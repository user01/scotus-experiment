  "Well, why -­",
  "But isn't -- isn't the biggest distinguishing factor the one that you raised in response to Justice Scalia's question? These -- these lawyers can represent somebody on a direct appeal, the same way and raise exactly the same issue that they're trying to raise on third party standing now. Isn't -- isn't that true?",
  "But the -- the claim that -­ I'm sorry.",
  "But if -- if you assume -- you assume the correctness of the allegations, which you -­ you have to do at this point, the allegation is that they would get clients and would be paid but for this bar to payment. Isn't that correct? So if you take them in terms of their claim, you've got to assume that they will have clients and they can bring this -- this issue on behalf of the client.",
  "What -- what are they getting at when they say merit? I mean, I take it you concede there was a quotation from that Contineri case on -- cited on page 30 of their brief. I mean, what -- what is the reference to merit supposed to mean?",
  "Isn't the reasonable thing to assume that they use it as we would normally expect it to --",
  "-- to mean by the words they use?",
  "But isn't the answer that all they have to do is to say, okay, I will represent him but I am representing him with a claim for funds? And at the end of the day, regardless of what the Michigan law says, I'm going to say to the State of Michigan, through the court, pay me for what I did. That isn't a waiver and there's nothing unethical about it.",
  "Right.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "I -- I could accept -- I guess I probably would accept your position if I did not think there -- there was another equally workable alternative here. And I didn't understand your answer to my earlier question in which you said, if I recall correctly, that it would be unethical for these lawyers to represent a -- a both of the client and, I suppose, of themselves, but essentially on behalf of a client, say, there is a right to State money to pay the lawyer who is representing them. It would be, as I understood you to say, unethical for the lawyer to proceed on that basis. And I don't understand the reason for your answer.",
  "Oh, no. I'm assuming they -­ they represent the client for all purposes and one of the client's claims is, pay my lawyer. I don't have any money. Your statute is unconstitutional. Why cannot the lawyer pursue that claim on behalf of the client and -­ and raise exactly the issue that is being raised in substance here?",
  "Well, except that that's a very formalistic answer. The -- the claim, in effect, would be I have a right to be appointed whatever your statute says because -- or my -- the -- the client would say my lawyer -- I have a right to appointed counsel, whatever your statute says, with the consequence of payment. So to say, well, they're not appointed, that's the question. Should they be appointed? I don't see why they cannot raise that issue.",
  "Okay, but these -- these lawyers are in the rotation. Are you suggesting that the rotation is so enormous that it will be 20 years before they get another client?",
  "Okay.",
  "I mean, your -- your claim is that they are going to get clients in the future and they -- they ought to have a right to be paid when the time comes. So why doesn't, number one, a lawyer representing the next client, whoever he may be, have a right to raise this, and why doesn't each one of these lawyers have a right to raise it presumably within a reasonable time when they next come up in the rotation?",
  "Sure they would, and that's what will get brought to this Court. That's what we're here for.",
  "No, because the claim is that they have a right under Federal law to an effective procedure whereby paid counsel can be supplied to them. That's a Federal issue, not a State issue.",
  "That's all you've got to get up here.",
  "It's an argument.",
  "Right. Exactly the same situation. They can -- they can bring the case directly for the client they're representing just as readily as they can bring this one. And if that is true, why is there an impediment to raising the issue unless we recognize third party standing?",
  "Without being paid if they lose -­",
  "-- being paid if they win. In this case, if they win, they don't get a dime because they're not representing a client. All they get is a declaration.",
  "And they'd be better off to represent a real client.",
  "Why will they get more appointments?",
  "I thought you said there's a strict rotation system. When your name comes up, you get an appointment. How is that going to change regardless of how this comes out?",
  "Oh, you're just saying there -­ there's going to be a further class of clients to be represented on the rotation.",
  "Okay, but that's -- that's true.",
  "What is the difference in effect? I mean, that's where I'm having trouble, and I guess others are having trouble. Yes, there's a difference in process, there may be a difference, in some sense, in ultimate status, but there isn't, it seems to me, any difference in effect. The defendant in the courtroom is going to suffer the same effect either necessitated or sufficed by this fact which is just as crucial, whether it's a rule, whether it's a guideline, whether it's a statute, why should that make any difference for the Sixth Amendment?",
  "Well, the practical effect is the same but in the moment before either in theory they commit the crime or in the moment before the trial is over or in the moment before the sentence comes down, there is one big difference in the two classes of cases. The defendant is entitled to claim that he can not be sentenced to the higher range unless a fact is found. In a case of discretionary sentencing range, within that range, he can not make that claim, he can not make that assumption, and the -­ that, it seems to me, is the point at which the jury trial right has got to focus.",
  "Why not?",
  "Well, the principal reason you can't, or I think the principle reason that you're advancing is, that the Guideline system is so complicated. There are a myriad of factors. As Justice Scalia says, why isn't each one in that myriad subject to the same claim? Surely, the argument can't be just because it's more complicated, that the Sixth Amendment evaporates.",
  "What is, what is the lawmaking part? I mean, if I have a choice -- if I have -- let's put the question this way. Congress has authorized the Commission and the Commission has said, \"If fact X is found, then the range is higher.\" Is there a lot of lawmaking in concluding that Congress and the Commission would have preferred that range to be higher regardless of whether a jury found the fact or a judge found the fact? That doesn't seem like much of a stretch to me. There may be other reasons not to do it. But in terms of judicial lawmaking, it doesn't seem like much to me.",
  "They're not out. They've got to be separately prosecuted.",
  "Well, I don't know of any case in which you can't.",
  "Then I guess, we ought to have an obstruction of justice crime with defined elements that can be prosecuted.",
  "And I, I would, I would take the same position today, unless you were going to define it, in terms of a condition that is both necessary and sufficient to expand the sentencing range of the crime that you are nominally prosecuting the person for. I mean, that's the rub.",
  "Let me go -­",
  "Is it any less uniform, any more manipulable, than on your proposal?",
  "I mean, uniformity is gone. A certain manipulability has got to be faced as a fact, and I'm not sure that you're proposing a better solution, I gather.",
  "Well, except that the manipulation, at that point, is the manipulation, in a way, in the present system, and that is it's the manipulability of charge bargaining.",
  "Yeah.",
  "Well, isn't it -- isn't it -- isn't that going to be so in every relevant conduct case in which the Government thinks the relevant conduct is a serious factor? There's either going to have to be a separate jury verdict on sentencing, or the district judge is going to be limited simply to whatever range the jury fact finding provides as the maximum range. There are no other possibilities, are there?",
  "But isn't the defendant in that case going to say look, I, I'm claiming a serious problem, if you're asking the jury to make a specific finding that I committed relevant facts A, B, C, D, and E, even though I don't happen to have been subjected to a criminal guilty verdict with respect to each one. By, by requiring those findings, you're going to skew the jury's mind to the point where I'm not going to get a fair shake on the guilty/not guilty finding or special fact finding most immediately relevant to this case. Every defendant is going to demand a separate jury proceeding for that, isn't he?",
  "Yes, but you wouldn't sit back and allow that focus, if you're the defense lawyer you're not going to allow that focus to be made at the time of the basic guilty/non guilty finding, are you?",
  "I don't -- I don't understand that statement. You say it would be available to be used as a credit in a subsequent year. Do you really mean it would be used as a credit, or do you mean it would simply be there to be used?",
  "Okay.",
  "What's the difference -­",
  "Well, what can -- what can the authority can't do? I -- is the difference between the two of them -- call it a jurisdictional difference -- nil, but there is process difference in the sense that the river master could say do this or don't do that, whereas your -- your fear is that the authority is simply going to be deadlocked because everything has to be done unanimously? Is it a process difference?",
  "But for that, you wouldn't be asking for a river master then.",
  "Your -- yes. Your State agreed to it.",
  "No, but you -- you agree that this is the -- the authority here is more than a keep-in- touch group. Your problem with it is -- is not that you need something more than keep in touch, but that when you ask them to do something more than keep in touch, the other State has a veto. And -- and that simply gets you to Justice Scalia's objection. That's the deal you made.",
  "But -- but Colorado still has the veto in any given case on whether an arbitrator will be appointed. Is that right?",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "Can you give -- I'm -- I'm not sure I understand the dispute. Can you give me in -- in -- without using up all of your time, a -- basically a simple example to illustrate the difference between the two contending methodological positions?",
  "I got you.",
  "Why doesn't -- why isn't the result that you -- of -- of your position that you would get a more accurate set of predictions if all you were making was a 10-year calculation, but you will not get a more accurate set of predictions with respect to any one year? And in fact, it is with respect to any one year that's important under the compact. In other words, they -- they plan every year, not every 10 years. So why does a 10-year accuracy help you in solving the practical problem you have on a year-to-year basis?",
  "I know. But it's used on the basis of 10-year figures which will not be accurate particularly with respect to any given year even though they would be -- they would be accurate if you were only interested in a calculation every 10 years.",
  "Does it -- can -- can you -­ can you get a better prediction on a year-to-year basis is what I'm saying.",
  "But there is a sense of color in which color is synonymous with pigment. And I assume that's what was accepted here, which leads me to my question, I don't understand why we're having this discussion.",
  "Because I thought it was agreed that for purposes of the defense, this was a descriptive use, is that incorrect?",
  "Well, could you just point to me -- I'm not asking so much about the \"why,\" I just want to know what this case is. Is there someplace in the materials that we've got that indicate that, in fact, you dispute that there is a descriptive use here?",
  "No, but you're saying, isn't your answer to Justice Stevens is that it was a rebuttable presumption?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, that may be, but the issue here is whether the Ninth Circuit simply went too far in the other direction and required too much. And all we have to determine is whether there is a per se obligation to prove non-confusion. If we do so, that doesn't necessarily reinstate the district court's position, it simply says that the Ninth Circuit went too far, isn't that correct? I mean, that is what is -- that is the issue before us?",
  "Well, we -- we have a different kind of trend. What do you make -- you spoke of a consensus, but what do you make of the fact that over the last, I guess, 10- or 12-year period, the actual imposition of the death penalty for -- for those whose crimes were -- were under 18 has -- has steadily been dropping. I think 10 years ago, there were 13. Last year, I -- I think the figures were that there were two. The -- the consensus seems to be eroding, and yet as -- as the counsel on the other side pointed out, this has been occurring at a time when -- when treating juvenile crime seriously has not, in fact, been eroding at all. What -­ what are we supposed to make of that?",
  "Has -- has the -- has the rate of attrition been the same?",
  "13 to 2 is pretty spectacular.",
  "I don't think we've seen that, or maybe we have seen that, for -- for death imposition generally. Is that so?",
  "Well, it went up once I think, didn't it?",
  "So -- so you're basically -­",
  "You're -- you're basically saying that the -- the time is too short, the numbers are too small -­",
  "-- to infer anything.",
  "Well, at least to the extent that he's simply quoting public sources, you had a chance to quote public sources in -- in return.",
  "So I think you're -- you're even on that -­",
  "-- or at least your opportunity is.",
  "But may I -­",
  "May I interrupt you there, Mr. Kneedler? Because I mean, the question is whether constitutionally we should respect that presumption. And -- and my -- my question basically is this. I can perfectly well understand and I can understand the -- the argument for respecting that presumption. When you're dealing with excluded aliens who are in a literal territorial sense within the border but are never allowed, in effect, beyond a point of initial custody, the ones who are kept at Ellis Island or wherever one may -- may keep them. It is difficult, however, I -- I think to accept what has been called the -- the fiction of custody. When we are dealing with individuals who, although absolutely excludable, were nonetheless welcomed into the United States by a public announcement of the President of the United States, have been allowed into the American population, just as clearly and as readily as they would have been under any other protocol of admission -- and I guess in this case for something like 20 years -- isn't there a point at which the -- the fiction of exclusion simply cannot be accepted for constitutional purposes?",
  "Well, factually. They're allowed into the country. You know, they can get jobs, own property, et cetera.",
  "No. I realize but they are admitted in the sense that they say, okay, you can come in and you can do these things, but you get no -- in effect, you get no vested right. We can take it away like that.",
  "All right. But otherwise -­ otherwise they are treated like any other class of aliens who are admitted into the United States. They are subject to this condition. The United States makes that clear, but they nonetheless can be in the country and do in the country what other aliens can do.",
  "I -- I know. Subject to that condition.",
  "No. I -- I realize that, but the problem is you've got a Due Process Clause that talks about persons not citizens. Maybe I can understand the -­ the fiction that says it doesn't apply to these persons if, for practical purposes, we stop them at the border and we don't let them into society. Once we do let them into society, whether we say it's subject to this condition it can be revoked or not, I find it difficult to see a constitutional warrant for drawing the line that you want us to draw.",
  "You're giving me prior examples, but the issue here is should we continue to respect that -- what has been called that fiction as to people who are allowed into the country and are allowed to move around like other aliens and, indeed, and by and large like citizens.",
  "All right. I can -- I can agree with you that the different classes are going to implicate different considerations on what is reasonable. But you, as I understand it, go the further step and say there is a presumption, and perhaps an irrebuttable presumption, that in the case of the -- the legally excluded, even though they are, in fact, in the country, the -- the presumptive reasonable period is forever.",
  "And that's where -- it's that stretch that's giving us the trouble.",
  "That's true, but we've got to say something.",
  "What's -- what's your best answer to the Government's argument that unless you treat this case differently from Zadvydas, at least for purposes of reasonable time or reasonable interest, which affects time, the United States is basically defenseless against countries that -- that want to dump undesirable aliens and force them into the United States?",
  "Because.",
  "But it's defenseless under the present law?",
  "Then what is the defense?",
  "What are they?",
  "So you're saying they can actually exclude, in practical terms.",
  "But they -- in any case, those individuals are not the subject of sort of dumping action by their own governments.",
  "Well, you -- you skipped a -- a phrase. It says when the Attorney General is of the opinion that the purposes of the parole justify nothing more, the individual shall return or be returned to the custody from which he began. And their argument is that custody is different in these cases.",
  "What you -- what you mean when you say we can forcibly return them is literally we can take them to Guantanamo, take them to the gate, and push them out?",
  "Well, what about the argument that the statute, in effect, limits the -- our -- our interpretation limits the -- the detention to a period reasonably related to the Government's interest in accomplishing that interest? That interest is different in -- in the case of -- of aliens who are excluded, if we accept that class as distinct from all excludables. And -- and that may allow a much longer period of detention, among other things, to deter dictators from -- from dumping. You've given us an answer to what to do if they dump, but we don't want them to dump in the first place. That argument stops short of saying we can detain them for life, but it would support the -- the position that on a consistent interpretation of the statute, the Government could detain them longer in the excluded cases than in others. What's your answer to that?",
  "There is only one class of excludables by the Government's own choice. That's -­ that's basically your answer.",
  "Yes.",
  "What's your -- what's your answer to Mr. -- Mr. Mills' position that the Government has, in fact, statutorily waived that distinction by creating one class of excludables?",
  "No, but doesn't -- doesn't that put you right back in the problem, the original problem, with -- with the riverboat? If all it is is tied up, it isn't permanently taken out of navigation. It isn't precluded. All they've got to do is cast the lines off and it's out in the water so that the riverboat is the vessel and presumably we've got seamen working on it.",
  "So you're saying -- and I -- I don't mean to disagree with you. You're saying, yes, there are going to be a few tough results under this definition.",
  "When you say the function of the vessel, do you mean the function of the vessel in its transportation function?",
  "So that would be the answer to the riverboat problem. You'd say sure, if the -- if the riverboat is capable simply of being let go in the water by casting off lines, the riverboat is a vessel. But you don't have to worry about turning all the -- the croupiers and the waiters into seamen because they're not contributing to the transportation function of the vessel.",
  "I mean, is that the way out of the problem?",
  "Does -- look, does the -- does the person in charge of the dredge control this process of pulling against anchor lines that moves it 8 feet or whatever it is?",
  "No, but if you can give me a yes or no answer, give me a yes or no answer.",
  "Okay.",
  "So that's why he's different from the croupier then, isn't he?",
  "Right, and the -- the guy in charge of the dredge does control the movement of it.",
  "Then what do you -- then what do you do with the croupier? You can't have it both ways.",
  "He's not participating in the navigation of the vessel.",
  "He's doing whatever croupiers do. I don't know.",
  "No, but -­",
  "Okay. In the case of the steam shovel operator on the dredge, do we say that -- that he contributes toward that function because it can't move unless he dredges first, so that the -- the whole object of moving across the harbor to dredge includes the -- the dredging part?",
  "Is that the way we do it?",
  "That's right.",
  "So as long as -- as long as somebody is -- is engaged in a navigation -­",
  "-- function, everybody else comes -­",
  "Okay.",
  "But isn't -- isn't that the point? The dredge is there necessarily to move. The casino is not there necessarily to move.",
  "Why -- why isn't there as much control in each case? I mean, the -- somebody goes to a lawyer with a claim and says, press the claim for me, recover if you can. What's the difference in -- in terms of control? So that if you win this case, why doesn't it apply to class action?",
  "Yes, and I -- I want to know why the result would be different.",
  "Why -- why would -- why would that analysis appear? Certainly there's -- there's not going to be any fee paid in the -- in the paradigm example of the class action without a recovery.",
  "So we're in the -- so we're in the situation we're in right now, aren't we?",
  "All right. But let me just -- I'll just press the point one more time. I don't understand, based on what you've said, why the class action result would be different from the result that you're arguing for here if you win this case.",
  "Mr. Salmons, doesn't the plausibility of your argument here rest on the assumption that what the -- that the cause of action at the time the -- that the plaintiff made the agreement with the lawyer is a cause of action which has the same value as the ultimate recovery that the lawyer gets? Whereas, in fact, the cause of action at the time of the agreement with the lawyer has an inchoate value. The -- the value that is actually realized is going to depend in part on the -- on the skill and -- and the -- the gumption of the lawyer. So that the -- what I'm getting at -- and -- and going to Justice Kennedy's question, it seems to me that the value realized as opposed to the right to sue are two different figures. And I don't see realistically how the client has complete control over the value realized, which we don't even know until the lawyer has done his work and gotten the check.",
  "No, but the bond coupon has a certain value at the time the father assigns it.",
  "The only thing that has to be realized after the assignment of the coupon is the passage of time at which it will be payable. Here we do not have a definite value. We don't know -- there's no way to know for sure what that value will be until the lawsuit is over with. The -- the two are not comparable.",
  "What -- what do you we make of the fact that two Senators apparently don't agree with that position? I mean, I -- I'm referring to the colloquy that was quoted in -- in one of the -- the briefs about the recent legislation, and the -- the substance of the colloquy was we're not making any change in the law, we're just clarifying it. Well, in fact, if there is no textual difference for tax purposes between the law, so far as it concerns these -- these so-called discrimination recoveries and non-discrimination recoveries that have the same problem that Justice O'Connor is talking about, shouldn't we infer that at least the Senate of the United States assumes that this does not get into gross?",
  "I'm -- I'm talking about the colloquy. I'm talking about the colloquy.",
  "All right. On -- on that theory, that there is a non-tax economic purpose, do you still maintain that your theory should have as an element unrelated people?",
  "Why do we need the question of the relationship, which Justice Stevens's questions raised, even to arise if -- if the principal criterion is going to be economic non-tax purpose?",
  "Aren't -- aren't you -­",
  "If -- if you view it as the theft loss, you -- you maintain your theory. If you argue, as you were arguing a second ago, I think what, in fact, you're doing is adopting the mere lien theory.",
  "I think you better go with Justice Ginsburg.",
  "May -- may I put aside for a moment the question of the strength of your argument in transfer situations and simply go to the circumstances of the original receipt of the prisoner for the first time into the prison system? What do the other States -- you say California is the only one that -- that makes this racial assignment like this. What do the other States do to guard against an -- an explosive team-up in -- in double-celled prisoners when -- when they're taking them in for the first time?",
  "Well, would it be a proper analysis simply to -- to separate or not based on gang membership?",
  "No. Your answer to Justice Scalia stands on that. So you would not be making an argument that gang membership is merely a surrogate for race in that case if that were the policy.",
  "Okay.",
  "Is -- is there an argument to be made that the reason we make that emphasis and -- and an argument for you in this case that there is somehow a greater fragility to -- to the effective standards to prevent racial classification than there is to the possibility of enforcing speech rights and so on? Is there something to worry about here more than in the case of -- of enumerated rights that -- that gets the Turner analysis?",
  "Yes, but there's a pretty frightening history about speech restriction too.",
  "Okay, but we didn't announce a standard.",
  "But -- I'm sorry. Even in the case of -- of housing in cells, what's the justification for it? The argument is -- excuse me -- on the initial intake, we don't know enough about them. Well, on -- on the transfer, you've had plenty of time to know about them. Why is it justifiable even for 14 days on -- on the transfer?",
  "Well, unless you house them with the cellmate, what are you going to learn from segregating them for 14 days?",
  "Well, if we have a choice between segregating by race and speeding up the delivery of records, isn't it constitutionally preferable to get the records delivered on time?",
  "Why? Don't you have xeroxes?",
  "All right. If we -- if we exclude Texas and California, on your recording, we've still got 80 percent of the -- the prison population in the United States, and apparently neither the Federal prisons nor any State does -- apart from Texas, has this policy. Why -- I mean, how do you account for the fact that there doesn't seem to be any evidence that -- that they are having explosive incidents involving new members based upon racial animosity?",
  "Okay. We've still got 47 States left. How -- how do you explain the fact that -- and -- and some of them don't have your racial problems. There's no question about it. I come from one that does not. But some do. And -- and how do you explain the fact that there is no sort of confirmatory record of what happens when you don't follow your policy?",
  "You -- you said a second ago that there's a significant difference between the conditions in the jails and the conditions in -- in the prisons. Is that significant difference the -- the organization of -- of racially based gangs in the prisons as distinct from the jails?",
  "Apart from the gang situation, is there reason to think that their minds change in the sense of inclining them to interracial violence simply because they say, gee, I'm in for a long time?",
  "And do we have any evidence to that effect?",
  "But that -- I mean, that goes back to the gang membership situation. It seems to me that's your strongest argument.",
  "When -- when they do choose that, do you respect a choice to cell with -- with another member of -- of the -- of -- do you respect the choice when two members of a gang want to cell together?",
  "Same gang.",
  "Do you -- do you have a -- do you have any record of -- of requests by different -­ members of different gangs to cell together?",
  "It wouldn't -- it wouldn't pass if -- would it, if we do not accept your argument that California cannot efficiently get records sent along with inmates so that, at the time at least of transfers, the prisons are in a position to know what they're getting? If we -- if we say, look, we're not going to accept the argument from administrative efficiency, then you can't survive Turner, can you?",
  "Well, that's -­",
  "No. I don't want to cut your argument short, but here's what's bothering me. I -- I can see there's a possible plausibility in what you're saying, but in fact is that the reason? Is there any evidence in the record to the effect that that is necessary in transfer situations?",
  "Okay. Look, if -- if we accept that officials have deemed it, we will not have many arguments in -- in this Court. I mean, they will be over before they start. I -- I mean, we've got to have something more than simply the decision under attack. Is there anything more in this case in -- with respect to the transferee situation?",
  "Okay, but -- no. I'm sorry.",
  "Okay, but they didn't -­",
  "Well, it -- it might be that there would be no justification for further evidence, but there would have to be a Strickland ruling on the merits of the Strickland issue, wouldn't there be?",
  "But nobody has explicitly done that yet. Is that correct?",
  "Because of the Cronic point.",
  "But what -- what if there's a third possibility and -- and the lawyer makes remarks in front of the jury, as -- as this lawyer did, in effect, concession kind of remarks, and the defendant stands up and says, hey, I'm not making those concessions? I am not guilty. I'm not conceding a darned thing. Does the lawyer at that point at least have a -- an option to proceed on the concession theory, leaving it to judge his performance under Strickland afterwards?",
  "Well, I -- actually I -- I didn't get into that one way or the other. Let's assume we've got a case in which the client says, no, I -- I don't agree to these concessions. I'm not guilty and I want a defense. As I understood your -- your earlier answer, you said if -- you know, if it is the lawyer's considered judgment that this is the only way to save his life -- he's talked with him, et cetera -- he -- he still may have that option to concede. And I'm taking the -­ the facts one step further and saying let's assume the -­ the client goes whole-hog in his objection. And he stands I'm not conceding any of this.",
  "I -- I would certainly agree if we get to that point. But let's the lawyer does, as you at least left the door open for him to do, and -- and he does proceed to represent the guy. The judge doesn't remove him and the lawyer continues to concede. Do you -­ do you think that there is any possibility on a Strickland analysis of finding adequacy of counsel?",
  "Let me ask you a question just about what you -- what you're assuming when you make the -- the statement -- prefaced the argument to the effect that there was a complete breakdown of -- of the adversary process. You're assuming, I take it, when you say that, that the guilt phase and the penalty phase have got to be regarded as distinct and separate phases.",
  "You're dividing it in half.",
  "Why is that -- why is that legitimate? Why should a lawyer -- I mean, I presume no representation without a thought to what is going to happen at the penalty phase if they get to the penalty phase. And so I -- I have difficulty in saying that there should be some kind of a firewall for analytical purposes between guilt and penalty when -- when we're in a -- a question of Cronic or Strickland.",
  "Well, they wouldn't end up having lower standards. They -- they would end up having consideration what the lawyer is or is not going to be able to do plausibly at -- at the sentencing phase. And you know, those -- those may be very, very difficult questions, but it's hard for me to say that either the standard is different or that a lawyer should -- or that we, in setting down standards, should pretend that a lawyer somehow has to go into a state of oblivion about -­ about what's going to happen at sentencing if he gets there.",
  "No. No, but I don't think you're getting to -- at -- at what bothers us. Nobody is saying that the client should not make a decision. The problem is that the client won't make a decision, and the client acts as if he had made the decision to allow the lawyer to do what the lawyer proposes. This isn't a question of whether he should be heard or not, but what -­ what to make of the behavior. And you're saying when -­ when the behavior appears to be acquiescence from silence, you nonetheless -- the lawyer is, nonetheless, obligated to take the course which is coming closest to guaranteeing that he will receive the death penalty. And that's what's bothering us. situation, it's -- it's the nature of what was said and his lack of presence in the courtroom where there was no affirmative defense. And in -- in the record below where the Florida Supreme Court sent it down to determine whether or not there was consent, there was no acquiescence. Mr. Nixon simply did nothing. When -- when asked -- when Mr. Corin testified and was asked about whether he discussed the trial strategy and whether Mr. Nixon agreed or disagreed, Mr. Nixon simply did nothing. He -- he didn't acquiesce to the strategy.",
  "Why -- why do we need a hearing rather than an examination of the record? Tell me why.",
  "No. We're talking about the trial court.",
  "Well, was he denied the opportunity?",
  "Did the -- did the judge say, look, we're -- we're going to confine it strictly to this one issue?",
  "Okay.",
  "What -- what did the judge -­ what did judge say? Your brother said the judge said, no, I won't hear this.",
  "Let me -- let me ask you this. If-- if your argument has force, why haven't we been having horrible example piled upon horrible example since 1981 when the EEOC took the position that it takes?",
  "Mr. Nager, will you go to another one of Justice Breyer's premises? He says following the practicalities are with you, which you're certainly going to accept. He says I think the EEOC can deal with some of these practical problems. Do you think so? Why not?",
  "Give me some examples.",
  "Well, Ms. -- Ms. Millett, my -­ my problem with that argument and I guess my basic problem with -- with the case is Congress did not just sort of stop when it got to the point that would support your Lewis argument. It went a step -- it went several steps further. But one of the steps further that it went to was -- was in -- in a certain fussiness about the definition of crime, and it said, well, we want to make sure that -­ that no State or -- or Federal business criminals are -­ are put at a disadvantage by this. It then accepted anything that a State might call a misdemeanor if it carried no more than 2 years. And it just seems very odd to me that Congress would have been that careful in putting these limitations on State and Federal crimes and would totally have ignored any category of crime under foreign law, any conviction under foreign law in -- in light of some of the hypotheses that have been thrown out this morning. It just seems strange that it would have ignored foreign law and foreign courts if it thought they were included.",
  "Well, it called it that, but it didn't -- it didn't have this issue in front of it.",
  "I -- I realize you've got the language, but it -- it wasn't addressing this issue.",
  "Well, I was talking about our language.",
  "But -- and I think that ought to count for a lot too.",
  "No, but how -- how familiar an example is it that price-fixers would -- would be placed in -- in a terrible position if they couldn't carry guns? I mean, that was not a pressing problem, so far as I know. And yet, Congress dealt with it.",
  "And if it can deal with a problem that is as little pressing as that, it seems odd that it would not have averted in any way to equally non- pressing problems under -- under foreign convictions if that's what they had in mind.",
  "All right. What -- what -­",
  "No. I -- finish your answer.",
  "Oh, there's no --",
  "We both know there's no -­",
  "All right.",
  "But neither did it give any explanation for not carrying it forward.",
  "It's -- it's the silence at the -- at the time it -- it apparently departed from the practice of predecessor statutes that -- that seems to be a problem for your argument.",
  "Well, is it an agency policy that the State endorses, and if so, why -- why do you endorse or adopt the policy?",
  "Well, is that -- I mean, is that the -- the real basis for the policy, that we -- that Washington does not want to make it difficult for -- for arrestees to raise bail?",
  "What do you make of the argument that unless the cause of the arrest is, number one, stated and, number two, a -- a cause that a defendant can rely on, that in any case like this in which the stated grounds of the arrest turn out to be -- we will assume, turn out to be inadequate, the police will always, particularly in traffic cases, be able to come up with something later on to justify the arrest? What -- what do you make of that argument?",
  "But that was for an -- an arrest in which, so far as we can tell, the -- the stated grounds for the arrest were those for which there was probable cause. And I think one of the concerns underlying the argument that I asked you to comment on is that if the -­ if the police, in effect, have -- have discretion ad lib afterwards to come up with new grounds for the arrest, there's -- there's going to be a kind of a basic corrosion in the integrity of the arrest process and in the confidence of people to believe that the police are really acting in good faith when they make an arrest.",
  "That -- that may be -- that may be the -- the best response. And I take it, so far as you know, there -- there are no studies that have gone into this on an empirical basis. Is that correct, so far as you know?",
  "No. The -- the argument is that he thinks he does have a ground. It turns out that he's wrong. Unless he is very unimaginative, he'll find another one. It's not that he arrests saying I have no basis to arrest this person, but I'll think of something later. It's -- it's the -- the problem is, I think -- or the argument, I think, is directed to a case like this.",
  "Do the facts, on your view, have to be known to the officer?",
  "Is -- is there -- and correct me if I'm wrong. In -- in cases in which we're inquiring into probable cause for a warrantless search, we give the government credit for any fact known to any officer, don't we?",
  "Why wouldn't we have the same rule? Why shouldn't we have the same rule with respect to facts known to any officer when one officer makes an arrest?",
  "But it's not urging it here.",
  "I don't think it is. I just want to know where we're going.",
  "So far as you know, there -­ there are no empirical studies looking into this particular horrible?",
  "But if -- if we had gone the other way in Whren, we would still have the problem that we have in this case, wouldn't we? Regardless of -- of how an arrest would be justified, the issue here is are the grounds of justification limited to the reason and in most cases the stated reason for the arrest. So we'd have this problem even if Whren had -- had come out otherwise, wouldn't we?",
  "But the question here is the scope of the Fourth Amendment inquiry. Can it take in probable cause for reasons other than the reason for the arrest or the stated reason for the arrest? Can it consider other offenses, and we'd have that regardless of -- of Whren, wouldn't we?",
  "Well, regardless if it -­ whether it comports with the common law, I don't see why the rule that you are urging, closely related, is going to make a dime's worth of difference unless ultimately we hold that there is an obligation to state the cause at the time of the arrest.",
  "Okay. The booking occurs after arrest, and I thought what we were concerned with in this case was the validity of the arrest, not the booking.",
  "Okay. Now, if -- if the -- if the -- if it is the validity of arrest, which -- which is in issue, I don't see why your rule is going to make any difference in the long run unless we go the further step and say, in order to make this work, i.e., enforce Fourth Amendment values, at the time of the arrest the cause has got to be stated. Am -- am I missing something?",
  "Well, based on an objective test, we'll get absolutely nowhere. The person who is arrested is not in a position to be making objective or subjective assessments, by and large. He probably knows what he's being arrested for because it's obvious, but then we have cases like this, which are the only ones that are going to be litigated, and he may not know. The -- the fact still, it seems to me, is obvious. If we go your way, we're going to have to go the further step of requiring the cause to be stated. Isn't that, as a matter of common sense, true?",
  "All right. I'll be candid with you. I think it is necessary. But the -- I guess the -- what I'm getting at in all of this is you're asking us to take steps to solve a problem, and I don't think you've demonstrated what the problem is. We keep coming back, as we have several times, to the lack of empirical studies. Have we got something to worry about in -- in enforcing Fourth Amendment values that we can only guard against if we go your way?",
  "Then what is the -- yes, but what's the justification for doing it? What is the practical problem that we are concerned with?",
  "But -- but don't you reconcile the -- the problem of the straddle by saying that unless the probable cause, which we will assume existed, is for a closely related offense, the whole arrest was invalid? Isn't that your position?",
  "Okay. Now, let me ask you -- you one other question. You -- you started out in getting down to first principles with disfavor of warrantless arrests. Would your position be different if the officer had somehow gotten an arrest warrant on the spot for illegal taping? Wouldn't you be making the same argument?",
  "So it has nothing to do, essentially, with warrantless or nonwarrantless arrests.",
  "Well, in this -- yes, but on your theory, that is -- that is incidental. That is not essential. If he had had an arrest warrant for illegal taping, you'd be making the same argument.",
  "That's -- that's right.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. What -- is -- is your argument that we are likely, in effect, to -- to violate some constitutional standard if we do what the Government wants, or is your argument as follows? That Taylor says this is an offense-based not a fact-based determination. Taylor says that's what the statute is getting at. And if you go as far as the Government wants here, you basically will have gone beyond offense-based. You will have gone -- become fact-based and you will be violating the statute. So my question is, is there something constitutionally we have to worry about which is the basis for your argument, or is it a violation of the statute that you think we ought to be worried about?",
  "Well, I don't have a position. I can't -­",
  "Well, aren't we asking that question in -- in any case? The question ultimately is, what did he mean when he said I am guilty? If you've got a plea colloquy, as you admitted a moment ago, it's easy to find out what he meant because they would have gone into the factual basis for the plea. If there's a written plea agreement, it's probably going to be easy to find out because, again, there would be a basis for the plea set out. Here, there isn't one of those documents. So you're going one step further, but you're still asking the question what did he mean when he stood in that courtroom and said I am guilty. And yes, in -- in one sense that's fact-based, but all of those questions are fact-based. They're going to the same issue. What did he mean? What was pleading guilty to? Isn't that correct?",
  "Why can't you make the determination? Isn't the -- the problem that your determination may not be as reliable? And I thought ultimately your argument would boil down to saying this. The reason you will accept the plea colloquy or the plea agreement, if it sets out the facts, is that that is very reliable. It is a reliable indication of what he was pleading guilty to and what the court was finding him guilty of. But once you go beyond that and you start looking into police reports appended to complaints or whatnot, you're getting into an area of less reliability, and when we're dealing with sentence enhancements like this, we better be reliable. That's why the statute based it on -- on offense rather than facts. Don't get into a factual determination that is unreliable. I thought that was your argument ultimately.",
  "I -- I'll accept that, yes.",
  "But why is a categorical determination important? I threw you a -- a bone a second ago, and I said maybe it's because of -­",
  "-- a reliability concern. Is that it? Is that your point?",
  "No, but is -- is your point that once you get beyond the documents that you admit we can look at, there is a higher -- an -- an unacceptably high risk of unreliability? Is that your argument?",
  "Well, but that -- that doesn't necessarily follow.",
  "But that doesn't necessarily follow from -- from looking at a police report. It may well be that we would say the burden never shifts, and he is simply in the position of any other party to a case. If -- if the other side has put in evidence that is -- is against his interest and he does nothing, then he's in trouble. But that isn't the same as shifting the burden.",
  "There's no -- I guess all I'm saying is it doesn't follow from the argument that the Government is making that a burden of persuasion shifts. Isn't that correct?",
  "Yes, but the Government -­",
  "Well, the -- the warrant affidavit is going to be present in the files. It's -­ it's returned. It's -- it's normally filed with -- with the other papers in the case.",
  "Why -- why not? I -- I mean, are we going to imagine an entirely different case out of the blue from the one that's disclosed in -- in the warrant application? It seems to me that there's a -- a relatively high degree of probability there.",
  "Well, let's say the warrant application says, you know, we're looking for a stolen radio and the charge does indicate that he was -- that -­ that the -- that the property taken in the burglary was a -- was -- was a radio. Wouldn't that be a basis for saying, okay, the warrant application probably discloses what was going on here? If -- if the -- if it was a radio on the warrant application, a radio in the burglary charge to which he did plead guilty, probably it's the radio at the address indicated in the warrant application. Isn't that a fair inference?",
  "Well, it may be done in advance by -- you know, by -- by a couple of hours from the -- the police going in -­",
  "What -- what about the -- the police officer -- what -- what if we don't have a document of any sort but the -- the State calls the police officer who, in fact, made the application for the -- the issuance of the complaint and he says, when I appeared to ask for the issuance of the complaint, I testified to, I swore to the following facts? I.e, that it was a house at such and such Shaw Street. That gives you your contemporaneity element. Why not accept that?",
  "They have notes. But the police all have little notebooks. That's what they use in trial day in and day out. So it seems to me that -- that if -- if contemporaneity is the -- is -- is -- or rough contemporaneity is -- is the criterion, then on your theory we ought to get into testimonial evidence.",
  "Does the -- do the actual contracts reduce the -- the CSC's to a dollar amount or -­",
  "So -- so we know -- they -­ they knew at the moment the contract was signed what it was going to cost.",
  "What -- what do you mean by that? You said a second ago the Secretary had the option to reprogram. What do you mean by reprogram?",
  "Is that what you mean by programming?",
  "So programming is allocating various segments of the lump sum to various purposes.",
  "Okay.",
  "All right. May -- may I interrupt you there? And tell me if I understand the -­ the position in your brief correctly. I thought the position that you took there was ultimately regardless of what the notwithstanding clause means, there's enough money to pay all the contracts in the appropriation that is actually made. And if any money is going to be squeezed, the person who's going to be squeezed or the -­ is the -- is the agency itself. Its bureaucracy is going to have less money. And I understood your argument to be that given the provisions you read earlier in this section, Congress has made a positive decision that if there's a choice between paying the contract amounts and squeezing the bureaucracy, the bureaucracy gets squeezed. Is that your position?",
  "If that is your position, do you have to even grapple with difficulties about the notwithstanding clause?",
  "But -- but I thought you were saying you could -- you could -- the -- the Secretary doesn't have to reduce funding for other tribes. The Secretary can pay the full contract costs, and if anybody is going to get the short end, it's going to be the bureaucracy.",
  "Just give them the -- just give them the money.",
  "Okay.",
  "That includes the 2 percent that you keep referring to.",
  "But -- but the other -- the other side says you don't have to get to that because you could have paid the contract amounts here without reducing funds available for other tribes. It's simply that it would have squeezed you in your budget, your -- your headquarters operating budget for IHS. So they say, if I understand them, that the -- that the nonreduction clause doesn't save you here because you could have paid it without reducing things for other tribes.",
  "Does it ever define them as noncontractable? I mean, I -- I -- your answer, I suppose, is well, what -- what do you think they're talking about, but does it ever expressly get to -­",
  "-- the point of contractability?",
  "Thank you, but apologize to him.",
  "You said that -­",
  "No. But you got a conflict apparently between the committee reports and what seems to be pretty clear law, which says we're going to treat these contracts as contracts, not as intergovernmental agreements. And in -- in that conflict, I don't see why contracting principles don't trump the committee reports.",
  "And -- and their -- their argument is that you can pay the contract amount without robbing other tribes of the amounts that the -- that the nonreduction clause refers to. They are saying -- I think they're saying, look, you, the governmental bureaucracy, get squeezed. Yes. And if so, the contract comes first and you have to live with the squeeze and go back to Congress and say, we're doing what you told us and we're getting squeezed out of existence. I think that's what they're saying.",
  "No, but if that's true, then everything -- then every penny in the -- in the IHS bureaucracy qualifies. I mean, that swallows the -- that swallows the entire budget.",
  "No, no. But I mean, just conceptually isn't that -- isn't that the -- the implication of what you're saying?",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, you -- you alluded a moment ago in -- in answering Justice Ginsburg, I guess, to declarations on file on the Tenth Circuit case that -- that specifically said we would have to reduce funds available for other programs. Did those declarations get specific in the way that her original question was -- was asking about? Did it say -- did the declarations say we will have to reduce the X program for the Navajo Tribe and the Y program for the Apache Tribe and so on, or was it -- did the declarations simply say, as a general matter, we would have to reduce allocations for other tribes?",
  "But that really doesn't get you anywhere, does it? I mean, if the United States says, \"We don't want this gun offense to be prosecuted unless there's a wire fraud prosecution,\" that doesn't tell you anything as to whether there ought to be a wire fraud prosecution.",
  "He files it electronically.",
  "Yeah, but why isn't it applicable to the extent that there seems to be a mandatory obligation to order restitution? And it seems to me that the restitution that would be ordered would be just as much in derogation of the common law principle as the out-and-out collection in Justice Breyer's example.",
  "Well, but I -- a moment ago, you said, \"Okay, we'll assume that there would be some derogation,\" in Justice Breyer's example. I don't see why you don't come to the same conclusion with respect to the restitution aspect here.",
  "Yeah, but the revenue -- the revenue rule does not rest simply on the rationale of non- extraterritorial enforcement. It has -- it has other rationales: difficulty of understanding what the revenue rule is; the -- you know, the problems of policy; there are lots of revenue rules in foreign countries that we certainly wouldn't want to enforce, and so on. It's not just extraterritoriality. And those -- those policies would be just as much implicated by the -- by the restitution as by the out-and-out enforcement in Justice Breyer's example.",
  "Well, perhaps - -",
  "No, go on.",
  "I was going to say, perhaps there were no specific holdings, because it would have been regarded as, kind of, a bizarre derogation of the rule in the first place. Nobody had dreamed up this scheme earlier.",
  "You're saying, in effect, that derogation is an effects test, not an intent test.",
  "Well, I thought the holding was that factor (k), standing alone, does -- does not raise a -- does -- does not, standing alone, raise a question of reasonable probability of -- of misunderstanding or misapplication of the law. And that's not what they're claiming here. They're claiming here that there was something much more than (k) standing alone. As I understand it, they're claiming that the difference between this and Boyde and why this is not a standalone kind of case is that the prosecutor deliberately argued or argued law that was in fact wrong and -- and continued to do so even after the court interrupted the argument and that the court never gave an instruction that corrected the erroneous statements of law that the prosecutor had made. So that's -- that's why they're -- they're saying this is not a Boyde situation.",
  "Well, no, no. The -- the mitigating evidence that Boyde held could be considered without a -- (k) being a bar, was mitigating evidence about the -- the character of the individual prior to or at least up to the moment of the crime. So this is - - this is different kind of evidence, and I -- I mean, this is post-crime evidence. And -- and I don't see that - - that Boyde's holding is so broad as obviously to cover this at all. It might be a -- it would be a -- a closer question if it hadn't been for the prosecutor's argument and the judge's failure to correct it. But even -- even without those elements, there would be a serious question whether Boyde covered this at all.",
  "Well, even -- even if -- even if that's argument is -- is on point, just taking your - - your response on its own terms, where do you get a reasonable likelihood?",
  "Well, but let's get specific. You -- you said there isn't a reasonable possibility. Why? Get -- get down to facts. Why isn't there a reasonable possibility?",
  "Yes. The prosecutor stands there and twice says, before the judge interrupts him and after the judge interrupts him -- says, you cannot legally consider this evidence. It does not fall within (k), and the judge never corrects it. Why is there not a -- a reasonable likelihood of -- of jury mistake?",
  "No. Precisely, if I recall - - and you correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought what the judge said was that the prosecutor's statements were - - were not evidence. Of course, they're not evidence. The issue isn't whether they were evidence. They were statements of the law. The judge didn't say anything about whether they were correct or incorrect statements of the law. It seems to me that the judge's response to the objection was totally beside the point.",
  "And the court didn't give them an instruction on this contested point.",
  "He didn't come out and say, yes, you can consider this under (k). He never said that.",
  "(k) says you can consider evidence that -- that goes to the gravity of the crime. I will be candid to say I think you're stretching things about as far as you can stretch, as Boyde held, that - - that character evidence pre and up to the time of the crime can be considered reasonably under that factor. But certainly evidence of what an individual did after the crime is committed does not naturally follow within (k) at all, and I don't know why any juror would consider it unless a judge came out and said flatly you can.",
  "They -- they might not have thought that the aggravating circumstances were entitled to -- to great weight. I mean, we don't know how they evaluated the aggravating circumstances.",
  "But I mean, that -- that is a possible conclusion, and therefore, it doesn't follow from the fact that they raised the question about life without parole that they necessarily had found -- that they were necessarily considering the mitigating evidence.",
  "It's -- it's one possibility. Isn't that all?",
  "Well, we've held that it's certainly not a -- a full-blown search. It's not a search in the classic sense, but a Terry stop isn't an arrest in -- in the classic sense either. We -- we have said that that is a kind of seizure. Why do -- I think your -- your argument assumes that this for -- for purposes of search analogies that something is either a -- a full-dress search or it's not a search at all. Why isn't there a -- a possibility of - - of a kind of middle ground on searches just as there is on seizures?",
  "Oh, I -- I can -- I can just imagine the problems, but I mean, what -- I think what's -- what the -- what's bothering me about the case is that if we persist in -- in saying that -- that it's -- that it's an either and or question with no question with no possible gradation, then I assume nothing prevents the police from taking the dogs through every municipal garage in the United States and I suppose there's nothing that prevents the police from taking the dogs up to any homeowner's door, ringing the bell, and seeing if the dog gets a sniff of something when the door is opened. We're -- we're opening rather a -- a large vista for -- for dog intrusions, and -- and that's what's -- that's what's bothering me. Why -- why should we -- why should we open that vista if there is a possibility of a -- of a middle ground that would prevent it?",
  "In -- in discussing the -- the answer to the -- the Kyllo issue, you've -- you place an emphasis on the protection given to a house. Would you go back to Justice O'Connor's question and my earlier example? Is it still your answer that the police can walk dogs around the foundation of the house or take a dog to the front door and ring the bell and see what it -- what it sniffs when the door is opened - -",
  "-- without there being a search and hence no Fourth Amendment concern?",
  "Okay. But then -- then the - - then there is no significance in the house.",
  "Well, when does -- when does it occur? I mean, if -- if -- first you say the -- the house is -- is a matter of significance for Kyllo analysis. We're trying to draw a distinction, if there is one, between Kyllo and this, and you say they can go to the house. They can sniff the foundations. They can go to the front door, et cetera. I don't see that the house, in fact, is functioning as a distinction at all.",
  "Oh, I realize that, but it seems to me your basic argument, if I understand it, is there is simply no search here, and because there is no search here, it doesn't matter whether you're dealing with a house or a parking lot or a car on the road. No search is no search. So for purposes of -- if I -- I want to understand your case, and as I understand it, for purposes of your case, there is no significance in the house because there doesn't have to be. The question doesn't arise because there's no search. Is that - -",
  "Why do you rely on the -- in - - in distinguishing Kyllo, why do you rely on the house if there's no search? Why do you have to rely on the fact that there was a house involved there? You -- you listed that as one of your three distinctions.",
  "But -- but your -- is -- is it -- I understand it to be your position that there simply is no search here. Period.",
  "It's because it's a dog sniff.",
  "All right. Do you -- do you think it's -- it's reasonable to say that if the police take dogs simply onto private property to sniff the foundations of houses, if they take dogs to the front door and ring the bell so that they hope the door will open, that there is -- there is no compromise of a privacy interest?",
  "Well, I mean, the Fourth Amendment analysis after Katz doesn't -- doesn't depend on trespass, and -- and you have said up to this point that there is no search. And then you have quite rightly said that we have had as a consideration in our minds analytically whether it's fair to say that what the police were doing involved any compromise of a privacy interest. So I'm assuming -- I'm assuming that the police can at least get to the foundation with a dog and they can certainly walk up to the front door and ring the bell. And if they do that with a dog, for the purpose of letting the dog sniff and alert, if there's anything to alert to, is it fair to say that there is no compromise of the privacy interests of the people who own the house?",
  "No, but the -- the difficulty that I have with that argument is take the -- take the case of -- of the arrestable offense in which it is undoubtedly the case that although the police don't normally arrest, they -- they can. Your -- if I understand your argument, you're saying if they, in fact, do arrest, they may then take the dog around the car, and indeed, I presume you would agree, they could make an inventory search because they've got to protect themselves against claims that they lost property and so on. So there's no question that in that case, as -- as you have argued it, they could make a full-blown search and -- and certainly can use the dog. But if they choose not to arrest on the highway, they can't. My problem is how can you say that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in case number two if you admit that the police can search in case number one. How does that affect the reasonable expectation of privacy?",
  "But -- but is -- why -- why don't you simply say, look -- have a very simple line. If they can arrest, they can sniff. If they can't arrest, they can't sniff without individualized suspicion going to drugs or whatever.",
  "But what -- what is the answer to the reasonable expectation to privacy question in that case? Isn't your expectation of privacy identical, whatever it may be, or isn't the reasonable expectation of privacy identical, whatever that may be, without regard to the discretionary decision of the officer to arrest or not?",
  "But you're saying that the - - the reasonable expectation of privacy depends upon the officer's discretionary judgment whether or not to arrest. Isn't that what you're saying?",
  "But you're -- no, I was going to -- your whole point, I take it, is that the two particular patients in this case are simply -- simply cannot be taken, for our purposes, as representative in the fact that they are getting the marijuana by, I think, growing it themselves or being given it. You're saying, you cannot take that fact as a fact from which to generalize in deciding this case.",
  "May I go back to your point a few minutes ago about -- it was, sort of, a categoric point -- you, in effect, said, \"If this argument succeeds with respect to medical use of marijuana, the next argument is going to be recreational use, and there's no real way to distinguish between them.\" Wouldn't this be a way to distinguish between them? That in deciding what class you are going to -- or what subclass you're going to consider from which to generalize, you simply ask the question, \"What good reasons are there to define a subclass this way?\" In this particular case, the good reasons to define a subclass of medical usage are the benefits - - whether you accept the evidence is another thing -- but the benefits which the doctors say that, under present circumstances, you can get from smoking it, as opposed to taking the synthesized drug. There's no such argument, I would guess, in favor of recreational marijuana usage as a separate category. And, for that reason, isn't there a -- isn't there a good reason to categorize this as narrowly as the Respondents are doing here, just medical usage, without any risk of generalizing to recreational usage?",
  "That may -- oh, that may be, but it seems to me that that's a separate argument, because you're -- you were arguing before that if you recognize medical usage, you don't have any way of drawing the line against private recreational usage. And I'm suggesting that you do have a reason for drawing that line, and it's the benefit for medical usage, if you accept the evidence; whereas, there is no reason to categorize recreational usage separately, and that seems to me a category argument, rather than a respect-for- Congress argument.",
  "No, but even - -",
  "But even if we accept your definition of economic, I don't see that it is a basis upon which we ought to make a category decision. You say it's non-economic because one of these people is a -- is a self-grower, another one is getting it from a friend for nothing. But I don't see what reason that you have given, or any reason that you haven't given, for us to believe that, out of -- now I'm going to assume, for the sake of argument, a hundred-thousand potential users -- everybody is going to get it from a friend or from plants in the backyard. Seems to me the sensible assumption is, they're going to get it on the street. And once they get it, under California law, it's not a crime for them to have it and use it. But they're going to get it in the street. Why isn't that the sensible assumption?",
  "Yeah, but the -- it's also the case that approximately 10 percent of the American population is doing that every day, if I accept the figures in the government's brief, and they're not getting prosecuted.",
  "And if I am a sick person, I'm going to say, \"Look, if they're not prosecuting every kid who buys, what, a nickel bag or whatever you call a small quantity today, they're not going to prosecute me, either.\" I mean, there's not going to be any incentive, it seems to me, to avoid the street market.",
  "Your whole argument for triviality, though, goes -- your whole argument for triviality, though, goes back to your disagreement with the government about how many people are involved, because I take it you accept the assumption that the more people who are involved -- if there are millions and millions, it is unlikely that this licensed activity is going to be without an effect on the market. So the whole argument boils down to how many people are going to be involved. You don't accept the government's 100,000-dollar figure. Let me ask you a question that would -- that would get to, maybe, a different number, and that is, do you know how many people there are in California who are undergoing chemotherapy at any given time?",
  "Isn't that number going to be indicative of the demand for marijuana?",
  "But if you -- if you accept that, then there's nothing implausible about the government's hundred-thousand number, is there?",
  "How many people are there in California? What's the population?",
  "Lots -- lots - -",
  "-- lots and lots. They -- a hundred-thousand cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy does not seem like an implausible number. And, in fact, if that number is a plausible one today, its plausibility reflects, among other things, the fact that there is a controversy as to whether California's law, in fact, is enforceable, or not. And the reason -- there is reason to assume that -- if we ruled your way, that that number would go up. So, if you accept that line of argument, then your argument, that the effect, whatever it may be, is going to be trivial, seems to me unsupportable. Am I missing something?",
  "Well -- but that is circular reasoning, because the whole -- your whole argument that it's non-economic is based on the claim that there are - - the numbers are so few -- the number of people involved, from what you could generalize, are so few that it would not be reasonable to infer an effect on the market. If there would be a large market effect, it makes no more sense to call this non-economic than Filburn's use, non - economic.",
  "It was inference upon inference upon inference. That's not what we're talking about here.",
  "But your whole jurisprudence in this case is premised on the assumption that we have got to identify the entire range of potential effect based on the particular character of two individuals in their -- in their supply of marijuana. And the whole point of this argument is that that does not seem to be a realistic premise on which to base constitutional law.",
  "And -- and the standards under Beck are different from the standards under the roughly comparable State rule, as I understand it, because under the State rule, the lesser offense need not be an included offense, in the technical sense; and number two, there need not be, in the absence of a further instruction, a - - a limitation to the jury to two choices, death or acquittal, so that unless one is very careful to raise the Federal standard, simply raising the State standard wouldn't do it.",
  "Sure, it embraces it because it's broader, which means that if you raise -- if you - - if you make a claim under the State standard, you are not necessarily making a claim under the narrower, more restrictive Federal standard.",
  "What about -- what about the - - the Beck condition that in the absence of the instruction, there must be a choice between -- the jury must be confined to a choice between death and acquittal?",
  "That's -- that's not the same in the State's scheme, is it?",
  "Is -- is Goodin the case that -- that stands for the proposition that under -- under State law, the -- the jury has an -- an option to sentence for life, as -- as well as -- as to impose the death sentence?",
  "So -- so I just want to make sure I know where we stand. You're saying that the assumption I was making, that under Mississippi law, in the absence of an instruction for a lesser offense, the jury has an option not only to acquit or to impose the death penalty, but an option of life with or without parole, that assumption is simply incorrect as a -- as a fact about Mississippi law.",
  "But it takes you out of Beck, at least arguably, doesn't it? The -- the question is, have you raised something that is necessarily on all fours with Beck? And given this sentencing scheme, we can't say that simply raising a State claim necessarily raises the Beck claim. Isn't that true?",
  "But the consequence of the jury verdict was -- was the death penalty.",
  "I -- I wrote it.",
  "Is -- is that the case here too? One of the things that's neither here nor there I guess, but one of the things that perplexed me was that I would have thought that the lesser-included offense on - - on the theory that the -- that he didn't intend to kill, he was sprayed with mace, got mad, pulled out a gun, and shot and so on -- I would have thought the lesser-included offense was a heat of passion kind of killing. But as - - as I read the -- the statement of -- of simple murder, which requires a deliberate act, that didn't sound like it. And I -- I read negligent homicide, and that didn't sound like heat of passion. But is -- is it your point here, if -- if we get into it, that as long as you asked for some lesser-includeds, under Mississippi law that raises the issue adequately?",
  "Well, is that fatal to him? I mean, that's what we're -- one of the things we're trying to get at I guess. Is -- is that fatal to him?",
  "Under Mississippi law, would he be entitled to a lesser offense instruction if he asked for the wrong lesser offense? I.e., in this case, if he failed to ask for heat of passion, would he still be entitled to a correct lesser instruction, even when he didn't ask for it?",
  "So you say he's not entitled then.",
  "The -- the only thing he would be entitled to, if he were correct, is the lesser instruction that he asked for, and if he's not correct, there's no error.",
  "No. We're just trying to get at what Mississippi law is, and I think you've - -",
  "May I go back to the heat of passion point? You say he did not put on evidence, but wasn't there evidence in the record through a State's witness that at least would have supported a heat of passion argument, the evidence being that he went up to the car, no gun was apparent, something happened. Evidence shows that he was sprayed with mace, and at that point, he pulls out a gun and shoots. That, I suppose, is evidence of heat of passion. Couldn't he have asked for a heat of passion instruction even though he did not put on the heat of passion evidence himself?",
  "Okay, but he did not do so.",
  "Manslaughter being defined as killing without deliberation?",
  "Okay. That's what he is saying - -",
  "May -- may I ask you? I'm unclear on -- on lesser-included in Mississippi. And I'm going to take this step by step.",
  "And tell me if I'm right or wrong at each step. The offense that he was charged with -- the capital offense that he was charged with was killing with or without intent in the course of committing a crime. Is that correct?",
  "All right. Now, his claim - - let's assume he claims this. There is evidence from - - from which you -- you could infer that he wasn't committing a crime. He may or may not be right, but let's assume that's his claim, and let's assume the judge says, yes, there's some evidence that would indicate that he wasn't up there robbing at the time he stood next to the car. Assume the judge accepts that. He then says, on that assumption, I want a lesser-included offense instruction of simple murder, killing with intent. Is that a lesser-included offense under -- under capital murder?",
  "Because what he's saying is, I'm asking for an instruction on an offense which is lesser -- it does not -- it's an offense that doesn't include the course of the crime, but it does include the other elements. It includes killing with intent. Isn't that lesser-included on your definition of Mississippi homicide law?",
  "Yes. I mean, he's got to qualify under the Federal standard. He says, the offense I was charged with was killing with or without intent, plus crime. I want an instruction that says nothing about plus crime but simply charges on killing with or without intent. Isn't he asking under Federal law for a lesser- included instruction?",
  "All right. Confine it to killing with intent.",
  "Under -- under -- as I understood -- as I understood you to define the capital offense, the State could prove the capital offense by saying he did have intent when he killed and he also happened to be committing a crime. Am I wrong about that statement of Mississippi law?",
  "I thought you said that on the capital offense, the killing could be with or without intent.",
  "So that the Mississippi law for felony murder is killing, pure and simple, plus crime, and simple murder is killing plus intent. And that plus intent is why it is not lesser-included.",
  "Okay. I understand you now. Let -- let me ask you this as a matter of -- on -- on the second point, as a matter of Mississippi law. Under the charge of capital murder, was there a possibility of sentencing to life or life without parole, as well as the possibility of the death penalty upon conviction?",
  "Okay. So that's the second reason why it would not fall within the -- the Beck rule.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, if we don't accept - - let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that -- that we're having trouble accepting the -- the analysis that it is a violation of the statute in the statute's own terms. You then made the argument that, in fact, you should recognize retaliation as a claim because in the context of -- of school students and so on, if you don't allow retaliation, the teachers are not going to blow the whistle, and if the teachers blow the whistle, the statute is going to be a dead letter.",
  "So -- so the -- the argument is you -- you should recognize this as a necessity. That, it seems to me, still goes back to Justice O'Connor's question. Why do we have to recognize a private cause of action as opposed to the government allowing an administrative remedy? And I thought you were leading up to saying the administrative remedy simply isn't effective because it's so draconian that, in fact, they don't impose it, or for some other reason. So my question is, is there an argument to say that the administrative remedy simply is not good enough to preclude -- to -- to deter retaliation and that's why you've got to have a private cause of action?",
  "What's -- what are the facts? What's the empirical evidence for that?",
  "Well, what -- what do you make of the -- the point that Mr. Dellinger stressed and others have stressed that, in fact, there is no administrative remedy in the real world? It's -- it's -- there -- there have never -- there has never been an instance in which funds have been withheld.",
  "Yes, but the -- the argument that's being raised is whether we're talking about the person who is listed in the statute as the primary beneficiary of the anti-discrimination statute or whether we're talking about the teacher who blows the whistle and so on -- the -- the argument is unless you allow this teacher or this whistle blower to -- to bring the private action, your statute is a dead letter, that the -- that if -- if -- once you recognize a private action, you've either got to recognize this kind of private action or you can forget the whole thing. That's the argument, and - - and so simply to say, well, they're not within the -- the primary ambit of benefit of the statute is -- is not to the point of the argument.",
  "Do we -- do we have any -- any empirical evidence as to -- as to what they have thus leveraged?",
  "The -- the other side says, look, dead letter. What do we know about such life as there may be in the letter?",
  "What do you -- excuse me. What -- what do you make of -- of this argument? Let's start with the premise that Congress wasn't thinking about overt acts at all. Start with the premise that you argue from that what Congress was concerned with here was primarily penalty. However, Congress did this in a context in which there are two recognized kinds of statutes, two recognized kinds of -- of conspiracy formulations. And if one has the magic words in it referring to an overt act, you got to prove an overt act. In the other variety, there's no reference to overt acts, and as a general rule, you don't have to prove overt acts. Why isn't it a sensible interpretive rule to say, look, when there are recognized models and Congress, in fact, chooses one rather than another, we're not going to get into the question of did Congress really mean to make a change when it picked one model rather than the other? It simply picked one model, and the -- the clearest way to have a coherent system of conspiracy law is to apply the model. If it didn't talk about overt act, there's no overt act requirement. Why isn't that a sensible way to -- to work our way through these thickets?",
  "But Shabani rested on -- on the existence of these prior models. Shabani didn't create them.",
  "If -- if 371 were repealed, would it affect the actual practice in the Justice Department? I -- I think I recall reading in the briefs for the other side that -- that the -- the United States has continued to charge conspiracies in money laundering cases under 371. Is that correct?",
  "But not in exclusively laundering cases.",
  "What do you make of the -- the argument that I think occurs in the yellow brief, that - - the reference to any other district where an act in furtherance, et cetera, took place implies that in the clause preceding, they were referring to a district in which an act in furtherance took place?",
  "Why -- why isn't it a right on account of?",
  "No, because the savings account doesn't have -- I mean, the savings account doesn't have the -- the penalty. Isn't your argument that you've got to read the right as meaning a right without penalty, because if you don't read it that way, then every one of these other retirement instruments is likewise going to fail? Isn't that your -- your strong point?",
  "What --",
  "Well - -",
  "Do -- do we know that? I mean, couldn't someone -- I -- I don't think this is a very plausible basis for construing the statute, but just as a technical matter, couldn't someone go to the bank or brokerage firm and say I want to set up an IRA, but I want the IRA to be, in -- in effect, like an irrevocable trust in which withdrawals can only be made on certain, specific conditions? And couldn't someone, using both the IRA mechanism and a State irrevocable trust document, create an IRA that would be as restricted as -- as the circuit suggested it might be?",
  "May I go back and just nail down one lose end in -- in an answer that you -- you gave to my question, can you set up a kind of irrevocable? I assume clearly from what you say is that there is not only no statute, but no IRS reg or ruling to the effect that you can make your IRA terms more restrictive without jeopardizing your qualification.",
  "Okay.",
  "I take it -- in -- in answering Justice Scalia, I take it from what you didn't say that none of the -- we'll call them kind of the paradigm example plans are, however, as -- as restricted as the language in this -- this statute would suggest that it had to be if you read it in a -- in a very literal way.",
  "In other words, they're all a little bit sinful, at least, even if they're not as sinful as -- as you say the -- the 401 -- the -- the IRA is.",
  "But attachment of the - -",
  "If -- if that is going to be your criterion, the -- the total freedom for any purpose, then why, if we accept your argument, why -- why don't we face sort of a daunting run or the courts face sort of daunting future? Because the -- the question then is going to be, well, what purposes are sufficiently close to old age to -- to allow for a continued exemption and how free may the purposes be before a plan falls into the IRA category. You told us a few moments ago -- and I'm sure you -- you were right -- that the kind of the paradigm example plans vary enormously depending on the terms in which employers set them up. So if -- if we say that the -- the dividing line is going to be between plans under which withdrawal can be for any purpose versus plans in which withdrawal is going to be somehow limited, then we're going to have to litigate an awful lot of plans. Aren't we?",
  "Let me -- let me ask you. Maybe this is irrelevant, but were -- were these restrictive IRA's that you're aware of set up under those terms in contemplation of bankruptcy? If the answer is no, why would anyone so restrict his -- his IRA?",
  "But why -- why would anyone do that? They're -- they're qualified without these restrictions. Why would anyone want to cut off his -- his rights to -- to withdraw?",
  "In other words, like setting up a personal spendthrift trust?",
  "I -- I want to make it tough so that I -- I will not be tempted to withdraw. Is that the motivation?",
  "What -- what if they don't repay it? What's the sanction?",
  "But what -- where -- where would the -- where would the principal repayment come from? I assume it would come from deducting whatever the balance was from the -- the person's account.",
  "I mean, we call it -- the - - the loan feature then boils down to a -- a withdrawal subject to a periodic repayment obligation, but if that obligation is not satisfied, the bottom line will be exactly like a withdrawal because they will simply deduct whatever the balance is from the person's rights under the plan.",
  "Subject to the 10 percent if the bankruptcy trustee does that?",
  "The -- the penalty still has to be paid even if it's the trustee who takes money out to pay the creditors, on your view.",
  "But you do agree, I take it, that if the judge says, yes, I agree with you, there isn't a scintilla of evidence, and -- and at some point I'm - - I'm going to enter an acquittal, but I'm not going to do it now just in case I have a second thought, but at least by the -- the end of the trial, I'll take care of it, you, I take it, concede that that is permissible.",
  "Well, if that -- if that's permissible, if you win this case, isn't that going to be the way trials are conducted when -- when there are mid- trial motions like yours? Every judge is going to say, yes, looks as though you -- you got them there, but I'll -- I'll just hold onto this until things are over, and then I'll rule. That's -- that's the way they're all going to respond, isn't it?",
  "No, but every judge knows he drops a catch once in a while, and -- and if he wants to guard against wrecking the whole trial or -- or creating an appellate issue later, he's just going to be cautious and hold onto it.",
  "But does -- does - -",
  "Did he - -",
  "Well --",
  "No, but isn't -- isn't the significance supposedly the existence or nonexistence of our continuation of the jury panel, going back to Justice Stevens' question? And what if the -- what if the State had a procedure whereby the trial judge would simply decline to discharge the jury panel if an appeal were taken from the acquittal motion so that if he was tipped over, it could come right back to the same jury panel? Would -- would the -- would the answer have to be different?",
  "Why?",
  "No, but on my hypothesis he's going to get the same jury.",
  "They have not been discharged.",
  "All right. If that's so, then why shouldn't Smalis have gone the other way? Because they can send it right back to exactly the same judge.",
  "Well, the jury is the trier of fact.",
  "I mean, on the hypothesis before, you're saying if they don't discharge the jury and it can go back to them, no double jeopardy problem. In Smalis, it's going to be the same judge. It was a bench trial. It should have come out the other way.",
  "Why -- why doesn't the -- the prosecution gets its full and fair opportunity if we have a rule that says to trial judges, when you make a ruling on acquittal, you better be serious and you better not make a snap judgment, think it over, because once you've done it, it sticks? Why -- why doesn't the prosecution have a perfectly fair opportunity under that rule? Everybody knows where he stands and judges, we hope, are going to be careful.",
  "Why isn't the distinction the right to rely?",
  "Well, it isn't just duration of -- of confinement. I mean, in -- in Balisok, what you had was a determination that the confinement would be definitely less as a result of the -- the good time scheme. The -- the gut notion behind Balisok was that what you were attacking would imply that the sentence itself was invalid because the conviction was and so on. We don't have that here. What we have here is a scheme that makes a -- a sentence that is imposed a more definite sentence. We know where in the range it's going to be reconsidered. And however that may be classified, it's not simply a Balisok situation.",
  "Right, but that had - -",
  "-- that had nothing to do with the rationale in Balisok, as I recall it. Isn't that correct?",
  "No -- no question. But the durational consequence in those cases was a definite consequence of longer duration, i.e., a sentence in the first place, a sentence not reduced by good time in -- in the second example. Here, there -- there is no such clear consequence. Here, the consequence is that there will simply be a period of time before a sentence already imposed will be reviewed to determine whether, in fact, it will be shortened or allowed to run. And that's different.",
  "No -- no question about that. At -- at the level of whether there is a durational consequence, they -- they both have it. I -- I grant you that.",
  "But it -- it doesn't advance the date of eligibility. It advances the date at which the parole board will take another look. The only eligibility is an eligibility to take -- to have another look taken and not an eligibility for release.",
  "But if they are subject to another look, they are not necessarily then eligible for release. And I think that's the point that we're getting -- let me -- let me ask a -- a sort of complementary question. Is there any reason that these - -",
  "With an E. With an E. But if -- if you take my questioning as a compliment with an I, that's perfectly okay too.",
  "Let's see what it is. The -- the question is, could these claims not have been brought in advance of any application to these particular prisoners of the revised -- whatever they were -- the 1998 guidelines? And if the answer is yes, then they could be brought at a time when, I suppose, habeas would -- would not have been a possible remedy. Is -- is -- am I correct on those two points?",
  "Is -- may -- may I just follow up on that question? At the administrative level, cannot these State law policies perfectly well be taken into consideration? In other words, your argument was these things are bound up with State law issues and the best place to have them resolved is -- is in a State forum. They can be resolved in a State administrative forum, can't they?",
  "But -- but the -- the generality at which you keep referring to it, with respect to conditions of confinement, is a -- is a higher level of generality than anything that Balisok decided. In Balisok, the particular decision was a decision to revoke an entitlement to be released at whatever the date the good time would give, and -- and that is a much more specific -- I mean, that literally affects an entitlement to be released. It is not merely a decision with respect to length of confinement.",
  "We -- we don't know what consequence it will have for the duration of his confinement. All we know is that it will have a consequence in determining the date at which the next look will be taken by the parole board to see whether he then is in a condition to be released. That's all we can tell.",
  "Okay. But you're -- you're assuming -- your argument now is assuming that they are going to be successful on this element, that you say they've got to satisfy later.",
  "And -- and whether they are or not has nothing to do with -- with Balisok and Heck.",
  "Sure. It also -- it also means that if -- if -- assuming your argument is sound, if you lose this case, you win the war.",
  "And why - -",
  "You said -- you said a moment ago that it would be expanding habeas, and I'd like you to expand on that. It would be expanding habeas, I am assuming, because in every successful habeas case, the ultimate remedy that the court can order, if the State does not snap to it, is the immediate release of the prisoner. And I take it when you said it would expand habeas, it would expand it because this would not be an immediate release case no matter what. Is that correct?",
  "Okay.",
  "And that's why they could not bring habeas in this case because if they won, they still would not have shown anything that entitled to them to get out now or get out now unless the State within 30 days does something. Is -- is that the nub of it?",
  "Regardless of what he's asking for, if he got what he wanted, he still would not be entitled to any immediate release.",
  "He would still have a sentence of X years, and the question is, how often are we going to look at him to decide when, within X years, we may let him out. Is that - -",
  "That's the nub of it I guess. The fact that he may be granted parole has no implication for the validity of the sentence.",
  "In fact, it assumes the sentence is valid, but that he will probably stay clean if he gets out. That's all it means, isn't it?",
  "Were -- were both of the cases cases of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals?",
  "Decided by the court -- the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.",
  "Well, don't we at some point have to have some reason to believe that the evidence of past practices become irrelevant? And if we -- if that is so, do we have any such evidence here?",
  "These are the same two prosecutors who in other cases had been found, in effect, guilty of -- of racial discrimination and the same two prosecutors who were calling for the shuffle in these cases. Is it plausible to think that there had been this change of heart?",
  "Well, I mean, I -- I am assuming it is relevant, and I am asking the question, is there a reasonable basis to think that these particular individuals, engaging in the practice that they demonstrably engaged in, had had a change in heart in this case?",
  "Is that why they engaged in the shuffle twice - -",
  "-- on -- on a record that shows there were black jurors down front each time they engaged in it?",
  "And -- and that evidence was not refuted. It was not denied, as I understand it.",
  "The -- I -- I don't think that's his argument at all. He is not arguing that there might not be other bases for making challenges or making peremptory strikes. What he is saying is those challenges exist for lots and lots of jurors. And what in fact there is is very strong circumstantial evidence that what tipped the prosecutors to make the peremptory challenges here - - what he was referring to earlier in this argument as the but-for cause was racial. He's not saying nothing else could have been involved. He was saying race tipped it. And it's the circumstantial evidence, among other things, that indicates that race does. And that's the reason for my question. Is there some reason to believe that there had been a change of heart on the issue of race so that his argument is unsound?",
  "Is -- is that true with respect to weight and mustaches and things like that?",
  "They were -- they were making notations of things like that, as I understand it, and they didn't have to worry about Batson there. But there does seem to be a correlation with the manual.",
  "But I -- I don't -- I mean, I'd just like to go back to my question. I don't know why else? It's true if -- if all they noted, if they had been prescient and had said, you know, Swain is going to give way to Batson and we're going to note Batson issues, you'd have an argument. But they were noting a lot of non- Batson issues too, and the one common characteristic of the Batson issues and the non-Batson issues were they were all correlated to a manual that says keep these people off the jury. And -- and isn't that a sound train of reasoning that that's what they were trying to do?",
  "The manual had said there are certain visual cues that indicate jurors you don't want on the jury. You don't want black jurors. You don't want women jurors. You don't want Jewish jurors. You don't want fat ones. You don't want bearded ones. And these are the things that they were noting. Isn't the reasonable inference that that's what they were noting them for?",
  "But it was not obvious to the person who at least drafted the Webb-Kenyon in the first instance, because as I -- as I understand it, there was an anti-discrimination provision, and that was then dropped. And do we know why it was dropped?",
  "Well, but is that a -- is that on a legislative history record somewhere? Do we know that?",
  "What -­",
  "-- what do you make of the argument that there's no practical way, except at great expense, to audit compliance if they're out of state?",
  "Well, I will grant that's required, but the argument, as I understand it, is, to find out whether they're doing what they are required to do, you've got to drop in unexpectedly and make an audit. And that's one thing in the state; it's another thing across the country.",
  "So you're -­",
  "-- saying they are not dropping in to local wineries to do audits, in fact?",
  "What do we have in the record on that?",
  "Okay, we've got one difference from Bacchus, because the claim that's being made here, which I gather was not made, or made seriously, in Bacchus, is there really is a need for differential treatment for purposes of enforcement. Go back to the enforcement of the tax law.",
  "How are we supposed -- what standard are we supposed to use to judge that argument? And, by that standard, how good is the argument?",
  "Because -­",

  "-- could a state -­",
  "-- could a state require an out-of-state winery to keep its books online, subject to a password, so that, with a password, they could go in and audit the books across the country, by wire?",
  "Well, your opponents have said that there isn't any clear countervailing interest here. They're saying you can't claim you're protecting kids, because you're selling to the kids at home; there's no serious audit-collection problem; and the other regulatory interests -- they didn't say this, but are, sort of, gauzy the way they're stated. I mean, they're saying that, by a process of elimination, what you get down to is nothing but discrimination and protectionism. What is -- what is your answer to that? Where is -­",
  "-- the substantial interest?",
  "I know, but -­",
  "Well, you -- I mean, you say that, but how? The very activity that you don't want them to engage in, you're engaging in, or your local wineries are engaging in, for example.",
  "Do we -­",

  "Well, should -­",
  "-- should we send it back for -- if we disagree with the rationale, should one or the other of these cases go back for evidence on what, in fact, the state is doing in relation to its in-state licensees and evidence that it could not effectively do the same with respect to out-of-staters?",
  "And what would you show? What do you, in effect -- make an offer of proof.",
  "And if you -- if you did that, could you require, as I suggested of Counsel on the other side, that you -- that, as a condition of the licensing, that the business records of these companies be placed in some secure online fashion, that, with a password, you could get into and do an audit across the continent just as readily as you could do an audit next door? Could Michigan not do that?",
  "What is it doing with the in­ state entities? I mean, one of the claims is that nobody is posting officers outside the in-state wineries, no one's making substantial physical audits of in-state wineries. Is that wrong?",
  "What do they inspect them for? Their books, I suppose.",
  "And is there a record that the state is doing that?",
  "Well, isn't that the end of that issue, then? I mean, it is your burden, isn't it?",
  "Well, the Twenty-First Amendment at least recognizes that alcohol can be treated as unique, and the issue here is whether you're really doing that in a way that supports your claim of interest.",
  "And, so far, the one specific thing I've heard from you is that state inspectors do go on winery premises, and they count bottles, and they see if they match what's on the written record.",
  "What illegal -- I'm sorry -­ you've got to be specific. What illegal activities? Selling to minors?",
  "Yeah, but if licensed premises don't serve a state interest, then you can't require a licensed premises, so that argument doesn't get too far.",
  "We seem to be talking -- may I just ask one -- we seem to be talking about two different things. Justice Scalia was assuming that, if you have the license and some in-state warehouse, you can ship from outside. And I -- is that the assumption? Or is your argument that New York can require -- does require the in­ state warehouse, and you can ship into -- in New York, you can ship only from that warehouse?",
  "So the -- we don't know yet.",
  "Well, your argument there is that -­",
  "-- if they break the law, you can shut down the warehouse; whereas, you can't effectively do that if the warehouse is in California. Isn't that your point?",
  "And -- and if in fact - -",
  "-- you rely on the rule, do we even have to resolve the issue of meaning of report in the statute? Can't we simply, from your position, rely on the rule and say you've got to follow your own rules?",
  "So you've really got three arguments. You've got the rule. You've got the statute, and you have due process.",
  "But that's not the way the rule reads. The rule reads, as I understand it, under (c) that the court itself may accept, reject, or modify. It doesn't say anything about the special trial judge reconsidering and rewriting his report.",
  "No. But I don't see what is consistent with your notion of a deliberative process as producing the report and the presumption of correctness in the rule. The rule presumes that some original document, which you are treating as provisional, enjoys a presumption of correctness, and I don't see the consistency between provisionality and deliberate character on the one hand and presumption on the other.",
  "And aren't those findings of fact the findings of fact that are delivered to the chief judge in the report that is made to the chief judge before it is even assigned to a Tax Court judge?",
  "But he hasn't abandoned them at the point that he delivers them to the chief judge, and if that's what this is referring to, then the presumption of the -- of -- of correctness necessarily has to apply to whatever the document is that's delivered to the chief judge.",
  "The presumption.",
  "So you're saying the rule itself in that respect is invalid?",
  "Well, how else could you possibly construe it? There's no presumption operating at all on your reading.",
  "No, but you're saying there is -- there is no presumption of correctness that can operate with respect to the report that goes first to the chief judge because, I understood you to say, to do that would violate the Internal Revenue Code provision that the fact- finder and the only fact-finder is the Tax Court judge. And therefore, I think the implication of what you're saying is that the rule on its face is invalid.",
  "I'm -- I'm not even getting to whatever the standard of review may be. I presume the word presumption means something other than it's there unless you want to change it later after the person who employs you objects to it. It's got to mean something more than that.",
  "But there's no party who is seeking to change at this point because the parties don't know what's in it. They're not going forward. This is, as you point out, an internal process that is going on here. So that definition can't apply.",
  "Any weight?",
  "So I -- I think your -- I think your answer then is not that this is invalid. It is simply unenforceable. It is precatory language, looks okay, but there's no way to police it.",
  "Judicially it cannot be enforced.",
  "Except that the -- the relationship between the -- the one judge and the full Tax Court is a relationship basically of people who are in the same boat with respect to what they know about or can know about law and what they can know about the evidence and the facts of the case; whereas the relationship between the special trial judge and the judge to whom it is assigned is -- is quite different because only one of them has heard evidence and only one of them is the source of conclusion about fact.",
  "It certainly is not identical in -- in the sense that the -- the Tax Court judge then goes and listens to evidence. He doesn't. That's the whole point.",
  "Neither does the full Tax Court, but if the full Tax Court is disagreeing with one judge, the one judge and the full Tax Court are in the same boat. They have access to the same material. Their limits are exactly the same in each case. That is not true in the relationship between the single Tax Court judge and the special Tax Court judge. The special Tax Court judge is the only one who has heard evidence and can find facts based upon the evidence that he heard.",
  "I -- I am quite aware of that. That's not -- that's not the point. I'm -- I'm saying that you cannot draw an analogy between one judge and full Tax Court and use that as an analogy to legitimize the relationship between one judge and a trial master. They are in different positions. They are not in parallel positions.",
  "It's the knowledge issue. The special Tax Court judge heard somebody.",
  "Nobody on the Tax Court did.",
  "In other words, they're - - they're sitting hearing witnesses? They are -- they are redoing the trial? Surely not.",
  "But we are talking about situations in which the trial judge is the special judge.",
  "Yes, but Rust did not -- Rust was not a case in which the doctor was saying, \"This is my personal opinion, not the government's.\" And here, as Justice Scalia pointed out, there is an affirmative effort to say, \"This is -- this is paid for by\" whatever it's called, the cattlemen's group or the beef group, which affirmatively indicates that it's not government speech.",
  "Well, it's accurate -­",
  "-- but it also contains the implication that who -- he who pays is the person whose speech is being broadcasted.",
  "Well, I -- we realize that. I mean, we're getting into it because there's at least a potential constitutional problem here.",
  "As you respond to Justice Breyer's question, would you go the step further and say, Why isn't one possible solution to this difficulty we're having about government speech a requirement that if you want to justify it as government speech, you put in the advertisement, \"This is the government's position, paid for by the beef producers\"?",
  "No -­",
  "It seems to be. In fact, there was an indication in the brief that the government had taken the position that if the government came out front and said, \"Hey, we're urging you to eat more meat,\" that, in fact, it would be very unsuccessful in doing it. It seems to want to hide the ball here.",
  "Did he -­",
  "And who paid for that? Did these people pay for that?",
  "But what it -- what it would -­ what it would be a basis for, at least within the confines of this argument, would be a basis for your government speech claim in the sense that you wouldn't be basing a government speech claim on what is really a misrepresentation.",
  "No, including those who don't want to fund it and who don't agree with the message. I mean, the problem here is that by making that representation, you indicate that this is the message of the people who are paying for it. And some of the people who are paying for it do not wish to convey that message.",
  "That's the misrepresentation.",
  "But what they would -­",
  "-- what they would, I think, assume is that, in the name, the beef producers do, in fact, agree with this, and this is their message. What they would not assume from it is that it is what you and Mr. Kneedler are claiming, the speech of the Government of the United States. They certainly wouldn't infer that.",
  "Well, maybe -­",
  "-- maybe it's not because they didn't know you were going to be defending on the basis of government speech. That's what's getting us into this.",
  "Which wasn't a government speech case.",
  "Well, it doesn't --",
  "-- we understand that you have a First Amendment claim, which you're going to have even if we say, \"This is not government speech.\" I think the whole point here is to decide whether this is even -­",

  "-- where the money goes and who pays out the money for the ad, that's the difference.",
  "Well, isn't that the -- isn't that the essential difference between the structure in this case and the structure in the case in which the government comes out, saying, \"This is your government, saying, 'Don't smoke.'\"",
  "Right.",
  "All right. Consider this theory. The Congress passes an excise tax. It happens to be a dollar head, on the cattle, just like this so-called \"checkoff.\" And the government uses the excise tax revenue to finance advertising, saying -- maybe saying, \"Eat more beef,\" maybe advertising, saying, \"Don't eat quite so much.\"",
  "First Amendment problem -­",
  "Including excise?",
  "No, I just want to know what -­",
  "-- your position is. I just want to know what your position is.",
  "Okay, then -­",
  "Okay, then it does not have -­",
  "-- it's not a First Amendment problem. It does not have the objection that you're raising.",
  "Okay.",
  "May I go back to one of your reasons, which was that they are being singled out to pay for this? They're being singled out to pay for it in the excise tax situation. Do you come to different answers, depending whether it's excise tax or singled out without excise tax, based, essentially, on the ground that there is a point beyond which we simply cannot look behind the expenditure of tax revenue? Is that it?",
  "But isn't -­",
  "-- isn't that -­",
  "Don't you go back to the answer you gave me? Sure, when taxes are involved, there may be an under-inclusive enforcement of certain individual rights, but they have to be under-enforced, because, otherwise, you simply cannot administer a tax structure.",
  "Now, in doing it as a matter of law here, should we give consideration to the fact that in this case, if -- if I remember correctly, one of the officers testified that had they followed normal protocol, once they had, I think his phrase was, secured the building, the -- the main building -­",
  "Is that the whole compound?",
  "That -- that they would have -­ they would have taken off the immediate restraints, and he wasn't sure why they didn't. We -- do we -- do we consider that when we're crafting our statement of law as -- as to what is or is not excessive?",
  "Okay. I take it you obviously don't want us to -- to come down with a kind of a finicky version of -- of excessive force as the touchstone, and I take it you don't want us to come down with simply a blanket rule saying that essentially the police can do anything in -- in restraining occupants so long as it is not wantonly cruel. Somewhere in between. Do you have a -- a statement that would be the kernel of the holding that you want?",
  "So -- I mean, I don't -- would -- would you say handcuffs are per se lawful for -- for purposes of applying Summers?",
  "But on the -- on the question whether they preserved the issue, I -- I took it, implicit in what you said a minute ago, that yes, they did not object to the submission of the question. They did not object, in effect, to an instruction or giving of an instruction as such.",
  "But they -- they had moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence, and that's enough to preserve the issue?",
  "I thought your position was that it -- it may be submitted to the jury, but that it may be reviewed as a question of law simply because that's the way we are able to set standards for later cases.",
  "Did they -- did they search the individuals too to make sure -­",
  "I assume they did.",
  "But the reason for that, I take it, is that FIFRA does not -- I mean, I think you agree FIFRA does not provide an independent private right of action.",
  "So you've got to sue under State law, but you would -- you would kind of have a slam dunk for your position, I suppose, if your pleading said, the failure to warn only to the extent that in fact the -­ the warning given in compliance with FIFRA was an inadequate warning. That would -- that would keep you within the -- the -- in effect, the -- the Federal limit, and it would also make clear that you had a State law cause of action, not a Federal cause of action.",
  "And -- and that's in effect what you're arguing.",
  "Why -- why doesn't the other amendment limit your argument? Because Congress has also passed an amendment to the effect that unless EPA chooses to get in to the business of -- of passing on efficacy, it -- it need not do so. And in fact we know it is not doing so. Why, therefore, doesn't the uniformity argument go to those subjects that EPA does review for and why doesn't the subject of efficacy, in effect, drop out of -- of the -- the whole preemption claim?",
  "But you can -­",
  "But on your theory there is no material fact, it seems to me, because your -- what you say they cannot make good on that claim without impeaching the label.",
  "Every time they sue on the -­ on the ground that -- let's say, that -- that the -- the actual use was inconsistent with what the label described, you could say, gee, if their theory is correct, we'd have to change our label to say that what's on the label now is in fact not properly descriptive of the product. So it's not a -- a question of needing more fact. On your theory, whenever they, in effect, sue on the basis of what you say, your response is going to be, as a matter of law, well, if they're correct, we'd have to say something else. That impeaches the label. Therefore, preemption.",
  "Okay, but why -­",
  "No, but neither -­",
  "The problem that I think some of -- several of us are having is that both the -- as I understand it, the Fifth Circuit test in your argument draws no distinction between the two following kinds of",
  "Yes, and the argument that's being made is that we ought to -- we ought to read -- we ought to read the limitation, which Justice Scalia has just described, with respect to labeling and packaging, in a relatively narrow way to allow the suit to go forward and, therefore, we ought to make a distinction between the two kinds of situations.",
  "Yes, but why isn't there a big difference, for purposes of your argument, between the Medtronic situation and this one for the simple reason in this case you've got a statute that authorizes EPA to do absolutely nothing on the subject of efficacy? And EPA does nothing on the subject of efficacy.",
  "But doesn't that simply mean that if it explicitly recognizes, it has made it plain.",
  "But it doesn't mean that it must be explicit in every case. Isn't that correct?",
  "You don't have to be explicit to make it plain. It's a great way to do it, but that's -- it's not the only way.",
  "Well, could -- could you be concrete? I mean, there -- I don't know what you mean. What are the issues? Can you give me an explicit example?",
  "Well, the argument on the other side, as I understand it, is that the -- the assertion of authority to regulate fishing really is -- is relevant. It has no necessary implication for the historic waters doctrine. What -- what is your answer to that?",
  "What -- what page was that?",
  "Mr. -­",
  "Mr. Minear, may I ask you? At the time the statute was passed, was the national Government conducting these activities?",
  "Maybe you were monitoring passages through to see whether the whales were going to be interfered with and doing that sort of thing. Were you taking core samples?",

  "But the -- the argument is that it is clear because the reservation without the reservation of the waters would be crazy.",

  "But they are regulations that the -- that depend upon the existence of a spy-principal relationship -­",
  "Well, are you claiming that your -- your people are -- were not spies?",
  "Well, however got there -­",
  "-- they -- they -- your claim is that they're spies and that, therefore, whatever your procedural claims may be, whatever your substantive due process rights may be, as I understand it, depends upon the assumption of a spy-principal relationship.",
  "Why?",
  "What if -- what if the Government takes a slightly different tack and -- and you bring your essentially PL-110 neutral claim, and the Government says, the only relationship upon which this claim can be based by these particular Does is a spy relationship? We claim privilege, and on the basis of that privilege, we -- we claim dismissal. What is your response to that?",
  "Well, they're not saying it's an essential element in the sense that only a spy can make a 110 claim. They're saying that the only basis upon which you can make a 110 claim is the spy relationship. You have no other. How do you respond to that?",
  "But, look, you're talking about procedural means. I want to know what your immediate response to their claim of privilege is. Are you going to say we weren't spies?",
  "They are making the claim of privilege on the ground that the only basis for your 110 claim is or can be, on facts known to them, that your clients were spies. Do you respond by saying, yes, we were spies, or do you respond by saying, we weren't spies?",
  "Let's assume that you have a really obnoxious court -­",
  "-- that wants a substantive response, do you respond by saying they're right, we're spies, or they're wrong, we weren't spies?",
  "They are claiming a privilege on the grounds that the only basis for your claim can possibly be the spy relationship based on facts known to them. In order to defeat that privilege, you've got at least to start by saying, no, we weren't spies and we don't claim to be. Are you going to say that or aren't you?",
  "Then I don't know why you're not out of court on Totten.",
  "You are -- you are -­",
  "When you say terminated the title, you mean by the conveyance of all lands?",

  "-- the government's representative, to the effect you don't have to leave New York.",
  "No, but my, I guess, let me just get to the point and you can answer that.",
  "Doesn't that negate your argument that the treaty as such disestablished the reservation?",
  "Do the, would the Oneidas have a claim to tax the current property owners?",
  "Why not?",
  "Was there any positive indication -- I just don't remember this -- in the New York case, that they would -- that they, in fact, had ceded anything of New -- of their interests in New York? As distinct from the Wisconsin lands?",
  "That's entering into the treaty. But when it came to compensation, was there an indication that they were being compensated for anything other than Kansas land, which they had obtained as a result of ceding their Wisconsin land?",
  "Okay.",
  "But there was no indication that they got Kansas for anything other than Wisconsin, is that correct?",
  "But there was no indication that they had ceded anything with respect to title in New York, was there?",
  "Okay,",
  "No, but the point --",
  "Well, what about the exceptional case? I mean, how do we avoid the exceptional case?",
  "Which can do what?",
  "What -- what is your answer to -- to your -- your brother's answer on this, and -- and that is, that the -- the existence of stay and abey as a possibility is not a right to stay and abey? And -- and if a district judge finds that a -- there is reason to believe that the defendant is gaming the system, because he's a capital defendant and wants to delay or wants delay for any other reason, there's -- there's no requirement that -- that there be a stay and -- and abeyance order. And why -- why doesn't that take care of what I -- I think is a very legitimate issue that you raise? Why isn't that a -- a sufficient answer to it?",
  "Oh, again, there's no question about that. And -- and in a perfect -- sort of in a perfect system, I think your objection would be unanswerable. The trouble with the system we've got is -- is the trouble that -- that is -- is undisputed here, and that is, that most of these petitions, the overwhelming number of them, are going to be pro se petitions. Exhaustion can -- can be tricky. The -- the statute of limitations is -- is going to run and -- and an individual can end up in the -- in the situation that this one had. What -- what he's asking for, in effect, is how do we tinker with the system, in effect, to prevent its being a -- a very unfair burden on people who don't have the sophistication to help themselves.",
  "Well, I -- I know but there's -- what -- what is your answer on the merits to the fact that most of the people who are going to ask for stay and abey are -- are going to be pro ses, or at least have gotten into the mess that they're in as a result of pro se representation, and -- and that -- that exhaustion in close cases can be a very -- very tricky issue? What -- what's your response to that?",
  "But Rose and Lundy also assumed that they could go back to State court and -- and in -- in fact this could be done without wiping out the claims. And the difference between the situation in Rose and Lundy and the situation we've got now is the difference which is focused, I think, in -- in Justice Ginsburg's four claims as to which there was disagreement even between the district court and -- and the State as to whether there was exhaustion. There -- there isn't a -- a -- as a -- as a systemic matter across the United States, there simply isn't a way for most of these people to go back and litigate their State claims. Rose and Lundy assumed there was. Now there isn't.",
  "It may not be -- it -- it will be waived. I mean, if -- if -- on your theory, he -- he jumps from the frying pan of nonexhaustion into the fire of waiver. That's -- that's no answer to the problem.",
  "Well -­",
  "Is -- is the -­",
  "Is the reason -- is there a further reason that they've got to -- to plead loss causation? And that is, by reading (e)(2), in effect, as -- as making -- as -- as saying that if you were going to recover on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you in effect have -- have got to prove your loss in a certain way. And you're saying if you're going to -- if you're going to sue on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you've got to allege all the elements of fraud on the market. And if you allege all the elements of fraud on the market, you're going to allege exactly what you've just been saying is required. So it's not so the -- I -- I guess what I'm -- I'm getting at is maybe what -- maybe the nub of the answer is not necessarily that there's -- that there's fraud involved, but there is a fraud-on-the-market theory as the basis for the cause of action, and if that is the basis, it's got to be disclosed in the pleadings as an element.",
  "Do you -- do you take the position that the phrase in (e)(2), if the plaintiff -- I'm sorry. Let me find it.",
  "No. I'm trying to find a phrase in (e)(2). If the plaintiff seeks to establish damages by reference to the market price of a security, do you take that phrase as -- as referring to a fraud-on-the-market theory or as being broader than a fraud-on-the -- on-the- market theory.",
  "It certainly includes it. There's no question about that. Does -­",
  "If -- if it's not confined to fraud-on-the-market, then there's the argument on the other side that all -- all (2) is really doing is saying that if you are going to establish your damages by reference to market price, this is the way you've got to do it. You've got to go through this mean price analysis and so on. But they are saying we are not simply trying to establish our damages by reference to the market, and therefore we're not bound by -- and therefore, (e)(2), in effect, is -- is irrelevant. What -- what is your answer?",
  "To the -- to the purchase price.",
  "Yes, but if you've got to show the inflation, then you don't have a complete cause of action the day after you buy the stock if there's no loss. I mean, if you've got to show the -- the drop following the inflation, you don't have the complete cause of action if there's no drop the day after you buy the stock.",
  "No, but I -- I thought you were conceding that you -- you, in fact, do not have a -- a loss -- forget what you can recover -- that you don't have a loss until the inflation is followed by a drop. And if there's no drop at the -- at time of purchase plus 1 minute, then I don't see how there is even the element of a cause of action.",
  "Then you're talking about a cause of action without damages.",
  "If you have no damages, you have no cause -- I mean, on normal tort theory, you have no cause of action.",
  "No.",
  "No, but what -- it seems to me that what Judge Sneed's theory boils down to is this. You cannot recover any loss except the loss that was caused by the fraud in question. In theory, that limit is established by the inflation at the time you purchase. So that is the limit of your recovery, but it does not follow from that that you have anything to recover for until you have your actual loss if you're pleading a -- a fraud-on- the-market theory. Isn't that fair to say?",
  "Okay.",
  "But the -- let's approach it a different way. On a fraud-on-the-market theory, there are two facts I think that can be assumed. Number one, there was no misrepresentation that was made peculiarly to you. The misrepresentation was to the broad market and was reflected in the broad market price.",
  "Number two, you as a purchaser do not know about the fraud until the market finds out about the fraud.",
  "If that is the case, then I don't see that it makes any sense at all to talk about your having a cause of action the day after you purchase before the market has found out and before the fraud is known. I mean, this -- this strikes me as an exercise in -- in an inconsistent theory.",
  "But aren't -- aren't you -- aren't you, in -- in effect, equating two different things: one, a loss that you suffer which you say occurs immediately upon purchase of the inflated stock; and on the other hand, a limit on the loss that is attributable to the fraud? Those are two different things. I understand the limit on the loss. I don't understand the -- the suffering of the loss in fact.",
  "Well, just so that I understand your argument then, going back to Justice O'Connor's question, if you get a long sentence, can you sit there for 10 years, then initiate the process to get the earlier conviction vacated and then say, as soon as it is, with due diligence I'm here at the courthouse because, although I waited 10 years, I have brought my 2255 as soon as I learned that my earlier sentence had been vacated? Your answer to that question, I take it, is yes, he satisfies the statute.",
  "Okay, but in -- in six States, I would have thought that, A, the due diligence language, together with the general obvious policy of AEDPA, to get this over with, would have made it very difficult to conclude that he can sit there without doing anything for 10 years.",
  "Maybe it's only in six States, but six States count.",
  "All right. Here's -- here's a simple way of looking at it. The minute that you're convicted and you are subject to the enhanced sentence based on a prior conviction, the obligation of due diligence begins. You can't sit there for 10 years. That's the point at which you've got to file your petition so that you can come into court with reasonable promptness, if not by the sentencing hearing itself, as soon afterwards as the State process allows you. That would be a simple due diligence point. It wouldn't involve placeholder petitions, and it would get things concluded with reasonable promptness. Why isn't that a way of -- of applying the statute?",
  "Easy. The minute he's convicted, the State has charged him and -- and -- or his -- by some charging document has made clear that there is going to be an invocation of a prior conviction for an enhanced sentence. As soon as he is convicted of the later offense in which that sentencing possibility has been raised, he has an obligation to go into the State court and start the process of -- of getting his earlier conviction vacated. Easy.",
  "But he would have acted with due diligence and he would have had as -- I suppose, a very powerful argument, which -- which the Government apparently would accept, for -- for tolling.",
  "Mr. Himmelfarb -­",
  "Mr. -­",
  "Would -- would you comment on -- on one difficulty I have with what, I take it, is your preferred position of measuring due diligence from -- as I understand it, from the -- the date at which the State conviction became final? Most of these -- I think it is fair to say that most of the State convictions, like most convictions in -­ in general, are going to rest on -- on guilty pleas. It just is not realistic to assume that Congress assumed a due diligence system which was going to require a State defendant immediately to start a collateral attack on a guilty plea. I mean, if -- if there -- if there were reasons for the collateral attack that seemed strong and worthwhile, he wouldn't have been entering the guilty plea. And it seems to me that if we're going to measure due diligence from the date of conviction, most convictions resting on pleas, as a practical matter under your system, a conviction that rests on a plea is never going to be subject to a timely challenge for purposes of applying 2255. Is -- is that a fair comment, or have I -­ have I missed something?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, would you comment specifically on your preferred position which starts at the very -- as I understand it, starts at the earliest date, which would be the date of the State conviction?",
  "Yes, but isn't it -- I guess my problem is isn't -- isn't it a sense -- isn't your argument for a sense of diligence which is really other­ wordly? At the moment the defendant's conviction based upon his plea becomes final, it simply is unrealistic to expect that any defendant would have an incentive to attack that conviction. And -- and the result, it seems to me, of -- of your position, your preferred position, is if -- if diligence is measured from that moment, that no defendant will ever be diligent because no defendant will ever have an incentive at that point to be diligent.",
  "Well, how about the one you're offering? Before you tell me why mine is bad, tell me why yours does not suffer the -- the -- at least I think, the objection that I've -- I've raised?",
  "That's -- that's right. But why is the requirement on your reading to challenge it promptly after it is entered in these plea situations, not a just totally unrealistic requirement that will never be met and will result in a consequence that all State convictions, resting upon pleas, will be, in effect, insulated from later collateral attack when -- under -­ for purpose of 2255?",
  "So you say we're all stuck with that.",
  "You don't mind, but -- if -- if you think -- if you think there's anything to my objection, you're in effect saying, too late.",
  "Is that also true under the Armed Career Criminal Act cases?",
  "In other words, you're saying due diligence applies to an extraneous fact when you could, in the simple sense, discover it. It applies to a generated fact when you could have generated it.",
  "Mr. Nolas, you haven't mentioned it, but didn't one of the three experts suggest that there be a -- a follow-up inquiry into the -- the abuse of alcohol by the defendant?",
  "My understanding is that nothing was done in response to that. Is that correct?",
  "Which -- which you're saying they did not do. I mean, just to get it -­",
  "And what would they have found?",
  "What -- what --",
  "Well, do you -- do you take the position that the -- that the argument that the prosecutor makes has got to refer explicitly to future dangerousness, a kind of talismanic words criterion so that we'll have a bright line rule and everyone will know where -- where he stands?",
  "No. But has -- has the prosecutor got to use a phrase like future dangerousness or a synonym for that phrase?",
  "Well -­",
  "-- if we -- if we don't adopt that kind of explicit words criterion, do you deny that the -- that the argument that the prosecutor made, particularly the -- by -- by introducing the -- the evidence of -- of the prior crime for purposes of the aggravating factor and the argument that he made about how the defendant had learned from his prior crime -- do you -- do you deny that -- that those were in fact, not with the talismanic words, but that those in fact were -- were arguments that suggested future dangerousness?",
  "But I -- I don't see how the -­ I -- I guess my -- my point is I don't see how you can avoid it. The -- the argument -- I think we would all agree that the argument was this person has committed repeated crimes. We're asking you to bear that in mind for the purposes of applying one of the three aggravating factors. In the course of committing repeated crimes, he has learned from past mistakes; i.e., he knows this time not to leave any witnesses. How can you divide the tendency of that argument, repeated crimes for purposes of aggravation, from the tendency of that argument to say repeated crimes in the future if he gets a chance? This is the kind of guy we're dealing with. How can you draw that line?",
  "No, but this is -- this is a special case. This is not a general argument to the effect that this is a very bad person and we can expect bad persons to be bad in the future. This is a more specific argument. This is an argument that says he's now done it twice. This is the second crime and he's getting better at it as he goes along because now he kills the witnesses. This isn't just generalized badness. This is criminal repetitiveness. It is recidivism. And it seems to me that that is a much clearer argument. It is much closer to the explicit argument that he will do it in the future.",
  "What -­",
  "And why would that argument have been reasonable?",
  "In other words, why -- why would we -- why would it be reasonable to assume that this Court had -- had established a constitutional rule going to jury instruction that rested on a kind of talismanic criterion?",
  "What -- what specific words in -- in the concurring opinion gets to the talismanic point?",
  "And -- and you're -- you're depending on the word, in effect, argue as -- as requiring -- or as -- as being a basis to say the argument has got to use talismanic words.",
  "And on that interpretation, why wasn't it an argument within the meaning of -- of your point, when the prosecutor here got up and said, isn't it frightening, he has, in effect, learned from his past experience, now he knows enough to kill the witnesses?",
  "Wasn't that an argument which -- which goes to future dangerousness?",
  "And Dr. Gross is the one who -­ who in his report suggested a follow-up on alcoholism I think.",
  "And one way, at least a kind of a threshold step to follow up on alcoholism, would have been to look at the -- the personal history report in the file of the prior case. If they had done so, they would have found something on that subject. So even -- even if we forget the question of the -- the scope of the expert's original brief and we look to Dr. Gross' suggestion and we look to the failure to look in an obvious place, i.e., the -- the personal history report and -- and the case file, which the State said it was going to use, don't we have a problem with competence of counsel?",
  "The -- the two other psychiatrists or psychologists?",
  "Wel, were they -- were they hired to -- to look into alcoholism?",
  "What's the -- what's the source of the implication?",
  "You say by implication.",
  "So -- so the -- the implication, I -- I guess, is that unless it specifically provides for damages, it implicitly does not.",
  "Mr. Waxman.",
  "Mr. Waxman, it seems to me that the -- the best argument we've heard about incompatibility is the one -- or at least I think the best -- is the one that Mr. Lamken touched on at the tail end of his argument, and that is, he said there's -- there's a 30­ day provision in there, which in effect says Congress wants this litigation conducted fast and over with fast. And that is incompatible with a damage action because if you get into a damage action, you are going to get into the panoply of -- of damages litigation, including depositions, and -- and the one thing you can guarantee is that it is not going to be over expeditiously. What is your argument? What is your response to that incompatibility argument?",
  "But it also requires expeditiousness on the part of the court.",
  "But do you -- do you agree with this much, that if -- if damages, in fact, are going to be allowed, what is going to count as expeditious is going to be a lot slower than what is going to count as expeditious if damages are not allowed.",
  "Okay. And -- and that -­",
  "-- that was a violation of the statute, wasn't it?",
  "So they turned the damage issue basically just into a separate remedial hearing at the end of the case.",
  "But isn't -­",
  "And -- and a very similar question. Is there anything in the record that indicates that those who would vote in the Libertarian primary are the stay-at-home Republicans or the Republicans who would otherwise have voted in the Republican primary?",
  "But that -- I mean, the Libertarians are happy to have -- take that risk.",
  "It seems to me if we don't know whether the -- the Republicans who are going to migrate to the primary are stay-at-homes or Republican voters, the State has no basis even to say whether in fact the harm it's trying to prevent is going to be affected one way or the other by its rule.",
  "Let me just ask you to look at the other side of the equation. However we assess the burden, we're assessing it in relation to the State's interest. What is your best statement of the State's interest here that you think is defensible?",
  "Do -- do you think the -- the poaching argument stands up on any -- any empirical basis?",
  "May -- let me just add quickly. I -- I realize, of course, there's going to be some movement of voters, but do we have any idea whether the voters who are moving are the ones who would otherwise have stayed at home anyway and done nothing, merely nominal Republicans as opposed to active Republicans?",
  "Well, he found that the numbers are such that they could, but did he find -- and I'm not sure of this. Did he find that the actual people who migrated would otherwise have voted differently so that in fact it made a difference?",
  "Okay. But you -- you want them to think and you want to leave the door open to their making a distinction for these purposes between the major parties and the minor parties, and I can't think of anything more intrusive into the political process than that. Coming from a Libertarian, I -- I get a sense that I must misunderstand you, but I don't know where it is.",
  "No, but we are -- we have got to look around the corner.",
  "And -- and if you're issuing the invitation to come up with a different rule for Republicans and Democrats and Libertarians, I think you're asking for trouble and we would be asking for trouble if we accepted that invitation.",
  "Well, let's assume that the city instead of taking the property by eminent domain simply used its, its own -- some of its own regular tax income to buy up the property, and assembled parcels of land with the purpose of selling them to an industrial developer to raise the tax base and hence ultimately to raise taxes. Would you say just within the meaning of general understanding of proper governmental purposes that the city was acting in a way that had no legitimate public purpose?",
  "Well, I'm not interested in the label. I'm just saying if the government says we need to increase the tax base because we have a depressed city, so we are going to take some of our tax money now, and we are just going to buy up property that people are willing to sell to us, and we are going to assemble parcels. And when we get a big enough one, we are going to sell it to a developer for industrial purposes. And that will, that will raise the tax base. Is there anything illegitimate as a purpose for governmental spending in doing that?",
  "Why isn't there a public purpose here?",
  "No, but we are talking about -- I mean, I realize that, but I mean, I thought your point was that it was use of eminent domain power for an improper purpose. And you characterize that purpose as conveying property to private owners. Well, in my example, the same thing is going on except that it's not using the eminent domain power. If the purpose in my example is a proper public purpose, why isn't it a proper public purpose when the government does it by eminent domain? What changes about the purpose?",
  "But if that is your answer then the slum clearance cases have got to go the other way.",
  "If that is your answer, then I suppose the slum clearance cases were wrongly decided.",
  "But you are saying we don't have to re-examine it, but I think your adoption of Justice Scalia's approach puts you in a difficult -- I think you're moving in the direction of saying we really have got to overrule the prior cases.",
  "Just for the moment, what about my question? And you can get into history, if you want to, and I tend to be interested in that, but my immediate concern is, if you give the answer that you have just given, doesn't it jeopardize the precedent of the slum clearance cases?",
  "I take it there isn't, but maybe there is, there isn't any question in this case that the city was acting in good faith and did -- and I presume still does -- intend to convey it to developers who will, will actually proceed to develop a project. Is there a question about that?",
  "Yeah, in other words, I can understand perfectly well, why we would want to draw a distinction between the use of the eminent domain power that takes a parcel of property from private person A and simply then reconveys it to private person B without any particular object in mind except that the city likes B, you know, the mayor is the Democrat and B is the Democrat. That kind of thing. So I can understand the need for some distinction between that case and what we've got here. The question is when you say there have to be minimum standards, I guess, is do we have a problem historically or in this case about the good faith of the taking so that we need the minimum standards to make sure that we are not getting into the first example?",
  "Is there a reason in this case? Is there some doubt here?",
  "Let me ask you, I'm sorry, I'll make this a quick question. Why do you think it is necessary, given your position, why do you think it's necessary to adopt the test you've just articulated as distinct simply from a good faith requirement. So that if somebody objected and offered to prove bad faith, that would be in effect a defense for the taking?",
  "Mr. Horton, what do you think is the reason that there are not a lot of examples of the sort that I think one of Justice O'Connor's hypotheticals raised, in which the, I don't know, the Econoline Motel gets condemned so that the Ritz can be built, thereby increasing tax revenue and so on, kind of parcel by parcel augmentations to the tax base and so on. Why aren't there a lot of examples like that?",
  "In which case we have a different - -",
  "But the loans don't make him whole. Isn't - -",
  "I mean, what bothered Justice Breyer I guess bothers a lot of us. And that is, is there a problem of making the homeowner or the property owner whole? But I suppose the answer to that is that goes to the measure of compensation which is not the issue here.",
  "No, but that -- that means if it's a taking at all, it's got to be a regulatory taking. But Justice Kennedy's question is what is the test for determining whether it is a taking.",
  "So you want money? You want a money judgment? I thought you wanted them to stop it.",
  "But -- but isn't -- I thought your premise was that because the statute doesn't authorize any payment, that is a way of stopping it.",
  "So if -- if Hawaii modifies its statute and says, we will give to you the difference between, you know, whatever the rent we -- if we can figure it out -- whatever the rent would be and -- and what our statute requires, you'd be perfectly happy.",
  "Okay.",
  "And on your theory it would easily be met no matter how severe the control. I -- I take it on your theory, if -- if the -- if the rent control ordinance said, $5 an apartment, that's the top rent, fine with you because it's extraordinarily efficient in relieving poor renters from the -- from the burden of -- of high rents.",
  "That can't be the test.",
  "But -- but it would -- in any case it would pass the threshold inquiry on your test. You would say, boy, it doesn't get any more efficient than this until it gets to zero.",
  "So you would say at the threshold level, there's no taking.",
  "And what would you then do? Go on to Penn Central?",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay. But if -- if the test is going to be as unhelpful as it would be in my extreme hypothetical, why have the test at all? Because in the more difficult case where it's not $5 an apartment, but a case like this in which the justification is ultimately a justification in gasoline prices and so on, the -- the inquiry is going to be much more complex. Penn Central is a way of approaching that complexity. Why do we bother with this threshold test which produces a bizarre result in one case and is going to be very difficult to apply in another case, in which event I don't see the reason for having it as distinct from the Penn Central difficulty test. What's -- what's its value?",
  "But isn't the sensible response to the situation you posit that the government shouldn't be doing it? I mean, it's a little crazy to say the Government is acting crazy. Therefore it -- it ought to contribute money so the net economic effect is somehow zero. There's simply a transfer. The taxpayers bear a burden as -- as opposed to somebody else. On the -- on the justification you're giving for the test, you would say, look, if it's not substantially advancing this interest, why let the government do it at all? I'm not saying that should be the test for whether the government should do it at all. But isn't that kind of the sensible tendency of the test, to suggest that the government shouldn't even be doing it?",
  "No. The -- I mean, it seems to me that the -- the whole point of the argument you're making is it won't hurt me, the landowner, quite so much, but if it doesn't make sense at all, why should we even have to get to that question? Why isn't the more sensible thing to say to the government, stop doing it?",
  "What --",
  "No, please.",
  "What do you make -- excuse me. What do you make of the argument for reasonable construction of the contract that in fact you just simply cannot have a system that would promise the chaos that -­ that you are promising?",
  "Is -- is it correct, as Justice Scalia suggested earlier, that so far as State litigation is concerned, it would be limited simply to arbitrary, unreasonable behavior?",
  "But what for?",
  "Well, if you win on the preclusion --",
  "-- what do you get then in substance?",
  "Then what do you intend to do? If you win on preclusion, what do you do then?",
  "No, but the argument -- it seems to me the argument is that in a de facto sense, when you try to litigate the Federal case, after losing the State case, you in effect are asking the Federal court in some sense to review what happened in the State court. Justice Ginsburg's answer to that is preclusion is the answer. Is that your answer?",
  "Because if that -- if that is -- if we accept that as the answer, then there's no argument for saying you should expand Rooker-Feldman to include the de facto review as opposed to the -- the very strict sense of review that you're talking about.",
  "And I take it that's because you don't have the cert period expired yet in the first action and you don't have the check.",
  "Okay. It's -- if the 3 months is expired and the check is in your hand and it's certified, what's left?",
  "I'm not asking about your intention. Let's assume you do intend to litigate further. What for?",
  "I want -- I want an answer to my question. What are you going to litigate for? What's left?",
  "I'm talking about your case. What's left?",
  "Nothing is left.",
  "And the -- and the concern is I think -- at least as I understand the -- the concern with it, it -- it boils down to something like this. Somebody comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion. Don't apply it because, for whatever reason, there's this -­ there's something wrong here, and -- and Federal court should determine the -- in fact, the -- the claim preclusion of the State judgment should not apply. The answer to that is, look, that's an issue to be raised by way of appeal of your State judgment. You don't appeal State judgments in Federal court. Out. There's no such claim being made here. The only claim that's being made here or the only conceivable claim, I guess, that can be made here is that we might want to do some litigating in the Federal case after the State case is over. There's no claim here that claim preclusion should not apply in that instance, and because there's no such argument that claim preclusion does not apply, the answer to the problem that you're worried about is simply claim preclusion doctrine. There's no reason to add a perihelion or something onto Rooker-Feldman to deal with what is really a very simple problem and that is, if they try to relitigate anew in Federal court, as Justice Ginsburg says, you -- you plead claim preclusion. Simple. Why do we need to complicate it beyond that simplicity?",
  "Well, no, because the -- it -­ it would not rule out the need to have some answer when someone in a Federal court comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion, whatever the reason may be. Don't apply the claim preclusion rules. There's something unfair about doing it here. The answer to that is, look, what you're really asking us to do, when you say don't apply claim preclusion, is to review what happened in the State court, and we don't sit as an appellate court on State courts. So there's still something for Rooker­ Feldman to do on, as it were, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg's claim preclusion argument.",
  "It'll get the -- it'll get the job done that you say will need to be done if you get to that point.",
  "Why won't it?",
  "Then -- then you -­",
  "Then -- then you appeal. Don't ask for a new body of law. Just say, look, you got the application of claim preclusion wrong in this case. We're going to appeal.",
  "Well, you can enforce the - - the discrimination provisions, but the structural provisions don't have to be enforced. Once the step is changed, they're not going to change it when they get 3 miles out.",
  "Well, it rules the world unless the world does not want to use the United States ports as ports of call.",
  "What you're saying is it would -- I thought you were saying that it would be the enforcement of the domestic contract of which the -- the statutory provisions would be an implied term. Isn't that it?",
  "It does not apply of its own force. It applies because two parties in the United States contracted that it would apply. Is that it?",
  "Yes, but Justice Stevens' question is you buy the ticket in Liverpool. Is the ADA -- an -- an American buys the ticket in Liverpool to come to the United States.",
  "Is the ADA an applied term of that contract?",
  "Mr. Salmons, one of the alternatives you threw out, not as a response to clear statement, but as a -- a response to the issue that was being raised by it, was the provision of the statute that it was intended to exercise the -- the fullest extent of the -- of the commerce power. And The -- The Bahamas respond to that by saying you could have said exactly - - or argued exactly the same thing in McCulloch. What is your response to that?",
  "Well, may I just ask you a -- a factual question? I didn't go back to the text to check this. Does the text of this statute say in these words basically we are exercising the fullest possible extent of the commerce power?",
  "And it's not in McCulloch.",
  "So it -- it doesn't have the fullest extent language then.",
  "Then your answer, I take it, is yes, it can discriminate and it can discriminate because Congress has not told it not to. Is that it?",
  "So far as United States law is concerned, it could.",
  "But -- but in that case, there was -- as I understand it, there was no legal relationship of any sort between the supplier of the patent-infringing object and the ship in the United States. So it at least made sense to classify that with internal order as opposed to external relationships arguably involving -- or implicating American law. You've got exactly the opposite situation here. You've got contracts made in the United States with the foreign cruise line. You didn't have that in your patent case.",
  "But its significant external -- its significant commercial relationships are in the United States with people in the United States performed partially in the United States.",
  "Could you go back to Justice Breyer's question about the number of foreign ships? Once we get beyond cruise lines, does it -- would -- would the -- the application on your view cover the -- the dozen passengers who decide they want to take a trip on a -- on a cargo boat?",
  "What about the -- what about the full sweep argument? Let's sort of come full circle on that. You -- you say the full sweep argument is no good because the same thing could have been made in McCulloch. The response was there is a textual difference - -",
  "Full sweep of the commerce power.",
  "But don't -- don't you have a -- a -- sort of a second prong to -- to your response? And I -- I wanted to get into this. You -- you have said Pennsylvania will let you file even though ultimately it, you know, may well determine that you -- you were out of time and you don't fall within any of the exceptions. Well, that's -- that's an answer. I'm not sure it's a strong enough answer to respond to Artuz. But I thought you had a second part to the answer, and I thought your second part to the answer was in that kind of situation, the Third Circuit practice, the Third Circuit rule is that unless we go through the Pennsylvania process, even if we know from day one that we're out of time, we think we have a -- an excuse, but even though we -- we think from day one we're out of time, unless we exhaust the Pennsylvania process, they will throw us out for nonexhaustion. And the reason they will throw us out from nonexhaustion, as opposed to going directly to the question whether there is an excuse for nonexhaustion, is because Pennsylvania will actually let us litigate this - -",
  "-- and not determine it as a threshold matter. So -- so your answer, as I understand it, is Pennsylvania let's you litigate it, and the Third Circuit requires you to litigate it so that the only reasonable thing for us to do is to litigate it even if you may say in the abstract it's a purely threshold time question. And for that reason, there should be tolling. Isn't that your argument?",
  "But isn't there a wrinkle to this? Isn't the wrinkle that even in cases in which you and I might say patently he's going to be out of time if he goes back to Federal court, the Third Circuit is requiring him to go there anyway, go through the formality of formal exhaustion, if you will, before they'll consider it? And isn't that a basis at least for equitable tolling?",
  "Right.",
  "Okay. Help me -- help me out here because I -- I just don't remember well enough. I thought that's what Judge Giles was getting at when he said, you know, he would have been thrown if he hadn't gone through the State procedure. So help me out. Is that what he was getting at or not?",
  "If that means the petitioner was wrong, doesn't it also mean that Judge Giles is wrong, and if Judge Giles can't figure it out, isn't there a pretty good argument that the petitioner ought to get equitable tolling?",
  "But -- but Judge Giles didn't understand it either.",
  "So far as this case is concerned, yes. And -- and so if Judge Giles got it wrong, isn't there a pretty good argument for equitable tolling when the petitioner gets it wrong?",
  "But -- but this argument is not trying to decide for the States. This argument basically is if nobody can figure it out, including a Federal district judge, at least give me the benefit of the doubt with equitable tolling.",
  "But if he had gone into the Federal court he went into, and he had not gone through this State procedure, he would have been turfed out.",
  "Well, answer that question - -",
  "-- before you tell me what the consequence is.",
  "Well, I mean, don't -- don't we have to take Judge Giles' statement as being a statement in good faith unless there is a pretty darned good reason not to?",
  "Well, he also raised an -- an entirely different claim, didn't he? I mean, it goes to ultimately the same point, but he raised the claim that the court had not engaged in an adequate colloquy - -",
  "Right. But that -- the -- I mean, it's a different claim. The judge has an independent responsibility. It's not the lawyer's responsibility.",
  "That -- that may be, but it is a different claim.",
  "It is not the claim of ineffective assistance.",
  "What was the basic justification in the first place for shackling? I mean, were there insufficient bailiffs or -- or why did they do it in -- even in -- during the trial itself?",
  "Is there any indication that there were or were not present court security officers?",
  "Well, is -- you -- you have -­ Justice Kennedy alluded to one of your earlier arguments, and that is the -- somehow the -- the shackling affects the capacity to participate. I thought you meant by that if the -- the hands are shackled, he can't write notes to counsel. Do you mean something else?",
  "Well, I -- I would grant you if -- if they -- they are so tight that it's causing pain, you've got a separate problem, but short of that, does the so-called capacity to participate suffer simply because he's -- he's in irons? I mean, the only participation that he's going to do, I presume, is -- is sit there and -- and communicate with his lawyer. It's going to affect his capacity to write a note to his lawyer. What else is it going to do?",
  "Do you know of any instance of that?",
  "But your -- your problem with that, as I understand it, is simply that at that point with all these chains and so on, he's giving an impression or the State is requiring him, in effect, to give an impression to the jury that may be a -- a false impression.",
  "Okay.",
  "But back to participation.",
  "But that would be true if he were in the legirons.",
  "True, true.",
  "Well, isn't -- isn't the question whether he -- he was dangerous in the courtroom?",
  "There's no question he was dangerous when he committed the murders, but -- but I don't know that that means he's dangerous in a courtroom.",
  "Is -­",
  "But the fact -­",
  "Well, the -- the stated aggravating circumstances didn't, but the point of -- one point of the argument is that by shackling the man in -­ in this complete and visible way, you are creating the impression that no one could fail to -- to perceive that this guy is so dangerous that they can't even depend upon courtroom security either to protect him from the -­ protect the jurors or courtroom personnel or to prevent escape. That -- excuse me. That may not be a verbal argument about dangerousness, but it seems to me that it is an unmistakably visible one. What is your response to that?",
  "You're talking about geographical diversity -­",
  "-- not jurisdictional.",
  "Mr. Ayer, let -- maybe I'm going to oversimplify to the point of the absurd but let me try it. The argument that you're answering is the argument that there is no textual basis in (a) to distinguish the geographical diversity requirement from the amount-in-controversy requirement. Your answer is, I think, that when the drafters in (a) refer to action and jurisdiction, those terms have to be understood historically as we have understood them, and the significance of a -- a geographical problem, which does destroy jurisdiction traditionally, is different from an amount-in-controversy problem which is -- which does not and is dealt with more simply. Is that your -­",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay, what if you go one step further and there was simply a tablet without any embellishment about source saying, you know, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet, et cetera, basically just the last five commandments, pure and simple. Would you have any objection on Establishment Clause grounds?",
  "No, I'm just talking about when I -- I don't know if I used the word tablet. I'm just talking about a piece of stone or a poster that says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not Would there be any Establishment Clause objection simply because though it does not say so, those were quotations from the last six commandments - last five commandments.",
  "Isn't it all the case, as has been pointed out, that no monument is going to be on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol without the approval of the legislature? You don't dispute that, do you?",
  "And you don't dispute that anyone going on those grounds would assume that the State government approved it or it wouldn't be there? the presumption would be that people on the Capitol grounds would assume the State of Texas wanted those monuments on the Capitol grounds.",
  "But you have to contend sort of commemoration of the Commandments involved was not the objective in placing the monument there, so you're left basically with a religious text. And if anybody has any doubt about that, the religious text is surrounded by some religious symbols, the Chi Rho, the Star of David. So it seems to me that it's hard to find, if we accept the district court findings, that there's anything here but an expression of approval by the State of Texas for a religious expression, and only for the religious expression.",
  "But you're not trying to withdraw the -- I took it to be the concession that of course anyone would reasonably assume that the State of Texas approved this message, and thought it promulgation.",
  "But then the fact that the Eagles also approve it doesn't really get us very far, does it?",
  "Let me ask you this. If the Eagles' presentation statement weren't on there, would that make a difference to Establishment Clause analysis?",
  "What is the -- that's one of the problems with the argument, it seems to me, grounds that have lots of other monuments, that the religious message is somehow either diluted or changed. Contrast the situation in Texas with what we've got here. You've got Moses up there with at least the last five commandments showing. But Moses is in the company of a group of individuals who are nothing but law givers. You've got Menes and Hammurabi and John Marshall and the rest of them. There is an obvious theme. Anybody who looks at the identity -- or knows the identity of these figures is saying they're getting at law givers. But if you look at the grounds of the Texas State Capitol, you see wars, pioneer women, children and so on. There is no one common theme. The only theme seems to be these are objects or symbols that are worthy of some kind of respect. And one of them is religious. Being mixed into a group that has no common theme does not eliminate the religious -- the obvious religious message from this monument. Isn't that correct?",
  "Maybe it doesn't, but I'm trying to find a rationale for the argument that's being made, and that I thought you were alluding to. The argument is that by mixing this in with a grab bag of other symbols, you have somehow diluted or changed the focus from a religious message to something else. And I can understand that in the Moses case in the frieze because there is a clear common theme. On the Texas grounds, at least insofar as I can tell, there is no common theme. There are a series of objects that say, these are worthy of veneration. One of them is religious. There is nothing that removes the religious message from its prominence in the display the way the religious message is removed from prominence in the Moses display, isn't that correct?",
  "You had a second point and I don't want to miss your second point.",
  "May I ask you there basically to comment on the point that Justice Scalia made in the course of the last argument? The context, as we know, has changed pretty radically in the course of litigation over this and it started out with just the Ten Commandments alone and then version 2, the Ten Commandments had certain -- were surrounded by certain quotations of religious content from other texts. And finally, as I guess literally is true with a new lawyer and more litigation, we've gotten to the present context. Isn't the problem that you have to face, as I've said before, what Justice Scalia raised before, everybody knows what's going on. Everybody knows that the present context is simply litigation dressing and that the object for what is going on is the object that was revealed in the first place. What is your response to that?",
  "Well, they created the land mine basically. I mean -­",
  "Okay, but if we still have a purpose inquiry, what you say of course is true. The current display includes the display of a lot of legal documents. But is there any reason for anyone to believe that that display of legal documents or anything else would be there for any other purpose than the display of the Ten Commandments, including the religious, the overtly theistic part of the text?",
  "But I assume if you were running a course in a school about the biblical text, you would explain the differences. You would indicate the difference between the Jewish, the Roman, the Protestant, the Lutheran and so on and you're not doing that here. I would have thought your answer might be, well, if that really made a difference, we could have separate versions. But it's not comparable to school teaching.",
  "Would you think it was appropriate in a public school course that was otherwise a bona fide course to teach the day on exodus, to teach about simply the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments?",
  "In a public school, wouldn't it be required, at least for intellectual reasons if not the reasons of the establishment clause to say, well, graven images are dealt with differently in the standard Roman translation and the preamble sections of what may and may not be regarded as commandment number 1 are different in the Christian versus Jewish and so on. Wouldn't that be an intellectually responsible requirement?",
  "Exactly. I thought you were equating the two together.",
  "Okay, but at the end of the day in Marsh, there wasn't any question that what they were doing was praying. And here it seems to me that the change that you're arguing for as significant is only significant unless it is a change in the essential activity because there is no law and it would be crazy law from this Court that said you can engage in religious endorsement, promotions, et cetera, so long as you hide the ball well enough. What this Court basically has said is you can engage in secular objectives that incidentally involve religious figures or references, e.g., Moses up there. What you started with in this case or what the county started with was a pretty religious-looking exercise and the question is, did they go from a totally religious exercise to a secular exercise or did they go from an obviously religious exercise to an obscured religious exercise? And therefore, you can't make context a mere change in physical context dispositive because it ignores that distinction. And that distinction I think is what is driving or what is going to drive possibly in my mind the resolution of this case. What do you say to that?",
  "May I ask you a question on that point? And I should know the answer. It must be in the briefs but I don't remember. I assume that they rescinded the resolution before version 3 of the display was put up, is that correct?",
  "It is still on the books?",
  "Would you explain why you distinguish text and symbolize them? You distinguish text from the crucifix and so on. Why?",
  "I understand the text part but why not adopt the same test for the symbols? For example, why not adopt it for the Moses? The burden would be on the government to show that it was not approving, endorsing, et cetera, and in this context, that would be pretty easy. Why not have the same test?",
  "Let me ask you this -- this question because it -- it -- I think it goes to the -- the heart of what I think is the problem in this case. If we are going to recognize a sphere of accommodation, which we have done previously, I think we have to recognize that the -- that the object of accommodating and the effect of accommodating is, in one sense, to benefit -- I mean, in an obvious sense, is to benefit religion. By recognizing a sphere of accommodation, in effect, I think the Court has said there is a sphere in which religion can be benefitted that does not rise necessarily to the level of government proselytization or -- or government endorsement. And it seems to me that the argument that you're making is that if the government endorses at all, it's immediately in -- in the -- the realm of establishment. Am I -- am I missing something in your argument?",
  "All right. And -- and why is the line violated here?",
  "Okay. Then I think you're saying that in order to exceed what free exercise requires in a prison necessarily forces you into establishment. And I think you're saying the reason it does so is that there are so many incentives on the part of prisoners to claim religion, that that's the only way you can sort of keep the genie in the bottle. Isn't that the -- the essence of your argument?",
  "Well, it -- but -- but that is not what the rule says. Number one, as -- as your brother on the other side pointed out, there's got to be some determination made as a threshold matter as to whether this is even a religious claim or -- or whether it's just gaming the system. So there's nothing automatic. Number two, if there are, as -- as there frequently will be, in the prison context important governmental interests which can only be served by denying the -- the request, the request can be denied. And it seems to me that if these are not sufficient recognitions of the -- of the prison context, then I don't know what kind of a rule we can have that would satisfy you except to say if it isn't absolutely required by free exercise, it is establishment.",
  "You -- you -­",
  "You mean specific accommodations like you can have kosher foods, you can wear a religious medal, you can have a tattoo? I mean, you're -- you're asking the legislature to be that specific.",
  "It -- it would also be rather a discriminatory one, wouldn't it? I mean, one -- one point that we have got to be concerned about, whether we're dealing with accommodation or whether we're dealing with -- with flat-out establishment, is distinction among religions. And I think you're saying if they do distinguish among religions, we don't have this problem, but I think that lands you from the frying pan into the fire.",
  "A guy comes along in a different religion and says, we're omnivorous, but we got to -- we got to wear medals. No statute that says medals are okay. It -- it -- you know, I realize the level of generality in your example is higher. The -- the discrimination is not quite so blatant, but it's a pretty tough job to come up with -- would be a tough job to come up with statutes without picking and choosing among religious demands.",
  "Why can't they -­",
  "But why can't they be dealt with under the statute as it is written, saying that if you -- if it is a bona fide request, and you, the prison, determine that in fact you -- you have a compelling State interest that cannot be served in any other way, you can say no? Why is that insufficient and -- and why does that -- why is that, therefore, the reason that -- that jumps us into an Establishment Clause violation every time?",
  "Well, are you saying that -­ that a statute is unconstitutional to recognize a prisoner's right to free exercise unless it also has a -­ a kind of a litany of sections recognizing speech rights, recognizing privacy rights, et cetera?",
  "Then it's got to single out religion.",
  "Sure it woul -­",
  "And if you did it under the statute, you would clearly have a reason for saying no.",
  "Then why hasn't that been the effect on the Federal ground.",
  "I'll -- I'll grant you that, but it seems to -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg responded to that by saying that these things get sorted out. At the beginning you get all sorts of loony claims. As time goes by, you get fewer of them. And -- and if -- if they weren't getting few of them, I would have expected the United States to make a different representation.",
  "Well, I don't know what that's got to -- you know, you may or may not have an argument there, but I don't know what it's got to do with the meaning of the Establishment Clause.",
  "Better shot than -- better shot than what? Better shot than the -- than the Free Exercise Clause alone would allow?",
  "And aren't you arguing that in the prison context, once you get beyond the free exercise line, you are into establishment?",
  "Okay. But how do we administer it? How does anyone administer that -- that kind of a test?",
  "It can -- it can be better but not much better?",
  "But wouldn't you concede that in the case of the injunction in which there is a specific order in relation to a specific respondent, that the police have much less discretion than they would have when there is in effect a general statute saying, respond in these kinds of situations?",
  "In the case of the statute that we're talking with, but they don't have that kind of discretion, do they, in Justice Ginsburg's example? What I'm getting at is, if you're going to take the example that Justice Ginsburg has given you as equivalent to the example that we have before us, I think you're fighting uphill and I don't think you have to do that.",
  "That -- no, please.",
  "But that's not the kind that you've brought, as I understand it. As I understand it, you've brought a claim simply that she was hurt and was not given process. That's all you have to prove. If you can prove a pattern, sure, it's easy to prove an individual case. But your only claim is damage as a result of a denial of some procedural right in this case, isn't that correct?",
  "But it's not a class action, is it? It's not a claim under some statute -- civil rights statute. It's a claim for the benefit of this client and if this client wins, this client presumably will get a money judgment, isn't that the case?",
  "Okay. Okay.",
  "I'll grant you that, but as I understand it, what stands between or what would stand between your ignoring complaint and success would simply be the police's statement of a reason because, as I take it, I take it that you don't deny she was heard, they answered the phone, they talked to her. She got a result. After she had talked with them on the phone, she knew that they weren't going to do anything or that they weren't going to do anything satisfactory. So as I understand it, on your theory, the only thing she didn't get that she would be entitled to would be a statement by them as to why they were not going to do something for her. Is that what it boils down to?",
  "And if they had said, we don't think there is probable cause, that would be the end of your case.",
  "Let me ask you a question that is suggested by Justice Scalia's question. And it goes basically simply to the practical problems that your position seems to entail. You answered him by saying that the point at which she realized they were denying her whatever she was entitled to was the point at which the children were dead. How would a reviewing court know when this particular right had been denied? I take it from your answer to Justice Scalia that there had not been a denial of the right and hence a violation of procedural due process after the first telephone conversation. I take it from your answer that there wasn't one after the second conversation. And I take it the only -- that there was no ripening, as it were, of the facts into a denial of what she was entitled to until the 3:00 a.m. call, is that correct?",
  "Well, my general question, then, is how does a reviewing court determine when or the point at which there has been a denial?",
  "So following the first phone call, they would have to have made an express probable cause determination?",
  "And communicate that to her.",
  "What good could that have done anyone?",
  "She knew, as it was, that they weren't going to do anything. What good would it have done her to know that, oh, it's nice to know that they've gone through a probable cause determination in coming to the conclusion that they're not going to do anything. I mean, what is the social value of that?",
  "They said call back in two hours and whatnot.",
  "And each time at the end of the call, she knew that they weren't going to do -- they weren't going to go out and look and they weren't going to enforce the order at that point, didn't she?",
  "I mean, I can understand you're making an argument -- you have made it, but I can understand you're making an argument that the point of procedure is to force people, in this case the police, to face facts. If they really know that she has made out probable cause that something is wrong here, if they are forced to face that as a result of procedure, they will then do something about it. It's not as easy to be irresponsible in that case. But the trouble with that argument, it seems to me, although it's sound as far as it goes, is that it's an argument that would apply with respect to every statute in which there is mandatory language to the police to enforce it. And that seems to me to suggest a completely nonadministerable system and one which is totally at odds with the normal accord of police discretion.",
  "I mean, how do you get around that dilemma?",
  "Then why weren't they enacted with an express provision saying, and by the way, the police have got to go, either through the following procedure or, by the way, this statute creates a right on the part of the protected party. In other words, if the response to what I understand the problem to have been, if the response was the response that you think the legislature made, why didn't the legislature say something that would take these statutes out of the run of the mill criminal law statutes in which the police, subject to mandatory language, have an apparent obligation to do something to enforce?",
  "But it doesn't say that people like your client have a personal right to enforcement with a damage remedy.",
  "How about you? You're in trouble too, aren't you?",
  "No, but it seems to me -- and I think what bothers me is -- is what bothers Justice Kennedy. It seems to me that the argument you just made is an argument that given the pleadings in this case, the findings that Justice Ginsburg just quoted really were irrelevant findings, that they should not have gotten -­ that the court should not have gotten into extortion and so on and should not have provided a remedy for extortion, quite apart from the fact of whether it's an appropriate remedy, constitutional or otherwise. And that, it seems to me, is -- is something that we -- we are not here to touch. That's a question of California law. What we are here to touch is, number one, whether the injunction is overbroad with respect to pure speech, and maybe we are here -- that we have a question about the -- the breadth of the case we took. But maybe we are here to determine whether there can be an injunction against blackmail or harassing activities. But I -- I think we're not here to decide whether California could have gotten to the question of blackmail, harassment, and injunction for that. Do you agree with that?",
  "Well, it can certainly -- the -- the issue is certainly before us as to whether such an injunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure and simple. But the findings that Justice Ginsburg has -­ has read and part of the order in question here seems to go beyond pure defamation. It goes to the kind of demonstrative activity which plausibly is found to have been in aid of extortion. And that, it seems to me, is an entirely different question. We may -- I'm not saying we will, but we may agree with you that it's overbroad. We may agree with you that as to pure speech, you can't enjoin it. But that doesn't necessarily mean that every part of this injunction is wrong, and it seems to me it is irrelevant as to whether the -- the State of -- the courts of California should have reached extortion.",
  "With respect to the defamation, pure and simple. I agree with you. We -- there is a heightened standard of review, but I don't think that addresses one way or the other what the standard should be when an action in the State courts has been treated as an action both for defamation and for extortion or harassment.",
  "Well, do you -- do you defend the injunction in its entirety?",
  "In other words, the -- the -­ Mr. Chemerinsky didn't have too much chance to -- to get very far into it, but one of his points was that there was -- quite apart from any injunction against picketing, harassment, et cetera, there was an injunction simply against speech on a given subject directed to a lot of people with no limit of time. With respect to that last aspect, do you defend the injunction?",
  "Well, it was directed, number one, to a named person who was not a party to the case, and it was directed to agents and employees of -- of the named party. So, I -- I assume that Mr. Cochran probably has a fair number of agents and employees, so it does seem like a large number of people.",
  "Well, let me ask you a law school question. In -- given the injunction on its face, with that breadth, is that injunction defensible with respect not to picketing, not to harassment, simply to speech in a public place?",
  "I -- I asked you -­",
  "-- to exclude the -- the issue of conduct. I said forget the injunction for a moment with respect to picketing, with respect to harassment, and we'll say with respect to blackmail, since that has come up. Forget that. Simply take the portion of the injunction that enjoins speech by these people, associates, agents, et cetera. On the subject matter of the injunction for all time, do you defend that injunction?",
  "Why?",
  "Why -- why shouldn't the litigant be put on notice by a district court decision? Let's assume it's in his own circuit.",
  "Well --",
  "Of course, if we're -- if -- if admittedly, as Justice Breyer said, we're trying to figure out some way to make this work in circumstances in which it's -- it's never going to work smoothly, I suppose one answer would be to take the Government's position and say you've -- your -- your year runs from the moment the right is recognized, but to the -- to the extent that there is a retroactivity question, a -- a court should simply stay the proceeding, hold it in abeyance to see whether, particularly in -- in second habeas where you have the -­ the second petition where you have the problem, to see whether some court will, in fact, recognize retroactivity or whether the -- your circuit will recognize retroactivity. Then if it does, then you can go forward.",
  "Oh, there's no question there's a Rube Goldberg character of the whole thing, I -- I realize. But -- but that would be a way of -- of solving the second habeas problem and still accepting the Government's position on the -- on the date at which the -- the 1 year for filing starts.",
  "Well, on Justice Stevens' analysis, he does not have a date until the retroactivity decision is made, and he has to sit there and wait. But when the retroactivity decision is made, he's got his date.",
  "I -- I follow your linguistic -- Justice Stevens follows the linguistic analysis. I think the question that he's raising, the question I'm raising is, do we have a good reason here to doubt that the linguistic analysis is getting us to -- to what Congress would have intended? The proposed good reason or the best reason I think is that if we read it your way, then as Justice Breyer said in Tyler, as a practical matter, second habeas is -- is -- a second habeas petitioner is -- is almost never going to -- or probably, in fact, never will get the benefit of the new rule. Well, maybe one answer to that is, so what. The reason that cannot be dismissed, I think, that way is this. As has been pointed out here, we do not under our rules often make a new rule retroactive, but when we do under the conditions which we impose for that, it's -- it's one humdinger of a rule.",
  "And it is -- it is unlikely -­ or at least there's a good argument that it's unlikely -­ that Congress would have wanted to exclude all the potential second habeas people from it, particularly because they're second habeas people because they got in in time on first habeas. They played by the rules, and on your theory basically they're out of the game on a very important rule. So that's the argument for saying that your linguistic analysis may not be pointing to what Congress intended.",
  "But that is -­",
  "That is a highly exceptional case, and the problem with that is -- I mean, if -- if we're going to -- if you're going to be linguistic about it, you'd have to say, well, that really is not very sound reasoning because that is not a holding because the -- you -- you've got not merely to have recognized it under the statute, but you've got to have held it. And that's -- that's pretty unlikely.",
  "Well, I guess we've said you've got to do it with --",
  "So far as first habe goes.",
  "Second habe, he's out cold.",
  "I'm laughing at the statute, not at you.",
  "Well, as I understand, I -- I would -- I will grant you that there are moments in the -­ in the Ninth Circuit opinion in which there seems to be a shift back and forth in the rhetoric between claim preclusion and issue preclusion. But as I understand what the Ninth Circuit held, it did not hold that your claim was necessarily out of court because of claim preclusion. It held that your claim failed because of the effect of issue preclusion on elements that were common, factual elements common to both the claim in the State court and the claim that you sought to bring in the Federal court. Am -- am I correct about that, about what the Ninth Circuit held?",
  "Okay.",
  "So, in effect, then maybe -­ are you saying this, that there is no issue preclusion here because the -- the ruling that there was no statement of a cause of action was, in fact, a disposition of the claim without there being any resolution of any fact issue upon which the claim might depend. Is that what you're saying? And therefore -- and -- and that is the reason why there is no issue preclusion? Is that your argument?",
  "Let's take a -- may I -- may I, in effect, approach it with a simpler example, which -­ which is not this case, but I -- I just want to know how -- how the -- the systems work together. Let's assume that, in fact, a -- a Lucas kind of claim had been involved, and the -- the State courts said we understand Lucas. We're applying Lucas. And in point of fact, following the Lucas standard, there are plenty of uses that are still left on this land, so that there's no taking under -- under Lucas. And let's assume that they -- they go through the State system. They lose. They don't petition here for cert. Instead, they go into the -- the district court with a Fifth Amendment claim. Is it open to them in the district court to make this argument? Don't apply issue preclusion to our Lucas claim. The Lucas -- to -- to the -- to the determinations, the reasonable use determination in -- in Lucas. Don't do it because although the State court purported to be applying Lucas, it really was not. It was not following the Lucas standard. It was applying something much more favorable to the State. And therefore, any determination on that issue should not get preclusion here. We ought to be able to litigate de novo even though, on the face of it, we seemed to have litigated the Lucas issue and the State court decided it. Could they make that argument? And -- and if it were sound, would -- would preclusion principles give way?",
  "I guess in the -­",
  "Decided but not litigated. I mean, the -- the problem is that -- that claim preclusion normally assumes that the issue is, in fact, litigated.",
  "And his -- he's arguing it was not.",
  "Tell me how that statement that you just made, fully litigated, squares with the fact that -- I thought you said a moment ago it was decided on a demurrer.",
  "I'm -- I'm confused here.",
  "But you're -- you're saying that the facts were -- were independently developed before the demurrer was filed and granted?",
  "So it was not decided simply on pleadings.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, your position, I take it, is that if somehow we follow your suggestion so that the President's suggestion may be put into effect in the state courts, that there would still be a habeas jurisdiction, ultimately, over the result if you're dissatisfied with what happens in Texas. Do I understand you correctly?",
  "You're simply saying that any court has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction. We grant you that. But, granted that, if we reach it, what is your answer to the claim that the COA requires a showing of substantial infringement of constitutional, as distinct from other sources of, rights?",
  "So you're saying the -­",
  "-- the constitutional violation is the violation of the Supremacy Clause.",
  "Is that what you're saying?",
  "Due Process Clause because?",
  "Well, of course, we wouldn't even have to venture into -- possibly have to venture into this issue of law if Texas were interested in following the determination of the President. I take it that the suggestion that your brother has made, that, in fact, we take no action at this point so that they may return to Texas with the President's determination, is not appealing to you.",
  "Well, but does Texas have a position in response to the President's determination?",
  "Well, but we don't -- we may not reach that, if Texas says, \"Well, yes, you're right, it is a claim, and we'll entertain it.\" Does Texas have a position on that question yet?",
  "Well, I'm sure it will be, but does Texas have a position on that, at this point?",
  "Well, what difference does that make, since this -- the issue to which it is addressed has not been raised either? I mean, it's a new issue, and I presume, to the extent that it may be considered at all, his response -- he can make a response to it.",
  "Well, I can understand the argument, that he shouldn't be allowed to raise due process here if the argument also goes to your -- the permissibility of your raising 2253.",
  "What's sauce for the goose -­",
  "Okay. Then I don't see why it isn't also a jurisdictional gate for him to make a response to it.",
  "So it's -­",
  "-- in effect, it's the unbundling requirement which is your answer to Justice Scalia's -- Why should that make a difference? I mean, you could just as well make an unbundling requirement with respect to cable.",
  "And the reason for a distinction, at least at the present time -- the reason for the reasonableness of the distinction at the present time, as a source of applying this definition, is history, basically.",
  "Yeah.",
  "But the -- I mean, I think the difficulty that we're having is that it says it in the cable context, and then it doesn't say it in the wire context. And you can say it just as intelligibly in the wire context.",
  "It's just that you haven't been saying it.",
  "So is that really the nub of the difference? It's Congress that is requiring them to do it separately, and Congress doesn't have a comparable requirement with respect to cable.",
  "Yeah, but that begs the question.",
  "It begs the question.",
  "Basically, you're saying interstitial lawmaking, like other kinds of lawmaking, can be reasonable without being absolutely consistent at a given moment.",
  "No, no, but they're saying if telecommunications and something else is involved, and that's what you offer, you are not offering a telecommunications service. That's their definition of \"offer,\" as \"offer telecommunications service separately.\" It would be obvious, for example, if you service were by phone, to connect with the Library of Congress and you owned the Library of Congress, as well as owning the dedicated line. Then what you're doing is selling information across the line. So they say that's what they're doing, but just not as much.",
  "There's butter on the cake, not in the cake.",
  "BUt, your argument, I take it, would be the same if the proportions were reversed. Your argument with respect to -- your current argument with respect to infringing use would be the same if only 10 percent -- if it were assumed that only 10 percent of the use were illegitimate and infringing. Is that correct?",
  "That's right.",
  "Well, let's go - -",
  "-- let's go from Xerox back to your iPod. How is that clear in the iPod case? I may not understand what people are doing out there, but it's certainly not clear to me. I know perfectly well I could go out and buy a CD and put it on my iPod, but I also know perfectly well that if I can get the music on the iPod without buying the CD, that's what I'm going to do. And I think it's reasonable to suppose that everybody else would guess that. So why, in the iPod, do you not have this Damoclean sword?",
  "Well, there's never evidence at the time the guy is sitting in the garage figuring out whether to invent the iPod or not. I mean, that's - -",
  "-- the concern.",
  "Okay, but you're - -",
  "No, but you're - -",
  "-- you're not answering - - you're not answering the question. The question is, How do we know in advance, on your test, anything that would give the inventor, or, more exactly, the developer, the confidence to go ahead? As was said a minute ago, he knows he's going to be sued immediately. There isn't a product performance out there, as there is in this case. So, on your substantiality theory, why isn't it a foregone conclusion in the iPod that the iPod loser -- or developer is going to lose his shirt?",
  "Yes, that's inducement.",
  "Mr. Clement, in one way this presents an easy case for answering Justice Scalia's question, but what about a case in which there isn't the Napster example to start with? Should there be some kind of a flexible rightness doctrine in response to suits, as Justice Scalia put it, against the inventor or developer right out of the box?",
  "Congress of laches.",
  "Congress of laches.",
  "How would you express the - - how would you express that, that substantive standard that anticipates, just as you suggested we do?",
  "But I don't - -",
  "-- understand how you can separate the past from the present in that fashion. One, I suppose, could say, \"Well, I'm going to make inducing remarks Monday through Thursday, and I'm going to stop, Thursday night.\" The sales of the product on Friday are still going to be sales which are the result of the inducing remarks Monday through Wednesday. And you're asking, in effect -- you're asking us -- to ignore Monday through Thursday.",
  "Then why was current -- why was inducement, as a current theory of recovery, even the subject of summary judgment? It seems to me that to make it a summary judgment is implausible to a nonworldly degree.",
  "I mean, I thought you were saying that, so far as the inducement theory of recovery is concerned - -",
  "-- the only summary judgment that was granted was with respect to current acts of inducement, the way the company is acting now, not the way the company was acting last year. And my question is - - if that is correct, then I don't see how summary judgment could even intelligibly have been considered.",
  "Why isn't this a classic willful-ignorance case?",
  "Sure, but I thought willful ignorance was basically a certainty of what was going on without empirically verifying it, so as to, sort of, maintain the guise of one's hands over one's eyes. And it seems to me, if that's what it is, that's what we've got.",
  "Then what is the point of the current summary judgment?",
  "So you're saying the summary judgment simply, in effect, says, \"They're not doing anything wrong now, but we have left open the question, not merely of what they have done wrong in the past, but whether what they did wrong in the past can carry forward into the future\"?",
  "That's bizarre.",
  "So you're saying -- what it really says is, \"There's nothing to enjoin, but there may very well be something to recover for,\" - -",
  "-- \"even as to future activity.\"",
  "Well, you say it's marginally greater than 4. It's not marginally greater than 1 or 2 certainly.",
  "Well, but the -- the point of the case is that the inmate does not expect to be put in solitary confinement for 23 or 23 and a half hours a day for a period of 1, 2, or more years without some process to do it because that is so extraordinarily onerous and so different from the general run of incarceration practice.",
  "30 -- for 30 days I believe, wasn't it?",
  "Not 1 year, 2 years, 3 years.",
  "But -- but typically it has been represented maybe -- maybe wrongly -- typically it has been represented that they tend to be in there for a year or 2-year periods.",
  "But in -- but in fact, they tend to be in there for the extended periods of time. Isn't that -­",
  "May -- may I just ask you a question about that? I realize that there is a predictive element. I don't think anyone disputes that. One of the points of contention here, as I understand it, is that even the new policy did not give a -- an -- an inmate a statement of the charge or reason for the -- for the reclassification to 5. Is -- is that correct?",
  "Notice of what?",
  "But did it give notice of the reason for the reclassification? You did such and such. You are such and such kind of person, a gang member. Does it tell him anything?",
  "No, not the evidence, just the reason.",
  "I -- I know that, but does it say you're being reconsidered for -- considered for reclassification because you hit somebody over the head or because you've shown that you're a member of a gang or some other reason?",
  "Well, you say he has the opportunity. Do you actually tell him you are about to be reclassified or our proposal is to reclassify you because you violated this particular regulation by this particular conduct?",
  "I'm asking you what you tell the inmate, not what initiates your process. Now, please answer my question.",
  "At which point does he get -­ at which point does he get access?",
  "General Petro, I -- I don't -- I'm going to ask you a very tendentious question, but it's something I don't want to make a mistake on. Going back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, when he is given what you described as the bare bones report at the beginning of the proceedings, when he gets the 48-hour notice, will in her example the bare bones report say you are being reconsidered for reclassification because you are believed to be a gang leader? Does he get the gang leader information?",
  "No. I'm not -­",
  "I'm not worried about evidence.",
  "Just I want to know the charge. Will he always get the charge?",
  "So that in the gang leader example, he will be told that it's because he is accused of being a gang leader that this is occurring.",
  "Well, is -- is the population with respect to which you have adopted the far more lenient process a -- the population of the control unit, which I understand is comparable to the unit we're talking about in Ohio, or is it with respect to the general maximum security population which is housed in conditions less onerous than the control unit?",
  "Okay, and -­",
  "May I -- may I -- I just want to make sure. There is then a direct disagreement of fact between you and the Attorney General. I understood him to say they got the form that starts at JA-58, and I understand you to be saying they don't.",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay.",
  "Haven't we -- haven't we got something equally different here? The -- the issue here, as I understand it, is -- is not litigation of the State law claim, but a claim under Federal law with respect to the passage of title when property is taken for taxes. As I understand the -- the original plaintiff's claim, it simply is that if he's right, under Federal law he is entitled to a declaration that the property is still his. If he's wrong, the other side is entitled to property. But the issue is a Federal issue, and the only way the State has a role in it is that the State provides a mechanism, the quiet title action, analogous maybe to 1983, for getting it into a State court. So it seems to me that the issue is a Federal issue, not as in Merrell Dow, a -- a State cause of action that incorporates by reference a Federal standard.",
  "Yes, but I don't -- I guess that's where we're parting company. I don't see that there is a State law claim as distinct from a State law procedure for trying that claim in a State court. As I - - as I said a second ago, it's sort of like 1983. It doesn't create causes of action, but it provides a -- a jurisdictional basis for getting into court if you've got a cause of action. And in this case, it's a Federal cause.",
  "Which was a Federal issue.",
  "I take it you would agree that we could leave the -- the Kansas City formulation, the oral laws, intact and say that the distinguish -- that the distinction between Merrell Dow and this case, which leaves it intact is the distinction between in Merrell Dow's case, the adoption by the State of a Federal standard, though the State did not have to adopt it in its tort law, purely optional, and in this case, the application of Federal law which, under the Supremacy Clause, the State had absolutely no choice but to apply. If we recognize that distinction, we could leave the language in Kansas City exactly where it is, couldn't we?",
  "What -- what are the -- sort of the -- the horribles that you have in mind?",
  "Yes, but in -- in that case, the action is not enforcing the Federal tax law, whereas in this case, the action is, indeed, enforcing the passage of title statute under the -- under the tax code.",
  "But Federal law is determinative.",
  "Well, you're taking the -- I mean - -",
  "Well, you're taking the position then, as I understand it -- and I -- I don't disagree with your -- your position necessarily -- that its construction or application - -",
  "-- of Federal law.",
  "Yes.",
  "May I -- may I go back to your answer to the -- the question whether in the absence of an answer, there is a presumption of a Batson violation, and you said, no, there isn't a presumption - -",
  "-- where the court has still ultimately got to decide it? What sorts of things could the court consider when it ultimately decides?",
  "At step three. We've -- we've gotten to step three.",
  "Step one, whatever the standard is, it has been met. Step two, silence. We get to step three. What does the court consider at step three?",
  "Which is zero. Which is silence. There is no answer.",
  "Yes.",
  "All right. But what I'm getting at is let's assume he doesn't draw that inference. Ultimately at step three, he says, no. I am going to reject the challenge. I do not think that the burden of persuasion has been met. What -- what considerations might lead him to do that, assuming that step one has been satisfied?",
  "All right. Let me - -",
  "Let me suggest this. Wouldn't -- wouldn't he almost necessarily have to consider at step three those reasons that the prosecutor has not given, but which he thinks might be good reasons for the challenge which do not raise Batson discrimination?",
  "Right. That's what I'm - - that's what I'm getting at. And -- and what I'm troubled by is I -- I take your -- I understand your point, that it's not appropriate for him to speculate and supply an answer at stage two. But if stage one -- at stage one, the objector has satisfied the test and at stage three, the -- the court may, nonetheless, reject the challenge, I don't know what he would be rejecting the challenge for unless it is on the basis of this kind of, as you put it, speculation about what the reasons might be. So help me out there.",
  "Then why don't you have to say at that stage, if there is silence on the part of the government, he's got to find the violation?",
  "But if he doesn't have to, he's got to have some reason for doing it. This is not a matter of whim. And if he's got to have a reason and his reasons may not legitimately be those speculations on what might be a legitimate basis for the challenge, but which were never raised by the State, and you can't think of any other reasons -- and I admit I can't right now -- then it seems to me that he would pretty -- it would -- it would follow that -- that he would be required to -- to uphold the challenge.",
  "Could -- could I take that a step further? Would this -- would this be a -- a fair summary of -- of your position on all the steps? Step one, there must be enough that would justify sending the question to the jury if it were a jury question.",
  "Number two, if there is silence at stage two or in Justice Scalia's example, the prosecutor just can't remember, and we then go to stage three, your position is as follows. At stage three, number one, there is enough - - there is enough evidence on the record from which the judge can find a Batson violation. Number two, there is a state of the evidence from which he is not required to find a Batson violation. Sometimes, maybe most times, the prosecutor's silence will be a reason to find a Batson violation, in addition to those that were stated at stage one. And finally, theoretically -- theoretically even with the prosecutor's silence, the evidence at stage one, sufficient as it might be to get to the jury, will not be persuasive. And there may be outlying cases in which, even with prosecutorial silence, the court will say I don't see the Batson violation shown here. Is that a fair statement of your position?",
  "Okay.",
  "I thought step one was evidence from which it could be found more likely than not.",
  "He doesn't have to prove more likely than not at stage one, as I understand your position. He has to put in enough evidence from which a fact finder could find more likely than not if he accepts all the evidence as true and so on.",
  "The dog is entitled to one bite.",
  "I say, the dog is entitled to one bite.",
  "But you -- you have - -",
  "I was going to say, if -- on the scenario that you have raised, in which you don't even know that the petition has been filed, because the -- you don't -- the Court hasn't called for a response, the whole rationale behind the narrow reading is absent, as I understand it, because you point out that the rationale for the narrow reading is that the first pleadings put you on notice as to the case that you have to meet. And you shouldn't then have to be given an entirely new case to meet after you've been put on notice and taken whatever preliminary steps you've taken. But in the scenario that you're talking about, you have not been put on notice, because you don't even know there is a petition there yet. You have not been led to prepare a case which has now changed. So it seems to me that your rationale does not apply in the case in which you do not yet have notice, and, hence, have not filed a response, for that reason.",
  "No, but that -- the problem with that is that a -- the whole point of a relation-back rule is to get around a time bar. That's why you have them. And I thought your argument was, \"Well, you shouldn't allow them to get around this time bar, because we have been put on notice, we have begun to prepare our case, and we should not then be presented with an entirely new case.\" And so, that's why, it seems to me, your preparation point, in effect, is trying to limit a rule, the whole purpose of which is to get around the time bar. If you don't have the preparation point, you don't have an argument.",
  "Oh, it would be. But, again, in the case that you're talking about, the very value that you're arguing for -- i.e., \"We ought to be able to rely on the notice that we have given\" -- is an argument which hasn't arisen yet, because there's no factual basis to make.",
  "But in the capital case, you've got a specific provision in there. I mean, for the capital case, which is the one, I agree, you worry about most, because there's reason to delay there, Congress provided specifically for states to opt in; and when they opt in, they get the benefit of pretty rigorous time bars.",
  "And so, why -- I mean, isn't the answer to the capital-case problem exactly the answer that Congress gave, and, if a state does not want to opt in, then the normal amendment rules apply?",
  "How about a case - -",
  "Well, let me -- let me ask you how that would work in this case. The original claim is that there was a Fourth Amendment violation in admitting, you know, unlawfully seized evidence. Later, the Petitioner wants to amend to claim ineffective assistance of counsel, because counsel totally overlooked the leading case, directly on point, on this particular evidence. Is that arising out of the same operative set of facts, or is -- or is that something different? Clearly, the facts are not exactly the same. Close enough?",
  "Yes, but if that's -- if that's the line you're going to draw, then it seems to me that, in effect, what you are saying is, you can't amend. Because I can't imagine an operative set of facts that are going to be much close than -- in the real world, than the -- than the two sets that I gave you; and if they're not close enough, you're really arguing for a no-amendment rule.",
  "Not if you were the judge.",
  "No, but, I mean, why - -",
  "-- why - -",
  "So you can amend -- you can amend your factual basis, as it were, but you can't amend your claims.",
  "Why - -",
  "Why do you argue that if there is no due process violation with respect to the actual plea, there is, therefore, no due process violation with respect to the sentence?",
  "Yes, but we -- we may say the theory really is -- is not sufficiently relevant with respect to the plea but that it is with respect to the sentence.",
  "I -- I -- no question about that.",
  "No.",
  "No. I -- I understand that. May I go back just to one factual issue before we go on and forget it? You -- you stated, in response to Justice O'Connor, that the State argued in -- in the Stumpf case that there was sufficient evidence to find that he was the triggerman. Did the State stop there and say, in effect, we don't care whether you find him the triggerman or not? We're just telling you there's enough evidence. I -- I assumed the State went on to say there is enough and you ought to find that he is the triggerman.",
  "Did -- did the prosecutor ever say he was the triggerman? The evidence supports it and -- and that's the conclusion that ought to be drawn: he was the triggerman.",
  "But did he take the second step and say there's ample evidence and he was, in fact, the triggerman and you should so find, or in so many words?",
  "But it is the case that he argued that -- that you should find him guilty because he was the triggerman. I mean, that was an alternative argument. So the -- I mean, I think what's the -- the concern following Justice Kennedy's question, the concern that I have is not with the -- the guilt or innocence as such here. It's with the sentencing. And as -- it seems to me fair to say that as the record stands now, the State has made two arguments: one that Stumpf was the triggerman, one that Wesley was the triggerman. It has to be the case that one of those arguments, if accepted, would lead to a false result. And the question -- I think the due process question is whether the State can pursue those inconsistent arguments, even if it starts out innocently doing it, but can it pursue two inconsistent arguments knowing that in one case the argument must be for a false result, without there being any kind of -- of process to correct the State's inconsistent positions? What -- I mean, what's your response to that?",
  "Oh, he could -- he could get into court, but as I understand it, there was no recognition here that there is -- that there is in fact something wrong with the two inconsistent -- or the two arguments of the State, each of which, if accepted, will necessarily result in one false conclusion.",
  "Maybe -- maybe that's enough. Let me, with respect to that, just ask you one final question. And I'm assuming the -- the answer, but I want to be sure. I assume that at the point of this intermediate court's reweighing, the intermediate court was aware of the -- the evidence of -- of -- the hearsay evidence of Wesley's confession and was aware that the State argued in the second case that Wesley was the triggerman. Am I correct?",
  "And -- and I take it also - -",
  "-- stipulated or represented or admitted, whatever, that in fact the State had argued in the second case that Wesley was the triggerman.",
  "Because of being -- because of being the triggerman.",
  "Okay, but wait. Who did the - - who was the last person the State pointed its finger at? You -- you told me in -- in response to earlier questions that when the case back before the two remaining members of the panel, that in fact the State brought the -- called to their attention the fact that Wesley had confessed and -- and it was -- it was clear one way or another that - - that they had argued in Wesley's trial that he was the triggerman. When they -- at that point when they are back before the two remaining members of the panel in Stumpf's case, did the State say we now go back to our original position that Stumpf was the triggerman and Wesley wasn't, or did they say we think -- we think Wesley is the triggerman and Stumpf wasn't? Or did the State simply stand there agnostic?",
  "May I ask you one final question? As a matter of due process, why shouldn't the State -- after learning of the supposed admission in Wesley, after taking Wesley's position, why shouldn't the State, when it gets back to the Stumpf case before the remaining two members of the panel, have to fish or cut bait on a position and say we think he's the triggerman and we want you to affirm on that basis, or we don't think he was the triggerman because we've taken this other position? Why can the State, as a matter of due process, stand there agnostic?",
  "Well, they didn't have to take it as true. As I understand it, when they went back before the -- the two original judges on the motion to vacate, they didn't have to take the -- the testimony about the jailhouse admission as true, and they didn't have to take the State's position at the Wesley trial as true. It was evidence. It was before them. They were in -- they were required to consider it. But as I understand it, the State at that point essentially was -- was agnostic. The State said, you know, this is what happened, this is what we said, this is what the jury did in the second trial, but regardless of how you determine -- of -- of any determination about triggerman, this man Stumpf still deserves death, so don't vacate the sentence. And -- and there was nothing I guess -- number one, there doesn't seem to be at that point a -- a problem with the State taking inconsistent positions, i.e., with its position in -- in the -- in the Wesley case, and there doesn't seem to be any -- any lack of candor. There may be a -- a lack of initiative on the State's part to fish or cut bait, but there's no lack of candor. So where does the due process violation come at that point?",
  "But it -- I mean, that -- that statement is true, I take it.",
  "Mr. Freedman, you've -- you've argued just a second ago that both of the appellate courts decided the case or went through so-called reweighing on a false premise that he had pleaded guilty to being the shooter. Let me go back to the -- to the two remaining members of the original trial panel. I take it they did not make that -- in your judgment that error.",
  "Yes. Let me -- let me ask you what your position would be if a hypothetical Justice Kennedy suggested earlier in the argument were true. What if the State had gone back at the -- at the hearing before the original two in response to the motion to vacate and had said, we did argue in the Wesley case that he was the triggerman? The jury rejected that argument. They found that -- that he was not. We've -- we've learned from -- from our own experience and -- and we now no longer think that -- that the evidence from the jailhouse informant should be accepted. We're back to the position that we took in the -- at the Stumpf sentencing hearing originally, that - - that he was the triggerman. If the State had taken that position, would you have a due process claim?",
  "I'm -- I'm not getting it. What do you mean?",
  "Well, can't they -- can't they profit from the jury's verdict?",
  "Okay. He didn't receive the - - the death penalty. What would his argument be with respect to guilt or innocence? It seems to me that the issue only goes to penalty.",
  "But that's Stumpf's case.",
  "Yes. So I mean - -",
  "I don't see where Wesley - -",
  "So -- so Wesley would have neither a -- a due process claim with respect to sentence nor with respect to guilt.",
  "I -- I thought the -- the specific intent element would be satisfied if -- if they, by plan, went to the scene with -- with deadly weapons.",
  "You -- you mean at the hearing on the motion to vacate.",
  "Well, Mr. Rosenkranz - -",
  "Do you agree then that at whatever period, however you want to describe the period, at which the researcher is basically trying to figure out what drug to concentrate on, that that period is too far back in time to come within the exception?",
  "Okay, here's what -- here's the problem I have with your argument. I can understand that argument more easily under the statute, under the text of the statute as it is written, than I can understand it under the instruction that you agreed to, because the instruction that you agreed to had a limitation, a textual limitation which is not in the statute itself, that refers to \"relatively directly\" as describing the relationship between this information and its object. And if we decide this case on the basis of the statute, and we read the statute more broadly than the instruction, then you're getting something that you're not entitled to, because you agreed to the instruction. If we decide this issue by construing the statute as if your instruction is correct, then we're making an assumption about the proper construction of the statute that has not been argued here.",
  "It seems to me that the law of the case, as to what the statute means for your case, is set by the instruction, and that is why I am reluctant to get into the issue that you raise here, because I think we're rather -- you are limited, and we are tied in what we can do as a result of your agreement with the instruction.",
  "Is that going to be your third point, the third error that the court supposedly committed?",
  "What are you - -",
  "What are you reading from?",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay, that talks about the primary concern. There is certainly going to be concern with efficacy to this extent. They are going to want to know, before they allow clinical trials, whether the drug that it is proposed to give cancer patients has some relationship to cancer, as opposed to the common cold. Admittedly, at the clinical trial they're trying to find out how effective it is on human beings, but there's got to be some threshold showing of effectiveness. They can't simply ignore effectiveness and look at safety entirely prior to that point.",
  "But there is at least - - there's got to be some way to tell whether it even addresses the disease. That is essentially a threshold effectiveness question.",
  "Congress described the need that there be some relationship between the consequences of taking the given drug and the disease which is supposed to be addressed by taking the drug. If they didn't use the word \"efficacy,\" what word did they use?",
  "In the real world, do we have such cases?",
  "Another real-world question. Do we -- do we have any -- do you have any experience that you can rely on either to show that in fact these subsection (h) claims are brought customarily with the main qui tam action or, conversely, that they are brought separately? Do we know what's going on?",
  "No, but isn't -- isn't Justice Ginsburg's question raised by your very argument, that you don't want whistleblowers having to bring their whistleblower actions before they are ready to bring their main actions? And if it's going to take -- you've just said how difficult it may be to prepare one of these qui tam cases. If in fact you're right and it may take a couple of years from the time the employer gets wind that something is going on and fires or does whatever, then in exactly that situation, the -- the whistleblower damages are going to be mounting during that period of 1 or 2 or whatever years it may be before the qui tam action starts. So on your hypothesis, it seems to me, you're going to get just the situation that Justice Ginsburg raised.",
  "Well, let's -- let's first see about your argument. Isn't that what your argument implies?",
  "Well, he's already alerted to the extent that he's taking retaliatory action as true. He may not whole -- know the -- the whole extent of -- of what the employee knows, but he's already been tipped off.",
  "Well, wouldn't -- I'm -- I'm sorry.",
  "Wouldn't your position be different if he had been advised that he had exactly the right that you claim he has, and the court said, however, in Michigan you may not enter the -- the plea unless you waive that right? If -- if you don't want to waive that right, which I've just explained to you, we'll -- we'll have a trial. Would -- would your answer still be that - - that waiver would be as a matter of law impossible?",
  "So that ultimately your case rests not on equal protection but due process.",
  "But it's one as much as the other, isn't it?",
  "I mean, you're -- we're saying if you're going to provide a first appeal of right, one incident of that is, as a matter of due process, you've got to provide counsel.",
  "You're -- you're saying that the due process is what gets you beyond the stage of merely providing counsel as a matter of grace. That's what due process does for you. Because they have to provide counsel not merely as a matter of grace, you have a very clear equal protection case which you would not otherwise have. Isn't -- isn't that the way the two work together?",
  "In any case - -",
  "So, in effect, it's discretionary in the sense that it's discretionary as to whether to give it full-dress treatment, but the bottom line, whether they give it full dress or -- or merely discretionary denial is -- is an implication on the merits.",
  "Well, I mean, wouldn't we have to conclude that if we're going to apply the same standards here that we usually do in -- in the plea waiver situation? I mean, we -- the -- the classic point of it all is the knowing -- the -- the intelligent, voluntary waiver of a known right. And leaving aside the equal protection problem here, even if we didn't have that, I don't see that there would be -- have been an adequate waiver here because he was never told that he had the right that he now claims as a matter of due process. You indeed, dispute it.",
  "But unless he were told that, the -- the waiver that -- that depends upon parsing the difference between must and may in the two paragraphs of explanation certainly wouldn't be taken as the predicate for a waiver of a known right.",
  "Well, the -- the appeal of his right -- the appeal as of right point, as I understand it, is a different point. What they're getting at there is it will be discretionary with the reviewing court whether your case is reviewed on the merits on some point if you ask for it. We're here dealing with the right to counsel, and it seems to me unless he were told that he had the right to counsel that he claims and he then waived it, that there wouldn't be a -- an -- an adequate waiver under Boykin.",
  "Are you going on -- on record as saying that Michigan does not and will not, in the United States courts, claim any AEDPA deference as a result of one of these determinations?",
  "And you have not been -- and - - and Michigan lawyers have not been advancing that claim in the district courts?",
  "So, so far as you can tell, that's the way it's been.",
  "Well, that was the same court, though, wasn't it?",
  "But what -- what about preclusion on other courts?",
  "In litigation in other courts. They -- did -- did they ever say there is no claim or issue preclusion in other courts as a result of -- of our denials?",
  "And any -- any court, I mean, in -- in theory, can -- can revise its own -- its own opinions. But the -- I mean, we look to preclusion really on -- on the effect of the judgment in another court, and I take it they have not ruled on that.",
  "May -- may I ask you one thing lest we forget it? Is -- is your argument premised on the assumption that a refusal to hear an appeal is -- is not regarded as a determination on the merits and thus preclusive?",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "No. But I'm asking whether that's a premise of your argument because the consequences of your argument are going to be very different depending on whether that is the premise or whether it isn't, whether that premise is true or whether it isn't.",
  "So your -- the assumption of your argument is that it is not on the merits. I.e., it is not a merits determination if there's a denial and hence there is no preclusion.",
  "Okay. Counsel, what -- that - - that brings me to a question that I don't understand about your argument. It seems to me you're biting off more than you have to bite off here. Would you win on the following argument? And I will tell you in advance that it looks to me as though you would. But maybe there's some reason you're not making it. Number one, your statute of limitations claim is not the kind of claim that AEDPA is concerned with when it deals with limits on second and successive petitions. Number two, although a statute of limitations issue is on the merits, it is not on the merits in the second or successive petition category. In this case, you don't have to worry about making a -- an -- an AEDPA end run so far as second or successive goes, and therefore, 60(b) can be used simply not as a wide-open door, but as a door that could be opened when your claim is a claim about a rule that barred you from getting into Federal court, which is what the statute of limitations rule does. That's all you're asking for.",
  "And finally, you have an extraordinary situation here because you have a later determination in Artuz which declared the law not as a change in the law, but as what the law presumably meant from day one. As I understand it, if we accepted that argument, you would win. Do you agree?",
  "Then why don't you make that argument?",
  "No, but your -- your immediate concern is how do I get into a Federal court. Whether you win or lose once you get in there is another problem, but I -- as I understand it, that's not what we're dealing with here. And -- and the -- you -- you were kept out of the district court on a statute of limitations issue. If you can say -- if you argue all I've got in front of you, us, is a statute of limitations issue, that's all I want under -- to raise under 60(b) and I have an extraordinary claim here because of the subsequent Artuz decision, that will get you into Federal court, if we accept that argument. Whether -- whether you win or lose, once you get there, I don't know, and I don't know that that's before us.",
  "Well, that depends - -",
  "Okay. But his -- his whole argument is you, State, get exactly what you're entitled to if I win on 60(b) because what I was entitled to and what you were entitled to was the 1-year statute but subject to the rule in Artuz. That's all you get, State. And what he is saying is, I want to get back into court so that I can have the statute of limitations -- the benefit of the statute of limitations as Artuz construed it. That means you, State, get what you want and I get my one chance. How is that an open door to the abuse that you're talking about?",
  "He got what Artuz said was an erroneous view of the statute of limitations.",
  "And do you -- do you think that there is -- that there is this -- this sort of tidal wave of -- of erroneous statute of limitations determinations that, if Artuz is applied, will suddenly be coming 5, 10, and 20 years into Federal court? I mean, it -- it -- your argument, in relation to his particular claim seems exaggerated.",
  "You -- you were there for the purpose of getting him booted out. I mean, you didn't - - you didn't get into the merits of anything.",
  "If there had been an Artuz violation and not every statute of limitations determination implicates Artuz.",
  "Well, what -- what Congress was principally concerned with -- Congress was concerned with two things. It was concerned with second and successive. That's not what is before us. Congress was also concerned with a 1-year statute of limitations. What is before us on that point is that this guy did not get the benefit of the statute of limitations that he had a right to get the benefit of, that there was a flat mistake of law. So by -- by recognizing his statute of limitations claim, we do not open the door to second and successive litigation. We open the door simply to Artuz problems on statute of limitations rulings and that's a pretty narrow category it seems to me.",
  "Sure. Sure, he does. And if it's second and successive, he's going to get thrown out again.",
  "You may -- you may be right, but that's what district courts are there for.",
  "Well, maybe --",
  "-- maybe the district court shouldn't have done that, but whatever -- whatever was wrong there, it was merely a classic application of -- of review of a statute of limitations point. There -- there was much else involved and maybe it was improper. My question, I guess, is why do you say that the -- why do you assume that the policy animating applying 60(b) to a gatekeeping issue like statute of limitations, where there is an unusual circumstance as in Artuz, should be the same policy that animates applying 60(b), let's say, when there is an attempt to -- to make an end run around the second and successive rules? The latter I think we can all understand pretty readily. I mean, it's very important. You've got the - - the -- AEDPA if you allow that. With respect to this kind of a statute of limitations problem, what the guy is asking for is what he was entitled to under AEDPA as a matter of timing and gatekeeping. Why is the policy under 60(b) the same in those two cases?",
  "Well, it -- it does for trucks that want to deliver things within the State of Michigan. It doesn't for anybody else.",
  "It would have that -- it certainly has that tendency. Do we have -- do we know in fact what the effect is? Is it deterring anybody? How many trucks does it affect?",
  "Well, it's not so much that you necessarily can do it, but it -- it sort of interrupts the -- the kind of the a priori reasoning and you're thrown back on a -- on -- on a practical effects analysis under Pike.",
  "Do -- do I understand that the two distinctions in what is done with the -- or the way the fee is collected and what's done with it is that the -- the fee is charged against the -- is it the operator as opposed to the owner, if there is a distinction? Is -- is that correct?",
  "The carrier.",
  "That's the term I should use.",
  "Which may not be the owner. And number two, as I understand it, as distinct from the registration fee, this fee goes to a different State department. Is that right?",
  "Now, let -- that's -- that's a premise for a question I want to ask you, and the question is in economic effect, is there any difference really between charging this $100 fee with those differences from the registration fee and simply jacking up the registration fee by $100? Would there -- would there be any economic difference to the -- to the public or -- or indeed even to the carriers if they simply jacked up the -- the registration fee by $100? Because the -- the registration fee is passed on to the carrier, if it's not the owner, and the carrier -- it doesn't make any difference to the carrier whether the -- whether the State diverts the $100 up front or -- or divides the -- the registration fee after it's paid. So is there any economic difference?",
  "No, but that shows -- that -- maybe I don't understand. That -- that tells us what happens to the money after it's paid, but it doesn't make any difference to the person who is paying the money, does it?",
  "Except that he only has to pay in one place, and -- and if they - -",
  "-- increase the registration fee, he'd only have to pay in one place, once.",
  "Sure, but it -- so -- so regardless of what Michigan does with the apportioned amounts, the amount it charges to the -- to the owner, in the case of the -- the plating fee, is -- is simply set by the State of Michigan.",
  "Yes.",
  "So what -- and -- and the - - the virtue of the apportionment is that the -- that the owner or the -- or the owner, I guess in this case, does not have to pay fees in 49 other States.",
  "But he doesn't -- it doesn't matter to -- that's the value to him. It doesn't matter to him how they apportion whatever that fee is that Michigan charges.",
  "But who -- I mean, is -- that's -- that's fine as a matter of administration, but in terms of the -- the end effect on the person who has to pay it and on the consumers to whom it is ultimately passed on, what difference does it make?",
  "Okay. What if he said $20 instead of $10?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay, but what -- what if the State says, you can enter -- enter into interstate activities for nothing? We're simply going to increase the registration fee by $100. Couldn't the State do that?",
  "So this is pure formalism.",
  "Well, the computation is vehicle-specific, but you're using all the vehicles as hostage for the payment of -- of any shortfall. That's what you're doing, isn't it?",
  "And -- and anyone can choose to do that? I mean, going back to Justice Breyer's example, anybody can say, well, I think I'd like to be plated in Michigan even though I operate in -- in other States. My principal place of business is in another State.",
  "No. I'm just asking about what you do in Michigan.",
  "You really can do that?",
  "You -- you can plate your whole fleet in Michigan under those circumstances.",
  "Where does it say earlier?",
  "And the court can -- can extend it or -- or in fact truncate it, can't it?",
  "What -- what if the court then -- I'm -- let me just get to -- and I think this is consistent with Justice Breyer's question. What if the court, at the -- at the point cert was denied and rehearing was denied, simply said, I -- we're now operating under (b) and we're extending the time?",
  "Oh. That's -- that's what it did, but what if the court had -- had been more articulate about what -- what it -- it was doing or may have been doing and -- and simply said -- at the moment at which the -- the rehearing period expired for cert, said, all right, we're still not issuing the mandate and we're operating under subsection (b), we're extending the time. Would - - is -- is there anything in the rule that, at least in terms, would have precluded the court from doing that if it had said that?",
  "But wasn't the --",
  "Well, that -- that may be but the -- the fact that this sort of evidence would ultimately be kept out from the court of appeals and ultimately from the district court may be a very good reason for us not to adopt your analysis that what happened here is the equivalent of a mandate issuing and a mandate being recalled. It may be a very good reason to prefer a different analysis.",
  "We -- we don't have to conclude why it was not presented. All we have to be concerned with or what, I think, we have to be concerned with is this. Is this very important evidence? The answer is yes. It may not go to eligibility, but it's very significant. Number two, if we accept your Calderon analysis, this evidence will be kept out forever. If it's that important, that may be a good reason not to accept your Calderon analysis and say if the mandate hasn't issued, it hasn't issued.",
  "That's -- that's my point and -- and you may want to respond to that.",
  "And I take it you also recognize that the bridge that we did not cross in Calderon was -- was in answering the question whether - - in a case in which a court does not issue the mandate, we are going to construe the court's authority, its -- its discretion narrowly or broadly. And that is the issue before us here, isn't it?",
  "Were -- were those cases in which they issued an order saying what they were doing? I.e., we extend under (b)?",
  "Isn't that satisfied at least by the part of the definition that refers to \"subverting an official proceeding\"? I mean, that certainly carries, to me, the implication that you realize that you're doing something wrong. An official proceeding is, prima facie at least, lawful, and you are subverting it. Doesn't that satisfy the \"knowingly\" requirement?",
  "-- I think I would go far in agreeing with you if the -- if the instruction had been \"merely to impede\" or \"merely to undermine.\" Now, I guess that gets to a question I wanted somebody to answer, and you can probably do it. Did the -- did the Court, in giving the instructions, ever refer -- in defining the term, ever refer to any of these three possibilities, separately, or did it do it simply as \"subvert, undermine, or\" -- what was the third? -- impede\"?",
  "Okay. It did --",
  "I -- one other question. In anticipation of that instruction -- I assume the counsel new what was coming -- did the Government ever argue to the jury that \"merely impeding,\" alone, or \"merely undermining,\" alone, would be sufficient, as distinct from saying, \"If he subverts, undermines, and impedes\"?",
  "There were, involving Enron, at that point, isn't that correct? The -- Enron had gotten the letter?",
  "Wasn't -- wasn't that instruction, itself, undermined by what I understand to be the instruction that good-faith belief in the legality of what was being done was no defense? I mean, if you had an instruction that depended upon the word \"subvert,\" I could -- I could understand your argument. But it seems to me that the difficulty with your argument, and the difficulty with your answer to Justice Breyer, is that it went beyond \"subvert\" to merely \"impede,\" and it included an instruction that good faith was no defense.",
  "I don't see why it doesn't. I mean, there's no grammatical break.",
  "Well, it's certainly --",
  "I mean, I will -- I will grant you that the definition that the Government asked for, and got, for \"corruptly persuades,\" does have that implication, so far as the \"subvert\" prong is concerned. But when you get beyond the \"subvert\" prong, and you get down to the third one, \"merely to impede,\" you're getting pretty thin, so far as the -- as the implication of knowledge of wrongdoing is concerned, and you've still go the problem of the instruction that negated good faith is a defense.",
  "Why did -- if that is so, why did you need it? In other words, you had a -- you had a pattern instruction, apparently, that was -- that was keyed to \"subversion,\" which I think would be an easy argument for you. If the addition of \"impede\" really wasn't adding that much, why did you ask the Court to put it in there?",
  "Why --",
  "-- why isn't the answer to your argument that the requirement in (b) -- \"knowingly\" requirement in (b) doesn't travel all the way down through the series, but it travels at least as far as \"corruptly persuades\"?",
  "No, but we know it --",
  "-- applies to something at the beginning of the series. It's got -- it's got some work to do. You've made an argument that it doesn't apply, or it would be logically absurd to apply it, to something at the end of the series, and we're somewhere in the middle. And why isn't the answer to your argument simply to say, \"Okay, it doesn't travel all the way to the end, but it travels up to the end, and it travels as far as this\"?",
  "Well, it is if we don't accept the continuous workday rule. If we do accept the continuous workday rule, why isn't it, in effect, the premise from which the conclusion for the other side falls?",
  "No, but your argument -­",
  "-- assumes that there is only one actual place. And their argument, which is consistent with the text of the statute, is that there may be more than one principal activity, and hence, more than one place. And if the -- if the place of donning and doffing is such a place, then wouldn't it be at least administratively odd to apply the continuous workday rule immediately to exclude some walking time that follows that?",
  "So, you're saying that -­",
  "-- so-called \"integral activities\" are not principal activities.",
  "\"Or activities.\"",
  "But you're saying -­",
  "No, no, I didn't mean -­ finish.",
  "No, but isn't your -- in the answer that you just gave, and an answer which you have, in fact, consistently repeated, inconsistent with Steiner -- Steiner didn't say there is a separate category of integral activities. Steiner said that activities which are integral are part of the principal activity. And isn't your argument premised on denying that identity?",
  "Could you give us a collateral consequence? I mean that is -­",
  "I take it you then agree that the answer for which you argue here follows not merely from the text of 4(a), but the text of 4(a) plus a continuous -- some variety of a continuous workday rule.",
  "You've got to have both.",
  "Yes.",
  "But you don't -- but you don't get the answer from simply the text itself.",
  "Mr. Olson, may I ask you to go one step beyond that on an issue of fact that I just don't understand from reading the briefs? Let me give you three quick quotations. First, the court of appeals opinion contains this statement, \"An expert on behalf of the tribe reported that basic economic theory teaches that the nation's station cannot charge prices high enough to allow collection of both the Kansas and the nation's fuel taxes.\" The red brief says, on page 8, \"It is undisputed that enforcing the State tax on fuel sold and delivered to the station would effectively nullify the tribal fuel tax.\" Finally, the yellow brief, on page 13, says, \"By selling its fuel at market prices, respondent\" -- the tribe -- \"is making both a profit and collecting a tax.\" My question is, Do we know, from the record, whether the tax that is assessed on the distributor is, in fact, passed through to the tribe so that, in economic effect, the tribe is collecting, via pass-through, the State tax and imposing its own tax and still selling at market prices?",
  "But if -- if I may interrupt you -- if it's getting passed through, and they're still selling their gas, then there's no -- then the tribe cannot make an argument here that their sovereign taxing authority is being compromised or threatened. And the argument, basically, would boil down to the argument that they want to make a bigger profit.",
  "Yeah.",
  "Yeah.",
  "May I go back to one factual nuance on that? Apart from legal incidence, somebody mentioned earlier that the tax would not necessarily be payable until, in fact, the gasoline was distributed to the retailer. Is that correct?",
  "But isn't that a surrogate for sale to the -- well, I guess what I'm getting at, the tax apparently is not payable when the distributor receives the fuel, but only when the distributor transfers the fuel to a retailer.",
  "No?",
  "Well, why would he be drawing it down, except to sell -­",
  "Yeah.",
  "Is it collecting that tax?",
  "Then what's its gripe? It wants a bigger profit? It wants to increase -­",
  "-- the taxation?",
  "No, but if --",
  "-- if the tribe is collecting -- it's assuming that -- if the tribe is collecting its tax, and it does not have a claim to greater taxation or greater profit, then how is its sovereign right as a taxing authority being interfered with?",
  "Loss of profit -­",
  "-- as an entrepreneur.",
  "Well, isn't -- I mean, isn't that necessarily the case? If it's collecting all of its tax, then what it's complaining about is that it's getting less profit as the -- as the retailer.",
  "All right. Then is that an issue that we should consider on a question of preemption which arises from the tribe's assertion of sovereignty?",
  "Well, in other words -­",
  "-- should we, in effect, say there is no distinction between the tribe's position as sovereign and the tribe's position as retail gasoline- seller.",
  "Well, they're similar, because it -- ultimately, it's all going into the same pocket. We realize that. But, unless there is a claim that its taxing authority, as such, is being threatened or interfered with, I don't quite see why a preemption theory that rests upon tribal sovereignty has any place in the analysis.",
  "But it's not operating at a loss.",
  "And your view generally was that it was -- that it was indicative of discrimination.",
  "And I thought that was the stronger argument, because the -- you're saying, \"Look, the State has only the most trivial interest in the amount of taxation it would get here.\" That would be equally true whether it forgives taxes that -- on fuel that goes to the United States or not. But the discrimination point, if it's a fair one, would be the same.",
  "Is it being interfered with?",
  "Well, that expert opinion is that, as an economic matter, you can't collect both.",
  "You can't impose both. But the tribe is still imposing its tax, and it's getting every penny that it -- that it purports to impose.",
  "Is -­",
  "-- is that -­",
  "-- in the record?",
  "Let's assume -- let's assume that is true. What difference does that make to an analysis based on a preemption theory which is supposed to take account of tribal sovereignty? The sovereign act is not selling gas, it's taxing. They are taxing. They're getting everything they want under their tax statute. Where, then, is there a basis for a preemption -­",
  "No, I mean, it was -­",
  "-- an entirely separate -- an entirely separate rationale. It was saying the tribe is getting this tremendous advantage by -- or wants this tremendous advantage -- by marketing the exemption.",
  "Well, maybe -- maybe it contemplated that, and maybe it simply contemplated that that particular -- that particular argument against it -- i.e., that it was simply selling a tax exemption -- would not have been an argument against it. But it doesn't follow, from that, that the tribe would necessarily have had a winning argument on a preemption theory.",
  "I take it Kansas has not indicted the distributor for failing to register under the Indian Trading Statute.",
  "Does the -­",
  "Does the statute -- does the Federal statute specifically authorize doctors to do this? Or does it simply say that convicts may be executed by lethal injection?",
  "No, but the method may simply be lethal injection. And, going back to Justice O'Connor's question, it might still be the case that, on the theory the Government is advancing this morning, it would be unlawful for a doctor to engage in that, because that was, in fact, not within the limits of the practice of medicine, the doctor was using a controlled substance for something outside the practice of medicine, and hence, it would be illegal.",
  "But I take it Congress did not refer specifically to -- or did not include a specific authorization of doctors, so that we'd have to do a little construction to get to your point.",
  "Well, they say -­",
  "-- that, in practical terms, that is exactly what it does, because the only way they can administer their law sensibly is by using these kinds of drugs, scheduled drugs.",
  "Well, did he use -­",
  "-- did he use a controlled substance?",
  "No, but -­",
  "-- that was a clear act of Congress. I mean, Congress had made that decision, and it was unmistakable. It seems to me that the problem that you have, with your reference back to the Harrison Act and the 90 years of regulation, is that the 90 years of regulation was regulation for the purpose of stopping drug pushing and drug abuse, in the conventional sense. And to say that a statute -- or a statutory history taken into consideration in determining the scope of this statute, with that kind of a history, can support a view that suddenly the Attorney General of the United States is given, in effect, the sole authority to determine whether any State may or may not authorize assisted suicide, and may do so in a way that any other Attorney General can flip back and forth -- as has happened in this case, if Attorney General Reno was wrong -- seems to me a kind of argument from history that simply cuts against you, because it leads to a sort of a bizarre result. I mean, what is your response to that?",
  "Well, and I -- as I said, it seems to me that your 91 years of history say that the end that Congress had in mind was to stop drug pushing and stop conventional drug abuse. It didn't have any more -- there's no indication that I know of that Congress had assisted suicide in mind, any more than it had the administration of the death penalty in mind.",
  "Suicide is a result of the kind of dementia that comes from drug abuse. That is not suicide under the circumstances that we're talking about within the limits of the Oregon law.",
  "Yeah, but even in your example, the concern of Congress is with the use of the drug to hurt people who do not understand that they're going to be hurt, and don't want to be hurt, and perhaps, in your example, the use of the drug to facilitate the violation of the law, that seems to me worlds away from what we're talking about here.",
  "But are you saying, in response to the Chief Justice's question, that, in fact, Congress, itself, could not explicitly pass a statute that says, \"No State, through its doctors or otherwise, may authorize the use of morphine\" -­",
  "All right. So, you're not making a -­",
  "-- constitutional -­",
  "-- argument. You're sticking to your statutory argument.",
  "Okay.",
  "But I take it you would agree that, in effect, all you need to win on the statutory argument is for us to accept the premise that Congress may very well have intended to interfere with the practice of medicine and to authorize the Attorney General to do it, insofar as the practice of medicine would have gutted the statute -- e.g., doctors who prescribe recreational drugs, doctors who, in effect, cater to pushers -- but that Congress did not intend to go any further than that in authorizing interference with the practice of medicine. I take it you agree that if we accepted that premise, that would be sufficient for you in this case.",
  "Okay.",
  "That's where I am not understanding your argument. There is an IEP in all of these cases. I would understand your argument if the State -- the school district said, \"We're not going to educate this kid. Throw him into the pot with everybody else. We won't give you an IEP.\" That's not what we've got here. And, in fact, if that's what we had here, the burden-of-proof issue would be of no significance, because the State -- the parents would walk in, and the only thing they'd have to do to satisfy \"a\" burden of proof would be to say, \"They didn't come up with an IEP.\"",
  "Instead, what we have here is a fight about whether it's a good IEP or no IEP.",
  "Then -­",
  "-- then we're arguing about words.",
  "The State is not saying, \"We will not come up with an IEP.\" The State is saying, \"This is what we're going to give you,\" and the parents say, \"It's not good enough.\"",
  "In an -- in an equal- partnership argument, nobody's got the burden of proof.",
  "Do you know what the -­",
  "-- do you know what the figure is per hearing?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, no. You divide the number of hearings by the figure you've just mentioned, and that's the result. Have you -- have you done -­",
  "-- the arithmetic?",
  "Three- -­",
  "Well, I thought (b) simply enacted a special necessary condition when you had a local defendant. I thought it was not an eligibility provision. I thought it was a limitation provision.",
  "Well, it's consistent with it, but I -- it seems to me that it's a bit of a stretch to say that anyone who is properly joined and served, at least in a formal sense, is, therefore, the only person who may be considered in a -- in a diversity inquiry.",
  "But the -- it sounds to me -- if I understood your answer correctly, you're talking about cases in which the named party citizenship is disregarded.",
  "Where the question is, Should an unnamed party citizenship \"be\" regarded?",
  "Yeah, but he didn't come in to defend; you pulled him in to defend.",
  "And the problem that I have with your position is, I don't know of anything in the record that indicates that he wasn't ready to defend, that he wouldn't have -- or it wasn't ready to defend, that it wouldn't have paid the judgment, that you could have -- could not have gotten, from the party you named, all the relief that you were asking for.",
  "Okay. But so far as the Fourth Circuit -- tell me if I'm wrong here -- it sounds to me that the Fourth Circuit took the following position, that for purposes of determining diversity, it is not enough to name a principal who may be liable for the acts of subsidiaries, without naming the subsidiary, or, if you name a -- I'm mixing up principal and corporation --",
  "-- principal and -- corporate parent and subsidiary, or principal and business agent. And I don't know of any rule to the effect that, for diversity purposes, a plaintiff simply cannot choose to sue the parent, or to sue the principal.",
  "Okay. Where would I be wrong?",
  "But the failure of the burden of proof is apparently a function of the Fourth Circuit's assumption that if you sue the parent, you have a duty to negate the possibility of suing any subsidiary; or if you sue the principal, you have an obligation to negate the possibility of suing any agent. And I don't see where that comes, except out of the sky somewhere.",
  "So, everything turned on the nominal-party finding.",
  "On the nominal-party assumption.",
  "But if the Fourth Circuit is wrong on nominal party, that's the end of the case for your side.",
  "No, but the burden-of- proof issue, as you've just answered my question, does not arise until the Fourth Circuit finds that Lincoln is a nominal party. And if, in fact, that conclusion is incorrect, then there's no burden-of- proof issue that has -- or no burden of proof that has not been satisfied.",
  "Isn't the difficulty with that argument that that, at least, is not the way the jury was instructed in this case? As I understand it, the -- and I don't have it in front of me, but I looked when I was going through the briefs -- the jury was instructed to consider the special circumstance, or -stances, as such. They were not instructed that, \"You will simply consider the facts that underlay whatever conclusion you drew at the -- at the earliest stage about special circumstances.\" They are instructed to consider special circumstances.",
  "As such. I mean --",
  "-- it calls them special circumstances, right?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well --",
  "-- well, that may be an argument for the way we have looked at special circumstances, is as something -- as factors that do carry a special weight, but I don't see any reason to differentiate the instruction to consider special circumstances here from the instructions in law to consider eligibility factors in other States, which we have called \"weighing\" States.",
  "Well, I --",
  "-- I know what you're saying, because, in California, you've got a long list of other things, and you're entirely right. But, as I understand it, in the States that we have classified as \"weighing\" States, the juries were not -- were not strictly limited, on the aggravating side, to consider only the special circumstances or the aggravating factors, as they have been previously defined; they could consider other things. And that's the case here. So, I don't see how we can draw a categorical distinction between California's situation and that of States we've called \"weighing\" States.",
  "I thought in --",
  "-- I thought in Mississippi they could take into consideration other facts.",
  "In this case --",
  "You're --",
  "Right.",
  "Well, but don't --",
  "-- don't we assume that the court follows California law on the -- on the burden? And isn't it clear that, under California law, the burden is on the defendant?",
  "I know there is no discussion of burden. But when there is no discussion of burden, isn't the reasonable assumption for us to make, as a reviewing Court, the assumption that the California Supreme Court followed its own law, and its own law is that the burden is on the defendant?",
  "Okay, but aren't we in, sort of, the converse situation here? There isn't any question about the admissibility of evidence that shouldn't otherwise have come in. I thought your argument here is: the error proceeds from the fact that, by using this label -- by referring to the circumstance as a \"special circumstance,\" having been found at the eligibility stage -- that circumstance, and all the evidence that might support it, is given extra weight, and that's where the thumb on the scale comes. Isn't that your point here?",
  "But that's what I thought I was trying to say. I mean, am I getting it wrong? Because this is the --",
  "-- time to correct me, if I am.",
  "No, but isn't -- I want to throw you a suggestion -- isn't the answer to that problem that anything may be considered as mitigating evidence, but a mitigating factor is a conclusion that evidence has a certain significance, and not everything may be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor? Isn't -- the problem that Justice Scalia raises addressed by distinguishing between evidence -- consider it all -- and factors, a characterization of evidence which may not necessarily be considered.",
  "Yes. Yes. Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. Yes. I misspoke. But, I mean, the distinction between \"evidence\" and \"factor\" is the -- is the key, isn't it?",
  "All right. That means the answer to my question is yes, right?",
  "Okay.",
  "And that was correct under the law, wasn't it? In other words, \"special circumstance\" means the same thing when it's referred to -- the term means the same thing when it's referred to in the statute on selection as it means in the statute on eligibility.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, that's -- I mean, I can see - -",
  "Counsel, you've made the point that if we go the Ninth Circuit way, every time an employee gets in Dutch there's a potential first amendment issue. Why hasn't that been a problem since 1988 in the Ninth Circuit? I think 1988 was the year of the Circuit's Roth decision. So, we haven't seen a deluge, and doesn't that rather discount your argument?",
  "No.",
  "I realize that, but that -- as I understand it, that has been true since the Ninth Circuit's Roth decision in 1988. And apparently we have not seen a deluge of these claims, or we would have had citations to the cases. So, doesn't that rather discount the concern that you express?",
  "But didn't -- maybe I'm wrong on my assumption, but didn't the Ninth Circuit take that position, back in 1988?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, but how do we know that? We're at summary judgment.",
  "No, I realize that, but where do you -- how do you infer, from that, that the individual, the employee, was not telling the truth?",
  "If - -",
  "-- if I - -",
  "-- if my ethical record amounted to a lie every time I made a -- an inaccurate prediction about what a court was going to do when I was a young lawyer, I would have had a very short career.",
  "And that seems to me as much as you can infer from what this individual did.",
  "Oh. Oh. Okay.",
  "So, we don't - -",
  "-- we don't know why it didn't pan out the way he said it was going to, and we don't know that he was -- that he was lying.",
  "Okay.",
  "Is that - -",
  "-- is that true in this case? I realize they didn't get to it on summary judgment, but is that true in this case with respect to a Brady disclosure?",
  "What if -- what if the lawyer simply believes that he has an ethical obligation to make the disclosure, and he makes it, and he is then subject to retaliation? No first amendment claim on his part?",
  "Well, does that mean -- what's your answer to my question? If he makes the Brady disclosure because he believes that is an ethical obligation, and he is then subject to retaliation, does he have a first amendment claim, or not?",
  "Do you -- let me ask you this -- do you propose drawing the line -- or at least drawing a line in some circumstances this way: That, at step one, if it can be concluded that a private communication between the employer and the employee would have constituted the discharge of the employee's assigned work -- so that it would have been within the scope of his employment, and, therefore, not subject to Pickering balancing, if he had made the statement to the employer -- that, therefore, the statement cannot be regarded as a statement of public interest, even if he had disclosed it publicly, or if he took a further step and went to the bar association and whatnot?",
  "But if it is within -- I'm sorry, but if it -- if it is within the speaker's assigned duties as an employee, does that preclude a conclusion, later on, that he was speaking as a citizen, even if he goes public with it?",
  "So, we do have, then, the problem that Justice Stevens has raised.",
  "What if he does let the employer try first, and the employer does nothing, then he goes public? Where does the Pickering balance come out then?",
  "But that does - -",
  "-- that does mean that potentially -- as the Government says, potentially every case is at least going to get as far as summary judgment in court.",
  "Okay, do - -",
  "-- do we know how many cases of this sort there are?",
  "Yeah.",
  "Yeah.",
  "Over what - -",

  "In - -",
  "-- in all of the circuits - -",
  "-- that follow a ninth-circuit kind of rule?",
  "When you say that it may be relevant, are you thinking of 2680(a)? Because 2680(a) says, you know, if you exercise due care, any act that you take in the -- in -- well, let's use the exact language -- \"any act or omission in the execution of a statute or regulation will not be a ground of liability,\" with -- at least leaving open the door that any failure to take steps that would have been reasonable in executing it might be. Is that why you answered Justice Stevens as you did?",

  "Right.",
  "Oh, I could -- I could --",
  "-- I could understand that if they -- it would be an easier question for me if the statute said, \"Even if you violate the statute, if you otherwise use reasonable care, no liability.\" But here, it talks about reasonable care when you are -- when you are, in the statutory phrase, in the execution of the statute, which suggests to me you're not violating the statute, you're not violating any standard. So, what function does it serve?",
  "So, it's really - -",

  "No, but you've - -",
  "-- you've still answered my question. I mean, you're -- you have said, \"Assuming that the individual is executing the statute, there is no deficiency in the performance of executing the statute. There is still this function.\" And I think I understand your answer. But, I mean, I think Justice Scalia's point is correct, it may apply in cases in which you are purporting to act under the statute, but you omit actions that you should take. In other words, your performance is deficient. And there, the answer is easier, because it says as long as you're exercising due care, no liability.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "It does.",
  "Okay, who's your -- what's your best analog?",
  "Whom does he work for? Do mines hire these people, or does he work for the liability carrier, which I would have expected? I mean, if we're going to make the kind of suggestion that Justice Breyer says maybe we ought to make, we ought to have something in mind. And is it -- is it the -- is it an inspector who works for the liability carrier who would be the closest analog in your case?",

  "Well, that's -- with respect to -­ I mean, you can say that of any claim that is valued in dollars. But, I mean, your -- you know, what I'm getting at is your position that there is no distinction to be drawn between the contract action and the preferential transfer. And my point was, some transfers might be satisfied -- might be sought in what, at least in the traditional classification, would be an in rem, rather than an in personam, action. Would your answer be any different if the -- if the gold bar were simply sitting on the -- on the desk of some State purchasing agent, as opposed to deposited in the -- in the State treasury or sold by the State for the monetary value?",
  "Okay, so -­",

  "Why? What does that have to do with the theory of sovereign immunity?",
  "Believe me, I -- I mean, I -- as you know, I'm not a big fan of sovereign immunity in these circumstances, but I'm not quite sure how to get around it, based on the fact that there is no alternative remedy here.",

  "My -- the particular concern I have with that, at the preliminary injunction stage, is not necessarily that that particular argument should, for all times, be assessed correctly by the -- by the District Court. But it seems to me that if the District Court at least plausibly reads that exception to negate your argument, isn't that good enough, at the preliminary injunction stage, as a basis for the Court saying, \"Look, you haven't -- you, the Government -- haven't carried your burden to show the affirmative defense here\"?",

Because you apparently take the position -- the Government takes the position that when -- under the governing law, the Government would have an affirmative burden, ultimately, to defend -- in this case, on compelling interest, least restrictive, et cetera -- that, at the preliminary injunction stage, the applicant for the injunction has the burden to negate the probability that the Government will carry its burden on the ultimate issue.

Your answer consistently is, Did he know that questioning would stop? And those are two different issues. One is understanding Miranda warnings. One is voluntarily initiating a further conversation with the police. So, I don't see it -- let's assume he perfectly understood the Miranda warnings. But if the initiation was not a voluntary initiation, or an initiation at all, it seems to me you lose.",

  "No, you're -­",
  "-- you're avoiding my question.",
  "My question is, Is the act of initiation a purely formal act on your view, so that so long as the suspect says the magic words, it doesn't matter what is in his mind or what he understands? Is it formal or not formal?",
  "It's not formal.",
  "No, but the standard fruit analysis is when you get something like a statement, and that statement then leads to further evidence. We're not -- I mean, Justice Breyer wasn't using the fruits analysis in that sense. He was -- he was getting at the -- at the same question we're all trying to get at: Was the later so-called initiation the product of the improper police comment in the first place, or was it voluntary?",
  "No, I realize that. But you concede -- I think you concede that the -- that the so-called initiation has got to be a voluntary initiation. You don't take the position that it's merely magic words. Isn't that correct?",
  "All right. If that is correct, why do we not give some deference to the conclusion of the trial court that this was not voluntary?",
  "You say there was a legal error. What exactly was the legal error?",

  "Well, Edwards is directed at avoiding badgering, but the issue before us is initiation. That's not a question of badgering, it's a question of initiation. And don't the points that Justice Ginsburg raised go to whether the initiation is likely to have been a voluntary initiation?",
  "So, your position, I guess, is -- I think it is, in your last answer -- that we really shouldn't be phrasing the inquiry in terms of the voluntariness of the suspect's statement, at this point. We, rather, should be focusing it on whether the statement was, in fact, a spontaneous initiation on his part or a response to the preceding police statement.",
  "That's the way you would phrase the --",
  "-- issue for us.",
  "If you lose this case, can the defendant be prosecuted federally under the carjacking statute?",
  "No, it doesn't say it -- it is deemed to continue to be pending. The issue is deemed to be reserved.",
  "Which is a very different issue. In other words, it's not waived and over with at that point, but it says nothing whatsoever, in express terms, about pending motions.",
  "No, the issue is reserved. The motion has been ruled upon. The judge says, \"No, I'm not going to grant this motion before submitting the issue to the jury.\" That's the end of the motion. The issue isn't over with, because it can be raised again after the verdict. Isn't that what the rule provides?",
  "All right, let's assume it's extremely apparent. Isn't -- and assume, just for the sake of argument, that we have a simple case, not a complex case, so it's easy to see that, in fact, the evidence falls short. It's still the case that this Court has discouraged, or has certainly -- has either discouraged the granting of motions at the close of the plaintiff's case, or at the close of all the evidence -- in any event, has put its imprimatur on denying those motions, subject to renewal after verdict. How can we possibly find that there is plain error when a court does exactly what we have encouraged them to do in order not to waste a lot of trial time and jury time? How could we ever find there is plain error, except with respect to the renewed motion after the verdict?",
  "And we have said, \"Don't grant it.\"",
  "And we have said, \"Don't grant it.\"",
  "It could do that even after it had ruled upon it and had denied it?",
  "Well, I -­",
  "-- I will -- I will grant you that, were it not for our cases, textually, the argument you make is possible. But I don't see how you can make that argument without our overruling a lot of law.",
  "Yes, but the -­",
  "-- rule doesn't deem it to have been deferred. A judge may, in fact, not rule on it, although he does not grant it. But the rule does not say that the motion is deemed to be deferred. The rule talks about the issue being reserved, which is a different thing. And the issue may be reserved whether the judge rules on the motion or simply says, \"I will take it under advisement and you can renew it after the verdict if you want to.\" Isn't that correct?",
  "Well, that may be, but it's still the case that the rule does not deem the -- this rule does not deem, in my terms, the ruling on the pre- verdict motion to have been deferred.",

  "May I pursue that point for a second --",
  "-- more? I -- it seems to me that you would have a much stronger argument on that point if, in 1996, the Act provided that, suddenly, Social Security benefits -- some Social Security benefits would be -- would be subject to administrative offset, but only those when the Government -- imposed when the Government is trying to collect educational loans. We would then have what seems to -- would seem to me to be a really head-to-head conflict between the two statutes. The trouble is that, in 1996, the extension of the administrative setoff authority covered Social Security benefits to be -- for which there would be a setoff for any purpose -- not just educational loans; for any purpose. So that, in fact, it is possible for us to read the 1996 Act as having an effect -- there's a 10-year limit, generally -- at the same time that we read the earlier -- I forget what the -- '91, I guess it is --",
  "-- which says, with respect to educational loan collections, including by setoff, there's no limitation at all. So, we can have both statutes without rendering either one of them nugatory. And isn't that the preferred way to read statutes?",
  "But with --",
  "-- with respect to Social Security setoffs, of course, it would.",
  "Social Security -- Social Security said it would be -- it would be a -- it would -- a flat head-to-head contradiction, no matter how you read it, on Social Security setoffs for educational loans.",
  "And if that's the only thing that the 1996 Act covered, we would say, \"Boy, there is just an absolute conflict here. We can't have both statutes.\" But, in fact, we can have both statutes most of the time. We read the 1996 10-year limitation as covering everything except setoffs against Social Security for educational loans. And, with respect to the educational loans, we give respect to the -- to the earlier decision that there be no limitation at all. You just have a weaker argument than you would have if the 1996 Act only covered this case.",
  "But you're using --",
  "You're -- no, please.",
  "But you're taking as your prime -- or a prime example of what would be covered by the exception of \"negligent transmission\" the package that is delivered to the right place on time and all the china inside the box is smashed. I mean, that would be an example that would fit your theory.",
  "Yes.",
  "And you would -- you would say that's supported by the -- you know, the noscitur a sociis argument, because it's damage of -- to the mail, or the condition of the mail, or the manner in which the mail itself is delivered, but it -- that's more or less where you -- where you think the exception should stop.",
  "Yes.",
  "But that would be, in each case -- in each example you're giving, as I understand it, that would be as a consequence to a violation that affected the mail, itself, in the first place.",
  "I lose the -- I lose the money, because the mail is slow, or whatever.",
  "No, but --",
  "-- your argument, as I understand it, on the -- on the truck accident and on the package that falls out of the truck -- is that the fact that mail transmission is going on at the same time is utterly irrelevant to the cause of the damage. And isn't it equally open to the -- isn't your position equally open to the argument that, when the person trips over the package on the porch, it is utterly irrelevant that that package has been placed there by a postal employee and has been carried in the mail? It is in the same -- it has the same character, vis-a-vis tripping, that a brick or a rock or any other package might have. So, if you're going to be consistent with respect to the passage of the truck, the package that drops out of the truck, and the piece -- and the package on the porch, don't you have to say it is irrelevant that the package in the porch has been carried in the mail and put there by a postal employee? It's its character of package at that place that matters.",
  "No, but you can say -- then you can say exactly the same thing about the package that falls off the truck. You can characterize that. You can say, \"Look, it wouldn't have been in the truck if they weren't delivering mail.\"",
  "Pardon me? But you -- and you could say that there wouldn't have been any accident with the truck if the truck hadn't been delivering mail.",

  "Okay, and let me --",
  "If that is correct, then your whole argument rests on the fact that, although he has, and may assert, an expectation of privacy, that is irrelevant to the right of his wife to let people, including the police, come into an area which is under her control, as well as his. Is that it?",
  "Okay.",
  "But your expectation -- this is what I'm trying to get at -- your expectation is not what governs. You concede, as I understand it, that he still had an expectation, in the sense that he could assert a right of privacy, he can litigate this case, he has standing --",
  "-- but that his expectation is irrelevant to the fact that the wife, in this case, we assume, had the right to admit them to an area which was under her control, as well as his. Is -- have I got it correct?",

  "All right, then he --",
  "-- if he --",
  "Well, it -- let me make sure I understand where you're going. We agree that he had a reason -- everybody agrees, I guess, that he has a reasonable expectation. He can -- he can raise his Fourth Amendment claim. Your argument is that, even though we get past the reasonable expectation, there's a second reasonableness question, and that is, Is the search, itself, reasonable?",
  "And that's the focus of your argument --",
  "-- correct?",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay.",
  "Yes, but Olson was a standing case. Olson was not confronting this situation. In Olson, the police simply went in without a warrant. And the argument was made that this person was not the normal inhabitant of the -- what was he? A houseguest or something of the sort. And the only issue that Olson addressed was his right to raise a Fourth Amendment claim. It did not respond to the issue that you are raising, which is the reasonable extent of search.",
  "I don't --",
  "I don't see that --",
  "-- at all.",
  "They concede -- the only expectation of privacy you've got to have for Fourth Amendment purposes in order to raise a claim is a minimal one -- they concede that the -- that this individual has an expectation of privacy sufficient to raise a Fourth Amendment claim.",
  "Their argument is that, although he can raise it, the rights, however they may be derived on the part of his wife, allowed her to admit the police -- in effect, thwarting his expectations. Your argument, as I understand it, is that when the police search with that kind of permission, over his objection, it's not a reasonable search. Isn't that the way to structure the issue?",

It is clear that Matlock, had he known what was going on -- and he may have; I don't know -- would have objected? So that if we accept your argument that the presence of the person there expressing an objection is what makes the difference, then Matlock and Rodriguez become almost silly cases. They are -- they are -- they're cases that rest upon an assumption that is clearly contrary to fact.",
  "Sure, but --",
  "-- an equally clear line would simply be that, if the area to be searched is one of common tenancy or occupation or whatnot, the only consent that will suffice will be the consent of the person against whom you expect to use any evidence found. Easy clear line.",
  "Okay.",
  "But an equally administrable rule here is that, even though the person you suspect objects, you can still go in, if a person with authority otherwise says you can. Equally clear rule, and it has one advantage: It does not turn Matlock and Rodriguez into silly cases.",

  "Yes.",
  "Well, yes, that's right.",
  "Yes. That's right.",
  "Mr. --",
  "Mr. Schaerr, before you go on, may I just ask you one question on the point that you made -- and you made it in the brief -- about the failure to establish a -- some kind of a history of unconstitutional action in this particular State? Do I understand you to claim that that is a -- that a record of some sort must be made by Congress? Or can a record of that sort be made in the courts, in the course of litigation, as a predicate for a particular lawsuit like this one?",
  "Right, but Congress --",
  "-- but Congress normally operates on a -- on a national scale --",
  "-- so that, I mean, we -- I guess, we would normally say, \"Well, you can show 40 States out of 50 were in trouble. That's probably good enough to get you across the line, at least.\" But you're not saying that. So, are you saying that Congress has got to make the record with respect to each individual State?",
  "So, it could be done --",
  "-- it could be done --",
  "-- in the litigation of this case, then. There could be a trial record of prior violations.",
  "No, but my question is, Where does the record have to be made? Does Congress have to make it, on a State-by-State basis, or may that record be made in the course of a trial in a particular State as a predicate for subjecting that State to liability in this instance?",
  "So that Congress could have known this, whether they specifically adverted to it, or not. That would be sufficient.",
  "Well, may --",
  "-- may I -- no, go ahead.",
  "Well, but --",
  "-- if we --",
  "-- if we decided it -- it was at least appropriate to give a hint, aren't we in a little bit better position than you suggested, in the light of Carey? Because in -- is -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought, in Carey, the State order was not merely that it was on the merits, but that it was on the merits and it was untimely. In other words, it said A and B. And we said, you know, \"That's ambiguous,\" to start with, and then we went on and said, \"You know, sometimes 'merits' don't mean merits.\" But if the State were to revise its procedure and say, \"We're either going to say A or we're going to say B, and that's our reason,\" and they said, \"It's on the merits\" or \"it's untimely,\" wouldn't it make sense for us, even in the light of Carey, to say, \"Okay, we'll accept that as the -- as the State's reason\"?",
  "I don't --",
  "-- see why. If they're going to follow something like a prima facie 60-day rule, and it's -- it's on day 65, all they've got to say is, \"It's untimely.\"",
  "Well, it would --",
  "-- it would -- it would be fair, but to call it a finding of California State law is a -- would be a bit of a stretch, wouldn't it? I mean, you -- you've made a perfectly good argument that it would be a sensible rule for California --",
  "-- to adopt, would not be sensible for us to adopt. But I'd have a hard time saying that I could justify it as a statement of current California law, and I'm --",
  "Am I missing something?",
  "Okay, the --",
  "So you're back to the presumption. But --",
  "-- but if --",
  "-- if we're going to go further and say, \"Oh, well, we find that that's what the State law is, unless they tell us differently,\" that's where I'm having trouble.",
  "Yes, but we --",
  "-- know what it --",
  "-- we know what it is. There's a State statute of limitations. It says --",
  "-- 3 years.",
  "We don't have anything like that here.",
  "In Bougas, they were there to -- they were put in originally in the original drafting. They were paired, right?",
  "Let me -- let me raise the reality check question. If -- if we assume that that is not the only possible reading of that statute, why in the world would Congress have wanted to impose the -- the system that follows from -- from your result in which the -- the national banks are -- are excluded from diversity jurisdiction to a degree that the State banks clearly are not?",
  "But the -- I guess the problem is if -- if we start with the assumption that I made a second ago that your reading is not a necessity -- it's a possible reading. No question about it. But if -- if we assume that it's not an absolute necessity, we -- we try to avoid freakish results, and this seems like a freakish result. And I take it your answer is it may be a freakish result. We're not claiming that Congress intended it. But that still leaves us, I think, with the problem of a -- a reading which is not absolutely necessary that does produce a freakish result. And if that's the case, why shouldn't you lose?",
  "Well, you can -- you can say the same thing of -- of res judicata, that there is a complete bar. I guess my concern here is that this seems to be, with respect to the employee, something much closer to a res judicata case than to an immunity per se case.",
  "Digital I remember.",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm assuming that it's not res judicata in -- in the narrow sense of the doctrine, but it's -- it's still a bar that depends upon a -- a prior judgment. And in that respect, it's sort of res judicata-like. Conversely, there is -- there is no immunity in the first instance conferred directly on the employee as such. And so that's -- that's why I -- it seems to me that there's an argument that this is a lot closer to res judicata than it is to classic immunity.",
  "But a double jeopardy claim is -- is a claim in which there is an -- a -- an immunity textually conferred by the -- the Constitution, or at least, we -- we have thought it -- the guarantee does not make an awful lot of practical sense, unless you read it that way. You don't have that -- that situation here.",
  "Well, let's go to --",
  "Mr. Pincus, let me go -- ask you to follow up on that and, in effect, go back to -- to Justice Ginsburg's question. I will assume that patents as such do not give market power. I will assume that there are many successful ties in which that is also not true. What is -- is your kind of short answer to the -- to the argument, which I think Justice Ginsburg was getting to, that if it is, in fact, worth litigating in an antitrust case, that is a pretty good -- darned good reason to assume that there is market power and that it is, of course, having a discriminatory price effect? What's the short answer to that?",
  "I was going to say I --",
  "-- I would have thought the answer was you could say that in any case in which an antitrust case is -- is brought. So essentially it -- it gets to be reductionist.",
  "In other words, the fact --",
  "Well, does it drive the -- I mean, it -- it drives the lawsuit with respect to one element. And -- and I -- I guess one argument is if -- if we reaffirm the rule that you're challenging, it will invite more lawsuits. They'll say, boy, the Supreme Court really means it with this presumption now. Has that, in fact, been the case that the presumption, at least as it has been understood up to this point, has driven lawsuits and, in fact, has driven lawsuits that ultimately were unsuccessful even though the market power point was, of course, satisfied?",
  "Yes, but this is -- this is basically a practical question, and I -- I'm trying to get a -- I guess because I'm not an antitrust lawyer, I'm trying to get a handle on how the presumption is actually working in the system, and I'm not sure that I understand it.",
  "But if it's a success, we'll all be rich. Now, he decides to tie something to that.",
  "May I interrupt you at this point? Because there is one thing that I'm not sure that I understand about your position, and one way of reading your brief takes you a step beyond what you have just said. So I would like to get clear on this. And I understood your argument to be that given the safeguards such as judicial override, there simply was no -- there was no need to read the health exception in, that in fact it was taken care of -­ any of the issues that might be raised in arguing for the need for health exception in fact were addressed by the statute. The point at which I'm not clear on your position is -- occurs in what you've said on page 11 of your yellow brief, if you could get that out. Do you have the carry over paragraph on 11? You go through the kind of a worst case analysis. And you say, well, you know, assuming that all of the safeguards somehow do not work, finally, in the unlikely event that a parent refuses to waive the 48-hour waiting period and so on, a doctor who performs an emergency abortion under such circumstances would not be subject to either criminal prosecution or civil liability because his or her conduct would not only be constitutionally protected but would be independently justifiable, and then you cite the competing harms. What do you mean when you say it would be constitutionally protected? I read that as suggesting that there was indeed a constitutional requirement for some kind of a health exception, but that may not be what you meant. What do you mean by constitutionally protected? What are you getting at?",
  "And if he said, \"I may not be prosecuted under the Constitution because,\" what follows \"because,\" in your view?",
  "Doesn't that mean because there is a required health exception? I mean, isn't that what you're saying?",
  "Competing harm.",
  "Well, that was true in Casey.",
  "Well, we may argue about what the fraction may be and we may argue about what substantiality means. But one thing I don't think we can argue about is that Casey was applying the Salerno standard.",
  "Once again, that may be, but after Casey, I don't think one can plausibly argue that the Salerno standard is the correct standard. Whatever their position may be, whatever fractions of substantiality may mean.",
  "But why would we have a separate rule on facial challenges merely for spousal notification?",
  "Why wouldn't it be an abuse of discretion in this case? Because there seems to be an ample record here that the legislature, or a majority of the legislature made a conscious choice that they would rather have no statute than a statute with a health exception in it. They deliberately said the only statute we want is one without a health exception. Therefore, even if you touch all the bases that Justice Breyer has laid out, don't you end up with a position that if we were to craft such a limitation, we would be flying quite precisely in the face of the expressed legislative intent.",
  "Whatever you call it, call it a health exception, call it an XYZ exception. They knew what they were getting at, they knew what they were worried about and they said, we will have a statute without it or we will have no statute.",
  "I don't know how you would sever a health exception that is not there. They're saying if something is in here, you can sever it and we'll be satisfied with what's left. In effect, if we were to enjoin certain applications, we would be injecting an exception that they've rejected. And whatever that may be, it does not seem to be severance.",
  "Well, that's true, but don't you have the further difficulty that we didn't merely reverse with respect to the -- to the Hobbs Act violations, or to the listed ones. We made it clear. We said, expressly, that the judgment had to be reversed, which seems to sweep everything within it, doesn't it?",
  "But, I mean, that's what we always say. And it may be that there is absolutely nothing to do, at that point, except enter judgment for one side and be done with it.",
  "Well, I think -- I think, you know, your argument is fine, but the trouble is, if the question is, \"Did the Seventh Circuit honor the judgment of this Court?\" I think there's a pretty good argument that it not -- that it did not, based upon the fact that we, in effect, summed up everything we were purporting to say with the phrase that the judgment itself had to be reversed.",
  "Well --",
  "No, but --",
  "Well, what do you say to the response --",
  "Well, you say they are punished as a part of the act, but Justice Scalia's point is still true, it only goes to punishment. The way this is written, it may be charged as a separate offense.",
  "Well, why -- why can’t he? when I first looked at this, I thought, well, this is the kind of thing that should have been -- should have even have to get to arbitration if he’s right. He wants a survey to see if he’s being picked on. If he is, there would be redress. So it seemed like this was the kind of complaint that was best handled in that kind of procedure.",
  "Yes, but that simply means that the grievance procedure is more valuable in this case than merely talking to his supervisor. And -- and the -- the issue -- maybe -- maybe we’re missing it, but the issue is why isn’t there a very good reason to require him to go through the grievance procedure, number one, to -- to cut down on needless Federal court actions and, number two, under the -- sort of the general policy of favoring what collective bargaining agreements negotiate.",
  "He may not have any right to it, but in fact, he may get some relief.",
  "Well, but the -- the --",
  "-- the whole right to -- to go into court with a constitutional claim is absent from the statute. And -- and so we may as well get hung for a sheep as a lamb. If -- if we’re going to recognize the one, I don’t see that we’re going too much further in -- in saying it’s got to be conditional on the other. Souter, because I think this Court has traditionally allowed individuals who are bringing constitutional Nothing in the CSRA changed that, and if I can explain why for just a moment, I think it’ll be helpful. If you look at this Court’s opinion in Fausto or you look at this Court’s opinion in Bush against Lucas or the opinion in Karahalios, which I think are the three leading cases from this Court construing the Civil Service Reform Act in -- in this kind of fashion, you’ll notice that they repeatedly refer to those acts as being comprehensive with regard to personnel actions. Personnel actions is not a casual phrase. It is a defined term in the CSRA. It’s defined in section 2302(a), which is -- was discussed in the Government’s brief at page 5, note 5. And you will notice there, if you read it, that they do include -- indeed, Congress in 1994 amended the statute to add to the list of personnel actions orders for psychiatric testing. There was nothing here that turns a drug test into a personnel action. Now, the CSRA is absolutely comprehensive in its field, but its field is personnel actions. And",
  "Well, I thought youthfulness --",
  "But -- but isn’t -- isn’t the difficulty with your analysis there, General, that, yes, she started out by -- by talking about youthfulness. As I understand it, she started out talking about youthfulness and the -- and the demeanor, the rolling of the eyes.",
  "Sort of at the second stage, again she spoke of youthfulness. Then at a third stage, she said, well, it’s a combination of -- of age, gender, and inexperience. Then she realized she was in trouble, and she said, well, I really didn’t mean gender because I -- I’d be in constitutional hot water there. Then she said, well, I really don’t mean age because there are other young people on the jury, and I’m -- I’m not challenging them. So that the only thing that was left was possibly that element of age which refers to ties to the community. And at the end of this long colloquy, in which she has gone back and forth and back and forth and -- and jettisoned some of her reasons, the trial judge says, well, I didn’t see the eye-rolling, and I guess I’ll give the benefit of the doubt to counsel. I don’t know whether the judge is talking about the benefit of the doubt on eye-rolling or the benefit of the doubt on -- on ties to the community. Assuming it’s ties to the community, that has nothing to do, I suppose, with -- with the -- the fear that a young person is going to be too sympathetic to a defendant who’s up for the third time with a small amount of drugs. And at the end of the day, it seems to me we have what Justice Kennedy’s question in the first place suggested. We simply have an incoherent colloquy and a response to the judge which simply does not tell you what the judge is ruling on or the basis for the ruling. All we know is that ultimately he’s saying I’m rejecting the Batson challenge. That’s the problem with -- with deference in this case. What -- what is your response to that?",
  "Yes, but the district attorney has -- I mean, the -- the point here is we’re judging the district attorney’s responses, not the judge’s responses.",
  "What we want to know is what the judge found and ruled upon. The district attorney, as I understand it, has withdrawn the general claim that youthfulness is a problem, and the only claim that might have been -- might -- probably was comprehended under youth that -- that remains is the claim of no community ties. And I find it very difficult to tell from the judge’s ruling whether the judge is saying, yes, I think there’s a fair showing that there are no community ties and that’s certainly a race-neutral reason. I don’t know what the judge was -- was --",
  "Well, didn’t the DA say, look, youth alone doesn’t -- doesn’t explain my reasons because there are other young people on the jury that -- that we’re not challenging, and -- and I don’t want to suggest that all young people should be disqualified?",
  "All right. Let me -- let me ask you as a -- as a response to -- to the kind of the incoherent flopping around argument, let me ask you what your position would be if the record were different in the following respect. Let’s assume the record is just what it is up until that final paragraph or so in which the judge rules. And instead of doing what he did in this case, the judge says the following two things. He says, number one, I didn’t see the eye-rolling, but I accept counsel’s representation of fact that the eye-rolling went on and I certainly understand the -- the significance of that. So I’m going to take that as a fact. Number two, even though counsel has withdrawn the -- the sort of the general claim of youth and so on, I understand counsel still to be saying this is a person without any manifest ties to the community and -- and that suggests a certain looseness of responsibility. And based upon the eye-rolling and based upon the lack of ties to the community, I think counsel had a race-neutral basis for the -- for the strike that was made, and for that reason, I’m going to overrule the Batson challenge with respect to number 16. What would your position be?",
  "Right.",
  "What would your position be?",
  "So you would say that those two conclusions on the part of the court were unreasonable?",
  "And this one rolled her eyes.",
  "Well, your argument --",
  "Okay, but even if you do that, you're still left, it seems to me, with the problem -- whether you characterize the problem as discriminatory and antidiscriminatory university policy or not, you're still left with a speech problem that they raise, that, in effect, you are forcing them, in effect, to underwrite your speech, up to a point, and you are forcing them to change their own message. You're forcing them into hypocrisy, in one alternative. And those arguments don't depend upon the -- sort of, the discriminatory character of what may be at stake.",
  "So, discrimination --",
  "-- or no discrimination, you've got a speech issue that you're going to address.",
  "No, but you're making a -- if I understand what you're saying, you are making a kind of O'Brien argument that the -- that the burden on speech, whatever it may be, is an incidental burden to something else. Well, that -- I think we have to draw this line between recruiting, on the one hand, which is what the military wants to do, and the Solomon Amendment, on the other hand. As I understand it, the Solomon Amendment is directed, or is responsive, entirely to positions taken by law schools on, among other things, first-amendment expressive grounds, so that if we are going to address the Solomon Amendment, I think we are addressing an exclusively first- amendment-speech expression issue.",
  "I don't --",
  "-- know of any other reason for the Solomon Amendment.",
  "But --",
  "But they're -- but the Solomon Amendment, in order to accomplish that, is addressed to a particular expressive problem which occurs for the military -- and for the law schools, for that matter -- in law-school recruiting. So, it seems to me that -- for -- I mean, my only point is that the Solomon Amendment seems to have one objective. Whereas, the \"don't burn your draft-card rule,\" in O'Brien, had two -- or had a -- let's say, had a primarily nonspeech objective with an incidental-speech burden. Here, the sole objective, in the real world, seems to be an expressive objective.",
  "No, this express --",
  "Yes, but the expressive objective is, the law schools are taking a position on first-amendment grounds. That position is interfering with military recruitment. No question about it. I don't know how much, but I will assume that there is no question about it. The Solomon Amendment is addressed solely, as I understand it, at the expressive activities which have, as you say, this interference. Its sole objective is expressive.",
  "Well, in --",
  "Well, is -- what about Hurley? Is there something deeply moral or conscience- driven about the position to exclude the gay-rights contingent in the parade, in Hurley?",
  "So, you're --",
  "Well --",
  "Excuse me, that -- I understand that, so far as the associational claim may go. But so far as the speech claims may go, I don't understand it.",
  "I can say, or refuse to say, anything I want to, for any reason I want to, however bad that reason, however nonmoral that reason is. And I don't see how, in the speech -- on the speech claims, we get into moral basis at all.",
  "No, but, Mr. Rosenkranz, isn't the -- I thought the distinction was that in determining the forum for recruiting, the university is speaking. The university isn't creating a forum from a lot -- for a lot of third parties; it's speaking, itself. And I understand the essence of your claim to be that its speech is being affected, either by being mixed with something it doesn't want to say or by being, in effect, forced to support it doesn't -- something it does not want to say.",
  "Okay.",
  "Isn't that the point? I mean, your point is not that -- as I understand, that, for any reason, if the -- if the university, for any reason, during World War II, had excluded recruiters, and there had been the equivalent of the Solomon Amendment, that there would have been a first-amendment problem. As I -- is -- maybe I don't understand your argument, but I thought your argument was, or is, that if they do it for some purpose of conscience, which implies a message -- e.g., if it is a pacifist college -- there would be a first-amendment problem. But if they're doing it simply because space is short and they would rather provide one more biology classroom, there wouldn't be a first-amendment problem, World War II or today, would there?",
  "I thought your argument was, the single message is, \"Join the Army, but not if you're gay.\"",
  "And --",
  "-- which leads me to the question, in response to your answer to Justice Ginsburg a moment ago, in your view is the compelling interest on the part of the Government recruitment or the refusal to accept gays?",
  "No, but, are you --",
  "-- are you saying that the Government -- that the only compelling-interest argument that the Government can raise here is the discriminatory argument? Since nobody denies that, if the Government were recruiting without the discrimination, that there would -- there would -- there would be no problem with it. Everyone would agree with -- that that was a compelling --",
  "-- interest. But, I thought your argument on compelling interest was that the only compelling interest that the Government can assert is the discriminatory interest.",
  "Well, I thought they were -- they were essentially, as I guess you said a moment ago, emotional distress kinds of injuries because otherwise he'd be claiming a double recovery. So he doesn't do that because they -- they settled the contract case with the corporation for what? $46,000?",
  "So -- so that the only thing he -- he's not claiming an economic injury, as I understand it, or am I wrong?",
  "But I -- I guess that's where I went wrong. I thought those were the reasons that he was claiming that he had been distressed emotionally.",
  "But you're -- you're saying he wants the --",
  "Well, can you -- can you do that under a general contract theory?",
  "So you're reporting not merely the -- the tort of tortious interference, but some general, broader concept of tort law as being subsumed with -- under 1981. Aren't you?",
  "Right, but the -- the focus of it is, as -- as I understand it, and the -- the kernel of it is -- is the capacity to contract. And we can certainly understand, I guess, how tortious interference with contracts might come under that umbrella, but you're going further and you're saying, I take it, any tort that would give a recovery -- recognize a recovery for -- for dignitary injury would be subsumed with -- within the concept of what 1981 was intended to -- to cover, which is a broader proposition.",
  "Well, contract -- I -- you -- you pointed out the -- the terminology which includes contract damages or -- or contract harm as personal harm, but it doesn't necessarily follow from that that every harm or every injury that is personal falls under -- conceptually under the 1981 umbrella.",
  "Yes, but there's no way to confine it to the individual, is it? I mean, the -- on your -- on your target theory, a -- a general discriminatory animus as a basis for breaching a contract with General Motors would give a right of action to -- to every minority employee of General Motors. Isn't that correct?",
  "But none of the ruin occurred, as I understand it, until the corporation went bankrupt. In other words, there was no direct -- the bank, for example, didn't say we're not doing any more business with -- with you, McDonald. As I understand it, all the -- all the -- leaving dignitary harm aside, all the actual loss was -- was as a consequence of the loss to the corporation. His stock fell, you know, whatever. But it -- it seems all derivative from the corporate loss.",
  "Well, can you give me an example?",
  "General, may -- may I -- I'd like to pose a question which at least gets to the nub of the issue, as I see it, and -- and get your response to it. The premise of my question is this. We -- we generally regard mitigation evidence as favoring life, aggravation evidence as favoring death. We've got a case in which the -- the assumption is that they are evenly balanced. The -- the pans of the scale are exactly even on that. Kansas says in that case the jury shall return the verdict of death. If we are going to demand, as we have said that we're going to demand, that the determination -- that the death penalty determination be one of what we have called reasoned moral judgment, then what has to be supplied in order to make the Kansas provision consistent with reasoned moral justice, it seems to me, is a presumption in favor of death. Other things being equal, there is a presumption in favor of death. And my question is, am I correct in saying that in order to hold your way, we have to hold that the eighth amendment -- is consistent with the eighth amendment to presume the appropriateness of death, other things being equal?",
  "You -- you agree that's -- that's a proper way to look at the issue then.",
  "Then how do you get off the dime?",
  "Yes, but the -- the direction, as I understand it, is that if mitigation and aggravation are even, then the only way to come to a conclusion is to say, as the statute does, because the mitigation does not outweigh the aggravation, you should return a verdict of death. And that seems to me another way of saying there is a presumption that if aggravation and mitigation are equal, that the penalty should be death.",
  "No, but the -- the Attorney General said that the -- the fact that in this particular case the issue was focused on, in effect, sort of remedy, severance, and so on, was dependent upon the assumption about what Federal law required. It was dependent upon the earlier case which so held. So I don't -- and -- and what he seem -- says seems plausible to me. I -- I don't see how we can divorce the judgment here with the earlier judgment, which Kansas -- which the Kansas Supreme Court relied upon here, which was a Federal ground.",
  "It wouldn't have even raised the issue had it not been for the earlier Federal holding. Isn't that correct?",
  "Well, do you -- do you -- I -- I take it this is the implication of your position. Do you take this position that in any instance in which a State supreme court decides a case on a Federal -- decides an issue on a Federal ground in case A, and for whatever reason, case A is not brought to this Court for review, that in every subsequent case in the State system, which depends upon State A, the State is totally without the -- or this Court is -- is totally without jurisdiction to review it?",
  "If you're -- if you're right, I take it, we would not have jurisdiction to review a Federal ground that was raised by a State court, even though it had not been raised by the parties. If they get -- you know, they get the opinion from the court and there's a big surprise -- the -- the State court decided to go off on -- on a Federal ground, which had not been pressed -- I take it on your view we would not have jurisdiction to review that.",
  "But --",
  "But --",
  "But, based on what you have just said, which was my understanding, too, assuming the Oregon Supreme Court made the assumption that the mother's testimony had not been admitted at prior trial, the only thing that the Oregon Supreme Court was ruling on was the admissibility of new testimony, and the use to which new testimony could be put, right?",
  "So that if the --",
  "-- if the other side says, \"We totally give up any claim to introduce new testimony,\" then don't we have a jurisdictional problem?",
  "Oh, we --",
  "-- have not, but it's possible for, it seems to me -- for all we know, it's possible that Oregon could say, \"Look, we have a statute that says everything that was introduced at trial may be considered. That may be a good thing or a bad thing, but that's what our statute says, and they may consider it. But when the question comes, What new evidence may be admitted at the sentencing hearing -- the sentencing phase only, then we're going to restrict that only to evidence which, in our view, is required by the eighth amendment.\" So, if that is, then -- we don't -- I don't know whether the Oregon Supreme Court took that view, or not. But if it did take that view, and, in this case, the Respondents say, \"We no longer want to introduce any new evidence,\" then we would not have a case left, it seems to me.",
  "But is that --",
  "Well, do you intend to --",
  "Mr. Wolf, in view of the direction this discussion is going in, I want to go back to something that I really think we all thought we had passed but I would like to go back and get clear on. My recollection is that you stated, in your answer to Justice Stevens, that you currently maintain that you have a right to recall the mother to the stand at the -- at the sentencing proceeding. My question, which is prompted by your motion -- my question is, Is it your present intention to call the mother to the stand, or is it your present intention to use the mother's testimony, which we all ­ - I understand to be admissible? Are you going to call her, or not?",
  "You do intend to call her.",
  "No, I'm not asking why. I just want to know whether you are. And your representation to me is that you do intend to call her as a live witness as the -- at the resentencing.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, isn't it --",
  "-- the product, here? I mean, if they had not -- if they had not entered, they would not have gotten their evidence. Their entry, because it violated knock-and-announce, was unlawful. So, it is a product, isn't it?",
  "Well, an entry that conformed with knock-and-announce would have been lawful. This entry didn't. This entry was unreasonable. So, I don't see how your argument fits the facts.",
  "Well, but --",
  "-- I mean, how do you make that distinction? I mean, it's like the -- you know, the Cheshire cat and a -- and the smile; you can't distinguish the two. There was one entry, and that entry violated the knock-and-announce rule.",
  "So, basically, your argument rests on the fact that we can draw a distinction between entry and manner of entry.",
  "What do you say the purpose of knock-and-announce is?",
  "So, I take it your argument is that, except in cases in which the people inside the house are not dressed, or cases in which there is, in fact, a gun battle of some sort, that a knock-and-announce violation will, in fact, never be the cause of any damage at all.",
  "No, no, it -- no, but it'll never be the cause of any compensable damage at all.",
  "Because I take it your argument is: what you can recover from requires causation. And what I mean by \"causation\" is the causation of the harms which the rule is intended to avoid.",
  "And if the only harms that the rule is intended to avoid is the exposure of nakedness and violence, once inside, and there are cases without nakedness or without violence, then, in those cases, there will never be a recovery.",
  "But, basically, your rule is, the police are entitled to take the chance. If they -- if they get inside, and people have got their clothes on and there's no gun battle, no problem; nothing that the police are exposed to, either by an exclusionary rule or by a civil recovery. And if they want to take that chance, if they want to take the chance that somebody will not be dressed or a gun will be pulled, basically that's their option.",
  "What was the --",
  "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.",
  "I was going to say, What was -- what were the grounds upon which the warrant, in Segura, was obtained?",
  "So, it didn't -- it didn't depend on the entry or anything gained as a result of the entry, right?",
  "Right, but the --",
  "-- but the --",
  "Right, but the warrant --",
  "-- the warrant -- the warrant itself didn't depend on anything they had gained as a result of the entry. There was no --",
  "-- kind of causal --",
  "-- continuum there.",
  "Isn't --",
  "Isn't that the difference, though, with this case? Because, here, there is a causal continuum, at least, as Justice Breyer said, a but-for causal continuum. They wouldn't have been in the apartment but for the entry. And so, the authority of the warrant and the manner of executing the warrant are not divisible the way they were in Segura.",
  "But, in Segura, the court issuing the subsequent warrant says, \"You can -- you can go in there and do this.\" The court -- by the way, I -- maybe this makes it even easier -- did the court, in Segura, know that they were in the apartment?",
  "Okay.",
  "But what --",
  "Wait a minute. What is this incentive inherent in the circumstances?",
  "Well, it doesn't seem to work.",
  "I mean, you've got -- this is a case in which the officer testifies, \"It never works, I always go in.\"",
  "When is it going --",
  "I mean, what reason do we have to believe that this incentive inherent in circumstances is ever going to work in the absence of an exclusionary rule?",
  "Why don't they --",
  "Why don't they have something to gain? If they're right that there is evidence inside, they gain. They're -- I mean, they're perfectly rational --",
  "-- in this. They gain a greater chance of getting that evidence than if they let a few seconds elapse and the evidence can be flushed away.",
  "For --",
  "For which there is no record of any recovery in any court in the United States, isn't that correct?",
  "I'm -- I'm not sure why -- why we should make the classification that you did, that -- that retaliatory is simply a species of -- of malicious. I mean, I -- I can see the similarities, but we've also got an entirely separate First Amendment value here which just is not part of the -- the analytical mix when you're talking about malicious prosecution. So I'm not sure why we should -- we -- we should classify it as you argue.",
  "But it's -- it's a peculiar, if you will, a peculiar malice with its own set of constitutional values, and I don't know of anything comparable in -- in malicious prosecution generically.",
  "But the difficulty I think we're all having with it is that the qualified immunity issue and the standard to which you are -- are adverting responds to a question that doesn't arise unless we first assume that there is -- that there is a constitutional violation.",
  "And our questions are, what is the standard for determining the constitutional violation? Once we get that squared away, then we'll get to Harlow.",
  "Well, they did, but wouldn't you have to prove under your standard not that they would have procured or tried to procure it anyway, but that in fact the prosecutor would have prosecuted anyway? In other words, that's the distinction between the -- the normal case and -- and the case that we're dealing with here --",
  "-- with a prosecutor who has absolute immunity.",
  "No. All right --",
  "Why --",
  "So the -- the screen, in effect, is --",
  "-- the qualified immunity screen.",
  "But if you turn the Harlow standard around -- I mean, you're -- you're making the -- the negation of the Harlow standard the screening device --",
  "-- in Justice Breyer's example.",
  "Yes.",
  "And if the burden does shift that way --",
  "-- wouldn't it be consistent with the screening mechanism that Justice Breyer suggested and -- and that you accepted? Wouldn't -- wouldn't the -- the -- when the burden shifts, wouldn't the obligation be on -- on the point of substance, as opposed to the point of -- of screening, not to show that the -- that the prosecutor would have brought the prosecution anyway, but to show that the investigator would have acted to procure that prosecution anyway? So you would have parallel standards.",
  "Okay.",
  "All right. But just -- I just want to nail this --",
  "-- to make sure I understand it. So you're -- you're modifying your position of a minute ago in which you said the standard would be would the prosecution have been brought anyway, and you're now saying, which I think would be consistent with your answer to Justice Breyer, the -- the question is would the investigators have tried to procure the prosecution anyway. And do I understand you correctly, and -- and have you changed your position?",
  "So it's a dual --",
  "It's the criminal trial.",
  "The original criminal trial.",
  "Mr. Nager, on -- on that point, I have a factual question and I figured I'd get it -- excuse me -- get it out on the table at the beginning so you'd know what at least is bothering me. The nub -- the nub of your factual argument is, as you just -- just stated it, there's a joint venture here and joint ventures price their products. The factual question that I have is this. This is -- or the preface for it is this. This is a joint venture that has continued to market, in effect, the same product that the -- that the two companies marketed beforehand, and it has done so, ostensibly, under the old brand names. Therefore, the fact that there is a joint venture doesn't necessarily disclose that there is a new product as -- as might be the case normally which you would expect the joint venture to set its own price for. Therefore, it seems to me that if the joint venture is clearly going to cover pricing, the joint venture agreements, the documents that indicated the joint venture at the beginning, should have mentioned pricing. And yet, my understanding is that they did not do so, and in fact, the claim on the other side, as I recall the briefs, is that when the Government looked at the joint venture, prior to its going into effect, nothing was said about fixing prices -- setting prices. So my question is, did the joint venture, as indicated by documentation, say in any -- so many words that the joint venture is going to set prices for these two -- or for the -- the -- whatever it -- whatever it sells? And -- and number two, if -- if the answer to that is no, should we regard the joint venture as covering pricing?",
  "There were two questions. Which?",
  "Okay.",
  "Is there a document that we could look at that -- that says that?",
  "Mr. Nager, what if you had a -- a crazy kind of joint venture -- or maybe it wouldn't be so crazy -- in which it was just like this one? The two companies said we're going to form a joint venture to market these products. You know, we'll use one fleet of trucks and -- and we'll have one computer to determine who needs gas and so on. But each company -- each of the -- the principals forming the venture retained the -- the power to determine the price of the gasoline that is sold under their brand. And then 6 months later, the two companies get together and they decide to fix the price. That decision would be subject either to quick look or per se analysis, wouldn't it?",
  "Well, I'm assuming there -- there are, indeed, efficiencies to be attained by it so that it's not a sham. They just retained -- they said, look, we're -- we're still using our old brands, ostensibly, in the market and we're retaining the power to set the price individually with respect to the gas that is sold under those brands. So no sham.",
  "Well, are you -- are you saying in practical terms that my hypothesis is -- is just a practical impossibility?",
  "No, no, but -- no.",
  "Beyond -- be candid. I won't get mad.",
  "Is -- is that -- is that really your -- your point that I've come up with a hypothetical which is just a non-real-world hypothetical?",
  "Okay. Assuming it can happen, in -- in that case, would the subsequent agreement as to price be subject to per se or a quick look analysis?",
  "Yes, but there's -- there's one part of the lot that you haven't thrown in together, and that's the pricing lot. In -- in my example, your -- your law firm agreement would be each partner can decide exactly what he wants to charge. If -- if one wants to charge $10,000 an hour and another wants to charge $15 an hour, his choice.",
  "I -- I agree.",
  "You said we're going to do it on the hypothesis that it's a big country and somewhere out there somebody might do this. If -- if two oil companies did it, quick -- quick look or per se analysis?",
  "But didn't we have competition even within the joint venture for a few months? Because -- correct me if I'm wrong on the facts. I thought for a few months the -- the price differential was maintained. I think there was a 2 cent price differential or something like that. And so long as that was maintained, weren't they competing?",
  "Wasn't there competition in -- in the -- in the retail market? I mean, if I had two stations in front of me and one was selling gas 2 cents cheaper, I'd -- I'd go to the one that was 2 cents lower. Isn't that competition?",
  "Because that differential was not reflected in what their agreement provided that each could respectively take out of the joint venture.",
  "No, but isn't -- isn't it expectable? I mean -- and this is -- I think this is Justice Scalia's -- isn't it -- isn't it expectable that if you don't have an agreement that clearly says the two -- the two joint venturers, respectively, retain the right to -- to price products sold to the consumer under their brand name, that in fact it is the joint venture that will price the products?",
  "And therefore, it is a decision of the joint venture, not of the -- the two original principals.",
  "No, but Mr. Minear --",
  "Well, that's true, but Mr. Minear had a response to that, it seems to me, a kind of blanket response, and he said that's only relevant unless you are dealing with pricing decisions between competitors. And the one thing, if I understood him correctly, that is clear is that under the undisputed portions of the joint venture agreement, the price at which the products were sold, high, low, differential, no differential, did not affect the distribution of profits as between the two joint venturers. Therefore, they were not competing with respect to the pricing, and therefore, the -- your -- in effect, your whole argument collapses because you don't have, on any analysis, an agreement between two competitors.",
  "I can understand your argument if we were doing a rule of reason analysis. Is that something that can properly be analyzed on quick look or per se?",
  "But, Mr. Alioto, your argument, I think, is assuming that the facts in this case are like the facts in what I think I called my -- my crazy joint venture hypothetical in which the two principals agreed to a joint venture, but they accept in a clear and unequivocal way the pricing decisions. And -- and it seems to me that the -- two things have come out of this argument. Number one, you don't make that assumption, and that assumption is -- is not supported by the facts of this case. And number two, Mr. Minear comes back and says as long as the division of profits under the joint venture agreement does not depend on these pricing decisions, they are not competitors, and therefore it's irrelevant anyway. Doesn't your argument run against -- crash against one or the other or both of those answers?",
  "Well, they did not change the price for at least 8 months.",
  "Well, didn't -- you -- you have accepted Justice Scalia's formulation, but my understanding is that Schlup did not say no reasonable juror could. Schlup said no reasonable juror would have. Isn't that correct?",
  "But I mean, it's would, not could.",
  "Could would imply a sufficiency of evidence possibility of analyzing it, but the would language excludes a sufficiency of evidence. The -- the would formulation says, in effect, what would the reasonable juror actually have done. Is that your understanding? I mean, is that your point?",
  "But wasn't the district court incorrect in that? Because as I understand it, there was evidence from one of the two witnesses who put in the confession evidence that she had gone to the sheriff's department to -- to tell them about the confession and had simply gotten a runaround and finally left. So as I understand it, the -- the record would not support the finding that -- that the -- the sources of evidence simply kept silent for over a decade.",
  "Well, is there any reason not -- did the -- did the district court explain that it was rejecting that element of the witnesses' testimonies?",
  "I know, but without getting to that point, it sounds as though the district court simply made a mistake, just forgot I suppose, the evidence that the witness didn't wait at all.",
  "Well, but one of the reasons for the finding of -- of incredibility was the decade or more of silence.",
  "Well, the -- tell -- help me out here. As -- as has been explored earlier, the confession referred to -- to some of the injuries on the body, but not to all of them. Were there -- were there other disparities between the confession and -- and the -- and other evidence?",
  "Well, but that -- that simply says if the -- it seems to me you're simply saying there would be sufficient evidence to go the one way rather than the other. And -- and you may well be right about that, but that certainly is not the reasonable doubt standard.",
  "But -- but may I interrupt you? What -- what about -- I want to just follow up on something that Justice Breyer alluded to and that is the significance of the DNA evidence. And I have tended to -- to think that a reasonable juror would look at it this way, but if I'm wrong, I -- I want you to comment on it. One of the -- I -- I assume, to begin with, that any reasonable juror would have found this evidence, the evidence of the semen stains, extremely significant because not only did the State argue rape as a -- as a motive, possible motive, but there was a specific finding of an aggravated circumstance that the murder occurred in the course of kidnapping and rape. I don't know of any evidence that would suggest an -- an independent kidnapping crime without the rape element under, you know, the circumstances of -- of this crime. So I'm -- I -- I assume that the reasonable juror, having come to the conclusion that that aggravating circumstance is true, found that a rape was being committed. If that juror had heard the DNA evidence, that juror would have said the only positive evidence that a rape was committed here would be evidence that pointed to the husband, not in fact to -- to the defendant House. And if -- if a juror had heard that evidence, it seems to me it is highly unlikely that any reasonable juror would have concluded that that aggravating circumstance was found, and I suppose that would play a -- a significant role in -- in the ultimate conclusion. Now, you have argued that the fact that the DNA evidence shows that it was the husband's fluids, not House's, doesn't conclusively prove that House didn't rape her, and of course, you're right. But my understanding is that there is no evidence from which one would reasonably infer that House did this. Now, what is -- what is your comment on that --",
  "-- analysis?",
  "In your pleadings, did you say he's an employer?",
  "Did you use the term employer?",
  "Okay.",
  "Was the word employer used in the pleadings?",
  "No. I'm just asking the really formal question. Was the word employer used to refer to your client at any point in the pleadings?",
  "Well, that -- that argument doesn't apply to absolute immunity cases, and yet in absolute immunity cases, once again, it's clear there's jurisdiction. There's simply immunity. The immunity doesn't depend on any particular facts.",
  "But we have to determine whether he's acting as a prosecutor. Sure. We have to determine whether the President was acting in a presidential capacity, but that's not the kind of fact inquiry that you were talking about with respect to the qualified immunity.",
  "But I -- I don't see why the same argument can't be made with respect to prosecutors. It is clear that if -- if an individual is acting in a prosecutorial capacity and enjoys the appointment as a prosecutor, that at least the -- the system -- we're not necessarily talking about Congress here. The system says there -- there should be, as a categorical matter, an -- an immunity from prosecution. And yet, that does not go to subject matter jurisdiction. And it seems to me that that is essentially the exact argument that you're making here, and I don't see why it should be any more sound here than it would be in the absolute immunity case.",
  "That's right.",
  "Well, why can't get they get the protections through summary judgment?",
  "Among other things, you -- you've got to do it up front.",
  "Well, if -- if we're worried about dragging people into litigation, I presume Congress didn't intend, as a -- as a general matter, to allow the -- the situation that we've got here. One party has been dragged through a piece of litigation and, having lost, has decided it wants to take another shot at getting out of the case. Surely you can't say that was within the contemplation of Congress' intent.",
  "My -- my point --",
  "-- my point is not --",
  "-- my point is not that Congress in some specific sense, when it establishes a jurisdictional requirement, does not intend the occasional costs that the system has to bear by virtue of treating that requirement as jurisdictional. My point simply is that if we are in -- in a situation in which it is not clear whether it's jurisdictional or not, and the issue can be raised, in effect, up front effectively through summary judgment, and in the alternative, can be treated -- and -- as -- as an ineffective fact element, and in the alternative, can be left, in effect, forever to be raised as a jurisdictional element. The fact that it can be treated effectively up front is one reason to think that Congress would probably have wanted that fact issue to be regarded not as jurisdictional but as elemental so that it can be gotten out of the way and the parties are not going to go through entire trials only to have the whole thing upset by a belated jurisdictional argument. That's my only point.",
  "How do -- how do we -- I mean, this was the problem I -- I had with -- with your -- your brief here, and it's the same problem Justice Ginsburg has. What kind of weight, what significance do we give to this obligation to keep the government informed? On the face of it, it seems like a -- an obligation that ought to get considerable weight. Everybody knows that if you own real estate, you've got to pay real estate taxes on it. You're going to have a hard time doing that if they don't know where to send the bill, and so on. So it seems like a very reasonable obligation for the government to put on you. What weight do we give that in -- in the analysis?",
  "And then that would be so even if there were no affirmative obligation on the property owner.",
  "You'd say, well, if they -- if they send the -- the notice to the last address they had, or if they send it -- since we're talking about real estate, maybe if they send it to the -- to the property, nothing wrong with that. So that's kind of a wash.",
  "No. But I want to know what Mr. -- I mean, it does not relieve it of some constitutional obligation, and we're trying to figure out what that is. And -- and the point of my question is in figuring out what it is, what significance do we give to the affirmative obligation on the part of the property owner to keep the government informed of the address?",
  "All right. Then -- then it has no significance ever because the -- the State has an obligation to use the best address it has, whether he's got an obligation to -- to keep the address updated or not. And -- and this is the -- the tough point for me with your case. It seems to me that your case depends on our saying the obligation to keep the -- the address current has absolutely no significance.",
  "But I take it in -- in this case -- I mean, I -- you're probably right that it would have -- it would have worked here, but I -- I take it that in the absence of that -- that hindsight, you would say that in -- in the regular case that simply posting notice on the house, after the letter is returned, would not be enough, that the -- that the posting on the house would be sufficient only if they had exhausted other efforts to get a better address so that in this case, going back to Justice Breyer's example, they -- they'd have to follow up whatever it is, the 18 G. Joneses or Gary Joneses that they could find in the phone book before they could then fall back and resort to posting on the house. Is -- do I understand you correctly?",
  "Would your argument be any different if there weren't a statutory obligation to keep the government informed of the -- of one's mailing address?",
  "Is there a provision of Arkansas law that if in fact they do track down the property owner and he is at an address different from the last address that he had given, that the expense of tracking him down may be charged to him, along with the delinquent taxes, penalties, and so on?",
  "So in practice the answer is no?",
  "Why isn't -- why isn't the simple answer to that concern to say, look, there's no way to tell in advance or, you know, by any general rule, at least not legislatively, how far they've got to go to try to find the correct address, but they know where the house is and they've got at that point to go to the house and put a notice on the door? That's simple, easy. Why -- why isn't that the answer?",
  "Mr. Bopp, right -- right there I guess I -- I have a problem with -- with your argument, and I just want to get it out. I went back and looked at some of the examples that were given at -- in -- in the McConnell case for parallels between what we -- what we thought was covered in those cases and -- and yours -- your case. And the -- the one which I -- I guessed was probably the closest was the -- was the advertisements there in -- in the McConnell case on the -- the lobbying on the Chinese trade relations. The basic message in -- in that case was China uses forced labor. The Congress of the United States is about to make it easier for -- for Chinese goods to get in here and for China to have a respectable trade status. And -- and it said, call Congressman Myrick, I think it was, in any case, a Member of Congress, and -- and say what you think. In this case, you're -- you're talking about a -- a filibuster, and you say, you know, they're filibustering nominees and they're not coming up to -- to a vote. Tell the two Senators in this State, Kohl and Feingold, that -- that you don't like this. The only difference that I could see basically between the two kinds of ads was that in the first one -- in -- in the Myrick ad, they actually gave the number of the -- of the congressional office to call and say, hey, don't do this. In this case, your clients did not give a -- a number. They gave a Web site to an organization. Insofar as I know, it doesn't have a number. Which gets me to the question. If the -- the Chinese trade relations ad was presumably validly subject to the act, I don't see why your client's ad is not, for the same reason, subject to the act and for the further reason that it doesn't even give a phone number to call -- to -- to lobby the people. So it seems to me that on stare decisis grounds, unless we're going to go back and simply reexamine McConnell to -- to -- from -- from scratch, that your clients fall within the general rule as -- as we held it in McConnell. So why doesn't precedent foreclose this?",
  "Yes, but you didn't even give their phone numbers.",
  "Okay. So if we accept that extra step, that's -- that gets you -- if -- if we accept the extra step that gets you parallel to the -- to the ad that we considered in McConnell.",
  "But if you are right --",
  "Then why didn't we have to go the other way in the Chinese trade relation example? I mean, everything --",
  "-- unless I'm missing something in your argument, everything you are saying in this argument could have been said with respect to that ad and, as Justice Breyer said, to a couple of others.",
  "Yes.",
  "And -- and we -- we cited some other examples as -- as examples that, on the face of it and on the face of the record, would -- would lawfully fall within the -- the general rule that we said Congress could prescribe.",
  "No, but the point --",
  "But I -- I don't want to cut you off from your Yellowtail argument, if -- if you want to make it, but it seems to me that the problem in this case is that your ad is very much like a non - Yellowtail ad. And the problem that we would have in accepting your argument is, number one, a problem of precedent and, number two, the problem that Justice Breyer raised that, again, we had dealt with in the prior case.",
  "No, no. Let me just finish my question.",
  "Once you get out of the sphere of -- of kind of sham ads that just hit you in your face, there isn't a practical way to tell the difference. There isn't a kind of magic formula. We rejected the magic word, or Congress rejected the magic word's approach. And therefore, Congress came up with a rule that it did within certain time limits, identified candidates, identified audiences. You can't do it within this period of time unless you do it through a PAC. What is different in your case from those paradigm examples in -- in McConnell?",
  "But Yellowtail --",
  "-- is -- is an ad of -- an obviously sham ad. The problem that we're dealing with --",
  "May -- may I finish?",
  "Excuse me. May I -- may I finish my question?",
  "May I finish my question? The -- the -- no one is saying that your ad in this case is an obviously sham ad like Yellowtail. Your ad in this case is one of those ads that it's difficult to deal with fairly. You can say, well, you know, it's an electioneering ad and you can say it's -- it's a lobbying ad. And -- and Congress decided how to deal with them. We said that's okay. Why doesn't --",
  "Yes, but why doesn't your ad fall within the reasoning that we used in approving -- on the facial challenge, in approving the statute?",
  "No -- no question about it.",
  "But your -- your as-applied --",
  "-- challenge has got to have something different about it, something unusual that says this is why my ad does not fall within the general rule. And that's what I'm trying to get at.",
  "Wasn't the Chinese trade issue currently pending?",
  "So that's no difference.",
  "Sure.",
  "May I interrupt? Because I'm - -",
  "-- your time is running out.",
  "Is my understanding correct that, on your reading, State class actions of less than 50 parties are also left unpreempted?",
  "Okay.",
  "So - -",
  "-- individual actions and small State class actions.",
  "Well, what do you make of - -",
  "Well, then - -",
  "-- what do you make of the legislative history? I mean, your friend on the other side pointed out that there was very clear testimony to the effect that if the statute passed, with the text that we're dealing with, that it would, indeed, cut out a series of claims.",
  "I think, Mr. Dreeben, at the end of the day, I agree with you on the particularity argument, but do you take the -- does the Government take the position that the -- that the -- that a valid warrant need not contain an indication of the time within which it may be served, executed?",
  "As far as --",
  "But -- but, Mr. Dreeben, there's an ongoing obligation of reasonableness in the manner of which the -- in -- in the manner in which the search is carried out. But unless every officer who -- who acts under the authority of the warrant is aware of the probable cause evidence and can make a judgment when that evidence either is stale or, in this case, has not yet ripened, then in fact there is no way for an officer to make that kind of what you're calling the reasonableness judgment in the execution of the warrant. He simply doesn't have the factual background for it, and that's where the timing -- we'll call it -- the timing clause comes in because at least an officer who may not know the probable cause behind it all -- at least an officer who has a warrant that says, you may search between times X and Y, or a warrant that says, upon the occurrence of event X and time Y, has a -- a rough and sound idea of when he can act. But if that's not in the warrant, the officer cannot make that judgment. He doesn't know the probable cause necessarily and he doesn't know the time.",
  "It -- it was -- I take it it was, in fact, not attached but it was somewhere on the premises.",
  "So an officer who picked up the warrant would not be able to tell necessarily. If he said, hey, has somebody got the affidavit, they could have brought it forward and he could have found out. But if -- if somebody didn't know where the affidavit was, he wouldn't have any way of knowing.",
  "Yes, but doesn't that simply -- isn't the analogy there that when a -- when a search warrant says you may -- you may pick up implements of drug traffic, all it covers is drug traffic. It doesn't cover coffee, tea, and -- and milk. In -- in the case of the electronic surveillance, they're supposed to record criminal conversations and -- but not others.",
  "But those -- those are judgments about facts that they are finding. They are not judgments about probable cause or the moment at which the warrant becomes valid.",
  "Well, it is. The -- the moment -- the triggering event is the event that determines that the probable cause determination is, in fact, true now.",
  "And his judgment, though, is there will be probable cause when the triggering event occurs.",
  "And so the triggering --",
  "-- the triggering event has a probable cause implication, which the selection of objects to be seized does not have.",
  "Well, he's saying two things. There is probable cause to believe that what we're calling the triggering event will occur, and there is probable -- and when that triggering event occurs, there will be probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime may be found and seized at such and such a place. There are two determinations.",
  "And exactly the same thing would be true if they had stated the triggering event clearly somewhere in -- in the warrant. The -- the argument here is that the triggering event was stated in the affidavit.",
  "Yes, but they're doing it for a functional reason. The functional reason is that if you put the poison in the adjacent wetland, it's going to get into the navigable water. Exactly the same argument can be made as you go further and further up the tributaries, and it seems to me that once you concede, as I think you have to, that there can be a regulation that goes beyond literally navigable water at the point at which the -- the pollutant is added, then you have to follow the same logic right up through the watershed to -- to any point at which a pollutant, once added, will eventually get into the navigable water.",
  "Then -- then you have to accept the fact that -- that Congress cannot effectively regulate the navigable -- the -- the condition of the navigable water itself because if all the -- the -- let's -- let's assume there's a class of -- of evil polluters out there who just want to wreck the -- the navigable waters of the United States. All they have to do is get far enough upstream and they can dump anything they want to. It will eventually get into the navigable water, and Congress can't do anything about it on your theory.",
  "So you're -- you're going to -- you -- you then want to draw a distinction between the dredge and fill addition and, let's say, a -- a conventional synthetic poison.",
  "You mean on -- on -- in every -- in every case then, I mean, Congress would have to -- I'm sorry -- a scientist would have to analyze the molecules and -- and trace them up, and so long as they could -- could trace it to a specific discharge, they could get at it, but otherwise they couldn't? I mean, that -- you know, you know what I'm getting at. That obviously would -- would totally thwart the regulation.",
  "Yes, but doesn't the reference to tributary make it relatively plain that what the Court was getting at was the impossibility of drawing a functional distinction between wetlands and tributaries on the one hand, navigable waters on the other, when the purpose of the regulation is to protect the purity of the ultimate navigable water? And isn't the inclusion of the reference to tributaries an indication that it said if we want to attain the objective, which is clearly constitutional, then we have got to recognize these means, i.e., regulation of -- of pollution in wetlands and tributaries, in order to reach that objective? Isn't that the reasoning that is apparent from what Justice Ginsburg just -- just read to you?",
  "Well, it's -- except for the -- it seems to me except for -- for your -- your argument is -- is fine except for one problem. And that is, if we -- if we assume that Congress was being as -- as cautious as you suggest, then Congress' caution, in effect, was -- was allowing an end run around the regulation for the reasons we went into a moment ago. All you've got to do is -- is dump the pollutant further -- far enough upstream in the watershed and you get away scot-free. And it's very difficult to believe that Congress could have intended that.",
  "Well, do they have to make this on a plot-by-plot basis, or can they make a categorical judgment that even in cases in which, you know, there's a berm, as there is here, when the water is high, it spills over? And if the categorical judgment is sound, do you have an exception because they haven't proven it with respect to your particular lot?",
  "Where do you get that exception?",
  "And the -- and the -- but I mean, what I'm getting at is the traditional test is the basis for a categorical judgment. Your land falls within the general category. Your argument is I should not be subject to it, to the statute, because of the general category. I should be subject to it only if they prove specifically that the water spills over in rainy periods in my particular lot. In other words, you're saying there's got to be a specific connection as opposed to a categorical judgment. And my question is what under the act supports that view.",
  "So -- so your -- maybe what you're saying is we have shown or the record shows that this doesn't fit within the category because it never spills over or whatever. Is that your argument?",
  "Where are you reading from?",
  "Right.",
  "Is the report in the -- is the subsequent report in the record somewhere?",
  "And again, where --",
  "Where are you?",
  "And Justice Stevens' question I think in -- in that framework is -- is this. If it will result in discharge after the project, is it a water of the United States now?",
  "Then -- then Congress has passed a statute that says we'll lock the barn after the horse is stolen. I mean, that -- maybe that's what it did, but that's -- that would be a very odd thing for it to do, wouldn't it?",
  "Well, it -- it would do so in -- in cases of -- I guess, of the -- the sorts of -- of new proposed actions that require the -- the Corps to get into it in the first place. But I also assume that it would leave lots of -- of water pollution regulation to the States. I don't see that it would displace the States.",
  "But you said -- in response to Justice Kennedy's question, you said that there was nothing, I think, as you put it, in the exiting of the water that was significantly different that -- or that we could peg as significantly different. But that seems to me to be at odds with your answer to the Chief Justice's question about the barrel, because the exiting of the water from the barrel and the exiting of the water from the dam are exactly the same. And if one is a discharge, I don't see why the other isn't a discharge.",
  "Then it isn't the exiting that you're getting at. And I --",
  "I mean, it seems to me -- and I don't want to make a joke, but I think you're on to something when you talk about the exiting, because the word \"discharge,\" as we commonly use it, is a word that describes how you get rid of something. And how you get rid of something, it seems to me, is exactly the same, whether you're pouring the barrel over the bank or whether pouring the barrel, as it were, through the turbine after impounding it, it is the -- everybody's been quoting dictionary definitions -- it's the \"flowing out.\" The flowing out is the same with the barrel as it is with the dam.",
  "And that seems to me where I have trouble with your argument.",
  "Well, as I understand it, in some or all of these dams, at the point of discharge, there isn't any river down there. It's dry. It's -- the bed, in effect, has been deprived of the river by the impoundment, so that you're not simply, as it were, taking, you know, one spoonful out here and dropping it into a river -- putting the spoonful back into a river that's flowing there, because it isn't flowing there, as a result of your dam.",
  "Well, isn't --",
  "-- isn't the answer to your question that a great number of those usages that you refer to are uses that refer to the discharge of pollutants? And there is a good -- there are good reasons in the statute -- and we have recognized them - - to say that when you discharge a pollutant, you are adding something that wasn't there before? But when the statute, in this case, is using \"discharge\" without a reference to \"pollutant,\" it makes perfectly good linguistic sense to construe it just as the Court has done.",
  "Well, maybe it's --",
  "-- \"reinforcing,\" and maybe it's \"changing.\" I mean, you're characterizing it one way. We start with a different canon of meaning, and that is that we look to the words around which, in connection with which, the word is used. In here, it's being used without certain modifiers or descriptive conditions. In other cases, it is being used with them. And that's a good reason to think that probably the word is intended to mean something different in those situations.",
  "No, but your argument, I thought, was simply this, that it uses \"discharge\" in, you know, X number -- I forget how many you had -- and it's perfectly clear that in most of those instances it requires an addition; and, therefore, it should be construed as requiring it here. My point was that in a great many of those instances, the statute is not merely using the word in isolation; it's using it in connection with a couple of other words, like \"discharge a pollutant.\" And it, therefore, number one, makes sense to construe \"discharge of a pollutant\" differently from \"discharge.\" That's the -- that's the only point.",
  "The only point is, you can't simply argue from the fact that the word occurs somehow X number of times to the conclusion that it has to mean the same thing every time it's used.",
  "Because that isn't what they mean. I mean, for example, if somebody puts a stick in the middle of the river, no one -- no one is claiming that the water that flows around the stick is being discharged. I mean, there are a lot -- I don't know whether anyone wants to put a stick in the river, but - -",
  "-- there are things you can do that clearly would not activate the Corps' interpretation here.",
  "Would you agree that if the -- if somebody with property on each side wanted to build a dam -- I'm sorry, wanted to build a bridge to connect his property, and he needed to put a post in the middle of the river to support the bridge, that there would be no discharge of water occasioned by putting the post in there?",
  "Why, if -- you may answer.",
  "Didn't -- didn't that case involved the -- a violation there -- involve the addition of a pollutant? And there was no addition of a pollutant, because the water was equally polluted on each side. Wasn't that the --",
  "-- the case?",
  "Yes.",
  "So, I take it your ultimate answer is, no, a State could not, in effect, eliminate hydropower from --",
  "-- development.",
  "I'm not interested -- I'm asking for an answer to my question. I take it, based on your further answer to Justice Alito, that your answer to the first question is, no, a State could not, in effect, eliminate all hydropower from -- development from its rivers.",
  "And you don't think there would be any conflict with the FERC scheme if you did that? You don't think there would be any conflict between the Federal policy embodied in the Power Act and in the State law?",
  "In other words, Miccosukee was concerned not with molecules, but with chemical composition. The chemical composition was the same in this body and in that body, and, in that sense, there was no addition --",
  "Well, that --",
  "Yes.",
  "No. But with respect, I -- isn't the -- the term that they use -- and I was going to ask essentially the same question. The term that the court uses is raise a reasonable inference of his innocence. And I will -- I will grant you this. When I read that, it said -- I thought to myself it sounds as though they are saying he must present evidence or make a showing, a preliminary showing, that it is more probable than not that he is innocent despite the State's evidence. But they never spell that out, and is it spelled out anywhere?",
  "What if the -- what if the court says, we will weigh it to the extent of determining whether, in light of the State's case, the proffered evidence, if accepted, would pass the laugh test? That's weighing. Is -- is that -- is that legitimate?",
  "But that does go -- somehow that goes beyond mere relevance. You can't say that the -- I don't think you can say that the existence of the million dollars in life insurance is irrelevant. It's just that it doesn't prove much unless it can be combined with certain other kinds of evidence. And when you say you've got a standard that looks into that, then you have crossed the line from mere relevance to probative force, haven't you?",
  "No. I -- I grant you that. But to say that the only test is relevance seems to be too strong.",
  "Mr. Zelenka, do you -- do you agree with the characterization that your brother has given, largely by way of quotation from the opinion in this case, that the rule of admissibility that -- that the -- that the court followed in -- or that the supreme court approved in this case would have required the defendant to show to a degree of probability, in light of all the evidence, including the forensic evidence, that he was innocent as a condition of -- of admitting the evidence?",
  "But, well, what do you -- I mean, your -- your brother's strongest point is this statement, and I'm quoting from page 365 of the joint appendix where the -- where the opinion is set out, at -- at the top of the page, the second sentence. He simply cannot overcome the forensic evidence against him to raise a reasonable inference of his own innocence. What could that mean other than a probability that he is innocent in light of all the evidence, including the forensic evidence?",
  "Yes, but what does it mean? I mean, I've given you a suggestion as to what it seems to mean on a straightforward reading, and -- and I take it you disagree with that. But can you explain how it could mean something else?",
  "Well, it's -- it's true. When they -- on the -- on the previous page, the bottom of 364, they -- they cite -- they first quote Gregory and then they cite Gay and they characterize, I guess, the two together as -- well, they say, in Gay, we held that where there is strong evidence of an appellant's guilt, especially where there is strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party's guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the appellant's own innocence. It doesn't use the word overcome which it uses on the other page.",
  "But even without the word overcome, what -- what can reasonable inference of innocence mean, considered in light of the other evidence in the case, if it doesn't mean something like a probability of -- of innocence?",
  "Well, the trial judge also kept it out, didn't he, because he believed there was -- there was no penal interest exception to the hearsay rule?",
  "But -- but then you get to the --",
  "I'm sorry. Then you get to the -- the South Carolina Supreme Court, and they don't keep it out on -- on grounds of -- of threshold reliability.",
  "Okay. And I -- I take it what you will do, in the course of your second point, is tell us the answer to this question, that if we do not accept the overcome by reasonable inference formulation that is here, what would be an acceptable formulation because I think that's what you -- you say you're getting to. But that would be very helpful to us.",
  "Well, one of the problems is I don't know what it requires. On -- on the -- on the second page of the opinion that I quoted, it is used with the word overcome, which certainly suggests that it is supposed to raise a probability of innocence in light of all the evidence. Sometimes it is used without overcome, as it was earlier in the opinion. I don't know what they mean by inference. Do they mean evidence from which one might reasonably conclude, from which one -- there is a reasonable possibility of concluding? I just don't know what the terms mean. So I hope you'll give us a suggested formulation with -- with terms that -- that are defined that -- that you and the States that you represent would -- would think was an acceptable and constitutional standard.",
  "Well, I included several. Which -- which one --",
  "Okay.",
  "What --",
  "-- what do you make of --",
  "What do you make of the pragmatic argument that seems to cut through all of your objections? The pragmatic argument is both in favor of complete discretion and of suspicionless search, that the in terrorem effect of knowing that these searches can occur at any moment, in fact, discourages recidivism.",
  "What's your response to that?",
  "Apart from --",
  "Apart from the lack of popularity of the State's view --",
  "-- do we have -- do we have any empirical evidence that bears on the in terrorem argument?",
  "No, I --",
  "-- I realize that. But, beyond that, do we have any empirical evidence, one way or the other?",
  "I take it --",
  "-- the answer is --",
  "-- we don't have any empirical evidence, one way or the other, apart from the fact that California stands out in its system. Is that correct?",
  "No, I --",
  "-- I know it, but I've said, about three times, that I want to get beyond the peculiar position of California to any other empirical evidence that cuts for you or against you. And I take it there really isn't --",
  "Okay. The officer says, \"I'm searching to see whether the person has any evidence of crime on him.\" For example, whether he has any drugs on him. Law enforcement purpose: supervisory, I suppose. They want to know whether their -- whether their parolees are committing offenses. And yet, that reason would apply to everyone virtually all the time. So, it doesn't seem to be a limitation at all. What -- am I -- am I missing something?",
  "Well, how does the limitation work? The guy is on 1st Street, and an officer says, you know, \"I recognize this person is a parolee, and I have a law enforcement objective. Is the person committing a crime? Is the -- is the person a recidivist? Is the person violating parole?\" So, he searches him. The person gets to 2nd Street, another officer does the same thing. Three hours later, a third officer does the same thing. In each case, it seems to me, their justification would not fall afoul of the arbitrary, capricious, or harassment standard. It's not coordinated. They have a -- both a parole and a law enforcement objective. Why is there any limitation, then, on the right to search?",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "No. No, but let's get behind the rhetoric. Is there any reason my hypothetical could not, in fact, turn out to be true?",
  "Apart from the unlikelihood of all those police officers out there. But, leaving that aside, is there -- is there any reason, in the standard, that my hypothetical could not be true?",
  "Okay. I mean, let's assume the police are telling the truth, and the judge says, \"Sure.\" So, there is no limitation. And it sounds to me, then, as though about the only limitation that would be enforceable would be the limitation against harassment. If one officer did it every 15 minutes to the same person, or if there were a departmental systematic policy saying, you know, \"Get so-and-so,\" that I can understand as being a limitation. But I don't see any other limit.",
  "No, I realize --",
  "-- but do you --",
  "-- do you agree that there is not any practical limitation, other than the harassment limitation?",
  "Well, maybe --",
  "-- maybe it is. But what's the answer to my question? Is that, in practical terms, the only limitation?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, let's assume -- let's assume that the cavity search is demanded at the bus station, and the officer says, \"We know that drugs get transported by people who ingest them in the balloons, and they get on buses and they travel back and forth from city A to city B.\" Any reason that that would run afoul of arbitrary and capricious?",
  "All I'm telling you is, he's at a bus station. The facts are that a lot of people who travel on buses are drug couriers. This person is a parolee. Would that run afoul of the -- of any arbitrary and capricious limitation?",
  "Well, sure, but the officer says, \"All right. I'm taking you down to the station for a cavity search.\"",
  "Well, you're -- I'm asking you to be the finder of fact for me. This is the officer's explanation. This is the factual -- set of factual premises on which he acts. Has he violated the arbitrary and capricious limitation?",
  "Well, I --",
  "-- I thought the assumption of your answer to my question a moment ago was that there was no such limitation, so far as California is concerned.",
  "Well, sure. But we -- the manner, in this case, is, they take him down to the station, so that they're not going through this in the middle of a crowded bus terminal. But the point of the question was, any parolee at a bus terminal could be subjected to this demand for search, and I thought your answer was, yes, he could be. And now, in response to Justice Scalia's question, you're saying, \"Well, there may be some limitation.\" So, which is it?",
  "Do --",
  "Even apart from the -- what -- the lack of evidence for any change since the Reyes decision, do we have any empirical evidence, perhaps involving a control group, about the likelihood of the -- this liberal search policy in reducing recidivism?",
  "What --",
  "What would you say -- assuming that we're beyond Rule 4, what would you say simply to a rule that said, \"Yes, we recognize that there remains a discretion -- not an obligation, but a discretion -- on the part of the court to raise this.\" But, just as a -- as a general rule, judicial efficiency is better served by avoiding the use of discretion unless the State, in fact, raises the limitations issue, itself. The courts have a lot of things to do, and they shouldn't be spending their time canvassing pleadings to see whether there might be an issue that the State missed; so that in the absence of some extraordinary circumstance, it would be an abuse of discretion to exercise it as the -- as the Circuit suggests it should have been exercised here. What would you say to that position?",
  "What --",
  "What, then, would be the significance here of the fact that the State conceded that there was no limitations problem? In a case like that, wouldn't it be a good rule to avoid judicial inquiry?",
  "No, but it bears on the exercise of discretion.",
  "That would be an abuse.",
  "Why didn't Arkansas --",
  "Then why don't we just send you back to do that?",
  "I mean, why are we going through this -- this proceeding here?",
  "No. I -- I realize that. But at -- at the end of the day, you want your money, and -- and I don't see why you can't get your money simply by going back into the State court. Maybe -- maybe lapse of time bars you at this point. But presumably you could have avoided all of this by simply saying, we didn't agree to the settlement. We're still here. We want our -- the -- the remainder of our money.",
  "Well, wouldn't it have been easier to do that than come to the Supreme Court of the United States?",
  "Why isn't her response to that argument, look, I've -- I've assigned you my rights? There's no question about that. I'm also willing to give you whatever the amount is that they allocated. If -- if you want the difference, you've got the assignment. Go ahead and sue for it.",
  "I mean, that would be consistent with the -- with the statute. Wouldn't it?",
  "No, no, but I -- I'm not saying that it -- it does. The State can do nothing if it wants to. But the statute that you just quoted requires her to assign to the State her right to recover for -- for her medical expenses. She says, I have done that. In fact, I've done that as a matter of law, under Arkansas law. You've got your assignment. Number two, I'm giving you the portion of the recovery that I got with respect to medical payments. You can have it. Now, there's a difference between what you paid and what I got attributable to medical payments, an amount, by the way, which you stipulated was correct. So if you want the difference, sue for it. Go ahead. It's fine with me. Why isn't that the answer?",
  "Right.",
  "But you're -- you're basing your argument on this statute.",
  "And let me come back to my question. This statute simply says that she will assign her rights to recover for the medicals. She has done that. She has also given you the portion of the settlement which she and you agree is attributable to the medicals. Why isn't the statute satisfied if she simply says, you've got your assignment? If you want the difference between what I've given you and your out-of-pocket expense, sue. You have the assignment. You have the right. Go ahead and sue for it.",
  "Well, it seems to me that that is an entirely different argument. The question is what does the statute require her to do and entitle you to do. And I don't see why, under the statute, the statute is not satisfied if you simply sue for the difference under -- under your assignment of her rights.",
  "Doesn't the assignment allow you to bring a lawsuit?",
  "Then why don't you bring it? I mean, the answer to the -- to the statutory point, it seems to me, is you've got your assignment. If you're not whole yet, sue.",
  "So what? You can sue too.",
  "Why is it her incentive to reduce recovery? She may not be getting anything more, but why does she have incentive to reduce it?",
  "I -- I thought she and the --",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "Yes. Insofar as the suit against the defendant is concerned, she's not -- she does not have an interest in minimizing.",
  "And I suppose if the insurance company heard from the State that the State continued to -- would continue to pursue its claim, in the absence either of a more generous assignment or a more generous settlement, there might not have been a settlement.",
  "Roughly speaking -- I -- I'm -- there may be a few dollars and cents that -- that aren't accounted for here. But roughly speaking, is it fair to say that the amount that -- that you and -- and, for that matter, the State attribute to the medicals out of the total settlement is the same proportion that the claim for medicals bore to the total original claim?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well --",
  "Okay. In a case like this, then it would be in the interest of someone like your client to make a claim not of $3 million but of $6 million. Then if you settle for exactly the same amount of money you settled for here, the percentage of the medicals -- the amount attributed to medicals would be exactly one-half of what it is here.",
  "Well, in the original State lawsuit, did you have to state an addendum?",
  "Where did -- then -- then tell me again where we got the $3 million figure.",
  "And is -- is that in -- is that in writing, along with the allocation --",
  "Well, I mean, is that part of the stipulation?",
  "Okay.",
  "But there's nothing in the assignment provision as such that limits it, is there?",
  "Well, it said -- I'm looking at 1396k(a)(1)(A), which refers to assign to the State any rights to payment for medical care from any third party.",
  "There's no limitation in that.",
  "Do you -- when -- when you make that point, that on this record the -- the claimed interests are not compelling or not proven, would you have us leave the door open for a greater degree of proof? For example, take the -- the problem of candidate time. The lower the donation limits are, the -- the more donations there have got to be, and -- and there's -- there's plenty of comment, particularly in some of the amicus briefs, on the amount of time that political candidates generally spend scrounging around for money. If we decided the case your way, would the door be left open for a more impressive and compelling record on this issue?",
  "But you also say, on this record.",
  "So I -- I take it your point then on the combined corruption/competition for money problem is that there isn't any record that would support it.",
  "Right, but you're saying this combination cannot be a compelling interest as a matter of law, consistent with the First Amendment. Is that correct?",
  "Yes.",
  "It -- it was pointed out in -- in one of the briefs -- and I -- I didn't go back and check it myself, but I'd like your comment. It was pointed out in one of the briefs that the limits in Vermont were substantially close to or even -- even higher than the -- than the limits in the Missouri scheme, out of which the Shrink litigation grew. Do you know whether that is correct?",
  "It always -- it always does, yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, take the whole schedule in Missouri.",
  "Mr. Bopp, toward the end of your brief, you -- you make the argument that if we accepted the State's position in this case, we implicitly would have accepted the position that totally -- totally publicly funded elections would be constitutional. And -- and I -- I realize your -- your concern there was with expenditure limits, obviously, not contribution limits. You didn't come out and say it, but I -- I assume your position is that that would be unconstitutional per se. A totally publicly funded scheme would be unconstitutional per se.",
  "Yes.",
  "And -- and its unconstitutionality would rest on the limitation on expenditure, in effect?",
  "Oh, yes, yes.",
  "But on -- on your view, if -- if there were a -- a mandatory publicly funded scheme and the -- the limits on expenditure were very high -- it was a very generous scheme. They gave them lots of money -- it would still be unconstitutional because there would be -- I -- I take it on your view, because there would be an elimination of any way to participate by contributing. Is that correct?",
  "Mr. Sorrell, would you go back to the -- your comment on -- on average expenditures? Do we know from the record how many of the -- how many of the contests, on the basis of which the average was calculated, were contests in which there was a -- a contested primary?",
  "But it's not going back on the expenditure limit.",
  "I mean, the problem, I mean, I was getting at and Justice Ginsburg is getting at, Judge Winter got at it. The -- the problem is -- is the -- the total limitation on an election cycle, including the primary, when the primary involves a challenge so that the challenger has an uphill fight presumably to start with in the primary. And if he's going to maintain an effective uphill fight in the primary and he's lucky enough to win, he's going to get to the general election and he's going to be broke. That's -- I mean, that's -- that's the problem that we're concerned with.",
  "May -- may I ask --",
  "Well, you know, I looked at your -- the -- the references in your brief for that proposition, and I did not see them borne out. You referred to a -- a footnote in the district court opinion which, in turn, refers to the remark of a sponsor of the amendment that -- that resulted in the presumption being in the law. And the only thing that was attributed to the sponsor was that the presumption should be regarded as rebuttable. The -- the footnote in the statement did not indicate that the presumption was a disappearing presumption, once the other side went forward with any evidence. So I don't see, based on your -- your citations, that the presumption goes away simply by -- by one party going forward with evidence.",
  "The -- the point is what if we don't have that simple of a situation. Let -- let me ask you this. Maybe we can short-circuit this. I mean, do you represent as an -- as a statement of Vermont law that this Court should decide the case on the assumption that the presumption is a disappearing presumption, once evidence is offered against it?",
  "Okay.",
  "But none -- none of this has to be done for you to win this case, does it?",
  "Then I -- I wish we'd stick to this case.",
  "Does this case involve anything more than the enforcement of an in personam tort judgment if you are to win?",
  "Isn't -- isn't it the case that she can have her claim and she can prove her claim, but she may not be able to collect the judgment unless the living trust is invalid? But that's not what we're litigating here, is it?",
  "Why does she have to show that is invalid as distinct from showing that another trust, favorable to her, was not created and it was not created because of the tortious conduct of your client?",
  "Well, let me -- let me stop you there because this is something I didn't understand in the brief. You speak of the Texas probate court determining the validity of an estate plan.",
  "I take it the Texas probate court determined the validity of a will here.",
  "It determined the validity of -- of a pourover trust. Is that correct?",
  "All right.",
  "All right. Isn't it the case that the two Texas determinations can be respected and still, in the Federal court, enter a judgment for tort liability against your client?",
  "That's in -- you may be right on that, but that's not what -- what we're here for.",
  "But when you speak of estate plan, you are -- you seem to be talking in global terms; i.e., that there could have been no other disposition of assets by the decedent or on behalf of the decedent except those which the Texas court is recognizing, the trust, the will. Is that what the Texas court does, or does the Texas court say, the will is good, the trust is good?",
  "In other words, is it preclusive of everything else? That's what I'm getting at.",
  "Yes, but her claim is assume it's been made irrevocable. I just want some money from this guy.",
  "That's all she's saying, as I understand it. She -- she can -- as I understand her cause of action, it can proceed on the assumption the will is valid, the -- the trust is valid. Just give me the money that I would have had.",
  "No, I don't -- I don't see your -- your logic there. Of course, it protects the succession process, but it does not follow that everything that implicates a succession process falls within the probate exception.",
  "If -- if there had been a joint bank account, the succession would have been determined based on the validity of the joint bank account, and that certainly wouldn't have fallen within the probate exception.",
  "Does -- does Texas law provide that a -- a living trust must be executed and administered with the formalities of a will?",
  "Then -- then you have to get beyond our probate exception cases to cover the living trust.",
  "What's --",
  "What's the difference?",
  "But that's the case --",
  "That's the case --",
  "-- in the tax example. I mean, the taxes are apportioned. The part of the tax -- or the business that would be taxable in the State gets taxed at a lower rate. Businesses say, \"Gee, let's do more business in Ohio and pay less taxes.\" In this case, they're getting, effectively, taxed at a lower rate, because they make an investment in Ohio.",
  "Well, I --",
  "Yes, but what you call --",
  "-- what you call discrimination is any differential. In fact, in this case, the effective tax differential is a quid pro quo for an investment. And, basically, your argument boils down to saying that there's discrimination whenever the State offers a quid pro quo for an advantage and somebody decides not to take advantage of it.",
  "That's not discrimination. That is simply the effect of a free choice, and any business is free to make that choice.",
  "Oh.",
  "I could -- I could see your argument, if, for example, in the tax exchange case, there was not taxation being made of the out-of-State transactions. But that was the case in --",
  "-- the tax. And there is -- there's no such parallel here.",
  "Except the criterion is not mere in-State activity. The criterion is a particular in-State activity, an investment, as to which the credit is a quid pro quo. And the opportunity to make that investment is open to every business, presently in-State, presently out-of-State, no matter where domiciled.",
  "Now, with respect to section 2, what is -- what is your position on the relationship between the predominant political motivation and the existence and nonexistence of a section 2 violation?",
  "If -- let me put it another way.",
  "If -- if you otherwise demonstrate a section 2 violation, is the political motivation a defense?",
  "No.",
  "But -- but are you saying --",
  "Mr. Smith, may -- may I ask you to comment on -- on one problem that I have with your position that has nothing whatever to do with the -- with the fact that there was a -- a judicial redrawing in the first place here? If I understand your argument, you're saying that a -- a districting that takes place prior to the report of a new decennial census, which is done for purely political reasons, maximizing political advantage, is invalid for that reason, I guess under the Equal Protection Clause.",
  "And yet, I take it it's also your position that if the districting is done in response to the new decennial figures so that there's a need to do something to conform to one person/one vote, that there is nothing illegitimate about political motivation, at least up to some point --",
  "-- in -- in drawing the lines at that time. How can we in principle say that the motivation which is legitimate in 1991 is somehow constitutionally illegitimate and dispositive in 1995?",
  "But your answer, both to the Justice Kennedy and -- and to me, ultimately comes down, I guess, to saying that political partisanship alone, undiluted, unadulterated by any other motivations, is per se wrong.",
  "All right. Let's -- let's assume that the -- that the partisans who do the mid - term redistricting candidly say, we are doing this for partisan reasons, but we recognize limits on what we can do. And the limits are the traditional ones, compactness, et cetera. Let us assume that there is, in fact, evidence of a good faith effort at least to conform to those districting principles. Under those circumstances, is the mid-term redistricting equally illegitimate?",
  "Well, that may be, but how about the question that I posed?",
  "Okay.",
  "No. I'm -- in a way, I'm making it easy for you. I'm saying, look, they're -- they're saying we think we can get a better deal for our party, but we are respecting these districting principles. Equally illegitimate?",
  "The difficulty I have with that is that it is -- it is impossible -- I think you would agree. It is impossible -- and may, indeed -- let's assume undesirable -- to take partisanship out of a political process. And -- and if partisanship pure and simple, even though subject to the discipline of districting principles, is -- is illegitimate, then I don't see why that does not imply the illegitimacy of any districting at any time.",
  "This would be at -- least your criterion, whether we accept it or not, would -- would be more administrable if we're dealing with the elimination of a district than if we were dealing with the question of creating one. Do you take the position that the NAAC brief does that there really should be distinct criteria, depending on whether you're asking to create something new or preserve something which has been in place?",
  "But is it -- is it wrong under the Equal Protection Clause or is it wrong under section 2?",
  "No. But on Justice -- Justice Scalia's hypothesis, there is no intention to remove Latinos as Latinos. And maybe the answer to that is if you're removing Latinos, it does not matter whether your motivation is invidious or not. I don't know whether that's your position. But it -- if that's not your position, then I think there's got to be a difference between the -- the Equal Protection Clause analysis and the section 2 analysis.",
  "Well, is that because there were no other Democrats who could have been identified and taken out?",
  "Well, isn't -- isn't one answer that we were doing it, number one, because we wanted to protect the incumbent and we also had to use race to avoid a section 5 problem and a section 2 claim? You've got to use race for those purposes.",
  "So you could have used that reasoning to create a district in the first place, but you cannot use that reasoning to create an offset district in the second place at the same time that you're trying to protect an incumbent. I think that's what you're saying.",
  "In other words, you're saying that would be implausible as a section 2/section 5 justification, regardless of when you're doing it. Is that --",
  "Yes.",
  "Why -- in -- in --",
  "In -- in contrast to that, however, you could not make that argument or -- or that response with respect to -- to district 24, the district in which the -- the Black vote was -- was cracked. And in response to earlier questions from Justice Stevens, you -- you mentioned there were a number of motivations for dividing it up the way it did, and -- and yet, as you also acknowledge, those differing motivations don't answer a -- a section 2 argument. What is your answer to the section 2 claim?",
  "But -- but following Georgia and Ashcroft, isn't -- isn't that a possibility that we should consider as a satisfaction of what has come to be known as the -- you know, the first of -- of the Gingles factors?",
  "But it -- it is not inconsistent with Georgia and Ashcroft to say that for -- for much the same reason, States have less flexibility in cracking influence districts once they have been established.",
  "What -- what do you say to Ms. Perales' argument that the -- the numbers are just too precise to have been reflective of anything but a racial motivation, and that, therefore, the -- the district court's finding was clearly erroneous?",
  "Aren't they equally precise here?",
  "I -- I misspoke. Okay.",
  "Do you have any --",
  "Well, in doing that, do you distinguish, for example, between the -- the expectation that lies behind a merely excited utterance, on the one hand, and the expectation or lack of expectation that would qualify -- that would be the case in a -- in a true res gestae statement in the very strict sense? So that, you know, if -- if the attack had occurred 30 minutes beforehand and -- and the victim is saying on the telephone to the police, Adrian is trying to kill me, that would be -- that -- that wouldn't -- would not be admissible, I take it, on -- on your view under the Confrontation Clause. And yet, if in the course of the 911 call, Adrian was battering the -- the -- you know, the victim over the head with something and she blurted out the same statement, he's trying to kill me, would the -- would the latter be admissible in your case --",
  "-- under your theory?",
  "I'm sorry. I misspoke. On your theory.",
  "So that the answer to my question is there would be no distinction between the merely excited utterance 30 seconds later and the utterance in the course of in -- in my hypo.",
  "Did -- did you subpoena her at that point?",
  "How -- how often does this happen? In other words, are we being asked to, in effect, on your part to -- to recognize or to derive a special rule for cases which, at least numerically, are sports?",
  "But -- but I'm talking about the witness who is not merely reluctant, but simply doesn't show up and you make reasonable efforts and you -- and you can't find the witness. How often does that happen?",
  "Has it happened to you before?",
  "But you don't know how many times.",
  "So we're not -- I take it we're not in a position whereby if we hold against you, we are, in effect, nullifying the possibility of enforcing domestic violence laws by criminal process.",
  "Isn't -- isn't the problem, though -- I mean, as Crawford said, those examples defined the core. They were the paradigms, but they didn't purport to cover the whole ground. And it seems to me that your argument is to turn the core into the exclusive examples, in which case the Confrontation Clause in the real world is never going to apply.",
  "If that's your criterion, are you going to draw the distinction between the letter and the tape recording?",
  "Well, let's answer it. Is -- is the tape recording like the letter so that it -- it's inadmissible?",
  "But your answer, I take it, assumes that the Framers had no concern with the capacity of the court to test the -- the validity or the truth of the statement.",
  "Well, but -- no. But I'm -- I'm not talking about outrageous circumstances in which the -- the statement was taken. I'm talking about the capacity of the court, by whatever means, to test the truth of that statement once it is placed before the court. And I understood your argument to Justice Breyer to assume that that testing function was not within the contemplation of the Framers.",
  "So that your -- your -- you would then say they want a -- they want to test certain -- in certain cases where they think there may have been an abuse in the elicitation of the statement, but if there is -- there is no reason to suspect that the statement was taken under untoward circumstances, they were not concerned to test its validity.",
  "But is that your position?",
  "Don't -- don't you think the Framers were aware of the fact that although there were law enforcement abuses, Raleigh's case and so on, there were also abuses every day of the week on the part of people who gave false testimony because they had grudges against the defendant? Do you think that was totally out of the minds of the Framers so as to support the distinction that -- that as a general rule you were suggesting?",
  "But why would -- why would we impute that -- that unconcern to the Framers about the -- the need to test statements which may very well have -- have been given because of envy, grudge, and so on?",
  "Well, but doesn't -- doesn't that get us back to the fact that those examples were given in Crawford as paradigm examples, if, you know, those were -- I think the word poor was used. But -- but Crawford was not limited to that, and if it's not limited to that, why, in effect, does the -- does the -- should we conclude that the concern of the clause stops short of the self-interested witness even though he didn't make an affidavit?",
  "Well, why wasn't that equally true in Connick?",
  "Yes, but I mean that's --",
  "-- that's a fine characterization, but I'm not sure that that helps us. held to be protected was the speech questioning political pressure to help in campaigns and so on. The issue of calling public attention to lying by police officers in criminal cases. And it seems to me that the -- that if there's a public interest in political pressure, there's a public interest in mendacity in law enforcement.",
  "Well, yes, but why?",
  "Yes.",
  "No, but it may well -- I guess the point that I'm trying to get at -- and it goes back to your original public-interest issue -- is, let's assume -- as Justice Scalia's hypo had it, let's assume that the statement made by the employee on the subject within job duties -- case like this one -- is, in fact, a \"stupid statement.\" Let's assume it's wrong, it's inaccurate, whatnot. The issue is not whether an employer, it seems to me, should, if that turns out to be the case, be able to fire. The issue, it seems to me, is whether, if it is not stupid, it should be totally unprotected, so that the employer could do anything, even if it's an accurate statement. And my understanding is that your argument on public interest was an argument that says, even if it's accurate and they were lying and so on, that there should be no protection. Am I -- and do I understand",
  "Sure, but take --",
  "-- take the case in which the employee says, \"It was accurate.\" The employer says, \"No, it was stupid. You got everything wrong.\" I take it, in -- your position is that regardless of whether the employee got it right or not, there shouldn't be protection, because it's within job duties. Is --",
  "-- that correct?",
  "Okay. employer is free from being challenged with regards to the employment decision. It may be a matter for the -- like Mr. Ceballos did initially, or even pursue it to civil service remedies. And those are the type of decisions that the personnel in those departments are more ably, I think, to decide.",
  "But I thought -- correct me if I'm wrong, just as a matter of fact -- I thought his 1983 claim listed the speech to the Mexican-American demoted, or whatever it was, transferred.",
  "Well, the --",
  "-- the focus may have changed, but, I mean, he hadn't dropped the -- he hadn't dropped the claim that that was one of the causes --",
  "-- of the --",
  "Did he?",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay.",
  "But let me -- let me raise this question. If, in this case, he gets past step one as you suggested in answer to a question a little while ago, that anybody could go public and get at least past extremely -- well, strike the \"extremely\" -- what is to be gained by the restrictive view that you take that if he doesn't go to the Bar Association, or doesn't go public, there's no protection at all? In other words, it seems to me that the public is being protected in a way subject to an immediate end run.",
  "But what if he simply goes to the public and says, \"Look, there's Brady material here, and it should be turned over, and, instead, my boss is telling me to suppress it.\" That wouldn't be turning over his work product. And I took it, from what you said earlier, that, in that case, you would say at least he gets pasts step one of Pickering for the --",
  "-- newspapers --",
  "Oh, he might -- he might ultimately lose, just the way, on all issues but one, the employee in Connick lost. That's quite true. But at least --",
  "-- there would be a claim to go through the balancing --",
  "-- exercise.",
  "Yes.",
  "Oh, I understand your point.",
  "You're not saying he would win on Pickering balancing, but he would at least get to the point of going through the balancing exercise.",
  "Maybe.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, you take the position, then, that -- going to the earlier hypothetical that somebody brought up, that, say, in a Brady case, if the --if the Federal prosecutor believes there was Brady material that -- and let's assume he's correct, just to make it a simple case -- that there's Brady material to be turned over, and the U.S. attorney says, \"Do not turn the Brady material over,\" that if the -- if the court, that he can be disciplined?",
  "Oh, I'm sure --",
  "-- that's so --",
  "-- but what about, you know, the basic First Amendment --",
  "But why would you recognize a due process violation if you wouldn't recognize a First Amendment violation?",
  "Well, neither does due",
  "Yes, but to get to the unconstitutional condition, wouldn't you normally look to the First Amendment?",
  "No, but I --",
  "May I --",
  "May I interrupt you? I thought you said that, in this case, as distinct from Givhan, there would be cognizable employer interests in to do the job without roiling the waters unduly, and so on. And that, I take it, is not necessarily so in a",
  "Maybe the employer has the same interest in each. I --",
  "-- I have --",
  "No, but in --",
  "-- in Givhan, if the employee's assigned duties were all done competently, but she had just gone off the deep end on racial balance or something, the employer would not have had - - if -- so long as it was the -- a private would have had an interest in saying, \"Well, you're incompetent on the subject of racial balance, and fire you.\" But in the case in which the employee is talking on the subject within the job description, then the employer has got -- I thought you were saying he's got a direct interest in competence, truth, and so on.",
  "Okay.",
  "But you're arguing now, as I understand it, that the reason you win on definiteness is that it sweeps in even as yet uninvented processes.",
  "And it does so by means, in effect, of erecting this umbrella of a natural fact which is intended to cover every process that might be relevant to establishing that natural fact.",
  "So that you're saying we cannot -- no court can decide definiteness in this situation without hitting the patentable issue.",
  "Okay, I think you've hit what is the problem for us. When you use the word assay, you assume that that is excluding certain processes. And that's not clear to me. Would you explain that in greater detail?",
  "I thought an assay was in effect synonymous with any process that gets the relevant data and you're using it in a more -- I think, in answering Justice Breyer's question, you were using it in a narrower sense.",
  "But I thought that was the point of your argument, that there are assays and then there are other methods. Did I misunderstand you?",
  "But isn't -- doesn't the mechanism take into account the number of employees who are on the rolls at any given time?",
  "Well, if that's the case, then -- then doesn't the premium that you're supposed to pay depend in -- in -- on the number of employees within the last 180 days, which in turn depends on their working in the last 180 days?",
  "Well, how -- maybe you just don't know the answer.",
  "So that's -- that's really not an issue for us.",
  "Well, if you want to make it an issue, you'd have to get the -- the predicate in the record to do it, and -- and we just don't have that.",
  "We -- we couldn't resolve that.",
  "Consider us together, yes.",
  "See, what I don't understand --",
  "Mr. Strain, you -- you mentioned --",
  "Let -- let me, if I may, ask you about other possible wage surrogates because what you're saying now seems to me to mesh with the argument, another legislative history argument, to the effect that the -- the current provision was meant to overrule two prior cases of this Court. And the -- the question I have turns on the fact that the -- the language is broader than what would merely have been necessary to overrule those cases. So my question is if the broader language does not cover the premiums that we're concerned with here, what other items dealing with -- with wage substitutes would it pick up, would it include?",
  "If -- if they don't pay the premium with respect to the 180 days, if there's an accident during the 180 days, the insurance doesn't cover the accident.",
  "Under the --",
  "If he had left voluntarily under the pre-'96 law, would he still have been subject to criminal prosecution for his prior illegal entry if he had later come back into the United States?",
  "Okay.",
  "Should --",
  "Well, let me go back to the criminal provision for a second. I take it your answer to the question I asked your brother a moment ago is that if the individual reenters, and, hence, has committed a criminal offense, and later voluntarily returns to -- in this case, to Mexico, that the criminal violation, in effect, would not, in any sense, be canceled out.",
  "And that if he returned, he could be prosecuted for the prior reentry. And I suppose, in theory -- I don't know what the extradition treaty is -- in theory, he might be subject to extradition for it.",
  "The odd way to --",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay.",
  "There's no forgiveness --",
  "-- provision.",
  "What do you say to the argument that that really is an inapposite argument because the 1983 proceeding is de novo?",
  "Is that --",
  "-- plausible?",
  "Well --",
  "-- what do you --",
  "-- what do you make of the fact that there was prior law that required -- I forget its exact words, but something like \"reasonable procedure,\" and that language was repealed?",
  "Well, if that's -- if that's the case, then, on your own reasoning, you can't assume that there's -- that availability requires any reasonable availability. It's got to be availability as, I guess, a physical possibility, and that's all.",
  "Do you find --",
  "-- it plausible that Congress, in effect, would have intended these -- the statute of limitations on 1983 to be truncated in that way?",
  "Yes, but the abuse was not coming from people who filed -- or the -- let's say the line that identifies the abuse was not a line between those who file a grievance within 2 days and those who do not. I mean, that's -- that -- it's true, if you -- if you have a 2-hour statute of limitations, you're going to keep out a lot of cases, but it's not a tool that is particularly suited to the problem that Congress was dealing with, which is frivolous actions.",
  "Wouldn't you like to have a 2 - hour time limit?",
  "You'd have a lot -- you know, a lot more time at the park.",
  "Now, on -- on your theory of -- of behavior modification, would it, nonetheless, be -- be open to the State to say, no, you may not receive any more legal materials and you may not go to the library to look at them? Because that's something you very much want to do. And in order to do that, you've got to shape up and -- and get moved down to a lesser level of security. Would that -- I'm not saying that the State is -- is about to do that, but on your theory, could the State do that?",
  "Well, what would -- I mean, you know, one of the arguments made on the other side is that if you accept the behavior modification theory as an adequate justification, the Turner categories essentially become incoherent. What, for example, would be the alternative means in this case if the State said, we realize that the people in -- in -- at level 2 want to see legal materials very, very much because that is a source of hope for them, and we want them to have that source of hope only if they shape up and -- and get down to a reduced level of security, so we're going to stop it, period? What would be the alternatives within the -- the Turner analysis?",
  "What if the -- what if the inmate said, look, the -- the lawyers who come to see us are -- are great guys, but they're -- they're overworked. They don't have time to be thinking about novel legal theories, which we would dream up perhaps if we could get to Legal Times and these periodicals? So it's -- it's not an alternative.",
  "So you're -- you're saying there -- there's a separate value here, and that is the value of access to courts. And -- and that limits what can be done for purposes of behavior modification.",
  "All right. What about the marriage example? The -- the Court has said, yes, you couldn't -- the -- the State can't prevent the inmate from -- from getting married. I don't see where the separate source of -- of value is that would -- that -- that would affect that analysis. No right of access to court. The associational rights can be abridged and so on. Why, on your analysis, wouldn't -- wouldn't the proper disposition of the earlier case have been to say, yes, the State can preclude marriage too because that's something they very much want and -- and the State can preclude that unless they shape up and -- and get down to a -- a lesser level of security?",
  "So you're saying there just is not a logical connection there within --",
  "-- the meaning of the -- of the case?",
  "But there would be a logical connection for those who want to get married.",
  "You're -- you're saying it might not make sense as a systemic policy --",
  "-- because it isn't a big enough problem. But for -- we're not talking about a whole system here. We're talking about 40 people or less, and if some of those 40 people want to get married, why doesn't it make perfect sense to say no marriage?",
  "You can, and on -- on your analysis, why isn't that sufficient?",
  "Okay, but how do we get around the marriage case then?",
  "So as to these, the -- the marriage could be banned, in effect, you're saying.",
  "But don't we -- don't we have the same problem if we're -- if we're dealing with First Amendment interests that we do when we're dealing with Eighth Amendment interests? In other words, if -- if we don't say, well, they get outside of Turner analysis because they require -- by virtue of being enumerated rights, they require an analysis specific to them, is the abridgement of the right carried so far that it is unreasonable? If we don't say that, then I don't see, as your friends on the other side have argued, I don't see where the logical stopping point is if we accept the -- the behavior modification theory.",
  "Oh, oh, I -- I realize that. I mean, they're -- they're making an in extremis kind of argument. I understand that. But if -- if we accept an in extremis kind of argument on the theory of behavior modification, then I don't see why that argument does not, for example, cover the marriage case, and maybe -- maybe it should. I don't know why that argument would not allow for a total deprivation of all communication outside of, let's say, access to counsel. And -- and so it seems to me that whether we admit it or not, what's going on here, whether we call it Turner analysis or not, is we're making some kind of a judgment as to whether they're carrying the deprivation for behavior modification purposes in these extreme cases too far.",
  "And if that's what -- I'll -- I'll be quiet in a second.",
  "If that's -- if that's what we're doing, aren't we just as much outside the Turner analysis when we're talking about the First Amendment or associational rights under the First Amendment as we are when we're talking about the Eighth Amendment? And shouldn't we say so?",
  "So -- so but at some point, there's sort of a reasonableness limit then you're saying.",
  "No, but consistent --",
  "Consistently with your answer, it seems to me, you have to say they should give the TV back, they should give the magazines back because none of those worked either. And those are First Amendment deprivations to some degree.",
  "No. But I mean, what's -- what's your answer to my question? It seems to me that your point to the Chief Justice was the courts have to review the efficacy of these moves.",
  "And if -- if there is no efficacy and there is an infringement of what, at least for people on the outside, would be a protected right, then they have no justification for taking those rights away. And if that's going to be the analysis, then on -- on the argument you just gave, they've got to give the TV rights back, they've got to give the magazine rights back, and so on. Isn't that correct?",
  "I sure would like that, but --",
  "But then why? Why?",
  "Right. And in -- in your argument, in your answer to the Chief Justice, you were pointing out a situation in which taking away the TV didn't work, taking away the magazines didn't work.",
  "Why then do they not, on your theory, have to give TV and magazines back?",
  "All right. Then where does your efficacy criterion go? You're saying they may make judgments, and apparently they may -- may make judgments and maintain them even if those judgments do not, in fact, advance their interests. Here, you're saying they -- it's not going to advance their interests, so they can't do it. In these cases, you're saying they don't advance their interests, but they can as a matter of judgment. And I don't know how to draw that line.",
  "I -- may I interrupt you --",
  "-- with this question? Aren't you really saying that when the deprivations get beyond some point, some serious point, the issue is not properly analyzed under Turner and Safley, can they do one thing more? The issue really becomes one of cruel and unusual punishment. Is the totality that they have taken away so great that it is cruel to maintain these people under these circumstances? Is that the argument you're really making?",
  "Oh, I know that wasn't -- that wasn't the claim that you made, but isn't that the argument that you're making?",
  "Well, isn't there something different here? Because in -- in Holmes, the -- the party that was claiming the -- sort of the ultimate damage was damaged because other people up the line were damaged, the -- the shareholders and then the broker-dealers and so on. There was a kind of a direct line of -- of causation. But the people who were claiming were at the tail end of it. Here, the causation between the -- or the -- or the cause of the harm to -- to the clients on -- on the other side was -- was direct. It was direct competition harm. So we are in a different situation from Holmes. In other words, they -- they weren't -- the -- the plaintiffs in this case were not injured simply because New York lost some money. They were injured in -- in their own right by -- by the competition between them and your client.",
  "Sure, but they suffered the harm because the firm suffered the harm. There was -- there was -- there's a word there. There was -- there was a victim in -- in the direct line of causation, if you will, between them and -- and the -- and the offending RICO party. Here, there's -- there's nobody in between the two of them.",
  "Well, may -- may I ask you to focus this way, just going one step further than the hypo you've got? Let's assume that the -- that the defendant engages in extortion against A and makes a lot of money doing it. As a result of that, in -- in dealing with B, the defendant, in fact, can -- can offer -- offer goods for sale to B's customers at a lower price simply because he's getting all this income from the extortion. In that case, wouldn't your analysis be the same as your analysis in this case?",
  "But -- but if that's the case, then -- if -- if the relationship between the nonviolence has nothing to do with your -- your position. Does it? I can't think of a hypothetical, off the top of my head or after some consideration, of where the violence would have been such that there would have been a less indirect injury than the one in your hypothetical, Justice Souter. But I would not want to foreclose the possibility, as this Court did not foreclose in footnote 20 of the Holmes opinion, that there could be such a case. It's not necessary for us to prevail here because the mail and wire fraud predicate acts are very close to the securities fraud that this Court considered in the Holmes case. I would acknowledge that in the extortion and robbery and other carjacking and violence type acts, there could be congressional policies that would be taken into account. And certainly the legislative history of RICO points to a concern that persons would be using violence in a way that would cause harms. But I don't think the Court needs to go there in order to rule in our favor in this case.",
  "Isn't -- isn't the problem with your answer to Justice Scalia and -- and a problem which -- which is bothering you with your case this? We're talking here about two different lines of causation? And each of them, to some degree, contributes to the ultimate result which you claim, One line of causation is -- is competitive. It's price competition. They charge less. They lure fraud on the State of New York which makes it easier for them to engage in price competition. So far as the fraud on the State of New York is concerned, its effect on your client's business is indirect. In other words, they can defraud New York without hurting your client. They might simply have pocketed all the money they saved, but the -- the only way that the fraud on New York hurts your client is that it puts them in a better position to engage in the second line of causation that hurts your client and that is direct price competition. If you accept the fact that there are two different lines of causation here, don't we have to say, under the Holmes direct analysis, that so far as the fraud on New York, which is the RICO violation, the consequence is an indirect one, the consequence to your client, but so far as the price competition is concerned, the consequence is a direct one, but price competition isn't a RICO violation, which leaves us saying, so far as the RICO violation is concerned, it's indirect? where.",
  "Does that mean, in practical terms, that the -- that the -- that the other claims that are in the district court get transferred to the circuit, the circuit is bound by the limitations that you've just described, and, at the end of the day, the complaining parties in those cases can raise the question whether they -- whether Congress could properly have truncated them, as it did, but it's simply got to wait?",
  "Okay.",
  "I realize --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, that's --",
  "Mr. Katyal, I mean, that's a good argument for -- from a broad policy, but isn't there a narrower reason? If we assume that the -- that the commission is properly established for some purpose, by definition that purpose is limited. We are not dealing here, as we would in the normal criminal case, with a court of general jurisdiction. If we're dealing with a court of general jurisdiction, we postpone claims like yours til the end, because we say the jurisdiction is so broad, they probably had it. Maybe not, but we can wait. But in a -- in a -- in a court of limited jurisdiction, or a commission of limited jurisdiction, we can't indulge that presumption. And that's why, I thought, your claim that conspiracy is not cognizable can be raised at the beginning, because it's inseparable from the limited jurisdiction of the court. Am I off in left field?",
  "Or do you like that answer.",
  "Okay.",
  "And that would require a determination by a different tribunal that he was not a POW, in default of which he would be treated as a POW and be entitled to a court-martial? Is that the point?",
  "Yes.",
  "What do you -- what do you make of the argument that Mr. Katyal just alluded to, that if you take the -- as you do -- take the position that the commissions are operating under the laws of war, you've got to accept that one law of war here is the Geneva Convention right to a presumption of POW status unless there is a determination by a competent tribunal otherwise, with the -- among other things, the rights that that carries. I mean, how -- do you -- why not -- why don't you go from the frying pan into the fire, in effect, when you take the position that the laws of war are what the tribunal is applying?",
  "Well, but you're -- are you saying that the -- that the commission will adjudicate POW status under the Geneva Convention? In other words, are you stipulating that the Geneva Convention does apply, so that the only argument left between you and Mr. Katyal would be whether the commission itself was a competent tribunal to make the determination? Is that your position?",
  "Well, do you agree that it applies as part of the law of war?",
  "But that, I guess, is the problem that I'm having. For purposes of determining the domestic authority to set up a commission, you say, the President is operating under the laws of war recognized by Congress, but for purposes of a claim to status, and, hence, the procedural rights that go with that status, you're saying the laws of war don't apply. And I don't see how you can have it both ways.",
  "But he is entitled to make a claim under them to determine whether, on the merits, he is entitled. Isn't that entailed by your position?",
  "Exclusive review of what? I don't see that the -- that the -- that the DTA preserves a right to review of the very issue that they want to raise here.",
  "They can -- they can -- they can review their enemy combatant determination. They can review the consistency of the procedure of the court with whatever law applies. But I don't see that there is a clear reservation of right to get to the very basic question of the -- of the constitution of the court itself.",
  "So, you're reading --",
  "-- procedures --",
  "-- to encompass the very act constituting the court itself? Is that the Government's -- I mean, are you going to go on the record --",
  "But the whole point, it seems to me, of the argument, is, should we not consider the significance of those very questions, because, if we don't, as Justice Breyer said, at the end of the day, as you describe it, we will have to face the serious constitutional question whether Congress can, in fact, limit jurisdiction without suspending habeas corpus? The whole point is to grapple with them now, and to -- and to treat them in a way that allows for this adjudication, so that we avoid this constitutional difficulty tomorrow.",
  "We may not have to reach the constitutional question. That's what -- that's what constitutional avoidance hopes for.",
  "Isn't there a --",
  "Isn't there a pretty good argument that a suspension of the writ of Congress is just about the most stupendously significant act that the Congress of the United States can take? And, therefore, we ought to be at least a little slow to accept your argument that it can be done from pure inadvertence?",
  "If we have to --",
  "-- get to the issue, in accordance with Justice Breyer's question, whether or not the writ of habeas corpus was suspended, you are leaving us with the position of the United States that the Congress may validly suspend it inadvertently. Is that really your position?",
  "The writ is the --",
  "The writ is the --",
  "Now, wait a minute. The writ is the writ.",
  "There are not two writs of habeas corpus for some cases and for other cases. The rights that -- the rights that may be asserted, the rights that may be vindicated, will vary with the circumstances, but jurisdiction over habeas corpus is jurisdiction over habeas corpus. And it seems to me that the position you have taken is that if, at the end of the day, we have to reach the question that Justice Breyer described, the answer to that question may be, \"Yes, the writ of habeas corpus was suspended by inadvertence. Congress did not intend to do it.\" Is that really your position?",
  "Is it also your point when there is no insurrection or invasion?",
  "Perhaps that's something that a court ought to inquire into when it gets into the question of congressional intent.",
  "And how specific --",
  "-- that intent --",
  "-- and how specific that intent must be.",
  "Okay. Let's --",
  "Let's --",
  "Let's assume we do not have a magic-words requirement. Given the significance of suspending the writ of habeas corpus, should we not have a pretty clear statement requirement?",
  "There may be nothing --",
  "-- subtle about the statute, but there is something very silent about the statute as to whether Congress understood that it was -- that it was acting under its authority to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. And, at the very least, that unclarity is manifested by the effective-date provision. H(1) doesn't have the language that it had before the amendment. Therefore, it seems to me, there would be some difficulty, if we have to get to the question, in finding a clear intent on the part of Congress to suspend the writ under its article I power.",
  "It comes --",
  "It comes as a wolf under H(2), but the wolf is silent under H(1), and the wolf used to speak under H(1), and it had its teeth taken out.",
  "And that's --",
  "-- gone.",
  "The very fact --",
  "-- that Congress chose to remove the clarity of the prior provision is of no significance?",
  "What --",
  "Whatever may be the standard of due care for courts in reviewing acts of Congress with respect to attorneys fees, it doesn't reach the level that, it seems to me, is incumbent on us when we're talking about suspending the writ of habeas corpus.",
  "Can --",
  "Yes.",
  "May I ask you this? If the -- if the day before the settlement was consummated, the plan had gone into court and had said the -- the beneficiaries plan to settle the case and they've indicated that they're not going to give us any of the settlement in accordance with the terms of the contract and we want an injunction preventing their distribution to anyone but -- but us, if the -- if the judge believed that and believed that under the contract, the plan was entitled to reimbursement, could the judge have enjoined the -- the distribution of the funds to the -- you know, to the extent of the plan's claim?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, it could enforce the injunction. provided that -- that the injunction was not a mandatory injunction. This Court in Great-West clearly saying pay us this money that's due under the contract, is not --",
  "No, but that -- that was -- that was an ex post remedy and there were no identifiable funds. What we're talking about here is an ex ante injunction and the funds are identifiable. And you are telling me that, in fact, all the -- all the equity court could have said was, don't pay yourself?",
  "It could not have said, give the $75,000, or whatever it is, to the plan?",
  "Well, when we get down to clever attempts, aren't we at the clever attempt point distribution to anybody else, including themselves, but they can't tell them to pay the money to -- to Great- silliness?",
  "But you -- in any case, I don't want to prolong this unduly. You're saying that there would have been some equitable claim and some equitable remedy with respect to the $75,000 that -- that a -- a court could have taken cognizance of the day before the settlement.",
  "No. I'm -- I'm just trying to characterize your answer to me. You said, yes, that would be an injunction and it would be an injunction",
  "Well, did you attempt to?",
  "Well, did -- did you respond to the summary judgment by saying, you know, there are reasons why they should -- specific reasons why they shouldn't get the full 75?",
  "And you were denied a hearing on that?",
  "That -- that may be a -- a reason for you to appeal on the merits, but I don't see what it has to do with the -- with the jurisdiction of the court as -- as awarding equitable relief. Maybe it did a poor job in deciding what was equitable.",
  "But it -- it has nothing to do with its power to award an equitable remedy. Honor, because MAMSI didn't move for summary judgment on an equitable theory. They moved for summary summary judgment motion is -- is particularly clear on this. It makes clear that the contract creates, governs, and is the end all and be all of their rights.",
  "Well, they would have nothing to say if they hadn't invoked the contract. They've got to invoke the contract. The question is, are they asking for equitable relief?",
  "You mean without a contract, they could have gone in and said, we'd like $75,000?",
  "And are you suggesting that the jurisdiction of the court would have been different if they had gone -- if the -- if the plan had gone in we're just relying on equitable principles of subrogation? In that case, are you suggesting the when they went in and said, we happen to have a contractual right to this, the court doesn't have equitable jurisdiction?",
  "But I think that's implicit in your argument.",
  "Okay, but why -- why isn't the answer to your argument the -- the historical answer that courts of equity frequently provided remedies and supplementary remedies when remedies at law were not fully adequate? And they were still equitable remedies. They were still typically equitable, and that's what is being requested here?",
  "Why isn't that the answer to",
  "Yes, but Justice Breyer's question is the eggs have gotten scrambled. That's the -- that's the hypothesis. Are you saying or are you going to say you can't unscramble the eggs consistently with -- with the limitation to equitable remedies, or are you going to say you can unscramble the eggs?",
  "Well, that's what I meant by",
  "Well, how about Justice Breyer's hypothetical? Is the -- is the court under ERISA incapable of dealing with that situation, or is isn't it?",
  "Under that -- under Justice Breyer's hypothetical, a court, consistently with ERISA, could give an equitable remedy?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, is that -- that -- my question was going to be are -- are you suggesting or arguing that the remedy ought to be exclusion as a matter of domestic law or as a necessary implication of -- of the treaty?",
  "Well, what would you do in a country that does not apply an exclusion remedy in -- in domestic cases given the provision, which I can't quote correctly, but you'll know what it is, the -- the provision that the treaty will -- will be administered in accordance with or consistently with, I guess it is, domestic law so long as full effect is given to its substantive provisions? I would have thought that that -- that that provision for administration in accordance with domestic law would have a great bearing, if -- if not being dispositive, on the remedy, so that if I were answering the question I -- I had asked you, I -- I would have said, well, it's probably a domestic law basis for -- for exclusion, but not a treaty basis. So why in those countries -- getting back to -- to my -- why -- why in those countries that do not customarily apply an exclusion remedy wouldn't it be consistent with the treaty for them to decline to apply it given the provision for administration consistently with -- with domestic law?",
  "So if the treaty --",
  "The -- the treaty provision then governs only in the sense that for remedy it refers you to domestic law. Is that it?",
  "Okay.",
  "It's a --",
  "We keep doing this.",
  "It's -- it's a duty to advise him of -- of his right to have them notify the -- the consulate. It is not a duty to remain silent until the consulate responds. And even if you are correct that the obligation to -- to advise him and to give the notice arises immediately upon the realization that he's a foreign national, I don't see anything in the treaty that requires them to defer interrogation until the -- the consulate has decided whether it wants to do anything or not.",
  "Well, do you -- do you say, going back to -- to the point Justice Ginsburg made, if the United States follows a 48- to 72-hour rule, is -- is that a violation of the treaty?",
  "Well, we -- we might have to make it in this case.",
  "No, but isn't -- isn't the problem with your analogy that counsel do not advise their clients about Brady rights because, by definition or in the normal case by definition, counsel doesn't know whether there's a Brady violation. But counsel does know or, it seems to me, can properly be charged with knowing that when he's representing a foreign national, the foreign national has a Vienna Convention right, just as much as the foreign national has a Miranda right, and he can advise him of that. So it seems to me the Brady analogy is -- is not apt.",
  "But once, at least --",
  "The -- the only thing in -- in the second part of Justice Breyer's question, the only thing that the lawyer has to be relied upon is to get the issue raised at the appropriate point in the trial process. And -- and so, at the very least, what Virginia is -- is arguing here is that he waived it because no objection was raised based upon a prior Vienna Convention failure. That is a very conventional obligation upon lawyers. It -- it's an obligation that goes to Miranda. It's an obligation that goes to any denial of rights of which counsel could or should be charged with knowing, and I don't see why there should be an exception made to -- to that obligation to raise the issue.",
  "No. And I'm not -- I'm not suggesting anything that -- that affects that. Yes, the State does have to notify him, and if he wants, the State has to make the phone call. What I am suggesting is that the lawyer should be taxed with knowing that that is the individual's right. The lawyer should be taxed with knowing that because it's the law of the land. It's a treaty. And -- and it seems to me the obligation is upon the lawyer to say, well, did they -- did they tell you, did they notify the consul, just as the lawyer would say, did you get the Miranda warnings. And -- and if the lawyer does not make that inquiry and does not raise an objection, whatever it may be, if in fact the individual didn't get his rights, then I don't see why there should be -- there should not be a waiver with respect to the Vienna Convention objection, just as there is a waiver with respect to a Miranda objection or a search and seizure objection and -- and other constitutional rights.",
  "Well, maybe after the first ineffective assistance claim is decided in the client's favor, people are going to wake up. I mean, you have to admit at this stage of the game -- and it's not your client's fault, but the -- this is a fairly rare bird. And -- and if, in fact, it were held to be -- let's -- let's assume that -- that on -- on collateral review, someone in your client's position made the following claim. Number one, the State didn't tell me. They -- they failed in their Vienna Convention right. Number two, my lawyer never inquired of me or of anybody else whether the State had given me my -- my Vienna Convention rights. And therefore, my -- my lawyer was ineffective. If on collateral review a claim like that is made, it is accepted and prejudice is found, I would imagine the bar is going to wake up fairly fast to what's going on. Don't you?",
  "May I ask you one factual question? And I -- I should know this. I just -- if -- if I did know it, I can't remember it now. Was any ineffective assistance claim raised -- I -- I take it there's no ineffective assistance claim that was ever raised on collateral review here because you've never gotten to a collateral review stage. Is that correct?",
  "But that -- wasn't -- I'm -- I'm sorry?",
  "But you did that on collateral review as opposed to trying to supplement the direct appeal?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, but --I mean, all you've got to do is --",
  "You ask him what his name is. Why don't you ask him whether he's an American citizen? If he says no, say what country are you a citizen of. I mean, I -- I don't see the difficulty of that.",
  "But, I mean, why does it have to be a distant goal? I mean, it seems easy.",
  "Does -- does -- would Virginia allow the -- a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to be raised on collateral review for a failure of counsel to -- to advise the client or take action on the client's behalf under the Virginia Convention -- the Vienna Convention during -- during the -- the direct proceedings?",
  "When you say they -- they contemplate it, how do they express that contemplation? I mean, are -- are there magic words that diplomats understand or -- or what?",
  "But they -- they provide expressly that these are rights that may be asserted individually in national courts?",
  "But they -- they go beyond the reference to rights as -- as in article 36.",
  "Well, I -- I would agree there, but we're not -- this -- this isn't a case about subjecting them to suit.",
  "Well, yes, but -- but that is -- that's not equivalent to saying that it's -- it is subjecting the United States to suit.",
  "Okay, but if that argument is sound --",
  "Yes, but if your -- if your argument is sound, Mr. Phillips, then -- then any employer is well advised to define job categories by having one really nice job within the category and one really rotten job within the category. And if anybody who's got the nice job does something like make a title VII complaint, automatically gets, in effect, reassigned to the rotten job, and your answer will be, you know, there's no economic effect. They're getting the same amount of money each week. I mean, that would seem to me -- asks for an end run around the whole concept of retaliation.",
  "Well, isn't -- isn't there a big difference between sitting on a seat and running a forklift and -- and picking up steel rails with your bare hands?",
  "Okay, but --",
  "Okay, but do you -- do you agree that direct economic effect cannot be the only criterion here?",
  "Yes, but if the employer --",
  "Yes, but --",
  "Well, do -- do you think it does anything more than just eliminate clearly de minimis action?",
  "Do -- do you think the -- the materially modifier here does anything other than eliminate obviously de minimis behavior on the part of the employer?",
  "Wasn't --",
  "Now, did you have to prove that because, as -- as I have assumed, the charge included the statement that he had used a handgun? Was that the term used?",
  "Okay.",
  "What -- what do we do about the problem that is raised by -- by counsel on the other side, that Washington law is such -- or at least at the time the briefs were written, Washington law is such, as they understand it, that the -- that the issue could never properly have been submitted to the jury, and -- and therefore, if -- if Washington courts are going to follow Washington law, in every case in which a firearm is an issue, the case is going to be handled exactly like this? It's not -- the firearm issue is not going to the jury. The firearm determination will be made by the judge. If the State of Washington decides not to amend its law, we would have a situation in which, in effect, Apprendi is read out of the -- the constitutional law simply by State procedure. And in every case, the -- the response would have to be harmless error analysis on your theory. That is a pretty neat way to undercut Apprendi. Is that not a good reason to say we shouldn't have harmless error analysis?",
  "So you're -- I'm sorry. You're saying their argument is wrong, in effect, as a -- as a statement of Washington law.",
  "A motion in limine kind of --",
  "No, but there -- there is evidence from which the jury could find that it was a real gun, and in the absence of any indication to the contrary, that is competent evidence for the jury to use in concluding that it would function like a real gun. It's not -- they didn't have to put in further technical evidence. An issue might have been raised. I mean, your -- the -- the defendant might have come up and -- and presented evidence to the effect that it was only a starter pistol, in which case, okay, there would be a real issue. But in the absence of any reason to doubt that the handgun was what it purported to be, there would be no reason to -- there would be no requirement of further evidence about functionality, would there be?",
  "What's -- what's your authority? I mean, that doesn't seem -- as a matter of factual common sense, that doesn't seem required. Is -- is there a Washington case that requires that?",
  "And what exactly in the language is it that you hang your hat on?",
  "No -- no question. But if there -- but if there is no reason to question its apparent functionality, I mean, you know, it's a handgun. It looks like a handgun. Somebody is holding it like a handgun -- there -- there is no reason, it seems to me, as a matter of fact or based on the statute to doubt that it would be functional. And therefore, it would seem to me that the proof would be competent that it was a functioning handgun in the absence of any question raised.",
  "No. But it's also the case, as I understand it, and as counsel on the other side confirmed a few moments ago, that the charge specifically specified that a handgun had been used. So this is not a case, as I think you were suggesting, in which there has never been a charge of the offense plus the enhancement they now claim. The -- the problem was in the jury verdict, not in the charge, not in notice to the defendant. And if that's the case, why isn't it just like Neder?",
  "Well, a -- a firearm, as I understand it, is defined to include a pistol or a revolver. Is that correct?",
  "All right. Isn't the natural reading of -- or understanding of the word handgun that it's a pistol or a revolver? I mean, isn't that what people would normally take it to mean?",
  "Yes, but you're asking for a -- you're asking for a Federal constitutional ruling, and right now, if I understand you correctly, you're arguing that you ought to win because if you don't win, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, we would be condoning a verdict for an offense that was never charged. But if, in fact, handgun is properly read, properly understood to mean a pistol or a revolver, and that's what a firearm -- that's -- that's what a firearm is -- is defined to include under Washington law, then in fact the offense has been charged. The enhancement has been charged. And as a matter of Federal constitutional law, it seems to me that ought to be enough to bring it within Neder regardless of what the quirks of Washington law may be.",
  "And that's because it -- it didn't go to the jury.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, when you say it's not litigated, do you mean simply that nobody, none of the witnesses, none of the counsel in argument, disputed that a handgun was there? In other words, it was just one of those things everybody understood. Is that what you mean when you say it wasn't litigated?",
  "And -- and what do you -- what do you base that statement on? In other words, I -- I think you're now arguing that the understanding was that although it looked as though the -- the most serious enhancement had been charged, the understanding of the parties was that it had not been. If that's your argument, what is your basis for saying that?",
  "And if we accept -- going back to our earlier exchange, if we accept the proposition that charging that he used a handgun was sufficient to charge a firearm, then the charge against him was assault in the second degree with the maximum enhancement for use of a firearm.",
  "You -- you and I may disagree on -- on how to read -- how to understand firearm, but if you read it the way I just suggested, then the charge was assault two with the maximum enhancement. Isn't that correct?",
  "Well, I thought the -- I thought the reason they conceded the Blakely violation was that in the instructions to the jury, the instruction only went to deadly weapon and the instruction did not specifically refer to firearm. I thought that's why they -- they stipulated that there was a Blakely error. As a matter of the fact about the instruction, is -- is my description correct?",
  "All right. And it didn't -- it didn't use the -- let's put it this way. it didn't use the word firearm. Right?",
  "That's -- that's why they conceded a Blakely error.",
  "The only issue in that case is competent performance, and it seems to me that the -- the difficulty behind a number of our questions this morning is that you are trying to draw an analogy from -- from counsel issues that don't involve an autonomy interest to a counsel issue that does involve an autonomy interest, maybe in theory not as greatly as self-representation, but as -- as everybody agrees, as you've said, it involves some autonomy interest. And if we're going to import the rule of prejudice from non-autonomy cases as the -- as the necessary condition in autonomy cases, then it seems to me the autonomy interest is devalued to the point of almost of disappearance. It becomes not much more than -- a little bit, but not much more than an ineffective assistance case.",
  "No, but you say he's -- he's not denied all choice. He is denied the choice that he wants to make.",
  "That's not the State's problem. We're talking about the State standing in the way of it. In this case the State through the court system stood in the way of it because it made an error that denied him his right. But the -- the -- it seems to me the autonomy interest is not merely an interest in choosing second- best. It's an interest in choosing the one you want.",
  "It's second-best to the guy who wants somebody else.",
  "But what good is that as -- as an answer to our question? Sure, no harm, no foul. But that can't be the -- that can't be the criterion for a court and that can't be our criterion in deciding whether he really has a right to his first choice or not.",
  "It's -- it's basically -- in -- in Justice Scalia's question, it is connected with what the -- the client believes will be a favorable outcome by using the lawyer he wants. It's his judgment about what will probably be a favorable outcome, and his judgment about the lawyer who is most likely to bring that about.",
  "I mean, all -- all I'm getting it, is that's a different -- that is a very different criterion from what we apply in Strickland.",
  "Why -- why take it away from the 10 percent?",
  "You're -- because you're saying they don't have it.",
  "Why is there a less worthy historical tradition to be honored in a defendant's choice of his own counsel?",
  "But -- but you --",
  "But you concede that if -- if it's a historical tradition to speak in one's own voice, it gets -- for practical purposes, it gets a kind of absolute respect. Whereas, if it's a historical tradition to choose one's own counsel, it does not get that -- I mean, it's very -- that seems to me a -- a kind of historical dissonance.",
  "Right, and the question is he -- I mean, the -- the whole point here isn't the -- isn't the interest in autonomy a separate interest which should be recognized by some means other than merely looking to the fairness of the trial.",
  "Let me ask --",
  "But isn't the sacrifice sort of egregious here? Because in the case of self- representation, we give virtually absolute respect to it, knowing perfectly well that the decision to represent one's self is usually crazy. Whereas, in this case, when the decision may very well be sound, we give -- we would, on your view, give a -- a much reduced respect to it. That does not seem consistent.",
  "No, but isn't -- isn't the difference that in the latter period, the court took no action, and there is a mandate on the court to act? With respect to this earlier period, the court did act. Incidentally, it did exactly what the defendant wanted it to do, but it acted so that the only -- the only reason for arguing error here is, in effect, a clerical reason. He didn't say the magic words or make the magic conclusion. If, in fact, that's because he couldn't have made it, no question. You -- you got a violation of the statute. But if he could have made it and -- and simply didn't say the magic words, you're in a very different position here from what you are in -- in the case of -- of the failure to act on the -- on the competency issue.",
  "Well, let's put it this way. It's a failure to speak rather than a failure to act. In -- in the latter case, no action. In this case, action, in fact, action as more -- it's as requested. But a failure to speak contemporaneously with the action, that's different.",
  "Well, we don't -- we don't know. I mean, on the face of the record, we don't know whether he weighed or whether he didn't weigh. In the second case, we know that he didn't act, and -- and action is what he's got to -- to accomplish. But whether he weighed or not, we don't know. He just didn't say whether he weighed.",
  "Right.",
  "No. I -- I --",
  "But it's -- it requires -- in order for us to conclude that that's the only way it can be taken account -- into account, we -- we'd have to conclude that -- that rule 52 was, in effect, partially repealed and made inapplicable implicitly here without any reference to it. And that's -- that kind of, let's say, implicit modification of -- of one of the rules is, as a matter of normal interpretation, disfavored.",
  "But there's always some sanction for error, and the point of the harmless error rule is to determine whether that specific sanction should be applied.",
  "Well, isn't there something more than a waiver here? I mean, waiver is a very broad term. I mean, it would cover a situation, for example, in which the Government asked for time and the defendant said, okay, I waive. In -- in this case, there's -- there's an affirmative act on the part of the defendant. He's not merely waiving. He is affirmatively asking for action on the part of the court, and subject I guess to cutting down the period somewhat, he got what he asked for. This is something more than waiver. This is, in fact, a -- a grant of specific relief requested by him, and he now wants to turn the tables based on receiving exactly what he asked for. That's more than waiver.",
  "And hasn't my brother cleverly changed my hypothetical? Because I was --",
  "-- I was not talking about the perpetual waiver. I was talking about the waiver for whatever number of days he actually took in -- in that case, which was what? 90 days?",
  "Yes.",
  "It could have come from my chambers.",
  "Mr. --",
  "You -- you made an argument a moment ago which included the point that he asked for this particular relief and represented what he needed to do if he got the relief, the continuance. You -- you came right up within a step of -- of making a judicial estoppel claim, although you did not use those terms. I have two questions. Did the Government raise at least the -- the theory of judicial estoppel in the litigation before it reached this point? And the second question is, even if the Government did not raise that term, asked for -- for estoppel to be applied in those terms, did the Government make the same argument that you have just made which emphasizes the fact that he asked for it and he represented the reasons for -- for needing it?",
  "Yes. The difference between acquiescence and -- and potentially sandbagging.",
  "Am -- am I correct that the -- the particular provision that you think is relevant here is -- is (h)(1)(A) on page 4 of the -- the appendix in the blue brief?",
  "I've -- I've got it. Okay.",
  "What -- what do you make of the language, any period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent? I mean, the claim here is that -- that the -- that the delay did not result from that fact, but simply from the failure of -- of the judge to make that determination so that what you're really doing is making a harmless error analysis.",
  "Okay, but isn't that a --",
  "-- isn't that a harmless error analysis rather than a -- a subsection (4) analysis?",
  "But -- but I guess my only point is that (4) does not say any period during which the defendant is mentally incompetent. It says any period of delay resulting from the fact that he was mentally incompetent, and this did not result from that fact until at the end of the period the judge says, oh, I find him incompetent, so that any period after that would be the result of the fact that he was incompetent. But the -- the delay up to that point was attributable solely to the judge's failure to make a determination.",
  "It was -- it was cleverly disguised, but it really was a question.",
  "Well, what about -- may I just take the question one step further? I think it's in a subsequent clause in that same section requiring the GAO report that it refers to the -- the -- I forget whether -- the expenses of consultants. Why was the word consultant in there? Because as -- as I understand it, a consultant would not be covered by the costs -- the general costs statute.",
  "What -- what do you say about expenses? Isn't -- isn't it a fairly common practice for a -- a trial lawyer to -- to hire his experts and pay them and then bill the client for -- for whatever he's paid for the experts? I mean, if that is the -- this has been a long time since I've practiced law. So maybe that isn't the way it's done anymore. But it -- it certainly has been done that way, and -- and if that is still the practice, wouldn't it make sense for Congress to have assumed that expenses would include those kinds of expenses?",
  "It's the GAO reference. You're right.",
  "What do you -- what do you say about the legislative history, which has been so prominent in the discussion this morning? The conference report.",
  "Well, don't you suppose it represents the view of the House and Senate conferees?",
  "No. I -- I realize that, but I mean, an --",
  "-- an argument, a perfectly fair argument, can be made, whether -- whether you find it dispositive or not, that everything that goes into a committee report of one house cannot simply be taken as a literal reflection of the thinking -- the -- the actual thinking of -- of everybody on that committee, let alone a whole house. But when we're talking about a conference report that has been hammered out between two sets of conferees, I think it is reasonable to suppose that the conferees know exactly what is in that report and would take exception to it if it didn't represent their views. Isn't -- isn't that a -- a fair reason for saying that whatever you may think of reports in general, the conference report probably has a -- a superior authority?",
  "Yes.",
  "Isn't -- isn't it really the point not that it makes no sense, but that it raises a question? It creates the question, which -- which we have in mind when we say the statute is ambiguous, and it is in answering that question, that you then turn to the legislative history, which has a pretty unequivocal statement in your favor. Isn't -- isn't that the -- the way to analyze it?",
  "Under that reading, wouldn't -- wouldn't you have a problem in a State court? Because doesn't this same provision govern in a State court, so that if the State did not have a separate cost statute, it would -- it would authorize nothing. Isn't -- isn't that the problem you'd run into.",
  "Well, do you take that -- please.",
  "Yes, but whether it does or --",
  "Then what you're saying, if I understand it, is that when the Arizona statute refers to whether or not the criminal act was wrong, the criminal act that they are referring to, on your view, is the act of intentional killing, period. And if that's what they mean, then it is irrelevant that he thought he was killing a Martian. But if the Arizona reference to the criminal act being wrong refers to the act in this case -- i.e., killing somebody you believe is a Martian -- then the evidence could come in. So, I think your argument means -- your argument rests on the assumption that the Arizona statute's reference to the criminal act being wrong means the criminal act, in general, in the abstract -- i.e., intentional killing - - as distinct from the act of killing somebody you believe to be a Martian. Is that correct?",
  "Okay.",
  "You mean --",
  "-- the Constitution --",
  "-- requires a diminished- capacity defense?",
  "Well, if you're going to let the evidence of diminished capacity in, on mens rea, you've done, by -- as it were, by the front door, what you can't do by the back door -- i.e., by a diminished- capacity defense -- because you're making the same point. The burdens of proof are different, but you're making the same point.",
  "Do you -- do you think it is unconstitutional for a State to say, \"We know perfectly well that it is much more difficult for both cognitive and reason -- reasons -- and reasons of character and training and so on, for some people to conform themselves to the criminal law than others. We know it's harder for some than others. But we don't care how much harder it is, unless it gets to the point that we define as insanity. Because unless we require something as serious as insanity to excuse, everybody's going to have an excuse, and there isn't going to be any criminal law\" -- is that unconstitutional?",
  "Okay.",
  "Isn't that what the State does when it denies a diminished-capacity -- says, \"We will not have a diminished-capacity defense\"?",
  "Okay. Now --",
  "-- isn't --",
  "No, but isn't --",
  "With respect, isn't that also what the State is getting at when it says, \"We don't allow diminished-capacity evidence in on mens rea, which is the State's burden. Rather, we allow it in only on the defense of insanity, so that we can keep it clear, clear that unless the diminished capacity is so great as to amount to insanity, it's not an excuse\"? And if that is what the State is doing, is there any - - anything unconstitutional about that?",
  "Well, wouldn't it make a difference in a case in which an individual understands, number one, as a general matter, that it is wrong to kill people intentionally? He also believes that there are space aliens. And he believes that it is wrong to kill space aliens. But he kills one. Under the full M'Naghten test, under prong one, he would have a defense. But under the M'Naghten test of prong two alone, since he believed it was wrong to kill Martians, he wouldn't have a defense. Isn't that right?",
  "Well, is -- is there -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I -- I had thought there was an -- an easier answer, and that is that the -- the decision that ultimately the State court will make, as to whether there is or is not preclusion, is not identical to the decision that the Federal court -- that the district court makes on the motion for remand because on the -- and this is the way I was going about it. On the motion for remand, all a Federal court decides is whether, in fact, there is a colorable basis for the removal. When it goes back, if it does go back, to the State court, there will be an opportunity not to go merely to the stage of colorable basis, but to litigate it ultimately on the merits. So -- so that what we have is a -- in effect, a kind of quick-look finding at the Federal level, and that does not preclude a -- a complete development of the issue on the merits in the State court, if that's where it goes.",
  "Okay, but do you take the position --",
  "In other words, you take the position that -- and -- and you may well be right, but I mean, you take the position that there is a complete determination on the merits at the -- at the stage at which the district court rules on the motion to remand.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, you say on the basis of the record then before it. I mean, they can -- they can -- can they put in any evidence they want?",
  "No, but isn't the -- isn't the argument --",
  "-- that in those cases in which Congress has provided, we -- we are not dealing with a situation in which the -- the removal or not, the preemption or not is the end of the litigation. Here, we've got a case in which there -- there are basically two kinds of preemption, as -- as you've recognized. There is -- there is regular preemption, on the basis of which there may or may not be a removal, and there is a preclusion of any litigation whatsoever. And in the cases in which Congress has made specific provision, were they -- the instances -- were they instances in which it was the second issue which precluded any litigation whatsoever? The answer may be yes. I just don't know.",
  "Why do you say it is not -- why do you say that it cannot be examined in State court if there's no appeal in the Federal forum?",
  "Yes, but the --",
  "Well, you wouldn't be stuck with it. I mean, that would be a Federal preclusion decision and that would ultimately be reviewable here.",
  "I -- I don't understand that. Why can't it?",
  "So you're saying we would have to overrule Missouri Pacific?",
  "But in -- in any case, Munsingwear turned on -- not on the availability of -- of an appeal generally, but on the mootness of the case. In other words, Munsingwear said, look, your case disappeared, and the -- the only way to get rid of the order you don't like is -- is vacatur. And if you didn't take that opportunity to get rid of it, then the -- the decision that was made survives, and that gets preclusive effect. It -- it doesn't -- Munsingwear would not apply of its own force in this case.",
  "But -- but here, what is set out in subsection (b) is exactly the reason for Congress' wanting to place these restrictions on it, and that, it seems to me, is the sensible reason for reading it the way your -- your brother on the other side does.",
  "So what -- what you're saying is they've got to have a reasonable ground to take the first step. That may not be a reasonable ground to have taken the second step right then and there, but it's the same reasonableness standard.",
  "That's -- that's --",
  "No, but if -- if the -- if the complaint were -- were simply a complaint of noise, and they got to the -- the gate, the back fence, and they could hear all the racket inside and there didn't seem to be any practical way to get people to come to the fence to talk to them, wouldn't they have had the right to go through the gate and at least go up to the door and bang on the door?",
  "So they could have gotten through the curtilage. They could at least have gotten to the back door based entirely on noise.",
  "Okay.",
  "So you're saying the objective -- the -- the objective officer always knows at least as much as the officers actually know.",
  "Isn't -- isn't that your standard?",
  "Yes. I -- I thought you were getting to the point of saying that on the objective test that you urge, the officer -- the objective police officer who sets the standard is deemed to know at least as much as the officer on the scene actually knows. In other words, we don't exclude information --",
  "-- from our objective test when the officer actually has that information.",
  "Okay.",
  "What -- what --",
  "May -- may I just get back to your general statement? Do I understand you to say that if they arrived on the scene and, you know, a really wild party was going on at 3:00 a.m., they knock at the door, nobody answers the door, they can't hear it for all the screaming and the music and so on, that under those circumstances, the police could not go in to -- to quiet things down?",
  "Well, it was -- it was over until somebody threw the next punch. They don't know what's going to happen the next. The kid broke away from the four people who were trying to restrain him once. Presumably he might be able to do it again. Maybe one of the four who were restraining him might come up with the idea that the best way to stop him from throwing another punch was to throw one at him. The -- the police cannot make -- it seems to me on the facts in -- in this record, could -- could not reasonably draw the assumption that there was no risk of further violence. Am I going wrong somewhere?",
  "No, but the -- as I understand the -- the trial court, he accepted the probability that the knock would be futile, and yet he thought as a formality it was nonetheless required. A, do you understand the trial court to have taken that position? And B, if it did, do you believe that is correct as a statement of Fourth Amendment law?",
  "Well, did -- do you understand the trial court to have taken the position that even though the knock would probably have been futile, the police were required to -- to make it anyway, to knock anyway?",
  "And -- and do you understand that to be a Fourth Amendment requirement, i.e., no futility exception?",
  "Why should there be no futility exception?",
  "Well, that -- that may be on your argument that noise is never sufficient to dispense with a warrant requirement. But it seems to me that in -- in the reasonableness analysis that the trial court was going through, the trial court was saying even if it would probably be futile, it is not a reasonable entry without a knock. And -- and I take it you -- you accept that and you think the trial court was correct, that there is no futility exception.",
  "Why -- why should we require a -- a futile act in the name of reasonableness?",
  "No one is denying that. I mean, we've had a knock and announcement requirement for 900 years.",
  "But the question is do you have to knock and announce when, on the facts before you, it is apparent that nobody will hear the knock and it will just be a wasted gesture.",
  "Why?",
  "But isn't the standard of the Fourth Amendment a reasonableness standard, and isn't there something bizarre about saying reasonableness requires a totally futile gesture?",
  "Well, yes, that's why courts review these things.",
  "And if the court says, yes, based on the evidence before me, it would have been futile, do you think Fourth Amendment reasonableness requires the court and ultimately the officer to demand the knock anyway?",
  "Okay.",
  "The difficulty I have is in the phrase that you have mentioned in the course of your argument a couple of times referring to the \"reasoned moral response.\" And the difficulty I have in squaring \"reasoned moral response\" with the construction that the Kansas Court and we all agree is the proper construction of the -- of the -- of the equipoise kind of provision, is this. Kansas has a right, as I understand it, to define what it regards as the aggravating circumstances, those that support a death verdict. And Kansas has done so. Kansas is also saying that if a jury cannot find that the aggravators, as we've defined them, outweigh the mitigators -- i.e., if the jury is in equipoise -- the result must be death, anyway. And that does not seem to be a reasoned moral response. I'm assuming that a reasoned moral response would be: the death penalty should be imposed because the aggravators do outweigh -- i.e., it's not equipoise -- the aggravators are heavier. And because Kansas is saying, \"Even though they're not, death is the result, anyway,\" it doesn't seem like a reasoned moral response. What is your answer to that?",
  "Well, that's the issue.",
  "But here we have, it seems to me, to be a stark finding that it has not been proven. That is what \"equipoise\" means. If aggravators are the basis for a death sentence, the equipoise finding is, \"Aggravators don't predominate. We cannot make that conclusion. We're right on the fence.\" And it seems to me that to call that a reasoned moral response -- \"We're on the fence, but execute anyway\" -- seems a total inconsistency.",
  "But it's a decision that says, \"We don't know what should be done.\" If aggravators define the basis for execution, and mitigators define the basis for life, the equipoise verdict says, in so many words, \"We don't know which is more important.\" And Kansas says, when the jury comes back and says, \"We don't know,\" that the result should be death. And that is what seems to me inconsistent with the notion of a reasoned moral response.",
  "But that is not our case, is it? Because our case is not, \"We don't find that the mitigators outweigh.\" Our case is, \"We find the mitigators are of equal weight.\" That's why you get to equipoise. It's not a question of the failure of mitigators to predominate.",
  "It is the sufficiency of mitigators to equal in weight. And that's what poses the problem, it seems to me.",
  "Of course it is not to predominate, but it is something more precise than merely not predominating. It is a fact, in effect, that you don't know, if all you know is that they don't predominate. The fact that you know, here, is that they equal, and --",
  "That's right. We don't -- we don't know whether that was the case here or not.",
  "As I understand it, our question is, if a jury could return the death verdict in the equipoise situation, as the Kansas Supreme Court has defined it, is that -- is that statute allowing for that possibility constitutional? Isn't that --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Is that the law in Kansas? I mean, I thought -- correct me if I'm wrong, because I may have made a wrong assumption here -- I thought the finding of guilt to an aggravated murder is the preface to a determination as to whether aggravators or mitigators predominate. And, based upon that determination, there will be a decision as to whether the sentence should be death or life.",
  "Right.",
  "And, at that point, we don't have any way of knowing, I take it, whether the penalty should be life or death.",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay. But --",
  "But --",
  "-- what I'm -- what I'm -- what I'm getting at is, I don't -- I -- as I understand the Kansas scheme, the determination of guilt, to aggravated murder, does not create a presumption in favor of the death penalty.",
  "Okay.",
  "Right. But the fact of -- let me -- I think we've got a terminological problem -- the fact that there has been a finding of guilt of aggravated murder is not tantamount, as I understand it, to a finding that aggravating factors to be considered at the penalty phase have also been found. Is that --",
  "-- correct?",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay.",
  "But regardless of the likelihood of that situation in any given case -- and I happen to agree with Justice Scalia; I mean, I don't think the likelihood of that in a given case is great -- we're, nonetheless, I think, faced with the fact that the Supreme Court of Kansas says, \"That can happen.\"",
  "\"And if it does happen, the result is death.\" And I think we've --",
  "-- we've got to take that as a given. I mean --",
  "-- do you see any way out of it? I --",
  "But I --",
  "If I -- if I may interrupt you, I -- your point, I take it, is, the jurors have got to make this decision, not the Legislature of Kansas.",
  "Okay.",
  "But I think Justice Kennedy is saying, when they make that determination, \"We can't tell whether one outweighs the other,\" that they are making a moral judgment there. And what's your -- what's your answer to that?",
  "He's saying they are making a moral judgment.",
  "And they know what its consequence is.",
  "In other words you're --",
  "-- saying moral --",
  "-- judgment has got to be an either/or judgment, not a \"we can't figure it out\" judgment.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, you're saying that there is a uniformity between a master contract between the United States and Blue Cross on the one hand, and Blue Cross and the subscriber on the other hand. But doesn't the United States approve the latter contract? In other words, doesn't it -- well, I forget the initials -- OPM or whatever it is. Doesn't it have a -- a requirement of approval going to the terms of the contract between Empire and -- and the employee before that contract goes into effect?",
  "But isn't that -- isn't that crucial, though, in your answer to Justice Breyer? Because if the United States -- if OPM approves the Empire employee contract, maybe you can say, well, gee, there's something strange going on at OPM that they don't require exactly the same terms in the contract with the employee that they -- that they require in their master contract with -- with Empire. But it doesn't say anything one way or the other about the interest of the United States in having uniformity in which the -- in the -- in the interpretation and application of contracts, which they do approve, between Empire, other Blue Cross Blue Shield entities, and their employees.",
  "And the United States is treated the same in relation to all Federal employees. I mean, there's -- there's an interest in uniformity for fairness among employees, and there's an interest in the United States in having the same expectation, in this case a reimbursement expectation, no matter where the employee is.",
  "Your -- your answer to -- to Justice Scalia -- I'm sorry -- just did not register. I don't understand --",
  "Yes, but do they take money in New York that you haven't gotten from the other side?",
  "Isn't -- isn't that --",
  "-- isn't that -- isn't that --",
  "But at the end of the day, the money, every penny collected, minus any service fee, is going to go into the Federal Treasury. Isn't it?",
  "But whether it's collected or not may -- indeed, may vary depending on whether State law or Federal law applies. And if Federal law applies, then you have the jurisdictional consequence.",
  "Well, presumably it didn't do that because the preemption provision does not rely upon conflict.",
  "Well, it doesn't apply to reimbursement provisions, you say, but it does apply to benefits. And -- and the value of a benefit is going to vary from the -- the policy limit to zero depending, in a case like this, on whether a third party payment has to be given to the Government with -- with -- isn't -- isn't that a question of benefit?",
  "Will you quote the language that you're referring to?",
  "I -- I don't want to take up too --",
  "My -- my concern simply is that you've made a conclusory statement that elsewhere there's a definition that doesn't --",
  "And -- and --",
  "After the argument, just give me a cite so I know exactly what you're -- you're getting at.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Stock, we have one loose end. I think we do. Both Justice Breyer and I have -- have asked the question whether OPM has to approve of the terms of the contract between Blue Cross and -- and the -- the insured. Is -- does OPM have to approve?",
  "Assuming the consistency term, that supports an argument that the Government has an interest in -- in uniformity of -- of interpretation, doesn't it?",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "But if -- if --",
  "-- if, in fact, there were consistently only in this remote sense so that the interests which are meant to be protected in the -- in the OPM Blue Cross contract aren't being protected at the next level, then OPM could bring an action against -- against Blue Cross saying it's not consistent enough, couldn't it?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, but doesn't vicious will mean simply the will to commit the crime?",
  "Well, what do you mean by vicious? I mean, that the person is -- is nasty, that the person is antisocial or asocial?",
  "I don't know what the added element is.",
  "But when you -- when you say freely choosing, what you mean, I take it, is choosing with -- without consideration of pressure from a third party. That's what you mean, isn't it?",
  "Okay.",
  "But if the -- the third -- the third party may, indeed, exert pressure, but I take it you would agree that it is still the decision of the defendant whether to cave in to that pressure or not, whether to commit the crime or not to commit the crime.",
  "Well, I -- I don't want to get lost in -- in rhetoric here. Isn't it still the case, even on your theory, that the defendant in these circumstances makes a choice? It may be a troubled choice, a much more difficult choice to make than it would be otherwise, but the defendant still makes a choice as to whether to cave in to the third party's pressure or not, whether to commit the crime or not. Isn't that true even on your theory?",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay. But are you making the argument that this number indicates a congressional intent and that what we ought to do is come up with a rule because Congress intended it? Or are you making the argument that yours is the better rule, and as a matter of common law, which -- which it is our responsibility to develop, we should see it your way? Which argument are you making?",
  "Is -- is -- I didn't mean to cut you off.",
  "I was -- you have a tougher argument, don't you, when you -- when you face the comparison between duress here and entrapment because it's -- it's quite true in -- in entrapment you're talking about the actions of a -- of a third party which is causing something, but the -- the ultimate determination that has to be made is a determination about the -- in effect, the -- the inclination, the willingness, the readiness of the defendant to have committed the act. And -- and yet, I take it, it's -- it's assumed that so far as the entrapment defense is concerned, the burden is on the Government. So if the burden is on the Government in what is a -- a somewhat difficult issue for the Government to carry the burden on in entrapment, wouldn't coherence suggest that a fortiori it ought to be on -- on duress?",
  "Well, the burden of going forward with evidence.",
  "You mean the burden of persuasion.",
  "And don't they do that by -- don't the allegations do that here by claiming that the corporation was manufacturing or providing false Social Security cards and was giving aid to the immigrants if the -- the law got too close to them? I mean, that is not merely the conduct by a corporation of the normal business of hiring and employing people. Isn't that the sort of extra that is alleged that takes this out simply of the -- of the category of the -- of the corporation conducting its own affairs?",
  "Well, maybe I misunderstood the thrust of the allegation. I thought the thrust of the allegation was that Mohawk was acting illegally in providing phony Social Security cards.",
  "Doesn't -- doesn't that get them at least to -- through the motion to dismiss, and doesn't it at least get them to summary judgment?",
  "But in -- in Reves -- and if -- and -- and you -- you may well correct me on this because I'm -- I'm -- my memory is not precise. But I thought in Reves, in effect, what they did was to lie in the course of doing the sort of the thing that they normally do. Here, the allegation is that they were doing something, providing phony ID's, that employers don't normally do. Isn't -- and, you know, maybe that's a fine line, but is -- is it not a fine enough line to get it out of Reves and get it beyond the motion to dismiss?",
  "Well, there is -- there is a common element of illegality, but the distinction is that in Reves, you're supposed to be providing these services, making out statements, et cetera, and you put the wrong numbers in them.",
  "Whereas in -- in this case, an employer does not normally go about providing phony ID's or any ID's for the people it hires. It says, who are you? What's your Social Security number? And -- and there's -- there's an affirmative act here.",
  "In -- in -- yes, but you're doing it in connection with a -- a joint recruitment activity. In other words, the -- the agencies that you hire to get the workers up to the door are not going to succeed very well if -- if all the workers are going to arrive without any papers and without any -- any indication like a Social Security card and so on that they can be part of -- of the legal work force. So there's -- there's something extra being done both by the -- the recruiters and by you, and the extra, in effect, is a -- a scheme to provide phony ID's that suggest that these people are -- are lawful rather than -- than unlawful immigrants.",
  "Okay, but I still think sooner or later we have to come back to something that you and I went over a moment ago, and that is the -- one function, maybe the function, of -- of the -- of the -- the entity claimed here is -- is providing cover for the illegal status of the aliens. And it seems to me that there is at least a bare claim here that Mohawk is directing the affairs or the business of -- of this third entity --",
  "-- by -- by the way that it is -- allegedly provides phony Social Security cards.",
  "Where -- where do we -- you're going to have to help me out then. Where -- where in the -- the pleadings or the -- the papers do we get into the Social -- do we get the allegations of the Social Security card?",
  "Okay.",
  "But isn't that factual allegation, as a bare matter, sufficient to satisfy the objection that you raise, that something more than merely the activity -- the conduct of -- of their separate business is going on?",
  "Well, if -- if, in fact, it is the case that Mohawk is -- is providing the Social Security cards, isn't it directing the means by which the third -- the third entity is, in effect, illegally -- or supplying illegal workers in -- in this -- this joint enterprise?",
  "Is it reasonable -- is it reasonable to suppose, on the basis reading the allegations as they have to be read at this stage of the proceeding -- is it reasonable to infer that -- from the allegation that there is an understanding between Mohawk and the employment agencies that Mohawk will provide this documentation and therefore make the scheme work?",
  "It doesn't say that in any -- any black letter statement.",
  "But isn't -- isn't the plus simply more than one act?",
  "So -- so -- no, but I mean literally. As -- as long as -- as two illegal workers are going to be hired, isn't that sufficient to convert -- to go from conspiracy to -- to RICO on your analysis?",
  "Do any of the court of appeals opinions deal specifically with the peculiarity of this definition in which, although it starts out with the word includes, then follows a -- a listing, A, B, C, and D, and then it repeats one, but only one, of the items on the list and says groups of these items, i.e., individuals, are included? That's the peculiarity of the definition. Do any of the courts of appeals come to grips with that?",
  "May -- just as a -- maybe this is technical, but what did you ask for for relief? Did you ask for relief that the State be enjoined from using this method, or that the State be enjoined from executing him until an acceptable method had been found? Because in the first case, the door theoretically is open to seriatim 1983 actions, and in the second case, presumably the issue would be resolved in this one case, as you suggest. So which did you ask for? Injunction against this or injunction until an acceptable alternative came up?",
  "Well, if that's -- if that's the relief you get, then the door would be open to successive different 1983 actions every time the State comes up with -- with a new protocol. Whereas, if what the -- if -- if the trial court -- if you succeed at this stage, if we say, yes, you're -- you're properly in court and you go ahead and litigate it, if the trial court, in fact, awards not the injunction that you asked for but the injunction saying do not execute this person until a constitutional protocol has been proposed and accepted by the court, then everything will get resolved in this one action, as you suggest. So would -- would you consent to -- as it were, to an amendment of your prayer for relief so that the injunction will be in such a form that everything can get resolved in this one case?",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "You -- you would agree to that?",
  "When did you ask for the public -- when did you ask for the -- a -- a statement of the protocol that would be used in your case?",
  "May -- may I ask you to clarify one thing? I take it, at this point, there isn't any question about the -- the amounts and ingredients that will be used in -- if -- if the execution goes forward. But my recollection is that you said that your -- your request for a specification of this formula or protocol was denied by Florida. Did you ever, as a result of your records request or otherwise, get a statement directly from Florida to you that the following proportions of chemicals will be used?",
  "But until you went into that proceeding, I take it, you had asked Florida to specify and Florida said, no, it would not do so?",
  "Did -- did you ever say to -- to any Florida official, please tell me what the chemicals are and the amounts that will be used --",
  "-- not asking for records, just asking for a statement about what they were going to do?",
  "But I guess before you went into court with a public records action, did you ever say to somebody, tell us what you're going to do?",
  "What -- what I'm getting at is --",
  "-- there -- there are ways to find out. One would be to ask. One would be to chop the door down with an ax to find out if there's a statement hidden inside. Did you ever try the easy way and simply say to them, will you specify for us what you're going to do and how you're going to do this?",
  "Okay.",
  "What is the source of his obligation to do this? I mean, why does he have an obligation under the Eighth Amendment or under any other ground to tell the State how to execute people?",
  "That -- that was a fact in Nelson, but my question to you is if -- if we were to agree with you and say that that, in fact, is a -- is an element of a 1983 action here, what would be the source of -- of the -- the conclusion that -- that he has to propose a less painful alternative?",
  "No. But I mean, that's not -- that's not the issue. I'm not asking you about res judicata. I'm saying that if he comes into court and, as Justice Ginsburg suggested in her hypo, his experts demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fact finder that there will, in a certain number of cases, be excruciating pain, and he is at least within the risk of that, your response is we're still -- that is no grounds for enjoining the execution under 1983. We can still execute unless he comes up with a proposal for a less painful way of doing it. And what I want to know is, why does he have such an obligation? Why isn't it enough for him to show that there is a probability that he will suffer excruciating pain?",
  "But it was mentioned -- it was mentioned in Nelson. But what would be the reason for -- for elevating that -- that fact in Nelson to a requirement? What is the legal principle that would support your argument?",
  "But is there -- is there in this case? I mean, the Lancet article has been out there for a while, and it certainly is enough to suggest, in your words, that there is something problematic about the manner in which Florida proposes to do this. And yet, we have not heard a word that Florida has made any effort whatsoever to find an alternative or, for that matter, to -- to disprove what the Lancet article suggests. And so it's one thing for you to say the States have discretion. I don't think that answers Justice Kennedy's question as to why the State does not have an obligation to fulfill its constitutional duty to execute without gratuitous pain. And I don't see why you have given any answer to -- to the proposal that that obligation requires the State to do some investigation of it's own.",
  "I -- I understand your -- your argument to be -- and I don't think you're making it here, but I understood your argument elsewhere to be we knew about Sims, but when they stonewalled us and said we won't tell you what we're going to use, we had reason to question whether they were going to follow Sims. Isn't -- isn't that your point?",
  "Even -- even if Michigan doesn't, I mean, that has nothing -- as I understand it, that -- that doesn't affect the -- the answer to the Federal question that we have because, as I understand it, we -- we can -- we can take as good law that even with a warrant that does not have a no-knock authorization, if the police have a justification for going in without knocking, so far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned, the search is still good.",
  "Isn't that correct?",
  "So what we're really arguing is what -- what is Michigan law on the subject, but the -- the issue we've got is not Michigan law.",
  "And you -- you concede that there was error in execution here? You concede that there was a violation because -- technically because there was no knock?",
  "Why do you concede that? You've got a case in which, as I understand it, not only was the evidence but the warrant itself an indication not only that drugs were present, but that guns were present. It's perfectly true we don't have a general rule that anytime you do a drug search, you can do a no-knock, but in this case you had specific evidence that there were firearms there. And based on what I've seen in the case, I don't know why Michigan did not argue that, in fact, it was justified to go in without knocking. And I'll be candid to say you -- to tell you that the fact that Michigan does not make that argument suggests to me that Michigan is trying to structure a case in which it's going to have the best shot to -- to get the exclusionary rule out of the way here. Why don't you claim that the search was lawful?",
  "Well, Richards precluded a general rule, but it didn't preclude you from arguing in a specific case, and it's the fact that the prosecutor and, hence, all the way up the line to you do not argue that is -- is what I don't understand.",
  "I don't think we have to revisit Richards. I -- I think what -- what I'm -- what I'm concerned is that you don't make an argument based on the evidence in this case that you had probable cause to believe that there were going to be guns facing you when -- when you went in the door and therefore the knock was not required.",
  "Well, are you suggesting -- did -- did the warrant -- I don't know this. I should but I don't. Did the warrant authorize seizure of guns as well as --",
  "-- drugs? Well, are you suggesting that the -- the gun portion of the authorization was, in fact, invalid?",
  "Okay.",
  "If -- so -- in any case, at -- at the moment that you got the warrant, you -- you had, in fact, a -- a finding by a trial court, or a -- whoever the issuing magistrate was, that there was probable cause to believe that you were going to confront guns as well as drugs inside. And -- and Richards does not seem to me to be a good reason, under those circumstances, to concede that you didn't have a basis for -- for dispensing with the knock.",
  "There was specific knowledge here.",
  "Well, you got a -- you got a warrant --",
  "-- that said look for them. That's about as specific as you can get.",
  "Well, you can't have it both ways.",
  "Do you -- do you dispute -- your -- your brother on the other side said in his argument that he had not heard a dispute about this. But do you dispute his claim that there has never been any -- at least in recent history, any -- any civil judgment actually rendered against anyone in the officer's position?",
  "But we don't -- we don't have any indication that there's an effective deterrence then in civil suits. Maybe there will be some day, but we haven't seen it yet in Michigan, I take it.",
  "And it may mean that -- that potential plaintiffs say if the courts are winking at this in the criminal case, we don't have much chance of getting a -- a verdict in a civil case.",
  "We don't know, but that might be the case too, mightn't it?",
  "Isn't -- isn't the problem that in -- in fact, it's the product of both? The warrant alone does not get the police officer into -- into the building. It -- it is in fact the entry that gets the police officer into the building, the execution of the warrant. The judge has to do something. The police officer has to do something. And the question that I think we face when we say is the later search the product of the entry, is -- is what your -- what -- I think a point that -- that counsel on the other side was making. It's a pragmatic point. Where do we draw the line of causation? And his answer is -- and I think the -- the answer of the cases that Justice Breyer was -- was referring to -- is this. We draw it in a way that will allow us to deter illegal police conduct, and if we engage in this slicing process of causation that you talk about, there will be no deterrent for the violation of the no-knock rule. If instead we say, yes, this is enough the product that we ought to deter -- that we ought to -- to respond to it in a way that will deter the no-knock and therefore we find causation and we get deterrence. What is fallacious about that argument?",
  "We do that every single time we exclude a piece of evidence in every suppression case, don't we?",
  "Don't -- don't we?",
  "Well, what -- what do you say to Justice Breyer's argument that we haven't previously analyzed suppression by tracing or trying to trace the causal connection between a particular piece of evidence and a particular reason for the rule that was broken? What we have said in the past is if the rule or the standard is violated and the search is therefore unreasonable, the evidence doesn't come in. You're proposing a -- a different causal analysis. You're proposing a causal analysis that requires the connection between a piece of evidence and the particular reason for one of these standards in every case in which suppression is -- is requested. Number one, do you agree that that -- that would be a departure, as Justice Breyer suggested? And number two, what would be the justification for that?",
  "Well, it does relate to the privacy interests, and we've seen the explanation. One of the reasons for requiring the knock is that there is enough respect for a person's home, a person's privacy to say the police should not barge in like an invading army.",
  "That is a respect for privacy.",
  "And that is involved -- and that is -- that is the whole point of -- of knock and announce, isn't it?",
  "We're talking about the privacy of individual in his home, and the reasonableness of the search depends upon the reasonableness of invading the individual's privacy in his home. Is that not the general rule?",
  "Then there will never be a suppression of -- of evidence specified in a warrant when the warrant's no-knock component is violated --",
  "-- because we -- we will say -- in every single time, following your argument, you will -- we will say the -- the violation had nothing to do with the authorization to seize the evidence. The violation simply had to do with the -- with the -- the niceties and the risks involved in entering. So if we accept your argument, no-knock is -- is a dead duck, isn't it?",
  "No, but apparently you're saying we would not suppress because as long as the warrant specified the items to be seized and they didn't go beyond that, there was no causal connection between the fact that they broke in and disturbed people in the night, when they were not authorized to, and their ultimate obtaining of -- of the evidence. Once again, it seems to me if we follow your -- your reasoning, then the distinction between the nighttime and the daytime warrant is a dead letter.",
  "The Constitution requires --",
  "The Constitution requires a reasonable search. It is hornbook law that violating no-knock, violating nighttime searches when only a daytime search is authorized amounts to an unreasonable search. You're saying that's utterly irrelevant because there's no causal connection between that violation and the seizure of the particular items that the warrant -- the warrant specified.",
  "Well, that may be why they had the conference, but they got into the colloquy that Justice Ginsburg described. And the last -- as I recall, the last reference to \"factors,\" whether aggravating or mitigating, was simply in terms of the list, or \"the listing,\" I guess the term was, so that the -- it seems to me at least, there's a fair argument on the other side of this case, that the last reference that the -- that the judge made to the jurors with respect to aggravation or mitigation was to refer to a listing. The listing itself didn't have anything to do, as I understand it, with the instruction that you are not limited to the listed mitigating factors. So, the concern is that, because the last reference was to the list, that the list included factor (k), without embellishment, and that jurors tend to give -- we have held that the jurors tend to give the greatest emphasis to clarifying instructions or later instructions in response to questions. Isn't it a pretty good argument that, in this case, there is -- there's a reasonable likelihood that the jurors went back to their task thinking that they were limited to the list?",
  "Well, I -- I'm not necessarily saying that's my position, so you don't have to be respectful to me about it. Just - -",
  "-- knock it down if you can.",
  "Well, except for the language of factor (k) itself. And if -- without some embellishment, isn't it a bit of a stretch to think that factor (k) goes as far as Skipper evidence?",
  "But, didn't he go beyond saying it was weak? He did say that, but didn't he say that he doubted that it fit within (k)?",
  "So, the prosecutor, I take it, would have answered Justice Stevens's question the other way. The prosecutor would have said, \"Well, no, this probably would not be understood by the jurors to refer to the gravity of the offense.\"",
  "No, but it is different, in the respect that he would first have to violate the law by entering the United States.",
  "All right, Mr. Kneedler, assuming that -- as I understand it, the answer you just gave, your second point, as well as the point that you and Justice Stevens were debating, turns, in your view, on a definition, or a reading, of the statute that would work this way: that if, under State law, the act were a felony, but, under Federal law, the action was merely a misdemeanor, it would still, for purposes of this definition, be an aggravated felony.",
  "That -- isn't that very strange, that Congress would have wanted a reading of the statute that would turn its definition of a \"misdemeanor crime\" into an aggravated felony for purposes of the immigration law?",
  "No, but I'm - -",
  "-- saying, if - -",
  "No, go ahead.",
  "Well - -",
  "-- I know it says that, but that doesn't necessarily take you any further than saying that if the words of the statute refer to something that could be a State law felony, under the -- under the penultimate sentence, it will count. It does not necessarily answer the question that we have, and that is whether a particular reference in the statute is a reference to a Federal felony or a State felony. So, it has a -- the penultimate sentence has work to do. And, in fact, we can see the work being done in the -- in the very definition of \"drug trafficking\" -- but it doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion that you draw from it.",
  "Even when - -",
  "-- the consequence, in effect, is to turn for -- turn the gravity of the Federal misdemeanor into the gravity of - -",
  "-- a felony that --",
  "-- just happens to be a State felony.",
  "No, I realize that. But, if we're asking, \"What is important in the mind of Congress, for purposes of the immigration law?\" one would suppose that the most obvious touchstone of importance is the way Federal law deals with it -- i.e., in the case of a crime, whether Federal law calls it a felony or Federal law calls it a misdemeanor. You know, in your reading, when Federal law calls it a misdemeanor, if State law calls it a felony, it becomes a Federal felony for the immigration law. And that's what seems to me odd.",
  "Yes, but - -",
  "May I just ask one --",
  "It's one thing to turn to State law to get an answer where there is no other answer. The problem here is that State law and Federal law are at odds in determining the gravity of the offense. The Federal law, on my hypothesis, would say, \"It is minor; it's just a misdemeanor.\" The State says, \"No, it is a felony.\" It seems to me very odd, given the tension between the State and Federal classifications, to say that, for Federal purposes, the State classification is going to trump the Federal classification; and that's a different situation from the one you posit.",
  "No, but - -",
  "-- your point is, it's not jurisdictional.",
  "With respect to -- whether we are talking about a jurisdictional defense or whether we are talking about an affirmative defense, assuming jurisdiction, is there any -- is there any reason for us to accept your position, other than the reason that you have mentioned a number of times, and that is the adoption and encouragement of a public policy that allows patent challenges freely? Is that the nub of our reasoning, if we were to support your position, either jurisdictionally, in this case, or in recognizing -- or the -- in dealing with the affirmative defense in another case?",
  "Well, Altvater is difficult for you, isn't it? Because there was an injunction in Altvater, wasn't there?",
  "Which raises an entirely different policy issue?",
  "But that is -- that is a good reason. And, I take it, it's your logic that that is a good reason to recognize a fairly broad right on the part of the licensee to challenge.",
  "In other words, the nub of your position, as I understand it, is the public policy that favors relative - -",
  "-- freedom to challenge --",
  "No - -",
  "No, I realize that. But, I mean, what we've got in this case, and in any of these cases, is a question of line-drawing under Article III. And your argument is, you want to draw the line where you want it drawn primarily because there are practical reasons to favor a public policy of free challenge.",
  "Why should we accept the characterization that it's a compromise? As I -- and maybe I'm just factually wrong here? I thought, at the time they entered into the license agreement, they had some disagreements about the scope of the then-patent, the scope of the anticipated patent, and so on, and they couldn't very well be resolved. But they were -- they were not settling, in the -- in the classic sense of the word, a -- let us say, a focus claim, one against the other.",
  "But had they gotten to the point, prior to the execution of the contract, in which one party was saying, \"You may not do this,\" and the other party was saying, \"Oh, yes I can,\" so that there -- there was a focus controversy that would have been the subject matter of a conventional lawsuit, then and there, had there not been this license agreement?",
  "But the question is, How far ahead of the pass can they get and still call it a settlement?\" in the sense that you're using that term.",
  "But - -",
  "But you - -",
  "Right. But you were saying that the status of that agreement, for purposes of the jurisdictional question here, is exactly the same as the status of an agreement that they might have entered into after one party had brought suit against the other. And --",
  "And they -- they had settled. And then, later on, somebody wanted to repudiate the settlement.",
  "In any event - -",
  "-- it's equivalent to a settlement after a formal demand has been made.",
  "One further -- on further wrinkle. What if the contract goes the further step and says, \"Even if the patent were determined, in any action, to be invalid, there will still be a royalty payable, because that's what -- that's -- that is consideration for the fact that we are not going to start any controversy now.\" Let's assume they assume, precisely, the invalidity. Would you say the contract is unenforceable then, and the -- and the --",
  "-- and, for jurisdictional purposes, there would be no case or controversy then?",
  "The - -",
  "Take the Chief Justice's hypothetical, add the following. There is a provision in there to the effect that if, during the term of this contract, the license is determined to be invalid, royalties will still be payable under this contract --",
  "-- because that is one of the contingencies, which is a consideration for our bargain. Would you say, in those circumstances, that your answer would be the same, that there's no -- there's no case or --",
  "No, but I'm talking about jurisdictional purposes.",
  "But do you see --",
  "Well, if -- do you see a difference between -- I guess you're saying there's no difference between my added wrinkle on the hypo and the Chief Justice's hypo, for jurisdictional purposes.",
  "Okay.",
  "Oh, there are many dismissed, for the reasons that they aren't concrete, definite - - there are a lot of reasons why to dismiss it. I'm just wondering if there is an additional reason that there has to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the declaratory judgment action. It's that phrase that I've never found anywhere - -",
  "-- and can't think of any reason why that would be an additional constitutional requirement. And I'm putting that directly to you, because I want to hear you give me the counterexamples.",
  "What - -",
  "May I ask you, on that point - - I understand what you're saying, and I've looked at your authority, but, right in the provision itself, there is a verbal distinction made between actions for money damages, and what, at the end of the provision, they refer to as \"administrative proceedings\" in providing for the 1-year supplementary rule. Doesn't the statute, in effect, say, \"We don't mean, by 'action,' what we would possibly - - what possibly might be included as an administrative proceeding\"? If they had wanted an administrative proceeding to be a subset of the actions for money damages, wouldn't it have been sensible for Congress to say in -- to refer, instead of to \"administrative proceedings,\" to \"administrative actions\"?",
  "You mean - -",
  "-- the regulations don't refer to the initial letter?",
  "So, they literally could start, absolutely out of the blue, by issuing the order?",
  "Well, on that theory, then, there was -- there was no time issue with respect to the right to offset, then, in the OLC's position.",
  "No, but I thought your -- in answer to Justice Scalia, you said what was essential to the -- to OLC's position was that the offset is like a prejudgment attachment, and, in effect, it's an attachment without process. If that's the case, then timing should have nothing to do with it. Conversely, as Justice Scalia said, if timing does have something to do with it, timing presumably derives from this provision; this provision, therefore, must have been assumed to apply to administrative proceedings. So, either there's no time question with respect to the offsets, or, if there is a time question with respect to the offsets, it implies an OLC position that this provision applies to administrative proceedings.",
  "What's wrong with that logic?",
  "You put me - -",
  "-- in good company, but - -",
  "No, but if it was - -",
  "-- a prejudgment - -",
  "It was a prejudgment attachment in aid of what could be accomplished administratively by, ultimately, an administrative judgment.",
  "Would the -- at the time that 4515 -- is that the --",
  "20- -- I'm sorry. At the time that was enacted, were there any limitations in other statutes on the commencement of administrative proceedings?",
  "Mr. Fisher, I realize you don't concede, in fact, quite to the contrary, you deny that the failure to pay the full rate is -- could be considered a practice here. But let's assume for the sake of argument that it is a practice within the meaning of the text. If the -- if the agency had explicitly said, what we are doing here in defining this practice as unlawful or unjust, is to define it as such within the meaning of, what is it, 201(b), so they make explicit reference to the statute and they say, we are fleshing out the statute, would your position be the same?",
  "But it wasn't textually as nice as that?",
  "Let's assume in the reg itself, they were that precise. Would your position be exactly the same?",
  "Sure.",
  "Okay.",
  "You invite me to change the hypothetical, then, by jacking it up in this respect. The FCC gives the reason. And it says, the reason it's unjust and unreasonable is that the carriers are getting a free ride on the pay phones, et cetera. So they fill in the gap that you claim. They have a reason. Would your answer or your position still be the same?",
  "Are there any times under any circumstances that you can think of in which the FCC can adequately and validly define a practice as unjust and unreasonable within the meaning of the statute so that, in fact, in applying the statute, we would follow -- be bound to follow the regs?",
  "Okay. But why can't they pass a regulation that says don't gouge pay phone operators?",
  "Well, do they? I mean, the statute of the United States says that -- I think I'm correct -- the statute of the United States says they can't be required, the caller cannot be required to put in the quarter in order to get the 800 number and so on. So as a matter of law, don't we have to say that the, in practical terms, the caller doesn't owe? Somebody owes. Somebody ought to pay for the use of this facility. But Congress has said it is not the end user.",
  "Well, the customer is going to pay if, in fact, the long distance carrier is the one who has to make the immediate payment, because that payment is going to be figured in the long distance rate. So that ultimately, the end user is going to pay for the service he gets, and Congress is simply saying, the way to make this thing work in a sensible and simple way is to require the long distance carrier to make the reimbursement. The economic end result is exactly the same as it would have been if they had said, well, you can send a bill for 25 cents to the end user.",
  "It hasn't decreed otherwise.",
  "Isn't that the classic situation in which agencies are supposed to figure out what to do?",
  "Well, as I understand it, it came to the conclusion not that they were not acting under 276, but that, in fact, the cause of action has to refer back to 201.",
  "May I focus your return to me? Because I want to take up with where your answer to Justice Scalia left off. As I understand it, you were saying that the rate in this case is unreasonable because the party or the person who is responsible for the use of the pay phone facilities is the person who's making the call, not the long distance carrier. My question to you is, isn't that simply a choice of characterization? Because another way of looking at it would be that the person who makes the call wants to use long distance facilities to get to the person he wants to talk to. And, therefore, the long distance facility in every pay phone case is using the pay phone in order to get the customer to what the long distance facility provides. Why then isn't it just as fair to characterize the use of the pay phone here as for the benefit of the carrier as for the benefit of the customer? And if that is just as fair, doesn't that end the distinction that you drew with Justice Scalia saying that it is not fair in this case.",
  "My question is simply, you can say -- one way of looking at this transaction is, it is the guy making the call who's using it. Another way is to say the long distance facilities carrier is using it to get the call to the long distance facility. If you look at it in way B, doesn't your argument for unreasonableness disappear?",
  "What difference does that make? What difference does that make? The use of the phone is of a value of 24 cents. But the value of using the phone is a value not only to the caller, but to the long distance provider who couldn't provide anything to the caller without the pay phone? Why isn't the alternative characterization just as easy, regardless of how they get to 24 cents?",
  "Excuse me, but aren't you arguing with the 24 cents, as opposed to creating an argument about what is the proper characterization of the transaction?",
  "The reason is that the store that rents the cell phone is getting rental income from the cell phone. And in the case of the pay phone, the pay phone operator is going to get zero, unless there is some such scheme as this.",
  "I take it you would be satisfied -- not wholly satisfied, but substantially satisfied if we said, yeah, we accept the doctrine of equivalence, and we think the instruction on contributory negligence was correct. Because that would mean in the next case, you would get a proximate cause instruction on defendant's negligence.",
  "If we came out the way I just described - -",
  "We wouldn't have to.",
  "Mr. Phillips, may I interrupt on exactly the point that I think you're addressing with Justice Breyer? As I understand your argument, you're saying one view of Rogers is that the in whole or in part language eliminates the proximate cause instruction. We all agree that that is one view of Rogers.",
  "But it also does something else. And I don't think we disagree about that either. It specifically instructs the jury that multiple causation may be present. And if it is, if the defendant is at least one, the source of one of those causes under Rogers even slightly - -",
  "-- that that will suffice. The problem I have with -- in a way with your response to Justice Breyer, and the problem that I have with the instruction that your side requested on contributory negligence is this: It seems to me that the in whole or in part language would be wrong on contributory negligence, or at least it would be very misleading, for the simple reason that you never get to contributory negligence unless you found the defendant was negligent in the first place.",
  "And therefore, if the plaintiff is also negligent, it will necessarily be in part. It couldn't be wholly or in part. If it were wholly negligent, you would never have found the defendant was negligent in the first place.",
  "So that to the extent the instruction addresses multiple causation, it would be misleading to the jury, and it would assume a possibility that couldn't happen. Therefore, if you are not going to mislead the jury on multiple causation when you instruct on contributory negligence, you've got to have some other way of addressing the proximate cause language. Is that analysis right or wrong?",
  "Okay. But the instruction that your side asked for, as I understand it, was not a slight cause instruction, it was an in whole or in part instruction.",
  "Okay, and that -- all right. But if you're asking for the in whole or in part instruction on contributory negligence, it seems to me the judge has got to have been correct in saying no to that, because to the extent that it addresses multiple causation, it would be addressing a problem that couldn't even occur in contributory negligence which will always be in part.",
  "Well, maybe that was not the basis on which he rejected it, but if -- we've got to consider it in deciding whether to reverse it.",
  "But that's not what he said. He said equivalence instruction was not on multiple causation. It was the equivalence instruction on either proximate cause or not proximate cause. It was the causation issue, it was the proximate causation issue, not the multiple causation issue that concerned you, right?",
  "They don't have to have proximate, we don't have to have proximate.",
  "Okay. But because the instruction addresses both, in one view, proximate cause and multiple cause, it would have been misleading so far as the multiple cause issue was concerned, and a request for an instruction in whole or in part on contributory negligence really should have been denied. Is that correct?",
  "You were entitled -- your argument is you were entitled to an equivalent instruction on the issue of the need to prove - -",
  "-- proximate cause or no need to prove proximate cause.",
  "That's your basic argument.",
  "Okay.",
  "And I don't think you could have gotten where you want to go with the instruction that your side requested, which was an in whole or in part instruction. That's my only point.",
  "That's the direct language?",
  "Yeah.",
  "The point that I was trying to make about it being misleading is that if you use the in whole or in part language for a contributory negligence instruction, you are misleading the jury into thinking that at least there might be whole contributory negligence. There never will be. You don't get the contributory negligence unless you've already found the defendant was negligent, at least to some degree. Therefore, if the plaintiff is negligent, it can only be in part. That's all I was trying to say.",
  "Well, no, no. May I pick you up on that? Because there's a point at which you and I are disagreeing about Rogers. And in all candor, I think it's because you are ignoring one part of Rogers, and if I'm wrong, I want you to tell me. You quote the slightest bit language from Rogers on both page 26 and 33 of your brief. And you take that as being language that eliminates the proximate cause requirement. What you don't include in your quotation is the footnote in Justice Brennan's opinion following that slightest cause language. And the footnote was to a citation, the citation was to the Coray case. The opinion in Coray was written by Justice Douglas and -- I'm sorry, Justice Black. And in the very language that Justice Black used, he said expressly that if proximate cause is shown, there can be recovery. Now, given the fact that in Rogers, the very citation to the language which you say eliminated the proximate cause requirement cited a case in which proximate cause was part of the very sentence relied on, I don't see how you can read Rogers -- maybe later cases, but I don't see how you can read Rogers as eliminating the proximate cause requirement. And therefore, I think you have to read Rogers as addressing the issue of multiple causation, not proximate causation. Now, am I going wrong there somewhere?",
  "Absolutely right.",
  "He did, but he was also pointing out, just to make it simpler, he was pointing out in Crane that the liability arose in Crane out of -- I forget the full name of it -- the Appliance Act. And the Appliance Act had its own set of standards. And therefore, you cannot, from an Appliance Act case, you cannot infer anything one way or the other about the general standard in FELA. And to make it even more complicated, as I recall, Rogers was an Appliance case, too, but he didn't get into that there. But my only point is, you are right about the two Brennan opinions, Rogers and the -- Crane. But given the fact that it was an Appliance case, I don't think you can infer one thing or another about an ultimate FELA standard in the absence of an Appliance action. What remains is that the citation in Rogers was to Coray, and Coray spoke about there still being proximate cause.",
  "Well, it is understood by everybody, isn't it, that at least it has the conception which is captured by using the word \"direct\" as in instruction 13, and at least it has that core of meaning whenever it is used, doesn't it? In other words, it may not have a lot of bells and whistles associated with it in the prior law, but at least it requires some direct causation as opposed to indirect, right?",
  "Okay. And that's -- I don't know that Justice Brennan's citation to Coray, or Coray's use of the language carries you any further than that. But that's as far as Mr. Phillips wants to go.",
  "That may be. That may be. But it seems to me that that's a different argument from saying Rogers requires it, because I don't think you can get that out of Rogers.",
  "But it could be the slightest direct cause, which is Justice Scalia's point.",
  "Now, it may mislead the jury if that's all you say. But as a matter of analyzing the statute or even of analyzing what the Court meant in Rogers, you can have a slight but direct cause, and that would be proximate cause in the traditional analysis; isn't that so?",
  "But under the old rule that plaintiff's negligence in whatever degree was an absolute bar to recovery, wasn't the rule customarily stated that plaintiff's negligence, however slight, was a total bar to recovery?",
  "I thought it was. I may be wrong about that.",
  "That's what I thought. Yes, I thought it was a pretty harsh rule.",
  "Isn't the problem that the motion to quash is going to be made, if counsel is on his toes, is going to be made at the beginning of the trial? And we want to induce the court to look very carefully at it at that point, because if the court is wrong, somebody has to go through an entire trial as a result of it. And the way to induce the court to be very careful at the beginning is to say, this is not harmless error, and you've got to take this very seriously and you can't take any chance on the, in effect, the evidence saving you in harmless error analysis later.",
  "Well, I'm sure that's right. But that simply reinforces my point.",
  "The trouble with your a fortiori argument it seems to me is this: If we accept your argument, then whenever a judge is asked to rule on a motion to quash, if the judge is in any doubt, the judge is going to be induced by your rule to deny the motion to quash and wait and see what happens at trial. And if in fact they get to trial and they don't prove the element, then it can either be thrown out because an element has not been proven or he can go back and revive the motion to quash. If on the other hand the Government gets its act together at that point and does put in evidence on the element, it's going to be harmless error. And so the price of, it seems to me, of your rule is that someone will always be put to trial if there is any question about how the judge should rule on the motion to quash, whereas if we go the other way the judge will grant the motion to quash and the Government can go back to the grand jury and get another indictment. It seems to me that something is seriously lost in that situation if we go your way.",
  "I'm sure they do grant them. But I'm concerned about the, we'll say, the doubtful case or the judge who can't make up his mind. Under your rule the price of that uncertainty is always going to be to subject somebody to trial.",
  "And it seems to me that the prejudice to the defendant in the two -- as between the two situations simply is not comparable. In Mechanik you had a situation in which two witnesses putting in whatever evidence they were putting in were in the jury room and, yes, one could influence the other, et cetera. Here, we're talking about a situation in which it may very well be that the defendant should never be put to trial at all. And your rule says if there's any question about it, put him to trial, judge.",
  "But your point is not that there was any prejudice here. Your point is that he was entitled to a grand jury?",
  "But why isn't your answer to Justice Stevens that in the case in which there is no allegation of an element at all there isn't a sufficient indictment to charge him for anything, whereas in the case of the variance on your theory, as I understand it, there is an indictment and the question is simply whether he was misled by the variance and prejudiced?",
  "So why isn't the answer is in one case there's an indictment, and in the other case there isn't?",
  "No, but why isn't your answer to him that in the case in which there is a variance you have an indictment; in the case that you're talking about there is none? And the reason I press you on that is that I thought the essence of your case was that there is no indictment here, i.e., the grand jury function has not been performed and he is entitled to the grand jury function before he goes to trial.",
  "And if that is the nub of your position, then I would have thought your answer to Justice Stevens was what I suggested. If that's not your answer to Justice Stevens, then I'm not sure that I understand your case.",
  "What is the result of what went wrong? How do you characterize the grand jury product in the case in which, as you put it, something goes wrong?",
  "An insufficient -- in other words, there is no indictment charging a crime? Is that - -",
  "But Mr. Dreeben, isn't the point that the tremendous cost that you refer to is a tremendous cost that the Government pays by its choice to go to trial, as opposed to going back to the grand jury and making sure that it has an adequate indictment?",
  "Would it always, then, be surplusage in the indictment when a fact is charged and subsequently found by a jury, is it always a surplus fact? Because otherwise -- I mean, what I'm getting at is, otherwise, one assumes it would be a way of stating an element of the offense, and as I understand it, under California law, the element of the offense couldn't satisfy the additional fact necessary to jump up to the higher range.",
  "If in this case, the indictment had charged -- had claimed that the defendant was the father of the victim, would that have satisfied at least the fact-finding for the aggravator of being in a position of trust?",
  "That depends on the instructions.",
  "If the instructions said, you know, you've got to find all of the things that are set out in the information, and the jury returned a verdict, then we would have found -- and that would satisfy the requirement of an additional fact on an element.",
  "Only in the sense that it would require the state to prove more than it had to prove for the elements of the crime.",
  "So you draw -- as I understand it, your basic answer to Justice Breyer is, it may well be that the situation in the community may justify a judge in going to the -- to the high end of the range that is possible, but that is not a factor that determines what range is possible. And the fact that determines what range is possible is an aggravating fact, and in that respect, it is different from the Federal system. Is that - -",
  "Even though there is the possibility that something above the middle term would also be reasonable without necessarily finding a discrete fact beyond the indictment to justify it. Right?",
  "No, but if -- as I understand it, it has construed it by saying that if you go above the middle term without a discrete finding of fact beyond what has to be proven to the jury, it is unreasonable as a matter of law. And that unreasonableness as a matter of law feature is what distinguishes it from the Federal system post Booker.",
  "But that does not necessarily mean that he must make a discrete finding of fact in order to do it. We come back to Justice Scalia's hypo a moment ago. He can go, you know, in theory, under Booker, he can go above the guideline range consistent with policy positions that may not be precise, without necessarily making discrete findings of fact. I mean, you'd have to judge it in each individual case, but the possibility is there. And under the California system, the possibility is not there.",
  "Are you saying to us that under the California system, if a California judge went through exactly the thought process that Justice Scalia just outlined and put that down on paper, without finding any discrete fact beyond the elements the jury found, that he could go to the third tier? I really think deterrence requires the third tier, not the middle tier? Can a California judge do that?",
  "All right. But even for selecting a term within the base range, I'm going to read now from Rule 4.20. Part (b) says, \"circumstances in aggravation and mitigation shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence.\" That's not the way we refer to judges' reasoning about policy. That's the way we refer to proof of fact. And I don't see how under subsection (b) your answer to me can be correct.",
  "Well, it can be a reasonableness constraint and also be a reasonableness restraint that requires a finding of discrete facts for reasonableness. The two are not exclusive.",
  "And the rule seems to conflate -- seems very clearly to conflate the finding of a discrete fact. And it seems to me that we've got to consider the rule in responding to the ambiguity that Justice Breyer referred to a moment ago. The ambiguity has got to be read in light of subsection (b), and subsection (b) seems to answer the ambiguity by saying preponderance of the evidence. That means a fact finding.",
  "So do you think under subsection (b) of Rule 4.420, if a judge said, I just think the policy of deterrence requires something heavier, you think that statement by the judge would satisfy the requirement that circumstances in aggravation shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence?",
  "All right. Then it seems to me that you cannot hold your position consistently with the state rule of court.",
  "Is Black repealing the rule of court? I mean, Black -- if we refer back to Black, we get the ambiguity that Justice Breyer has raised. In order to solve the ambiguity, we look to the court rule.",
  "Under the court rule, you admit that a judge's policy consideration, however sincerely held, could not satisfy the requirement to prove aggravation by a preponderance. Isn't that the end of the issue? I mean, if California wants to amend its rules or its statute, that's California's business. But we can't do it.",
  "Then why didn't you give a different answer to my question? Why didn't you say, if it is reasonable for the court to conclude that deterrence really requires something tougher than the middle term, that's enough? Why didn't you say that is enough and (b) wouldn't preclude it?",
  "Okay. Let's -- the judge, the judge is on the bench. He says, there's too much crime in our community, look at these statistics, I believe that deterrence requires something heavier than the middle tier. Nothing unusual about this particular crime. I'm making a policy decision about what the law should require in general. Would that satisfy part (b) of 4.420?",
  "That would satisfy the requirement of, as it puts it, establishing by a preponderance of the evidence?",
  "That was not what I understood California law to be or your position to be until this moment.",
  "Reasonably -- that does not answer the problem.",
  "Well, it went a little bit beyond that. I mean, the -- Justice Marshall announced not merely the possibility of inherent prejudice, but he spoke in terms of practices that raised a risk that improper factors would come into play in the jury decision. Isn't that the criterion?",
  "That's the criterion.",
  "That's the way he formulated it. That's the way the Court in Flynn formulated it.",
  "That was the end point that they were reaching, and then he elaborated on that by referring to the unacceptable risk that improper considerations would come into play. And it seems to me that if you're going to talk about the criterion of the test or the standard, however you want to describe it in Flynn, you've got to get that latter point about unacceptable risk of improper factors.",
  "What if the button had said -- the three buttons had said \"Hang Musladin,\" would you say that there was not -- there was not sufficiently clear law from this Court to find that practice unconstitutional under Justice Marshall's formulation.",
  "We both want to know why you say that.",
  "Okay, but what are the -- getting into the formulation, what are the impermissible factors as to which a risk is raised by wearing the \"Hang Musladin\" button? What are those factors?",
  "Well, what's wrong with that? The prosecutor is going to get up and urge the jury to convict him. What is wrong with it on the button? What risk does the button raise that the prosecutor's argument does not? That's what we're getting at.",
  "What about simply the facts that we have in this case, which I thought I was doing, maybe I wasn't clear about it, but the button is different. Instead of putting a picture of the victim, it's got the statement, \"Hang Musladin.\" It's worn every day by three members of his family who sit behind the prosecution table within the sight of the jury. Assume those facts. Would habeas relief be required under the general rule?",
  "Is that a way of saying that it's required? Should -- look, should a court grant habeas relief on my facts?",
  "Why?",
  "I don't know whether they are grieving or not, but I certainly know the sentiment that they are trying to convey to the jury if they wear a button that says \"Hang Musladin.\"",
  "Pardon?",
  "They may not want him hung. They may not believe in the death penalty.",
  "Okay, assuming that explicit message, could habeas relief be granted in my hypothetical case?",
  "Why?",
  "Is it reasonable for a state court to say that three family members sitting in a courtroom within sight of the jury for whatever number of days the trial ran, saying at the guilt stage, hang so and so, is exposing the jury to a proper influence, that it should, and may consider in deciding guilt or innocence?",
  "Okay. Why don't you concede that of course that would be exposing the jury to an improper influence, in the \"Hang Musladin\" case.",
  "My hypo is at the guilt stage, not the sentencing stage.",
  "But at the guilt stage, is there any, is there any question in your mind that allowing the family members to display this message to a jury throughout the trial at the guilt stage is raising a risk, an unacceptable risk, that the jury will consider improper influences in reaching its verdict? Is there any question?",
  "That's my hypothetical. My buttons, \"Hang Musladin,\" is there any question about the risk of improper influence on my hypothetical? Not this case, my hypothetical.",
  "Even if it didn't, though, I suppose you could draw a line between people who were doing what they naturally do, and some people do wear mourning, and some people will come into a courtroom and be reminded of the person who died and sob. But in this case, they're going out of their way to do something that people in mourning do not normally do.",
  "And so you've got -- I think you've got a stronger argument. The problem that I have in this case is that, number one, I view the wearing of the buttons, as I just described it, as something that is abnormal and something that is intended to presumably get the jury's attention. I don't know why otherwise they would be doing it. And from whatever source, we do know that the button was at least two inches wide and maybe larger. So it's reasonable to suppose that the jury saw it and understood perfectly that these were people who were raising, in effect, an issue of sympathy. I can understand that, and under the general rule out of Williams and Flynn, it seems to me there's a pretty darn good argument for saying, yes, an unacceptable risk has been raised of emotionalism in the jury's deliberations as opposed to dispassionate consideration of courtroom evidence. What, however, do I make of the fact that not one single court has ever reached that conclusion and -- you know, as a constitutional matter? Am I in the position of sort of being Jim, and they're all out of step with Jim? I'm raising a question about my own judgment in relation to the fact that no other court seems to have come to that conclusion. What do you think I should make of that?",
  "Do you have to depend on there being a message? Isn't it enough if there is an influence that is conveyed? I mean, what I thought the problem was, was that there was as a result of the obtrusive wearing of the button, that it created a risk simply of an emotional approach to the determination of guilt or innocence. The jurors are more likely to feel sorry for the family members sitting there a few feet away from them. Perhaps they may be more likely to feel sorry for the victim, but certainly for the family members. And it would be that improper influence of emotionalism as opposed to a particular message that is the problem here, isn't it?",
  "Do you accept that?",
  "Okay.",
  "Why isn't it the denial of an element of the claim? There's no recovery for assault if the mental element is what the Chief Justice just described in his hypo, and if in fact that is an element of the claim how do you draw a distinction between that and the existence or nonexistence of any act at all.",
  "Well, I'm not asking about certain cases. I just want to know analytically how you do it or how you think we're supposed to do it.",
  "Well, in this case the immunity defense is, number one, as you said, the Government forthrightly said at the beginning right in terms of the statute that he was acting within the scope of his employment. Secondarily, as you said, the Government in effect elaborated on that and said the reason he was not acting outside the scope of his employment is that these acts which would have been outside scope didn't happen. Why is that any different from the claim in the Chief Justice's hypo that there was no intent to harm?",
  "It's a claim upon which the immunity depends. The immunity is claimed -- the immunity claimed here is that at the time in question he was not acting outside the scope of his employment. The reason he was not acting outside the scope was that he didn't do what they say he did.",
  "Couldn't it be conclusive for purposes of removal jurisdiction, but still leave the district court with discretion to remand on the grounds that, although it had removal jurisdiction, in fact the premise of that removal jurisdiction was wrong, and it would therefore remand, in effect, because the only claim it had before it was the equivalent of a pendent claim.",
  "In that case it would be reviewable.",
  "So you're saying there are two claims, one claim is raised by the defense, and if you look at that claim which is by definition Federal, then it's fair to look at the original State claim by analogy as a pendent claim?",
  "Is that fair?",
  "Isn't the problem, and maybe I'm missing, and I may be missing something here, but isn't the problem with your argument is that the statute didn't come out and say you can't remand. The statute said, for purposes of removal, the certification is conclusive, and that allows for the kind of dichotomy that you and I were talking with before. A court can say look, I know that I have article III jurisdiction here, but in point of fact I am, I am remanding because what you and I are calling here the pendent claim does not support any of the Government's theory. If that's the case, then under 1447(d), there could be a review of it because it was not a jurisdictional ruling. But if on the contrary, the judge said, as I think the judge said here, I am remanding because based on this analysis, I do not have jurisdiction, i.e., the judge went against the statute saying that jurisdiction is conclusive. That is an erroneous jurisdictional ruling, and as Justice Scalia said, we have said over and over again, however erroneous it may be, it is not reviewable.",
  "If we amended the rules that way, in effect it would no longer be an affirmative defense. I mean, by definition an affirmative defense gets raised by the defendant and so on, so if we amended the Federal Rules in practical terms it would be like adding an element to the claim.",
  "Would your answer be different if amendment were allowed? I mean isn't the problem in substance here, and I don't mean to dismiss your arguments from the rules, but leaving the argument from the text of the rules aside, it wouldn't be a real problem here in substance if the circuit bar allowed amendment, would it?",
  "Why is it that the Sixth Circuit rule requires the identification, for complete exhaustion requires the identification to be made at the first stage?",
  "So to make sure I understand this, in a case, let's say at stage one he names Dr. X. And for whatever reason in the course of the response perhaps, he learned that not only was Dr. X involved but Dr. Y was involved in that decision. So if he is denied relief at stage two, he says X and Y, and he identifies X and why all the way through. He gets nothing satisfactory to him, so he goes in to Federal court. Is it correct that under the Sixth Circuit rule they would say you have not completely exhausted because at stage one you did not mention Y? Is that correct?",
  "What justification is there for that? I mean, for two stages through the prison administrative process, Y has been identified. The prison has taken action on the merits on the assumption that Y is in fact at least an allegedly responsible party. What reason is there in a Federal court to say that the exhaustion is incomplete because he didn't mention Y back at stage one?",
  "Yeah, but that wasn't my hypo. As I understand it, in that case he keeps going after Bobo, period. And in my case at stage two, having learned something, he identifies Y. And I -- so I don't see the justification, what is the justification?",
  "In my case, you said you understood that the Sixth Circuit would say that although he identified X and Y in stage two and at stage three, and there had been merit for adjudication at those stages, understanding who the named respondents were, the Sixth Circuit would nonetheless say you had failed to exhaust because back at stage A you mentioned X but not Y. What is the justification, if that is still your answer, what could the justification for that be?",
  "But that apparently, if I understand your answer, is what the result would be. And is there -- and I don't want to, you know, make it hard for you. I think you're having a hard time finding a justification for that result and I certainly can't find one. Can you think of any?",
  "Well, how about Y in my example?",
  "Does he have a good claim against Y?",
  "In the Federal court in my hypo - -",
  "Okay.",
  "Even though the Sixth Circuit would throw it out for failure to exhaust.",
  "I take it from your answer to Justice Ginsburg that back in my Dr. X, Dr. Y case, under the new policy if they got to stage 2 and Y was identified, that Michigan would process the complaint?",
  "The grievance.",
  "Isn't that the problem? If the instruction had said that, you would have a very different instruction, and I'm bothered by the instruction too for just that reason. It says you may consider, and if I were a juror parsing the instruction, I would say, \"why? You've just told me I'm not supposed to punish them.\"",
  "Okay. This is an argument you're making to us, but I don't know how a juror is supposed to figure this out.",
  "Let me -- let me -- let me focus the problem that I have right now this way. If I look at the Oregon Supreme Court opinion, and particularly at the point that you mention in 20 and 21, I have to say I, I read the opinion the way you read the opinion. I read them the same, just what you claimed they were saying. The difficulty that I have is because I think the instruction that was proposed on behalf of your client was not a clear instruction, I have great difficulty in seeing how I could find that it was error to refuse to give the instruction.",
  "So my problem is, if I think they really did have the wrong view of the law but the issue was focused at the trial court by a request for an instruction which I think was properly denied, what do I do? Do I concentrate on what they said in the opinion or do I concentrate on what I think was the deficiency of the instruction?",
  "But then they would respond, when they made that, when they gave that explanation in the Oregon Supreme Court, they were responding to a claim of error which was focused and raised at the trial level by the request for an instruction, which strikes me as probably an unsound instruction, an unsound request.",
  "In effect, it would give you another chance in Oregon.",
  "It was a good thing we weren't instructing a jury.",
  "Oh, I do too. I don't have any trouble with the distinction.",
  "But it doesn't answer the question, if the juror were to speak up. It doesn't answer the question. Consider for what? How? Why am I supposed to be considering it when you've just told me not to punish?",
  "Or not punish for other - -",
  "What do you say, I mean Justice Alito asked you a question about the footnote. And I, in all candor I think you told us more about the, your case than about the footnote, but let me ask you basically the same question about what the Oregon Supreme Court meant in the passage that runs from the bottom of 20(a) up to 21. It says \"Philip Morris's proposed jury instructions would have prohibited the jury from punishing the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons even if those other persons were Oregonians who were harmed by the same conduct that had harmed Williams, and in the same way. As we noted that is not correct as an independent matter of Oregon law,\" and so on. That is not a totally unambiguous statement. I will concede that, but isn't the most obvious reasoning, reading of that a reading that says you can punish for harm to others, so long as those others are Oregonians and not people in other States?",
  "Why was it critical?",
  "Yeah. Justice Scalia said, you know, they left out this one little bit. Why was that critical? What's the answer.",
  "You're saying, I think you're saying the jury couldn't have figured that out without somebody telling them?",
  "Isn't that what you're saying?",
  "In the same sense that it is pending after the trial court has acted but before the defendant or the petitioner decides whether he wants a state appeal.",
  "I don't know where it's pending. Whether it's still pending in the state trial court or in the state appeals court. But nobody denies that it's pending. And I understood your argument to be, whatever mending means there, pending means here because there is no modifier that would limit the same -- the same construction.",
  "If you succeed you're going to get an order from this Court to the state court say, saying, go back in this state proceeding that has been begun, and do it right. So the focus of it is still the state proceeding even though we may correct it under appellate jurisdiction.",
  "But it doesn't say state pending or pending in state court, and what I want to do is go back and ask a question somewhat along the lines that Justice Stevens asked. Is the application pending in the period between the disposition of the petition by the state trial court and the determination by the petitioner whether or not to go forward for state appellate relief?",
  "By the same token, why isn't it pending between the final disposition by the state appellate court and the determination to seek cert here?",
  "But why isn't your sister's answer to that adequate? It is the state judgment that is final, but action on the petition is not yet final until it has gone through the period allowed for final review by this Court.",
  "So you're distinguishing between a state judgment and an application upon which further, further proceedings can be had. Why is that a nondistinction?",
  "Let's assume that the, the petition for cert is granted and this Court grants relief. The relief as I understand it is going to consist of a remand to the state court saying you did something wrong on this application before, go back and do it over again and do it right. It's the -- it is the state application which is going to be the subject of it and that therefore, it is the state application that necessarily is the subject of the cert petition.",
  "It's a petition for certiorari to review action taken on a state petition, just as at the state level, whatever may be the, the nomenclature for filing an appeal from the state trial court to the state appellate court, is an application which relates entirely to the original application for relief that was filed in the state trial court. It seems to me the two situations are exactly parallel.",
  "That gets, if you follow Justice Scalia's argument, that gets you to, I think to the argument you have made. And that is all right, we have got to look at it pragmatically. I mean, what are the consequences of following a reliability model rather than a cross-examination model? And your argument is consequences that are not necessarily more favorable to defendants, in fact -- or more productive of ultimately reliable determinations, in fact. And that I take it is your basic point. So I think you've answered what for all of us is a problem. And that is we don't have a clear analytical definition of bedrock; but if we look to consequences, you have got an argument. Your friends don't think it is a good one, but that's your point.",
  "-- accuracy-enhancing then?",
  "It's a question about how much more accuracy-enhancing, if at all?",
  "Would you comment, Ms. Forsman, on your opponent's argument based on 2254(d)?",
  "Well, is that -- I mean, your friend on the other side says that the cause of action would have accrued at the moment at which he was bound over by the decision of an independent magistrate. At that point the false arrest and the incarceration incident to the false arrest is over and if there is ever going to be a claim for what happens next, I gather it'ss going to be a common law action for false imprisonment, and that, I guess, would not accrue until the imprisonment is over. But so far as the arrest is concerned, whatever whatever wrong is done, that wrong is completed at the point at which an independent magistrate takes over.",
  "But all of that occurred, as I -- correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, but I thought all of that occurred prior to -- I don't know what they call it in Illinois, but prior to a bind-over hearing or prior to the point at which the judiciary steps in, breaking the, as it were, the chain of causation between what the police do and the subsequent incarceration.",
  "No, but just as a factual matter is it correct -- is it correct as a factual matter that the confession that was given was a confession that was given before there was any judicial intervention, before he was brought before a magistrate?",
  "Okay.",
  "Why would it be a mess? I mean, it seems to me that the district court, once it is filed -- something is filed within the two year statute, the district court can tell virtually immediately whether there are criminal proceedings that are yet to be held, and the district court can simply, it can simply stay further proceedings until those criminal proceedings are over. If there's a possibility of collateral attacks, the district court can simply say hey, are you going to file a collateral attack? And if the answer is yes, stay it further. If the answer is no, go ahead with it then. What's tough about that?",
  "That's the premise of my question. But I mean it seems to me to be fairly easily administered.",
  "20,000 might make me shudder. But we got one.",
  "Well -- explain that.",
  "And don't you think that a civil action which necessarily has to be stayed, might be a basis for, for the court in the criminal case to limit that kind of cross-examination?",
  "Are there appeals from the Circuit Court of Cook County?",
  "Okay, don't you -- don't you think ultimately you could get that issue resolved?",
  "Come -- come back here.",
  "Even on the basis of innocence?",
  "The common law would give damages in a case like this in which the release was basically governed by a suppression which has nothing to do one way or the other with the innocence of that person?",
  "But if the Fifth Amendment claim were before us, do I understand you to have said before that the Fourth Amendment claim of false arrest would also be subject to litigation as part of the Fifth Amendment claim or under the umbrella of the Fifth Amendment claim, so that the statute would not have run on that?",
  "But if he had also brought a Fifth Amendment claim, your view as I take it would be as follows: Number one, his Fourth Amendment claim, the running of the statute, the Fourth Amendment claim would be unaffected by that, so that would have to have been brought within the two-year period.",
  "Number two, I'm assuming, and this is what I want you to tell me whether my assumption is right -- I am assuming that if a Fifth Amendment claim were brought by -- no, strike the assumption. You, I take it, would -- let me ask a different question. I take it you would agree that so long as a criminal case was pending, that it would be sensible and maybe required for the court simply to abstain from any proceedings on the Fourth Amendment claim.",
  "But you would agree that the court, if there's a criminal case going on, I take it you would agree that the court should not proceed to trial in the 1983 action.",
  "Yes, but your claim doesn't rest on a due process denial of hearing does it? That's not, that's not the question you brought to us. So it seems to me that Justice Ginsburg's question is not answered by saying, well, he'd get a hearing in that case. The fact remains that in that case the, as I understand it, the judge in Chapter 13 could immediately deconvert to Chapter 7, couldn't he?",
  "But due process is not the issue here. The fact is the bankruptcy court could deconvert or reconvert to Chapter 7, in effect, following the election that the debtor makes. That's so, isn't it?",
  "Well then, why would we have a system as ridiculous as to preclude the court from looking at fraud or bad faith at the moment of election, go through the paperwork and the folderol of converting to 13, and immediately turn around, admittedly having the power, to deconvert? That would be a rather foolish system.",
  "But they don't have to.",
  "And the deconversion could be done prior to the filing of the plan?",
  "But your case as I understand it, your case does not turn on the question whether there was or was not, should or should not have been a hearing in this case, an evidentiary hearing in this case; is that correct?",
  "Mr. Fisher, you know, assuming we read it the way you read it, I've got a basic problem that doesn't really surface until you get to the end of the briefs and I wonder if you would comment on it at the beginning of the argument. That is -- or I'll put it in the form of a question. Is the decision which the judge makes here to sentence consecutively rather than concurrently, a decision that requires the finding of any fact about the commission of the crimes themselves or the circumstances of those crimes or about the defendant's character? Does the judge have to make or does the fact -- some fact finder have to make a finding on any of those subjects -- crimes, circumstances, character of the defendant?",
  "What is that fact?",
  "I thought the only fact that had to be found was that, given the classification sentencing scheme Washington had, there would be, in effect, a free crime, no incremental punishment, unless there were consecutive sentencing. That's not a fact that falls within any of those categories of crime, character, or circumstances.",
  "So it's a misnomer to say it's a mere free crime criterion? It's free crime plus some further fact?",
  "So the extra fact then is a lot like the sort of heinous, atrocious and cruel aggravator? I mean, it's comparable to it?",
  "But could the nature of the additional crimes themselves satisfy it? In other words, could the judge say, well, all three -- it might be one thing if one were serious and the other two were trivial, but all of these three are very serious. Now, that's in effect a value judgment, not a finding of discrete fact. Could that value judgment satisfy the extraordinary criterion that Washington says there must be in addition to free crime.",
  "But if the first proceeding was not in fact jurisdictionally barred, then you would lose under the second and successive objection in this case, right?",
  "Why not?",
  "Aren't those cases in which the first judgment is complete, he simply does not attack everything that was a predicate for the first judgment; and then if there is, in fact, a new trial, and a new judgment, of course, the habeas possibility arises again, whereas in this case, the first judgment was not complete.",
  "So that is the only judgment that could be attacked on habeas?",
  "Well, Mr. Collins, isn't it your position that, number one, the only judgment that he can attack on habeas is the judgment that is extant at the time of the habeas proceeding, and that is the '92 judgment that follows the resentencing? But he may in attacking that judgment attack the premise of conviction which occurred earlier?",
  "And if he chooses to attack only the earlier conviction which is the premise of the later judgment, he has simply in effect waived any other issue. And when he comes in later and tries to raise the issue that he could have attacked under the '92 judgment, he's in effect trying to split up his habeas, it's second and successive, and that's why he can't do it.",
  "So that if the statute governing our review had an exhaustion requirement and a second and successive requirement comparable to the AEDPA requirement, the case that Justice Scalia put would be exactly like this case?",
  "Okay.",
  "That's -- I keep doing this. I'm sorry. Is that sufficient, as you understand it, under the Washington case that your brother cited to me?",
  "Okay.",
  "That is to say that that would have been sufficient.",
  "But in fact that is not what the trial court premised its decision on, because, as Justice Stevens points out, it went on in findings 19, 20, and 21 about deliberate cruelty, sophistication and planning, and so on. Having been through those findings, the court says, from the foregoing facts the court now makes the following conclusions of law. It seems to me as though the trial court was basing its decision on those foregoing facts as well as upon finding 18, which was the free crime finding.",
  "I guess what I'm saying is the fact that he might have -- I'm assuming for the sake of argument that the trial court might on the basis simply of the free crime conclusion have sentenced consecutively, is simply not the case that we've got, because he sentenced consecutively on that basis and on cruelty, sophistication, and so on.",
  "Was it logical for them to conclude it or were they -- were they expressing the hope that the Court would draw a distinction which it had not drawn in the formulation that it gave in Apprendi? It's one thing to say that if you draw no further distinctions, Apprendi requires a certain result. It's another thing to say but maybe they will draw a distinction and we're going to predict that they will, and hence not apply Apprendi. Weren't the other appellate courts to which you refer engaged in the latter exercise, which I call the exercise of hope?",
  "Okay, but doesn't that require drawing a distinction that Apprendi did not speak to? And isn't it still the case that, I think Mr. Fisher points out that three times we repeated in Apprendi the formula about fact, beyond fact found by a jury on the basis of which, et cetera, the range increases. Isn't the distinction which -- and I trust your recollection here -- that Justice O'Connor had in mind and that they had in mind a distinction which simply was not addressed in Apprendi and would have been something new as opposed to merely an application of what was implicit in Apprendi?",
  "Yes.",
  "Is that true in fact?",
  "I'm mean, I'm sure you're reading correctly, but is that in fact true? Because, having talked, as I just read out a moment ago, having spoken about free crimes, aggravating factors, it says, on the basis of the foregoing facts I now draw the following conclusions of law.",
  "So we can treat it in effect -- and this may be the way to do it -- we can treat it as the ultimate sentencer was the Washington appellate court and that's what they said?",
  "Well, you could do it in a noncurtilage burglary State simply by putting the ladder up to the window and getting on the first rung of the ladder. I mean, you would have -- you would have taken a substantial step. You would have made an attempt. Now why would that not qualify under the words of the statute that referred to a potential risk? Haven't you created the potential for the risk of harm that the statute is getting at when you take the substantial step?",
  "Well, how about my question first?",
  "I mean, haven't you in the words of the statute, created the potential for the risk when you take that substantial step by starting up the ladder?",
  "No, but I thought your argument was that that analysis would not lead to the result unfavorable to your client because the nature of starting up the ladder did not create or could not reasonably be seen as creating this kind of risk. In other words, I thought you were saying - - maybe I misunderstood your argument -- that the reason the Taylor analysis favors you is that merely taking a substantial step -- which is what the indictment would charge -- could not be seen as creating the potential risk that the statute talks about. Now if I'm not understanding your argument correctly, you know, straighten me out here.",
  "And that's why simply charging attempted burglary will never satisfy the statute under a Taylor analysis as you understand it.",
  "But isn't one way of looking at it -- I mean, I, when I read it, you know, I thought it's just redundant. But it may very well be that the word potential is in there in order to accommodate attempts.",
  "Mr. Crawford, may I ask you a question about the relationship between generic burglary and what Florida takes as sufficient to show an attempt? And what I'm getting at is the issue that at least was alluded to in the Jones case. Do you understand Florida law on attempted burglary to be as follows: that there must be an overt act taken toward entering either a dwelling or a structure, as distinct from an overt act taken to get within the curtilage?",
  "So there's no such thing as attempted entry of the curtilage as an attempt offense under burglary under Florida law.",
  "Okay, so when you say dwelling you mean dwelling as defined to include curtilage.",
  "Okay.",
  "Mr. Marcus, do you agree with your brother's answer to my last question that there would be an attempt -- could be an attempt under Florida law simply to take an overt -- to commit an overt act toward entering the curtilage as distinct from entering a physical dwelling or a physical structure?",
  "We don't know basically what Florida law is? I mean, is that the best answer?",
  "So that literally, I take it then if someone did have a fence around the house, and I, I -- I walked from the sidewalk onto the lawn toward the fence, with the intent of getting over the fence, that would qualify then, as you understand it, as an attempted burglary under Florida law?",
  "Would that be true if I simply wanted to get into the -- if my intent was to get on the other side of the fence but not into the dwelling? For example, you know, I wanted to steal the apples on the tree?",
  "Would that qualify as attempted burglary?",
  "Doesn't that give you a pretty tough row to hoe, in saying that there is a sufficient potential risk of the sort of harm that qualifies under the act?",
  "Didn't we -- didn't we also go further and say one reason to construe it that way is we don't want courts to have to be, in effect, having sort of subsidiary collateral trials after the fact, to establish -- you know -- the facts of old trials. There was an administrability analysis involved. I think there was. Yeah, I wrote Shepard. And I think that's what - -",
  "Maybe, the same point, isn't it reasonable to assume that the risk of harm in these attempt cases is characteristically going to be pretty close to zero? I mean, they're not in the house. They're just on the ladder, in the kind of examples we've been talking about.",
  "One way to do that is to say the potential risk is the potential for the risk of the harm that comes from the commission of the crime itself. I mean, there is -- I don't want to overdo it, but the risk of harm to others from the -- from the step on the ladder is zero, if you consider simply the act itself of putting the ladder up against the building and taking the step. It's only because that creates the potential for getting inside where the risk, in fact, is measurable. I mean, we know there are cases in which victims get shot when they appear in the course of burglaries, but the risk associated with the mere attempt in isolation is going to be minuscule.",
  "Oh, I agree with you. But the act that involved -- the act that constitutes the - - that qualifies for the attempt doesn't involve it. I'm trying to help you here. I mean - -",
  "Well, what do you say about your brother's argument that the statistics show there's a 3 percent chance, I think it was a 3 percent chance of violence in the course of committing the burglary? I take it there isn't any statistic available, if we want to take Justice Breyer's approach, about the potential -- the actual proven potential for violence at the near attempt stage.",
  "No, I don't think you do either, but I mean, I think your whole argument has got to rest really on the potential for harm in the commission of the offense.",
  "Mr. Marcus, assuming we accept your view about the way the statute should be read, I take it you agree that because of the curtilage possibility under Florida law, that Florida law, that burglary in Florida is not a generic burglary?",
  "I guess my -- so that leads me to this question, because -- I mean, I, my understanding is it's not a generic burglary. Therefore, even on your reading of the statute, an attempted burglary in Florida doesn't necessarily satisfy the prong, and it's got to come in under the residuary clause, of course. And because there is a possibility that the only burglary charged was a burglary of the curtilage, we've got to -- don't we have to send the thing back to find out either from court records whether something more than a mere penetration of curtilage was involved here? And if so, whether -- whether that penetration carried with it the potential for harm?",
  "No, but the only thing we know under the otherwise clause, is that this was an attempt at burglary. If the burglary were a generic burglary, your analysis, if we accept it, would be the end of the case.",
  "But this is not a generic burglary. Therefore, we have to assume that the attempt in this case could have been nothing more than stepping across the grass, moving toward the fence, to lean over to take the apple. And therefore, don't we have to go to court records? In other words, don't we have to take advantage of the qualification in Shepard and Taylor before this case can finally be decided?",
  "And we don't have any transcript of colloquies with the court or anything like that?",
  "Is the following sort of summary fair: Because Florida is not a generic burglary State, the mere conviction of burglary would not satisfy the burglary prong in subsection 2? But on your argument, even though Florida is not a generic burglary State, an attempted burglary will always satisfy the \"otherwise\" prong; is that correct?",
  "Is that a fair statement of your argument?",
  "Miss Gartner, with regard to your argument that the statute here did not track what you have described as the characteristics, the hallmarks, I think the answer from the other side is that the, the theory of this statute is a theory of a clear line between a legitimate abortion and infanticide. And if that is the theory, then whether it's a breach delivery or a non-breach delivery is irrelevant. What would your answer be to that?",
  "Well, we said that that would be an appropriate line. But the question here is is it really essential to an appropriate line that we talk, that we describe it as a, as a breach delivery or a non-breach delivery.",
  "No, but the dilation protocol certainly would be relevant on the question of intent which this statute does refer to, wouldn't it?",
  "Because?",
  "But you're telling us that some do this and some do that and the question is why wouldn't following one protocol rather than another protocol very significant evidence of what was intended?",
  "Do we have any indication in your case about the effective safety of any other aspect of this procedure if these doctors would change their, their method of operation and go to a one-day protocol?",
  "Yes.",
  "I don't want to cut your answer but I want to know whether there is anything specifically in the record in your case that bears on my question.",
  "Do you mean start and stop with a different intent?",
  "As opposed to adopting a completely different procedure entirely -- a different protocol entirely.",
  "Well, but we have -- we have said that that judgment has to reflect some kind of substantial medical judgment. It can't be an idiosyncratic determination by one doctor alone.",
  "So to that extent - -",
  "But isn't it quite independent of the anatomical approach that the health exception is denied? I mean that's an -- that does not depend on the anatomical approach. The anatomical approach may well be an answer at the facial challenge stage, to problems of vagueness, for example. But the health excepton problem is not affected by that. And the difficulty that I have with your argument that somehow the health exception issue should be left to an as applied challenge is the statement in Stenberg, and it's on 938. I'm quoting: \"But where substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular abortion procedure could endanger women's health, Casey requires the statute to include a health exception where the procedure is necessary in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation --\" -- excuse me -- \"of the life or health of the mother.\" Now, your position, it seems to me, requires us to do one of three things. Either we, we overrule Stenberg in that respect, or we, we find -- I don't know how but we might find, well, in this case, there is no substantial medical authority, and therefore on the face of the statute there seems to be no impediment in the Stenberg statement. Or three, we say well, there seems to be a tension between the showing of substantial medical authority which occurred in the litigation in these cases and the findings made by Congress, and under those circumstances in effect we are required to ignore the record in the cases and go with Congress's apparently contrary judgment. Which of the three do we take?",
  "Take all three.",
  "No, but seriously - -",
  "Okay, but the problem, I guess -- focus the problem this way. The, the Stenberg opinion talks about substantial medical authority as triggering this requirement for a statutory element. That problem is not focused simply by saying Congress made some findings and the district court made other findings and Congress should prevail. The fact is the substantial medical judgment finding I would suppose is satisfied by the, by the record in the district courts in these cases. This is not one doctor's idiosyncratic judgment and a court can reasonably find, it seems to me, that there is substantial medical judgment. If we are going to defer, as you say we should defer to Congress, haven't we got to overrule that statement?",
  "May I ask you to focus on one particular problem that I think is implicated by Justice Ginsburg's question. If I understood you correctly a moment ago, and I think this is in your briefs too, you said that the definitional problem is that doctors always set out to do an intact procedure if they can, because it involves less risk to the mother from, from acts performed inside. And if that's the case, then it would be, I guess in the real world, very difficult for Congress to define a difference between D&E and D&X, because the intention is always, as you understand it, to have an intact result. Your brother on the other side, the Solicitor General says there certainly is testimony to the effect that that is not so. That doctors who intend to perform a D&E simply intend at the beginning to have a lesser degree of dilation which will force them to do the D&E and not have a totally intact procedure. Would you comment on what I think is the factual difference between you and the Solicitor General there?",
  "I understand that.",
  "But could you start simply with the factual predicate for your argument and his argument. You seem to be starting from, if I understand the two of you correctly, you seem to be starting from basically different factual assumptions. Could you, could you start by commenting on that?",
  "Well, they may not be able to control it in an absolute sense, but can't they go about it in a way that would tend to produce less rather than more dilation?",
  "It can't guarantee results, but couldn't they at least start with a, I don't know how you put it, a procedure that would be likely to produce less rather than more, and hence come within the safe harbor, if you will, of the statute?",
  "Well, you say they don't, but my question is, can they? And the record may not show this. I'm not asking you to answer the impossible, but do we have evidence that would indicate that they can or that they can't?",
  "Can you tell us where to look in the record for the evidence on that?",
  "How do they know that? 10 years ago the employee got a particular, got a particular job evaluation and that dictated the amount of pay that that employee was going to get for that period and all, all subsequent pay built on that base, and then it turns out many years later that there was discrimination in the way the employee was evaluated way back when, even though there was no complaint about it; then under your theory that would be a present Title VII violation, to cut a paycheck that built, that was based on pay that was built on this act of discrimination that occurred long ago?",
  "Oh, yeah, but that assumed a present discrimination, and it seems to me the problem that we've got is the problem of connecting a past discrimination with what may in fact be an apparently neutral act 15 or 20 years later.",
  "Well, what is your burden to prove? You've talked about their burden to go back when -- do I understand it that your view is that the only thing you have to prove is that in this case a woman was being paid at a rate which is different from the rate of a man doing a comparable job?",
  "What do you say of the explanation that was given in Bazemore? I forget the subsequent case. It was in footnote 6. You know what I mean. Which referred to Bazemore as a case that involved a present discrimination which, which is inconsistent with your theory. What do you say about footnote 6?",
  "Well, the policy -- I thought the assumption was that the policy was in fact a policy which, which was sort of currently honored and intended to be honored by the company, whereas the case that we're concerned about is the case in which there was a discriminatory act, you know, 5, 10, 15 years ago. Nobody remembers the discrimination now. It's just that it continues to have these ripple effect consequences. I would have thought that the subsequent explanation in Bazemore would have been inconsistent with your position with respect to the current ripple effect.",
  "Well, do you take -- I'm sorry, I can't think of the name of the case. You know the case that I'm talking about with the footnote?",
  "I guess. Do you think that the Court in the footnote misstated Bazemore and that therefore we should trust to Bazemore and not the subsequent explanation?",
  "But that assumes that the company in effect says, we have a pay structure and our pay structure as it is now treats people differently depending on sex, race, or whatever. And that's not the kind -- that's something very different from the ripple effect argument.",
  "Is that so even if they know it was in fact originally an unlawful act?",
  "You draw a line between present purposeful discrimination and present knowledge of past discrimination which is knowingly carried forward.",
  "If the EEOC is upheld in the Court of Appeals and review is sought here, will the Government confess error?",
  "If the EEOC decision is upheld by one of the Courts of Appeals and there is an attempt to bring the case here on cert, will the Government confess error?",
  "Well, I'm asking a simpler question. Let's assume that somehow we fudge it. If -- if there is a clear cut case in which the EEOC takes a position different from the one the Government is now espousing, and a Court of Appeals upholds it, and cert is sought here, will the Solicitor General say please remand, or simply confess judgment?",
  "I think I got your point.",
  "Well, I thought you were also making a different argument. I thought you were making the argument that they have, by their pleadings, in effect, affirmatively indicated that they don't have enough facts to support a general allegation. I thought you were saying that because of the preface that you began reading, that in view simply of the fact that they are not competing, and in view of parallel conduct, they have violated the Act. So I guess my question is, would your position be different if there were no allegation simply of an absence of competition and parallel action if -- would your position be different if they had simply alleged, as Justice Stevens emphasized, that here were these parties and they had -- they had taken some action, not specified, which resulted in violation of the Act?",
  "So that would not be good enough, but are you saying that this is worse because, in effect, they have gone some steps towards specification. And the specifications that they have made affirmatively show that they don't have enough for the agreement.",
  "And you're saying that inference cannot be drawn from the particular facts that they have alleged.",
  "Well, is that really what they -- I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that the, that the Court spoke of no set of facts, only on the assumption that there had been a pleading which did raise a plausible, possible inference of forbidden conduct, and I thought the Court was saying if the, if the plausibility criterion has been satisfied, then the only way that the defendant can get a dismissal is by showing that there is no set of facts which would actually support the action. And I'm not sure that that can be done at the, at the, at the stage of simply pleading a dismissal as opposed to summary judgment or something like that. But I thought the Court did not get to its no set of facts point until it had first assumed that there had been a, a pleading on the basis of which a plausible inference of forbidden conduct could be drawn. Am I about that?",
  "So, so that if plausibility is the standard this does not meet the standard of plausibility, that's your argument?",
  "But that does not help you with respect to the other claim, the claim that there was a conspiracy to prevent upstart competitors from coming in. There's no plus factor as I understand it alleged there, and I also understand that it would have been entirely in the interest of each of your defendants to keep the upstarts out and that there is no need for them to agree to do that. It would be the most natural thing in the world to do it. What do you say about that part of your case?",
  "Yes, but a common, isn't the common motive consistent, just as consistent with no agreement as with agreement? In other words, they didn't have to agree; their common motive was operative agreement or not?",
  "No, what the other side is saying is that simply by alleging parallelism when it would be in the interest of each of the alleged conspirators to do just as you claim they are doing in the absence of an agreement, you have not alleged something that gets to the threshold of plausibility. That's their argument and I, I - -",
  "You may reply to us jointly or severally, however you may want.",
  "But the difference between that case and this is that the allegation with respect to the agreement to procure the getaway cars gets to a kind of specificity that is not present here. Here the allegation simply is parallel conduct to make it hard for the upstarts to get in. And at that general level the answer is, of course anyone in his right mind would want to make it difficult to let the upstarts in. There's no need to assume that they might have agreed on some matter of detail which is not essential to the scheme. This is a general characteristic of competition and resistance of competition.",
  "What's the answer to Justice Alito's question in this case?",
  "But if they don't do that, is it your argument that simply by behaving differently from the way Congress assumed when it passed the statute, that raises the plausible inference of violation?",
  "Okay. But is part of the plausibility of that inference the fact, in your argument, the fact that Congress assumed that would happen?",
  "But I mean, the congressional assumption is part of your case, in other words?",
  "Yes.",
  "What do you make of the, sort of the revolution argument that whether it's contrary or intention with, in fact the, it's been applied in what is now the Fed Circuit for what, 20 years, more than 20 years I guess. And to tip it over now is going to produce chaos. What's the answer to that?",
  "Well, I realize there's been comment on it, but guess I'm -- I'm raising the question that comes up in the old motto. I mean, if the error is common enough and long enough, the error becomes the law. And in effect is that what we are confronted with here?",
  "No, but -- if we see it your way, are there going to be 100,000 cases filed tomorrow morning?",
  "Well, you don't have that in this case, do you, because I thought the, I thought one of the arguments on the other side was the inelasticity of the supplies, so that no matter what they were paying, basically the same amount of wood was ultimately going to get processed; is that correct?",
  "You also, I take it, have to have an equally limited approach on the recoupment analysis, then. I mean, your recoupment analysis would have to be symmetrical with your cost analysis.",
  "Why is that the standard of fairness? I mean that, you know, that may be fine. But how does, how does a jury, A, what's the authority for saying that is the standard of fairness and B, how does a jury know that?",
  "Maybe you didn't, but that basically left the jury on a, on a free float, didn't it?",
  "Okay. Let's assume I accept your sort of Delmonte's analysis here. If we were to approve of that instruction in effect, as you want us to do, and we also believe that on its face something more has got to be said than merely the word fair, what proposition would we say must be included in that instruction to make the so-called fairness instruction a sensible one that can be consistently applied?",
  "No, I realize that.",
  "And I'm saying if we follow your lead, we're going to try to take that and make it a closer to perfect instruction, and what should we say must be added to it?",
  "But isn't that something that we've got to consider because if, if we disagree with them on Brooke Group, we've got to do it in the course of making a choice between a Brooke Group instruction and something else, and the only something else we've got right now is what we have in this case and we ought to, we ought to decide whether in fact that is good enough.",
  "And so I mean, I think, they may not have made that an independent basis of reversal but we've got to consider it.",
  "I'll stipulate to that.",
  "Assuming they don't have a leg to stand on in complaint, we have still got to face what the alternative to a Brooke Group kind of instruction is. And -- and however they may have tried their case, we've still got the same problem.",
  "They are saying it is likely to do so, even though we cannot give you a point for point percentage correlation between reduction of gas and coastline loss. You're saying, it seems to me, that they have somehow got to pinpoint this mathematically - -",
  "-- before, before there is redressibility.",
  "Tell me what it is that they need, be more specific about what they need to do.",
  "Why is there -- why is there reason to assume that it will have no effect?",
  "That seems to be the assumption you're making. You are saying unless they can pinpoint the correlation between reduction of gas and effect, let's say in coastline loss, they have not shown either causation or a sufficient likelihood of redressibility.",
  "But why do they have to show a precise correlation as opposed simply to establishing what I think is not really contested, that there is a correlation between greenhouse gases and the kind of loss that they're talking about; and it is reasonable to suppose that some reduction in the gases will result in some reduction in future loss. Why is that insufficient?",
  "Let's assume the rest - - let's assume that the rest of the world does nothing. I don't think that's a very reasonable assumption, but let's make that assumption. So that the only thing we're talking is the 6 percent. If the 6 percent can be reduced -- I think the suggestion was over a reasonable period of time, by two and a half percent of the 6, there is, I suppose, reason to expect that there will be, maybe not two and a half percent less coastline lost, but some degree of less coastline lost because there is a correlation between the gas and the loss of the coastline. Why is that an unreasonable assumption to make in order to show causation and redressibility, bearing in mind that redressibility is a question of more or less, not a question of either/or. They don't have to show that it will stop global warming. Their point is that will reduce the degree of global warming and likely reduce the degree of loss, if it is only by two and a half percent. What's wrong with that?",
  "Not redress their injury in the sense that it will prevent any global warming or stop global warming and stop coastal erosion; their argument is a different one. It will reduce the degree of global warming and reduce the degree of coastal loss.",
  "That's their argument. Not all or nothing. But a part. That's what they're trying to show.",
  "Don't they have to show that it is reasonable to suppose it will have an effect?",
  "Why is that showing -- and I agree with, by the way, with the Chief's suggestion a moment ago, life is not, or physics are not so simple as to assume that there's going to be a be a direct two and a half percent reduction of coastline for a two and a half percent reduction from the 6 percent. But isn't it intuitively reasonable to suppose that with some reduction of the greenhouse gases, there will be some reduction of the ensuing damage or the ensuing climate change which causes the damage? Isn't that fair?",
  "But do you have any - -",
  "But Congress has not directed, don't regulate domestically for purposes of global warming.",
  "The problem that I have with your reference to this very -- these various pieces of legislation that suggest that Congress has a different modus operandi in mind is that Congress certainly is aware that EPA has authority over pollutants, and it has never interfered with it.",
  "But isn't that a misstatement? Isn't the conclusion that they're trying to draw that Congress doesn't want them to exercise the authority they have for this purpose? And isn't that something quite different? And doesn't that raise the question whether that is a legitimate concern for them under the statute that does give them the authority?",
  "Let me ask the question - - the regulatory question. You do not dispute Michigan does not dispute that the operating -- well, strike that. Michigan does not dispute that national banks can go into business of real estate loans? And Michigan does not dispute that Congress has authorized national banks to operate through subsidiaries for specific purposes like this. My question is can you give me any plausible reason to think that Congress would have contemplated this system of potentially more restrictive State legislation when its national bank in a given instance decides to do -- to exercise its Federal banking power through a subsidiary rather than directly? Can you think of any reason that Congress would have contemplated the scheme that you're, that you're defending?",
  "Well, if, if -- if the banks have got, let's say, a subsidiary has to go through two rounds of bank inspection every year instead of one round, it is going to cost them something. Regulation costs the regulated entity something. It is a burden on them. And we also have to assume that there may be instances -- you brought it up -- in, in which the, the -- the State burden is heavier. So with those possibilities in mind, can you think of any reason why Congress in authorizing the exercise of the Federal banking power through a subsidiary would have contemplated Michigan or any State would have this authority? It seems counterintuitive to me. They're saying you can -- - you can -- you banks can exercise the Federal banking power through a subsidiary. It would seem strange to me that Congress would silently say, \"and, of course, we acquiesce to a -- a dual system of regulation that would not apply to the bank itself.\" What reason would Congress have had for assuming that might be the result?",
  "So it is state sovereign immunity in effect, is the answer -- State sovereignty is rather the answer?",
  "Well, we have said it repeatedly in contexts different from this. I mean, the paradigm context in which we made remarks to that effect, stated that, are affirmative action cases. The point of the affirmative action case is that some criterion which otherwise would be the appropriate criterion of selection is being displaced by a racial mix criterion. That is not what is happening here. This is not an affirmative action case. So why should the statements that have been made in these entirely different contexts necessarily decide this case?",
  "Let me help you out by taking you back to my question. One of the characteristics of the affirmative action cases was the displacement of some other otherwise generally acknowledged relevant criterion such as ability as shown in test scores, grade point averages, things like that; and that was a characteristic of those cases. It is not a characteristic of this case, as I understand it.",
  "Well, when you state Justice Scalia is right, you are assuming, I think as your brief assumed, that the definition of the benefit to be received here is the active choice, not the provision of an education. Now the active choice may be of value. I do not suggest that it is not. Clearly the school district thinks it does or it wouldn't provide choice. But it is not the entire benefit that is being provided, and the principal benefit is the education, not the choice of schools. Isn't that correct?",
  "My question is really Judge Boudin's question. You are in effect saying that by siting the school they can achieve exactly the objective they are seeking here. It's a question of do the -- the question comes down to whether they can do it candidly or do it by clumsier. That is, it seems to me, an unacceptable basis to draw a constitutional line.",
  "That isn't what they said here. I mean, they were dealing with a zone within which they operated, and it was only when the numbers got to the outer limits that they said, okay, we're going to use a racial criterion to prevent anything more, any more extreme disparity.",
  "That's what they do when they site the school. They said, you know, we'll get a rough whatever it is, 40-60 mix.",
  "Why?",
  "Mr. Gordon, in responding to Justice Ginsburg's question, don't you have to deal with the fact that this Court said in the second Swann case that the -- that a school district, particularly a school district like Swann which had been in violation, had been found in violation, had the same interest after unitary status had been attained in maintaining the unitary status as it had in reaching unitary status beforehand; that if those interests are identical why doesn't it follow that the means to achieve those two interests, unitary status from segregation in one case, preservation of unitary status in the other, are reasonable if they are identical?",
  "Race-neutral alternatives for what? To accomplish what?",
  "And isn't there a distinction between unitary status and unitary condition? Unitary condition is a descriptive situation. It describes a district in which there is, in fact, enough of a racial mix so that there is no credible claim either that there is de facto or de jure segregation; isn't that correct? There is such a thing as unitary, a unitary condition?",
  "And is the preservation of a unitary condition a legitimate or indeed a compelling governmental objective?",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "What do you mean, it doesn't work? I don't understand.",
  "I don't understand what it is that hasn't worked.",
  "I think that's what your friends on the other side are arguing.",
  "May I ask you this, and I think this applies to the case we have got, as well as to Justice Stevens' hypothetical. You said in Justice Stevens' -- in answer to Justice Stevens' hypothetical, that they could achieve a result, legitimately achieve a result of racial mixture within the respective faculties of these schools if they took other things in addition to race into consideration. You mentioned ability as teachers and so on. But at the end of the day, the object of doing this, which Justice Stevens' hypo assumed, and I think the object of doing it which your answer assumed, was the achievement of racial mixture in the faculties. My question is: Why do thy have to hide the ball by saying, oh, we're going to consider these other things, ability to teach, educational credits, whatever you could come up with when at the beginning and at the end, the objective is to achieve a racial mix? Why can't they do that candidly and employ a criterion that candidly addresses that objective?",
  "And it has developed that concern in cases in which the obvious use of race was to hurt or to stigmatize. Here, there is stigmatization going on as between black and white, when we say there is a value in mixing them up. Therefore, why should that same concern about referring to race at all be applied in this case.",
  "We have extended it in cases in which benefits were being denied. In Justice Stevens' hypothetical, and so far as I know in the kindergarten system in these cases, no educational benefit was being denied.",
  "Nothing was being rationed.",
  "But that is simply another way -- when you say it is the choice that's being denied, and that has to be the focus of the analysis, that is simply another way of saying you may never use the means of race-conscious distribution to achieve the educational objective. You're saying the same thing in a different way.",
  "In Gratz, the characteristics of individuals that could be considered were arguably relevant to a distribution decision. Here, the sole point is not to achieve a quota by relaxing other standards. The whole point is to achieve a value which comes from mixing the races, from distribution. And, therefore, why is it appropriate to look to other things as opposed to looking at that candidly, if that is a legitimate objective?",
  "But you may use those race neutral means only for the purpose of achieving that mixture. I take it that's the assumption of your answer.",
  "The objective is fine. The important thing is simply to hide the ball.",
  "Mr. Mellen, here is a question I should have asked friends on the other side. But I think it is raised by Justice Kennedy's question, so let me put it out. Are there circumstances under which there is reason to suspect the motivation of school districts when they come up with a plan in effect to require a mixing of the races in the schools that is more or less tailored to the relative percentages in the communities? Is -- are there circumstances in which that would be done for malign as opposed to benign purposes?",
  "And what -- give me some, or give me or an example.",
  "Do you think the school board in that case would use the clumsy means of racial integrational mixing as opposed simply to devoting more money to the black schools?",
  "I would think so, too.",
  "No, but was the reason they were using too little cement, the reason that there was a variation in the amount of liquid being taken out with the sludge as you've described to us that he had claimed, or was the reason simply that there was a kind of standard ratio of cement to sludge and that standard ratio was not followed in the later cases? In other words, is it because there was such a tremendous variation in the liquid in the sludge or simply because there was a standard formula having no particular relationship to the liquid in the sludge, and they simply didn't follow the standard formula? I thought the government's theory was the latter, and if it was the latter, it has nothing to do with the claim that he was making that there was too much variation in the amount of liquid in the sludge.",
  "But if they had followed the formula that they followed at the beginning, isn't it true that there's no evidence that even these variations in the liquid in the sludge would have resulted in instable or insolid pondcrete?",
  "This was truly even before the troubles started, even before the insolid pondcrete?",
  "Will you help me out on one mechanical point? As you probably know from your brief, I don't come from a jurisdiction that uses this rule and I'm just not used to it. I had thought -- and I guess I'm wrong -- that if the natural and probable consequences theory were used to prove, let's say, ultimately the offense of assault, in what started out as a theft case, that there would have to be a separate charge of assault but that the theory of proof would be the natural and consequences extension of aiding and abetting so that there would at least be on the record a charge of assault. And I take it that's not the case.",
  "Otherwise, you wouldn't have this problem.",
  "But in any case in my example of -- of theft, and the further offense under natural and probable consequences being assault, the only charge against the defendant who aided and abetted would be a charge of theft; is that correct?",
  "Me too.",
  "But to accept your answer, we've got to look into a question of California pleading law which hasn't been passed on below.",
  "No, but you're -- you're saying then despite the fact that the, the indictment in this case said he willfully et cetera did this, it would be open to California to prove that in fact he didn't do any of those things, but was merely an accessory after the fact? That -- that's your position? That's what California pleading law allows?",
  "Okay. JUSTICE STEVENS? Do you have any case on that?",
  "I think that, the problem I guess that I have with your argument, is that the theory of Taylor and as carried forward in Shepard was that there was a concept of a generic offense. And when aiding and abetting liability is extended in the natural and probable consequences theory, we face the fact that regardless of what the actual count is, even on your count, there isn't even a majority of states that do it. And I have difficulty seeing how that can, therefore, form an element of a generic offense when it is -- or a generic concept of the offense -- when it is a minority view.",
  "Why didn't we simply take the closest Federal definition as being the touchstone?",
  "Yes.",
  "Was Taylor an immigration case?",
  "So you are in effect, you would say that the rule should be, or the modified Taylor rule for application here should be that it's either got to fall within the concept of the Federal offense, or in default of there being a comparable Federal offense, a generic offense defined by reference to state practice?",
  "But it was also protectionism -- I mean, I didn't agree with this at the time, but I mean there, it -- you have to admit that there was protectionism of the one licensee, the person who constructed the plant and was going to sell it to the town for a dollar. That, so far as we know, that person or that company was in it for the money. And so for the period of the five years prior to the transfer to the town for the dollar, that particular entity was being protected so it could make money, and therefore, make it worthwhile for that company to sell its, its real estate to the town for a dollar. Surely that entity was being protected handsomely.",
  "Well, that's -- that's a third case but that's not the question we have here, is it?",
  "It sounds to me as though, if we accept your argument that, going back to Justice Breyer's first question, every municipal utility in the United States is going to fall.",
  "No, but you know, you know that there are plenty of, of communities that don't have municipal utilities and seem to get natural gas. They seem to get electricity. The lights go on. And therefore by parity of reasoning to what we have just heard, there just wouldn't be the justification for, let's say, embargoing the importation of electricity and gas by private entities from outside. So that if you win on this argument, no more municipal lifelines.",
  "No more municipal pipelines.",
  "Well, they'd like to run them as - -",
  "-- an exclusive monopoly, and in that sense they won't, they won't be around anymore because the Commerce Clause will, will declare them unconstitutional.",
  "Then where does your argument about formalism go? Isn't it a formalistic distinction whether the utility does its financing through or its collection through taxes, or through a user fee? You said, you said distinctions on -- I thought you said distinctions like that were purely formalistic - -",
  "-- for purposes of the Commerce Clause, and therefore the distinction I suppose wouldn't count.",
  "There's some, then I guess you are saying some formalistic distinctions, some distinctions that don't make any difference economically but are formalistically different are okay.",
  "But at the same -- exactly that -- that avoids the problem. At exactly the same time, it's protecting the private 50 percent interest. Why isn't the better answer that in fact that would be subject to Commerce Clause analysis and that would fall, that if the government wants to do this the government's going to do it the way the government's doing it in your case, it's going to be a 100 percent government. If it doesn't, it's protectionism.",
  "Well, that's just a question of New York law, isn't it?",
  "I don't know, I don't know what municipalities can do in New York. You say they've got to have a good reason. I assume you're referring to New York law for that purpose.",
  "What are you referring to, then?",
  "Then essentially it's just a political check on it. When you say there's got to be a good reason, politically people would get mad if you didn't have a good reason; is that basically it?",
  "But there's no Commerce Clause reason?",
  "Okay.",
  "But isn't that almost a fourth point? I realize you didn't get the third point out yet. But isn't -- I remember your brief and isn't there sort of a fourth point? And that is, I will assume that the government does have some basic health and safety objectives and the objective to protect its citizens here.",
  "If the government tries to pursue these policies solely by private inducement, trash haulers may say, we don't want to deal on those terms, we can haul somewhere else, in another county, another State, what-not. By taking on the job itself, the government in effect is guaranteeing that to the extent it can protect its citizens, induce respect for environmental policy, and so on, it will do so without any cessation of service? There's kind of an assurance of service plus the objectives that the government gets by running the plant itself. And isn't that sort of the nub of all of your points?",
  "I guess I'm not quite sure what that means. I mean, it's one thing to say I will pursue the litigation because it would be a good thing to have a definitive answer from someone other than the governor or me. Is it her position at the present time that the position of her predecessor is correct or not?",
  "So she adopts the interpretation of her predecessor?",
  "Well, in this case if it was not a false exercise in Santos, why was it a false exercise here?",
  "But it, it, it was still an exercise -- it was an exercise in this case of the same authority that it was purporting to exercise in Santos, which you conceded. And that is the authority to determine its own jurisdiction. I presume that jurisdiction is determined on a case by case basis when a case has already been accepted by the Court, and as Justice Ginsburg said is sub judice. So if there was, if there was jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction in Santos, I don't see why there wasn't likewise jurisdiction to determine it here.",
  "Once the -- once the Ninth Circuit determined that it had no longer a continuing jurisdiction to do anything more than it did, in the order that finally dismissed this, the other side wasn't bound to litigate that here. All the other side is saying is that up to that point, the court was determining its own jurisdiction. And therefore it is only when it determined that its jurisdiction no longer existed, that the filing period began to run. So it seems to me that the crucial question is if it could determine its own jurisdiction in Santos which you concede, why can't it determine its own jurisdiction here?",
  "Isn't that what it was doing?",
  "Why -- why can't it?",
  "But those -- those -- are they -- and you have got me here. The argument here is that the, that the Ninth Circuit already had taken jurisdiction in this case. It wasn't a question of whether to accept it or not.",
  "I guess I'm still at a loss on the point that for one purpose, the purpose of the 90-day filing period, you're saying that the Ninth Circuit did not have jurisdiction; but for another purpose, the determination of whether it had jurisdiction, you're saying it does have jurisdiction. Am I misunderstanding your argument?",
  "I don't see how you can have it both ways.",
  "Maybe I should say I don't know why this Court can have it both ways.",
  "Don't, don't we have to choose one analytical path or the other analytical path?",
  "Well, why why does it do any more than the 35 percent value? That sets a definite limit.",
  "Well, you say without any responsibility to the voters. I mean, the voters are going to know that if the valuation is changed and the tax rate isn't, their taxes are going up. So I assume the voters are going to be vigilant to what is going on and I assume they have telephones and they'll call their representatives. Why is this -- why do you posit this sort of failure of representative democracy?",
  "But if the tax rate is changed, they're going to call twice.",
  "But they're going to know this. I mean, they're going to be, if they are concerned at all about it, they'll be in touch with their representatives.",
  "No, but isn't that the problem in your argument? Because your argument assumes, and I think you said this quite candidly a moment ago, that once there has been a finding that he informed the court that he did not want mitigation evidence presented, that in effect is a matter of - - binds him as a matter of law for all time. And what he is saying here is look, if I had known that there was this kind of mitigating evidence, as opposed to what was proffered to the court at the end of the trial in fact, I would not have made that waiver, if you want to call it that. I would not have made that representation to the court. And what I want is an evidentiary hearing to show that, to show that in fact, when I said to the court no mitigating evidence, I didn't mean this. And he wants a hearing for that. The only way it seems to me that you can properly win on the issue that he thus raises is exactly the way that I think you said a moment ago. That once there is a finding that he made a statement, whatever its predicate, a statement that I don't want any mitigating evidence presented, that is the end of the issue as a matter of law. My question is, do you have any authority for that?",
  "Doesn't it have to go to both? Because I mean, he's saying look, first I want to show that there's a certain kind of mitigation evidence that was not proffered, that I didn't have in mind, that I wouldn't have objected to. And he then wants to proceed with respect to his inadequacy of counsel claim based also on the existence of this kind of evidence that counsel didn't look to. There's a dual purpose, I thought.",
  "So it's clear that they disagreed that the finding was necessarily dispositive. Is anything clear beyond that? I mean, I guess I'm hesitant to say I'm raising the same question that the Chief Justice did, about the ambiguity of what the court did. I mean, there's no question that they found that the -- the State trial court's finding with respect to waiver or whatever we want to call it was not necessarily dispositive. I don't think it's clear that they found anything beyond that, but correct me if I'm wrong.",
  "Right. But that could have, as we said a moment ago, that could have a dual purpose. One to show the, in effect, the inadequacy or the nondispositive character of the State court's finding; and two, to show relief for inadequate assistance of counsel. And the question here is that, the immediate question is what exactly did the State court find with respect to -- oh, sorry -- what exactly did the Ninth Circuit find with respect to the State court finding? And there's no question that the Ninth Circuit assumed that the State court finding was not necessarily dispositive, but I don't know that it's clear it went beyond that, and that's where perhaps you could help me if I'm wrong.",
  "Isn't there something that, isn't he saying implicitly Justice Souter implicitly \"I didn't have this kind of evidence in mind; if I had been aware of this kind of evidence, I wouldn't have given that instruction?\" So he is, it seems to me, implicitly saying well, my waiver was not knowing, in the sense that I understood there was this kind of evidence and intended to preclude its introduction? Isn't that clear?",
  "But that's the same thing, isn't that the same, a way of saying that to that extent my waiver was not knowing?",
  "And he's saying if you will give me a hearing, district court, I will try to demonstrate to you why, why the State court's finding on that point was unreasonable. The State court made that finding based on its observation of me at trial and, and at the sentencing phase; but it didn't give me a, a further chance to develop my evidence on, on post-conviction. And I want a hearing to develop that evidence in front of you, Federal district court, in order to prove that the State court's finding in light of that evidence was unreasonable. Isn't, isn't it correct that that's what he's asking for now?",
  "How would -- how do we know that?",
  "But you, I don't think you mean this, but you're not arguing that he just omitted the magic words not knowing and voluntary?",
  "No, but, I thought a second ago you -- you admitted that to a degree he was, because he is saying implicitly if I had known about this kind of mitigating evidence, I wouldn't have waived. Therefore, my waiver was, as to this, not a knowing waiver.",
  "Look, it would have been a better affidavit, it would have been better pleading. We can stipulate to that. But is there, I don't see there is any serious question that he is arguing right now that as to this kind of evidence, had I known about it I wouldn't have waived and therefore, I shouldn't be precluded from, from getting it in now. And, and if there's no question about that, then -- then I think we're just fighting about words.",
  "And he says in the district, he says in the district court: I want a hearing to show that I was credible. So credible that the State court finding should be seen as an unreasonable resolution of a factual issue. I want a hearing. That's all he's asking for, isn't it?",
  "Well, that's pretty good evidence, isn't it? I mean, he may be a believable witness on this point. I don't know.",
  "Well, the district court had a proffer, but the district court but had not heard witnesses, it had not heard evidence.",
  "Sure, but the reasonableness of factual findings depends on what the evidence is that can go in on the issue of reasonableness. And there's a universe of difference between a proffer of evidence which the district court says \"well, I'll assume that,\" on the one hand, and on the other hand, the actual presentation of witnesses perhaps including Landrigan himself, which the court actually hears. You know, you, sometimes you get a lot more impressed by real evidence than by assumptions you make for the sake of argument. And that seems to me a world of difference.",
  "The only thing, but the - - the -- I guess on that point, my only, my only reason for raising this with you is on that point, it's not enough to say well, the district court assumed this. Or for that matter, the State trial court assumed this. That is not the same thing as putting in the evidence.",
  "And so are you, are you in effect then saying that the waiver does not need to be a knowing waiver in the sense that it needs to be based upon an appreciation of all the possible mitigation evidence that in this case might come in? Are you saying it need not be knowing in that sense?",
  "Well, you're not answering my question. I -- we all agree that he needs to understand the basic concept of mitigation. Does his waiver have to be a knowing one in the sense that I just described? Or doesn't it? What's your position?",
  "And it will nonetheless kind him if he comes in later and says look, I accept the fact that it's my burden to show at this point that my waiver was not a knowing one, and that there us mitigating evidence that I would have let in? Are you saying that he simply as a matter of law cannot say that? Or cannot be heard to say that?",
  "So -- so the answer to my question is yes?",
  "As a matter of law, he cannot do what he is trying to do here?",
  "Okay.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, you -- you may have convinced me. I'll stipulate that you have convinced me that the argument that you're arguing for would probably be a better method, but you haven't touched the text of (b)(2)(b)(i) yet, and that's where some of us at least are, are having our -- our problems. Do you agree that in the absence of the other program, I forget the, the acronym for it -- that you really would not have any argument that there is ambiguity in the text here?",
  "Then -- then would you address the text?",
  "Okay.",
  "So what is supposed to be disregarded are educational agencies?",
  "Right. And the agencies are identified how? How do we identify the agencies that would be disregarded?",
  "And we identify their per-pupil revenues, too, don't we? Agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above or below, right?",
  "But that critical test is being applied to an agency which is being identified by reference to per-pupil expenditures or revenues, correct?",
  "Well, it's not merely that they are associated with. The very definition, the very identification of LEA here is exclusively in terms of per-pupil expenditures or revenues. It's not merely in association. It is a definition, isn't that so?",
  "Then, then what does the phrase with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above 95 or below 5 mean?",
  "Well, why doesn't it? It seems to me that the only identification of an entity or person, if you want, to be disregarded is the identification of an LEA, and the LEA is described in terms exclusively of its expenditures or revenues. So why doesn't that foreclose your position?",
  "Right. Obviously - -",
  "After identifying them in terms of the expenditures or revenues. That's what you're supposed to do.",
  "There are lots of things that Congress could have done differently from what it did do, but it, that doesn't seem to me to inject an ambiguity in the identification in, in this subsection of the LEA that we are talking about. And it doesn't create an ambiguity in, in the clear provision that what is to be disregarded is an LEA as so defined.",
  "Sure, that's another way to --",
  "-- do it, but tell me why that is consistent with the text.",
  "It says disregard LEAs; it then identifies certain LEAs which are to be disregarded. Nowhere does it say disregard pupils.",
  "Well, why can't the State protect it more? I mean the fact that Hudson would be adequate -- it - -",
  "-- from that it does not follow that the State is not protecting the rights.",
  "And your claim as I take it, that there is an infringement with the union's right of political advocacy, is that if in effect the scheme restricts the union's use of its own funds?",
  "All right. You agree that the union could segregate these funds as opposed to commingling them, and that would cure, that would in effect answer your, your constitutional objection?",
  "Well, it's clear from the statute that, that what you would do would be leave them subject to the opt-in determination, but all other funds, i.e., the funds that you are constitutionally entitled to protect, would be unencumbered.",
  "Do you think that would create an independent constitutional problem assuming that you did segregate the funds?",
  "That would, that would create an issue? You know, what if they say: Nothing? Maybe, maybe the statute does not deal adequately with that. But does that raise a constitutional problem that in effect would be, would be of equal parity with the one that is, that is raised on behalf of the, the, the dissenting workers?",
  "You're -- you're back to its funds again.",
  "And you're saying, first you said well, segregating the funds does not answer the problem. And I thought the reason it didn't answer the problem was that the, that it was, that the purposes of the, of the act were underinclusive. And now you're responding to Justice Ginsburg by going back to making the assumption that the segregated funds would be the union's funds.",
  "May I just -- I'm sorry. May I just take you back to the point of the objective being protection of election integrity. As I understand it, so far as the protection of election integrity is concerned, with respect to these contributions, that is simply the obverse side or the flip side, if you will, of protecting the right of the dissenting union member or the non-joined -- strike that -- the non-union worker, to control the use of the funds that would be used for the political purposes. The one is simply the obverse of the other. Do you agree?",
  "So by articulating that the election integrity is a purpose, the Washington Supreme Court should not be understood as excluding the protection of the non-member workers' interests?",
  "Okay, but you're one step ahead of that here, because here there hasn't been any, in effect, any exposure. Here there isn't any certain default on the note. So far as we know, here, there may never be any default on the workers comp obligation. So that your contingency is a much more remote contingency. Why should that, why should this case fall into the same category as the promissory note?",
  "And so far as we know, it won't.",
  "Well, it has, but that depends on a totally circular argument. The minute it filed for bankruptcy, although there had been no default on the comp obligation, your client started incurring attorneys' fees, and it was not incurring attorneys' fees based on any default by the, by the debtor.",
  "You can call bankruptcy a default, but that's not what I mean, and you know that's not what I mean. I'm talking about a default on the workers comp obligation.",
  "There has been no default on the workers comp obligation, and because they intend to keep on running this business, there is reason to suppose that there will not be.",
  "Yes, and maybe you don't have a claim at the beginning of the case. I mean, that's what we're getting at. We can understand the claim when the note -- when you've got a promissory note and you're out of money. The claim is inevitable. In this case, there is no inevitable claim.",
  "But if it is defined as broadly as this, we're in a situation exactly like this. There has been no default on the obligation, and prior to getting to this Court, $167,000 has been racked up in legal fees that accomplishes absolutely nothing.",
  "All right, in this case, $167,000 has been spent to come to the conclusion, as I understand it. That if the time comes to assert a right of indemnification, you can assert a right of indemnification and we can oppose it. If we are going to construe the bankruptcy law to provide a law like this, then maybe there is something wrong in the, in the construction of the bankruptcy law.",
  "Let's assume, let's assume that one of the recipients of comp payments had come forward and said: I object to the plan, I have a claim for comp payments and I object to the plan because it doesn't provide for them. And the -- the court said, you're, you're right. The plan is going to include provision for comp payments and it had been so amended, and it was then -- the plan was then amended. Would you, under those circumstances, have had any -- would Travelers, under those circumstances, have had any reason to assert a claim?",
  "No, I know it. But would you have had any other claim that you would have asserted, had that been done?",
  "With respect to any interest of Travelers?",
  "If that had been done, would Travelers have asserted a claim?",
  "What?",
  "Well, of course the argument here is that this is something different from the general abuse that you're describing, because the plan didn't make any provision here for, for paying the workers comp obligation at all. What is your response to that?",
  "What do you say to the argument from drafting history that looks at the history both of little n and little o and it points out that as originally, in the original bill, little o providing for the actual damages required a finding of gross negligence? Little n used the word \"willful\" just as it does now, suggesting that willful would not include gross negligence or something close to gross negligence like recklessness. Then in, then in o, they changed the standard from gross negligence to mere negligence, but they made no change in n, which suggests that n stayed whatever it always was, and if the argument from contrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than reckless, it stayed knowing even when the standard was changed to negligence in o. What do you say to that argument?",
  "But the fact that they had originally drafted n as it is, in contrast to the original o, does tell us, doesn't it, something about what they had in mind in n. And they must have had something in mind, probably had in mind, something in n which was a standard higher than gross negligence.",
  "Well, I mean, there's no question it has been and that is sort of the usual reading in the civil context. But we also keep repeating, you know, \"willful\" is a word of many meanings and you always look to the context. And here the argument is that if you look to the context of the, of the two statutory sections right up next to each other, you can draw a, an inference about what \"willful\" means.",
  "They're making this argument, and I think you got close to it a minute ago when you alluded to statutory purpose. I think this is what's behind, and you tell me if I'm wrong. One purpose of the statute is to alert a consumer that the consumer's credit report may contain errors which are doing the consumer some kind of damage.",
  "And you want this consumer alerted so the consumer can ask to see the report and correct it if possible.",
  "Reading the adverse action the way you read it, it would give the consumer or consumers a tip-off in the maximum number of cases. In every case in which the consumer might have done better if the credit report had assumed different facts, on your reading theoretically, the consumer is going to say I want to look at that report and correct it if it's wrong. But isn't the fallacy of that argument the fallacy of saying because that is one object of the statute, every term within the statute has got to be read in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that object? And the trouble that we're having on the bench is that discrimination and increase are different terms. Increase says the rate actually goes up from a baseline that the consumer previously had, whereas discrimination does not. And your reading in effect, increase to mean discrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that the consumer will look at the report, isn't that the basis of your argument?",
  "Well, that's a way to give every conceivable effect to that policy. But the statute in drafting adverse, or drafting the terms of adverse action, may very well have said we don't want to give every conceivable effect to this purpose because if we do, we'll get into the situation that Justice Breyer described. Everybody will be getting notices and the notices will be meaningless.",
  "To set the charge. I mean, that's circular. To set the charge that it gives you.",
  "Why do we -- how do we know that they were intended to be protected in this way by getting this notice? That's the issue in the case.",
  "Okay. So that's - -",
  "Your basic argument is the statute, the definitions of adverse action have got to be read in a way that maximizes the occasion upon which a consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer to ask to see his credit report. That's your basic premise?",
  "All right.",
  "Well, Mr. Steiker, may I interrupt you or interrupt the course of your argument to get to a more preliminary point before you get down to details? Do you concede that harmless error analysis is ever appropriate, is ever open as an option following an, in effect, a finding of this kind of instructional error, Penry I instructional error? Do you concede that?",
  "Well, I quite agree. I understand that. Was the, was the issue of the availability of harmless error raised on your side of the case in the proceedings back in Texas?",
  "May I, may I again interrupt you to just get the context of your argument? You said earlier that under Chapman, assuming there is a harmless error issue, that essentially is -- is necessarily a Federal issue. And therefore, I take it, the basis of your point here is, if that is a Federal issue, then the adequacy of actions of counsel to raise it is also a Federal issue. Is that correct?",
  "Is my understanding - -",
  "Thank you.",
  "But you do, but you do take that position with respect to a harmless error?",
  "All right. If we assume, for the sake of argument, that there is disagreement on that point, are there any cases of this Court on the matter of adequacy of State procedural bars that would support you, even on the assumption that it's a State, not a Federal issue?",
  "What about the case, the name of which I cannot think of, to the effect that requiring procedural action by the defendant which would simply be a useless formality and so on?",
  "It's Flowers. All right. Wouldn't, wouldn't that be authority that you would invoke, in the, in the sense, as I understood your earlier argument, that the, that the pretrial motion and the adjudication of that made it plain to everybody what the, what the issue was, and therefore requiring anything more would -- would in effect violate the Flowers rule?",
  "It's preserved error on direct review, isn't it? On page 23 of their brief there's a footnote that, the red brief, that at least claims to describe the sort of the structure of Texas law, and I thought under Texas law you got a Chapman analysis only if you were on direct review and had preserved error. Is that correct?",
  "Well, it would be a special risk if you, if you, if you allowed them to raise the bar, allowed a State to raise a bar to consideration of the issue. But I want to go back to your answer to Justice Stevens' question. You, you say you draw no distinction between the, the procedural failing as a bar to raising the issue and as a basis for determining a standard of harmless error review later. I don't understand why you, you can maintain there is no distinction because if they may not consider it as the basis for their, their standard of harmless error review, assuming we have such a thing, then what are they supposed to use as their standard? Your answer I take it is Chapman, but Chapman as I understand the statement of Federal law would not apply -- State law -- Chapman would not apply in these circumstances. And if you were in a Federal court and this were a Federal conviction Chapman wouldn't apply on collateral review. So it seems to me that you've either got to accept the distinction between procedural error as bar to issue, procedural error as basis for standard of review, or you have no way to figure out what the, what the standard of review should be.",
  "I take it that is not an issue before us?",
  "But the Penry error, even if not structural, is not subject to harmless error review and you could say that that distinction is possible because Penry has a built-in harmless error or a harmful error component. But as I understand it that's not -- that issue is not in this case.",
  "No. But isn't the implausibility of the argument that you are making something like this: You say the Texas rule is not that failure to object is a procedural bar but that failure to object determines the standard of harmless error review if in fact there is a later appeal. The implausibility, though, I guess of the position is that as I understand it, four members of the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals did not understand that to be the case at all. Four of them said it is a procedural bar. The four did not understand that there was this rule that you invoke, and when the four said there is a procedural bar, the majority of the court never came out and said no, there isn't.",
  "Isn't the consequence of that, though, that for purposes of this case there was no clear State bar at the time in question and therefore, they cannot apply it now? Maybe they can apply it in cases down the road. I'll assume for the sake of argument that they can. But not in your case, because the bar was not established at the relevant time in your case.",
  "Okay. But what it is doing is in effect saying there was a kind of default which is subsumed in what the four dissenting justices said the first time around. And so we're going to, we're going to sort of call it a half-loaf procedural default, but we never said so the first time around.",
  "I can understand that they would be separate concepts if there were a rule or if there had been a rule in place at the time he was going through his State habeas that so said. But we don't seem to have such a rule because as you said, there was disagreement within the court, and Hood had not been decided, and therefore - -",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Black being -- help me out, Black?",
  "But that goes to Penry I, and this is then an objection both to Penry I and based on Penry II.",
  "So it's - -",
  "You're right.",
  "When you say 90 percent, you're talking about argument time, aren't you?",
  "Your answer to that is, there were several hundred pages of records from school and the testing that went on in school that indicated there was something seriously wrong with this guy.",
  "All right. Maybe -- but the fact is that we're talking right now about sort of quantum of evidence. Was there something serious there for the jury to consider which in effect is the basis for all of this argument? And it seems to me it's not fairly characterized by saying, well, 90 percent of the mitigation case was that he was sweet and loving there. Whether you find it -- whether you find it persuasive or not, there was a substantial amount of evidence of -- going to his mental capacity and to his abuse.",
  "Aren't you really saying that the most weight that the guidelines can be given, or guidelines can be -- is that -- I apologize for my voice -- the most weight the guidelines can be given is, is the weight of necessary advertence? The guidelines, in effect, are at odds with the rest of 3553(a). The rest of them say individualized sentencing. The guidelines, in effect, says, no, sentencing by the guidelines. Therefore, in order to -- to break this, in effect, logical incommensurateness, on your view, I think the most that you can concede is that before a district judge sentences finally, he must show that he has considered the value of uniformity as something different from individualized sentencing, but that's as much as he can be required to do. Is that a fair statement of your position?",
  "Yes. I -- I stand corrected here. I'm sorry.",
  "But are you saying now that that distinction should be ignored?",
  "But it sounds to me as though you want all the reasons to be specific. I mean, I understand your argument. But if we accept that argument, then the distinction between reason and specific reason basically is going to be a matter of history, and perhaps it should be.",
  "But unless there is a way to calibrate the strength of the presumption, there's no clear way to distinguish the presumption from the mandate. The mandate is gone. You say yes, they consider other things. But unless we can calibrate the presumption in some way that says, you know, a mandate was force 60 and a presumption is a force 40, something like that, there's no way to tell the two apart in practice.",
  "Well, is your view -- on your view, is the appellate court engaging in some kind of de novo review or is the appellate court supposed to engage in a review that it will disturb the sentence only if it is shown to be unreasonable?",
  "What is reasonable is -- is not merely a sort of number within a spectrum. It seems to me that what is reasonable is a function in part of the reasons that are given. And in the Chief Justice's view, two diametrically opposed reasons are given for two different sentences. Does the, does the appellate court in his example say, well, I think reasonable people could go either way on that, so however it comes out it's fine on appellate review? Isn't that what the court would have to do in order to affirm both sentences, other things being equal?",
  "Isn't it clear that it would have been the last choice of the Congress?",
  "So doesn't your presumption argument come down to an argument for a sufficiently comprehensive statement of reasons, with a more extensive statement required the further the court gets from the guidelines? Isn't that what it boils down to?",
  "Is there -- may I interrupt you? Because your time is getting short. Is there a difference between a presumption of reasonableness to the guidelines on the one hand and a rule that says the further you get from them, you can get as far as you want to, but the further you get from them, the more extensive your explanation has to be? Is there a distinction between those two, two rules?",
  "And the component then would be either a disk which is put into a computer or the portion of the hard drive to which the code is transferred.",
  "But in this case, you're - - but Mr. Olson said the component is either the disk or the portion of the hard drive to which the, the coded instructions are transferred.",
  "Do you accept that?",
  "In other words, the disk plus the -- plus the coded instructions.",
  "It could be on the hard drive.",
  "And that is what is on master disk.",
  "So you -- and the reason it wouldn't matter on your view is that the component is the object code on the disk, not the disk itself?",
  "All right. Then why doesn't that get you - -",
  "Why doesn't that get you right back to the point that Justice Breyer was making? You are saying, I think, in essence if you send a blueprint -- this is like a blueprint. It tells, it tells a machine which may be in Europe how to put the object code on other disks or on hard drives. The machine in Europe is following instructions just the way an artisan would follow a blueprint.",
  "What is the difference?",
  "Yes, but the \"continuously\" does not describe the process of going from the master disk to what you claim to be the infringing computer sold in Europe. There is no continuous process there. As I understand it, what happens is -- let's just take the master disk and forget the photon for the moment. The master disk functions like a blueprint. They send, from the United States they send the blueprint to Europe. The blueprint is put in some kind of a machine in Europe. And by the use of the blueprint the machine puts electrical charges on a disk or on a hard drive, and that it seems to me does bear out the blueprint analogy. And if it does, then any export of a blueprint or indeed the simple export, the simple sending of the '820, if that's the right number, patent in this case would be a violation.",
  "And so what's the difference between that and this case for you?",
  "But what is it that they export and send overseas?",
  "Right, it's a thing. It's an object of some sort, isn't it?",
  "It is an object that has coded onto it, transferred to it in a readable way, those commands. But it's an object, isn't it?",
  "All right. But - -",
  "You can perfectly well say that in this case. You can say that the instruction is exhausted once the golden disk has sent its information through an intermediary machine onto the new disk that is made.",
  "That simply means that after the -- the -- the -- the idea as you put it, has been placed on the hard drive, certain other processes must take place too before we get the result that people are buying computers to -- to obtain. But it's still the case that the -- that the code on the golden disk is exhausted once that has been transferred from the disk through an intermediary machine on its way ultimately to a working computer just -- and my only point is -- just the way you can say that the blueprint in effect is exhausted once the house has been built.",
  "Sure. You can use it again.",
  "The object code has several jobs. One job when embodied on the golden disk is tell a -- is to tell a machine how to make disks or how to put a message on a hard drive. Another job that the object code has is when the object code gets on the resulting disk or the hard drive. But in fact, the manifestation of the object code on the golden disk and the manifestation of the object code on the resulting disk are separable, just as the blueprint is separable from what is constructed.",
  "Before do you that, will you go back to the Philadelphia case. Do you contend that a jury could find that he reasonably believed that he would not cause, that he would not raise a serious risk of death or serious bodily harm by bumping the car at 90 miles an hour?",
  "I don't understand that. How could such a belief be reasonable? What am I missing here?",
  "That doesn't answer my question.",
  "Why, why would it be reasonable to believe that a car could be bumped at 90 miles an hour plus without raising a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm? How could such a belief be reasonable?",
  "Some people are lucky. We're talking about creating a substantial risk. How would it be reasonable to assume that one would not create a substantial risk?",
  "Well, the phrase used was \"take him out,\" wasn't it?",
  "The question was whether he was creating a substantial risk doing that.",
  "And my, my question is how could a jury find otherwise? Your answer up to this point is that well, he used signal lights and his reflexes were good, and they sure were. But the question is whether he was creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm to others. And my question is leaving -- assuming that his reflexes were good and he knew how to use the signal lights, how could the jury fail to find that he was creating such a risk?",
  "Garner was not talking about someone who at the time the deadly force was used was himself creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm to others. That's what we are dealing with here. And the reasonableness of the officer's action depends on whether, at the summary judgment stage, a jury can reasonably find that, in fact, he was not creating at that moment, a substantial risk of serious bodily harm or death to others. And my question is, how could a jury find anything else?",
  "But at the moment Scott came into this case, what difference does that make? Why is that even relevant? Let's assume Scott knew that this entire situation had eventuated out of an 18 mile in excess of speed act by the individual. Assume that. What Scott also knew at the point at which he joined the chase was that this individual was driving a car at 90 miles an hour. He was crossing yellow lines, going through red lights, et cetera. At that point, wasn't the only legally relevant data whether or not Harris was creating the risk of death or bodily harm to others?",
  "So you agree that whether Scott knew or didn't know, that this whole scenario had eventuated out of a speeding situation was irrelevant?",
  "In an instance in which the money is paid to the -- the reimbursement is paid to the child, how does the child get the money to the parents?",
  "No, I'm not talking about negating the award. I'm -- if that theory is sound, if the child is the proper recipient of the reimbursement, I presume that ultimately the reimbursement is supposed to go to the person who paid the money?",
  "Which would be the parent. My question is how does the child in that case get the money to the parent?",
  "All right. But if the, if the guardian is in a position to convey the money to himself in the different capacity as the parent, then why isn't the guardian equally in a, in a position to be substituted for the child in -- in litigating the action?",
  "You can't have it -- you can't have it both ways.",
  "Mr. Bergeron, I have a basic conceptual problem, both with that response and with your larger argument. Leaving aside how we should classify the reimbursement right or classify reimbursement, you make a broad distinction between the substantive right of the child to the free appropriate public education and on the other hand, the procedural rights of the parent in going through the process that ultimately comes to a conclusion for the child's benefit. The conceptual problem I have is that I don't understand why it makes sense to say that the parents have procedural rights unless that procedural - - or unless those procedural rights of the parents are in aid of some substantive entitlement for the parents. We give procedural protection to people in order to vindicate some substantive interest that they can claim, and you're, in effect, splitting those two apart. You're saying one person has a substantive right, the other people have procedural right. And I don't see conceptually how you can make that split. And if you don't make that split, then it only makes sense that the right to the free public -- the free appropriate public education is, as the statute in one place seems to say, a right of the family group, the parents and the child together, rather than the right of the child alone. So conceptually, how do you defend the distinction that you make between substantive rights on one person and procedural rights in another?",
  "Then why don't we say that they are the procedural rights of the child and the parents are simply stepping into the child's shoes to vindicate them?",
  "I'm sorry. You go ahead.",
  "Isn't that the problem? On the analysis that you're coming up with, parents end up without even the procedural rights, because you're saying the only person who can basically invoke a violation of procedural right is the person whose been denied the substantive right. The parent hasn't been denied the substantive right. Therefore, the parent cannot invoke even the procedural right which ostensibly on your own analysis, the parent has been given. That can't be correct.",
  "No, but before you direct me to cases - -",
  "What's wrong with the analytical point that I just made?",
  "Yeah, but instead of saying they're not eclipsed, you're saying they are totally blocked out. Because you analysis, I thought was, in response to my earlier objection, that the procedural right, in fact, can only ultimately be invoked for the vindication of the substantive right. And because the substantive right is the child's, not the parents, it would follow that the parents cannot even invoke their procedural rights, and we know that that can't be correct.",
  "But if the parent's procedural rights are not gone, then the parents must be able to invoke those procedural rights based on what they claim to be a denial of some substantive entitlement. You're saying that's the entitlement of the child, but if the parents are going to have any procedural right worth having, they've got to invoke it for the purpose of vindicating that substantive right; isn't that correct?",
  "Okay. Then why do not the parents, when they are claiming that they are aggrieved, have as much right to make a claim that goes to the substantive denial as to the procedural denial, simply because the two are inseparable?",
  "Mr. Bergeron, on, one of the points you made on the spending clause argument, I thought, was that if there are lawyers representing the parents, the lawyers are going to screen out the more frivolous cases. If they are not, more frivolous cases are going to be brought. And there's -- there's an intuitive appeal to that argument. Do we have any -- any figures on the comparative numbers of frivolous cases in lawyer representation and pro se representation under the Act?",
  "We don't have any First Circuit numbers - -",
  "-- versus other numbers?",
  "Okay. Thank you.",
  "And why should that make any difference if the entire theory behind it is sort of a Madisonian theory, if not threepence from the pocket for a religious purpose? If you start with the Madisonian view, there should be no distinction of the two cases that Justice Scalia puts.",
  "No, but let's talk about establishing -- maybe this is what you're going to do, establishing religion by spending the threepence.",
  "And in this case, when you build the church, you're spending the threepence whether -- whether a -- a Government employee is laying the bricks or a contract -- an outside contractor is laying the bricks or a third party institution to which a grant has been made is laying the bricks. It's the same threepence.",
  "Taking the money out of the pocket and using it for a particular purpose, and the money comes out of the pocket in each case. The purpose is the same in each case.",
  "Mr. Pincus, may I ask you this question? Do you think your theory is consistent with Valley Forge?",
  "But respect to the RICO claim, assuming the RICO claim is upheld, what do you say to your brother's argument that there is no history of qualified immunity for RICO claims? That the qualified immunity doctrine addresses the, the kind of development of squishier law under -- under 1983. So that you simply have not qualified immunity.",
  "Well that may be a very - - it seems to me that those may be good arguments, or at least relevant arguments against the applicability of RICO in the first place. But if RICO is found to have been violated, I take it it would be an extension of qualified immunity jurisprudence - -",
  "-- to, to apply it to a RICO defendant.",
  "This is the easement over the roadway.",
  "As opposed to the grazing easement.",
  "No, but the theory of the Tort Claims Act is that if the government is paying out of the treasury, it's going to see to it that its employees don't continue to commit the tort. So I don't think -- I don't think you can make the argument that it would have had no effect on the improper behavior.",
  "So are you saying that there was therefore no way short of Bivens even to challenge or even to vindicate his claim of selective prosecution.",
  "I appreciate that, but I thought you made the further claim -- maybe I misunderstood it -- that if he had gone from the administrative tribunal, or attempted to, to get into the district court, he could not have gotten into district court under the act.",
  "Could he have gone into the district court and said, I tried to make a record but they wouldn't let me; let me make a record now? Could he have done that?",
  "But what do you -- what do you say to the argument that -- that you simply cannot follow that logic ultimately, because when you get to the point of the sort of the, you know, the death by a thousand cuts, which is what they are claiming here, you can stitch up every cut, but by the time you get to a thousand, you're dead. I mean, they're making an argument that this is quantitatively so different that it is qualitatively different.",
  "Why is that a reasonable assumption in response to their argument?",
  "Well, I can understand if they unfurled the banner in a classroom that it would be disruptive, but what did it disrupt on the sidewalk?",
  "No, but I mean, that's at a level of generality that doesn't get us very far. I mean, what specifically did it disrupt? Did it disrupt the parade, did it disrupt teaching, what was it?",
  "Then if that's the rule, the school can make any rule that it wants on any subject restrictive of speech, and if anyone violates it, the result is, on your reasoning, it's disruptive under Tinker.",
  "Then I'm missing the argument.",
  "What would be disorderly? I don't understand this disorder. If somebody holds up a sign and says change the marijuana laws, why is it disruptive of anything, simply because the school quite naturally has said we support the enforcement of the law, and the law right now does forbid the use of marijuana.",
  "It's political speech, it seems to me. I don't see what it disrupts, unless disruption simply means any statement of disagreement with a position officially adopted by the school. Is that what you mean by disruption?",
  "If it's calling -- I mean --",
  "A call for a change in the law, I would have supposed, was political speech.",
  "Well, that may be, but that's not the hypo. The -- the hypothetical is, what if there is a sign or a statement in the school calling for a change in, you know, the prohibition against marijuana use? As a call for change in the law, I would suppose it was political speech. But as I understood the argument you were making, it would still be regarded as an exception, as it were, to Tinker, because it was disruptive. And it was disruptive in the sense that it disagreed with official school policy, which was to enforce the law or support the law as it was. Is that your position on what disruption means under Tinker?",
  "But don't we have to be more specific about the context in determining whether there's disruption? If it's a school trip to an art museum, unfurling a 15 foot banner in front of the pictures is clearly going to be disruptive of the object of the trip. Unfurling a banner in a classroom is going to be disruptive to the teaching of Shakespeare or whatever is supposed to be going on in there. What we have here is the unfurling of a banner on a sidewalk in a crowd with kids throwing snowballs waiting for some -- somebody to run by with a TV camera nearby. And there is a real question as to whether, it seems to me, as to whether it is in a kind of practical, real world sense, disruptive of anything. And if there is such a question, shouldn't the answer favor the right to, to make the speech as opposed to favor the right to suppress it?",
  "All right. Let me, let me follow, actually ask you the same question on -- on that. Because in response to Justice Scalia's question you said certainly that the school has got the right to have a policy that forbids violating the law and calling for violations of the law. Accepting that as a premise, don't we need, before the school may suppress the speech, don't we need at least a statement which is clearly inconsistent with that policy? And if that is so, is Bong Hits 4 Jesus inconsistent with it? It sounds like just a kid's provocative statement to me.",
  "All right. Given the fact that this is a First Amendment case, isn't a court forced into the position if it's going to be consistent with what else we have said, even at the final appellate level, of giving pretty careful scrutiny to the statement itself in determining whether it may be suppressed or punished? And if we do that, is it such a reasonable construction that this is an -- an incitement to illegal drug use? I mean it's a statement which makes, makes the drug law look a little ridiculous, I think, but I'm not sure that that is very distinguishable from a statement saying \"you ought to change the drug law.\"",
  "Do we have to give -- let me ask you this. And maybe this is the, as far as we can go with it here. Is that the answer to the question here about what the statement means?",
  "In other words, if we give deference your argument wins. But if we don't give deference, then does anybody really know what the statement means?",
  "Were they ever told what they were supposed to do in the sense did the school ever say, we are letting you out on the street to celebrate the Olympics and to do only that? Was, was there an object to this release from the school building that was ever conveyed?",
  "Does that, does that general statement that you just made apply to all circumstances in which a student-teacher relationship might be involved? For example, in the course of teaching a class in Shakespeare would your rule prevail?",
  "Yes, the general rule which the teacher is supposed clearly to have known here. For example, in the Shakespeare class, kid doesn't, doesn't say anything. He doesn't yell or scream or even raise his hand. He just holds a little sign in the Shakespeare class that says \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus.\" As I understood the general rule that you said the teacher was bound to know here, the teacher I suppose would be required or the school would be required to tolerate that sign in the Shakespeare class; is that correct?",
  "Well, would there be a substantial disruption?",
  "If the kids look around and they say, well, so and so has got his bong sign again - -",
  "-- they then return, they then return to MacBeth. Does the -- does the, does the teacher have to, does the school have to tolerate that sign in the Shakespeare class?",
  "I mean, we have had a debate here for going on 50 minutes about what Tinker means, about the proper characterization of the behavior, the nonspeech behavior. The school's terms in dealing with the kids that morning. The meaning of the, of the statement. We've been debating this in this courtroom for going on an hour, and it seems to me however you come out, there is reasonable debate. Should the teacher have known, even in the, in the calm deliberative atmosphere of the school later, what the correct answer is?",
  "May I go just back to Justice Breyer's question for a second?",
  "And I mean, I think your answer to Justice Breyer was a very good answer as a, as sort of a general statement. But in -- would you agree that in this case, if we -- if we do proceed, number one, to agree with you that Brecht is the standard, and we then do proceed to apply Brecht here or to determine whether Brecht was properly applied here, that in this particular case, the, the record indicates that the case was so close that there would have to be a finding of harmful error, or at least it would be impossible to find harmless error. Even applying Brecht clear. And you know what I'm getting at. I mean, five weeks of deliberation. The question after, whatever it was, two weeks, and four ballots, and so on. Obviously this -- this case was just to tottering on the edge. So even if we, if we do get to the point of applying Brecht, wouldn't it be impossible to say that he's -- he gets no relief under Brecht?",
  "Five, five weeks?",
  "Do you know of any other case in which the jury deliberated for five weeks?",
  "I'm sure there's an example somewhere, but I -- I practiced law for over 40 years, and I never heard of it.",
  "Otherwise, I mean, they couldn't have found it was cumulative if -- if that had not been the case.",
  "But -- on appellate review in California, they found it cumulative, didn't they?",
  "And they -- they couldn't have found that if there hadn't been some evidence on Hurtz, apart from Maples?",
  "And if Maples' testimony had come in, I presume they could have cross-examined him on the basis of Maples' testimony?",
  "Neither am I. But I draw a different conclusion from it from the one you're drawing.",
  "I mean, I cannot accept the State -- the conclusion that there was no possible prejudice, on the premises that Justice Stevens a moment ago and I a moment before sort of put out. I just do not find that a reasonable conclusion.",
  "But the reason they may have been doing that is that they may very well have thought that the evidence indicating third party guilt was close and perhaps persuasive and what they wanted to know was whether the evidence going specifically to this defendant was strong enough to overcome it.",
  "Well, do you think the Patton argument has anything to do with the evidence? I mean, the Patton argument -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the argument that referred to General Patton was an argument that, number one, talked about his addressing the troops before battle. And he was telling the troops that unfortunately it is sometimes their duty to kill. And he said: Go out there and do your duty, which I assume any reasonable listener would say, go out there and kill. If a prosecutor, as in this case, tells that story and uses that analogy, it seems to me that the argument is not an argument based on evidence, but an argument based upon the situation, the situation of the jurors vis a vis a capital defendant. And I would suppose that the reasonable inference from the argument is that they have a duty to go out there to kill, to impose the death penalty. That does not sound to me like an argument based upon the evidence specific to this defendant and specific to this case. Now, am I wrong?",
  "No, but you're -- you're saying look, he can make a general statement that we have a death penalty in part for its deterrent function, but he cannot make the argument that you ought to apply the death penalty in this case solely for deterrent reasons, i.e., reasons unanchored in the culpability of this particular defendant.",
  "Isn't there evidence that the, basically that the rise of the Wal-Marts and the Targets is correlated with the demise of fair trade? So -- that there's that correlation.",
  "We do have empirical evidence, though, don't we, that the decision of this case is going to be very significant in the sort of battle between Wal-Mart and the Main Street stores; and why should this Court in effect take a shot in the dark at resolving that, as distinct from leaving it to Congress, which is in a position to know more about where the shot is going to land than we are?",
  "That's my point. But it seems to me there is a body of some empirical evidence that the success of the Wal-Marts and the Targets and the Home Depots was a success which was correlated with the elimination of price maintenance by the States.",
  "They began, but they have flourished in the post-fair trade era.",
  "But doesn't that answer your argument that there isn't reason to believe that there is going to be disruption if Dr. Miles goes, because now it's going to be easy?",
  "Isn't it fair to say that there is reason to believe that there may be a massive reorientation in the retail economy if Dr. Miles goes? And that gets to my problem, why should we be the people to make a guess as opposed to the Congress as the institution to make the guess?",
  "Mr. Mancino, I take it that what you are really proposing is sort of a rule that if -- if counsel could reasonably be misled to overlook the mistake by the court, that your reliance upon the court's mistake should -- should, in fact, be respected. It's kind of a rule of reasonably misleading; is that about right?",
  "I mean, that's how we distinguish your case on your view from the case in which you get 180 days instead of 14?",
  "Let's take it a step further. Let's assume it isn't recognized. Assume he gets his habeas relief, and three years later some eager beaver is culling through the records and says, this guy never should have been in court. Do they rearrest him and put him into prison?",
  "Mr. Stewart, should we repudiate the unique circumstances doctrine?",
  "Well, the unique circumstances doctrine is one circumstance in which courts, say yeah, you can excuse it.",
  "But on the grounds for which they have been taken as authority, is it your view that we should repudiate those grounds?",
  "Doesn't, doesn't the statute specifically provide for -- for exactly this possibility? Doesn't both the '33 and the '34 act have a saving other remedies clause?",
  "Was it -- were those two clauses expressly limited to state law remedies?",
  "But do they have to?",
  "None of the claims includes an antitrust claim on its face.",
  "Well, we think -- we think they don't apply to antitrust, and in Gordon and NASD those same provisions were in place but that didn't deter the Court from finding them - -",
  "What is the particular difference between supporting the price and rigging the aftermarket? I mean, how do we tell that at the 12(b)(6)?",
  "No, but we haven't had this problem focus before, and isn't primary jurisdiction the most efficient answer to the problem that we've got? In other words, isn't it time to do something different?",
  "But isn't the difference between Matsushita and this particular case at least as you are presenting this case, the -- the -- focused on the strength of this exclusion of innocent conduct? As, as I recall Matsushita, there -- there had to be at that stage, there had to be evidence from which one could infer that the -- that the conduct was not innocent; but you're arguing for something stronger than that. You're arguing for, in effect, an -- an ultimate conclusion that excludes innocent conduct. And aren't you asking for more than just what Matsushita did at -- at that later stage?",
  "But -- but Matsushita as I recall did not require it to rise beyond the level of a plausible inference. And I think you're arguing for something stronger than that. And I think the language of Congress forces you to do it but I -- I'm just finding it difficult to conclude -- to equate the plausibility standard in, in Matsushita with the strong inference standard here. If you - -",
  "Why don't we simply assume that the read most favorable to the plaintiff rule is still in place, but that reading it most favorably to the plaintiff, it must rise to the level of supporting the strong inference?",
  "Well, but I was using the word inference to -- to refer to some reasoning process based upon what is stated. Not on assumptions favorable to the plaintiff. And if inference is to tie -- is, is a term that is tied to what is alleged, then I don't see any - - any contradiction between reading those allegations most favorably, but saying the statute in each statute requires that the -- that the total force of the inference rise to the level of strength that you speak of.",
  "Are you entitled to consider the brush strokes that are not there as well as the subsidiary brush strokes that are? In Justice Alito's example, if the pleadings don't point out that the Library of Congress and the Capitol are also up on this hill, is the judge at the motions stage entitled to consider that?",
  "Okay. Then that is engaging in something more than construing the pleadings most favorably to the plaintiff.",
  "What do you think about that? There are at least some circumstances, then, in which there this is kind of critical assessment function that you concede must go on, rather than simply a piling favorable inference onto favorable inference to see if it gets to the strong points.",
  "That is -- that is an argument for the weight of considering motive rather than the relevance of the motive consideration per se.",
  "Mr. Frederick, are you going to get to the 1447(d) problem?",
  "But at the point it was acting it was remanding, and its basis for remanding was not that it thought the removal had been proper; the basis for its remanding was that it said it lacked jurisdiction over three of the other cross defendants.",
  "It may have been, leaving aside the question of whether it was right or wrong, it may have been wrong. But what it thought it was doing it seems to me is fairly clearly remanding for a jurisdictional reason.",
  "Then what you are really arguing for is, in effect, a separate rule, and that is that 1447(d) has an exception when we are dealing with foreign sovereign immunities.",
  "But the trouble with the principal submission, it seems to me, is that we have said that even if the district court has come to an erroneous conclusion about jurisdiction, if it understands that it is making a jurisdictional ruling, that is not appealable.",
  "Regardless of how they would get up on it, assuming they could get up on the immunity question, our series of questions is why do we draw or why should we draw a distinction between immunity and federal bench trial? And your answer is, I take it, immunity is dispositive; Federal bench tribal is not?",
  "And in effect he would say -- I mean, I assume what the clever lawyer would say is, State court, cannot try me at all. The feds can do what they want about remand and it gets back here. But because I'm entitled to a bench trial, you cannot try me at all. Isn't that the argument?",
  "And ultimately when the two clever parties got to the State supreme court, they would have these two opposing issues and ultimately if we granted cert this Court would decide it, wouldn't it.",
  "They were not treated as covered enterprises.",
  "No, but the point is why can't it be?",
  "Doesn't the ESA require something more than voluntary cooperation? I mean, you quite rightly emphasize the mandatory nature of the approval under the Clean Water Act. But the Endangered Species Act mandate seems equally unconditional.",
  "I realize that that's your point. But doesn't that sort of beg the question? Because it's not that anyone is suggesting here, I think, that under the Endangered Species Act the Federal Government can keep control or that the Federal Government can in effect provide guarantees of what may happen in response to some future development proposal. What I think they're arguing is that when, when, when the agency gives the approval, it should require that there be some kind of procedure in place on the part of the State so that when problems arise the States will probably respond to them with the same values in mind that the feds would. And the question is why cannot the Endangered Species Act be enforced in that way, to require, in effect, an advanced mechanism before, in effect, the whole business is turned over to the States?",
  "I know you say you don't think they can do it. But the problem is we've got two statutes each of which is mandatory. And your response seems to be, well, we'll give full effect to one and we will ignore the other. And I don't see how that is a tie breaker. And why do you not have an obligation to do what you can with respect to the Endangered Species Act?",
  "At which point EPA doesn't have any authority left under the Clean Water Act.",
  "That begs the question because the concern is the enforcement of the Endangered Species Act.",
  "Why don't they get that in the memorandum of agreement up front?",
  "Maybe it doesn't, but isn't it the case that if it's in the agreement up front the odds are better that the State will address it, as opposed to the State ignoring the problem, requiring EPA then to take affirmative action to object?",
  "Is there an obligation on the part of the State agency to take reasonable action in response to them, or can the State agency simply sit there, listen with a tin ear and then do whatever it wants to?",
  "You are in effect saying that the, that the, that the enforcement of water quality standards is, in effect, the indirect answer to the problem that the other side raises? That's the way it's done?",
  "Which is the -- the later act is the Endangered Species Act?",
  "Why doesn't that control?",
  "No, but you can just as well say that if it does not control then there is an exception by implication, the exception being based on the prior act. Neither of them is particularly satisfactory, but neither answer gives you a reason to ignore the problem.",
  "Well, but by that very reasoning you could say that if assurance are required that the Endangered Species Act is going to be honored, that does not in and of itself prevent any development program. Each, in effect, is a kind of mechanism for dealing with something that may happen in the future.",
  "Just as a technical matter, don't they have to show there's no jeopardy?",
  "May I ask you to follow up on that? A few minutes -- I guess your time is getting short and I'd like to get away from some of the specifics and back to the general. A minute ago, Justice Breyer in effect offered you an opinion and he spelled it out and he said, if I put that in writing is that what you want? You said, well, it's really more than we need. Would you please at this point summarize as succinctly as you can what you need to win this case?",
  "No, tell me substantively, what do you want? What substantively do you want at the end of this case?",
  "And how will they put those mechanisms in legal form?",
  "Justice Scalia's got a fair point. What if the States say, we don't want a memorandum of agreement? What does the Federal Government do at that point? Doesn't the Federal Government at that point say, okay, we're not going to issue the transfer under Clean Water because we have an independent obligation under Endangered Species and there's got to be both or there will be neither? Isn't that the Federal Government's position?",
  "Counsel, may I ask you one thing, which I have assumed, and I think it is correct, but I'd like to be sure of it. Is it the case, is it correct, that prior to the voir dire questions, no one had given a statement to the venire people of what the law was with respect to the imposition of the death penalty; is that correct?",
  "Were they told what the - - I forget how many factors are enumerated under the Washington law? Were they told what they were?",
  "Okay.",
  "I take it your position is that if the State courts had made or had expressed no conclusion other than the final conclusion that he is impaired, that that conclusion itself would be entitled to AEDPA deference if the record could be read to support it; is that correct?",
  "If that's the case, then AEDPA deference is more than deference, isn't it? AEDPA deference has reached on your view the conclusion that if there is any factual support in a record, the ultimate conclusion of the court will be upheld, whereas I thought AEDPA deference went to factfinding and to express conclusions that the court drew.",
  "But the trial judge made no conclusion about demeanor. He didn't say anything about demeanor, did he?",
  "If we're going to get - - that takes -- it seems to me it takes deference yet one further step. We're saying that even if there is nothing on the record about demeanor, we are supposed to assume that a trial judge drew a conclusion based on demeanor. I mean, that is not deference. I mean, that's simply imputing fiction.",
  "Why is it the defense counsel's obligation to object? It seems to me that if the State is objecting, saying I want this juror removed, and the trial judge is saying, okay, I will remove him, that there is an obligation to make a record.",
  "Wouldn't there be? I guess my point is if there isn't, then in effect you are making the defendant responsible for creating a record to support what the other side asks for.",
  "But that means that the, that the argument for sustaining the trial judge's action on the ground that the trial judge could observe demeanor in effect is the elimination of judicial review on that subject, because we know that if the venire person was present in the courtroom and the judge was present in the courtroom, the judge probably looked at him, and if that is enough to sustain judicial action on the grounds that we defer to demeanor then there's no judicial review at all. I think that's what Judge Kozinski said.",
  "I'm talking about demeanor. I'm talking about demeanor. And there's nothing as I understand it on the record about demeanor.",
  "And if there is no requirement that there be anything on the record about demeanor, then there is no judicial review on that point at all, is there?",
  "And the question - -",
  "Is there any way that he can show that demeanor didn't make a difference when the record is absolutely silent on demeanor? Is there any way he can show that?",
  "Is there anything in this record to indicate that the judge did rely on demeanor?",
  "But he had not been given, as I understand it, the explanation of what the -- I keep saying nine factors. Whatever the enumerated State factors were. He had not been told that at any point, had he?",
  "Yeah, but the -- the questioning was what grounds are you going to look to make that decision; and he had not been instructed on Washington law on that at all.",
  "What do we make of what I understand was the court's post hoc statement that what was -- the reason for issuing the temporary injunction was the perception that there was a content basis at work? And what do we make of it in light of the fact - - I think this is of record; you correct me if I'm wrong. what do we make of that in light of the fact that I believe it is in the record that I forget the appropriate State official said, well, it's true we've let you do this in the past, but this is political or this looks political, which suggests that there was a content basis going on? What do we make of the court's statement and the record statement by the official in deciding whether there really was in effect a separate kind of order involved in the preliminary injunction from the order that was denied at the end of the case?",
  "Oh, I know that. I know that.",
  "Because that's why I asked, what do we make of the court's statement subsequently?",
  "Is that so when there is some evidence in the record that a content basis actually was the criterion?",
  "Now the 2001 order was it -- was it? She applied, I think it was in - -",
  "Yeah.",
  "So the factual answer in effect is there isn't enough fact to support the distinction?",
  "Yeah. But when you got to the summary judgment stage, the particular peace demonstration performance was -- was behind them. So they're, I'm not sure that it would have been expected to be reinjected into the case.",
  "So it wasn't moot after the demonstration.",
  "Okay, but the argument is undercut, as you yourself say, by the settlement rule. Don't we have the settlement rule simply because we want to promote settlements? We don't want litigation to go on and on and on simply because somebody wants to establish a right to attorney's fees. And doesn't that same reasoning apply here when there is a preliminary injunction and that's all the person wants. By the same reasoning that we accept a settlement, why shouldn't we accept a preliminary injunction as being a sufficient determination of rights to justify fees because we don't want it to go on and on and on when nobody has any issue of substance involved, but is just litigating for the sake of establishing a right to fees later?",
  "But the only attorney's fees that would be assessed would be attorney's fees attributable to the preliminary injunction.",
  "They have been found subject to a preliminary injunction. The playing field is no longer even.",
  "But it does mean, it does mean that somebody with a burden to establish an entitlement to the injunction has carried the burden.",
  "Then let's not have it in the settlement case.",
  "Because the TRO case, characteristically the other side isn't heard, so you haven't prevailed.",
  "Ms. Mahoney, on that point, can I just take you back to square one for a second? I'm with you in your explanation that the speech at issue here probably was fairly understood as being for, you know, the communication here as being a violation of the rule. Could you, though, tell me, would it have been -- I guess I have two questions. Would it have been a violation of the rule if the coach had sent the letter to eighth grade students in the school itself, those who were already formally enrolled and who might be going out for football the next fall? And number two, what is exactly the interest in preventing recruiting, as you describe it, when the letters are aimed at people who have already signed, I think you referred to it as, an enrollment contract? So there's every reason to believe they're going to be in that school next year. What is the interest? And would that interest have supported a ban on letters to the already enrolled eighth grade kids?",
  "Okay, so they had signed up to go to Brentwood. So where does the recruiting come in?",
  "So it boils down to saying that when they've signed the enrollment contract that's not the end of the, in effect, the issue.",
  "And there is a sensible practical way in which recruiting goes on even among those who have signed up. Okay.",
  "Mr. Blumstein, it seems to me that Ms. Mahoney addressed that in response to a question from me. I said, in effect, that once a student has signed an enrollment contract, where is there any recruiting going on? And she said there is recruiting, and hence there is an interest in regulating recruiting, because not everybody who signs these contracts, or on behalf of whom those contracts are signed, end up going to the school. So that in fact, there is room for recruiting right up to the moment that the kid arrives in the fall and signs on the dotted line. What is your response to her response?",
  "Well, how many cases have there got to be before you would recognize the sufficiency of the asserted state interest?",
  "Well, we know that. They've signed the contract. So that's where we start. And you're saying, well, only about 5 percent of them weasel out of it later on and go to some other school. But why is 5 percent insufficient?",
  "So that if the kid comes and says, look, I'm going to Brentwood next fall and I'd like to tag along to a spring practice, they say okay. But that's not recruiting. The school hasn't initiated it. In this case, the school has initiated it by the letter. And it does sound like recruiting if you accept the proposition that the students aren't bound to go to the school even though their parents signed up and some of them don't. So I come back to my question. If taking your figure -- let's assume that only 5 percent, in fact, change their minds. Why doesn't -- why isn't there a legitimate interest in preventing recruiting within the 5 percent?",
  "Yeah, but would you answer my question? Why isn't that enough?",
  "Okay. It certainly can do that. There's no question about it. But it seems to me that the line that is being drawn is a line between contact which is initiated by the prospective student and proselytizing which is initiated by the school. Why isn't that a reasonable line?",
  "That's not what we've got before us.",
  "Okay. We're still talking about athletic contact.",
  "Okay. Maybe that would present a different kind of problem, but that's not what we've got here. What we've got here is contact through speech that was initiated by the coach.",
  "And I am saying that if the rule generally -- maybe quite imprecisely -- but if it generally distinguishes between that kind of proselytizing by a coach, and on the other hand contact that a kid initiates in the first place, isn't that roughly a fair line?",
  "The activity being tagging along to spring practice?",
  "But the answer to that is, they're not trying to prevent people, at least under this rule, they're not trying to prevent 8th grade kids from going to spring practice. They're trying to prevent coaches from proselytizing kids, and that's the distinction. Why isn't it a reasonable distinction?",
  "So your position basically is that \"petition\" hear means petition that could have been brought. This couldn't have because up to this point there was nothing that was justiciable; is that - -",
  "-- the textual argument?",
  "All right. Let me ask you this specific question. Let's assume that the individual understands that both the necessary and the sufficient condition for his execution was his conviction of the crime. He also believes that they probably wouldn't actually execute him except that they are persecuting him, in this case for his Christian advocacy. Does that person who understands the necessary and sufficient condition for execution, but believes something else is afoot in the motivations of those who are going to execute him, does that person have a -- what you call a rational understanding such that he may be executed?",
  "It's more than -- in my hypothetical, it's more than a purported reason. He understands what the law is. The law is if you're convicted of this crime, that enough -- is that -- that will -- and sentenced to death at the penalty phase, that is alone sufficient and in fact a required condition for your execution. Why can't that person, even though he thinks some ulterior motivation is what's really driving the executioner, why can't that person prepare for death just as well as the -- I won't say just as well, but why can that person not prepare for death just as he would prepare for death if he were not suffering from the persecution delusion?",
  "Well, do you claim in this case that he does not understand that he was convicted of committing a crime or that he thinks he didn't commit a crime?",
  "If that's the case, then every person who believes he's innocent of the crime is at least a candidate for the rule that you're asking for.",
  "You mean we can't predict that the delusion today is the same delusion yesterday? Is that what you're saying?",
  "Well, it's taken a specific form because the circumstance is different. He was being tried yesterday. He's going to be executed today. But it's the same delusion, and it seems to me that Justice Ginsburg's issue is a kind of a proper issue even though the event on which he focuses has changed.",
  "Yes, but that's a silly fiction. You're not reopening a claim. We can use any kind of language we want. The fact is that when he first raised it he didn't have a claim which bore a close enough relationship to the time of execution. When he was able to raise the claim that bore enough of a relationship, it was a freestanding claim itself. It seems to me that to say, well, he's simply reopening something that he reopened before is just playing with words.",
  "Yes, but you can deal with the text of this. I mean, given the fact that there's no neat satisfactory solution to this no matter where we turn, the -- at least the text of the statute can be read to say that second successive petition at least means a petition when it raises -- refers to a petition in which a claim could previously have been brought. And if we say, look, unripe claims can't be brought at an earlier time, then it's not a second and successive petition in that sense. That's one way to you know - - admittedly, it's interpretive, but it's one way to deal with the text. It's kind of a -- it seems to me more forthright than saying, well, he's just continuing or reviving the claim that he raised the first time around.",
  "Then what do you say to the indication from those two exceptions that Congress simply wasn't adverting to this problem?",
  "Has. Has. He doesn't have the claim at that first point.",
  "You in effect are telling us that we've got to read this to mean that any claim that he could conceivably have under any set of conceivable circumstances has got to be raised on the first petition with these two exceptions, and that in effect is a formula for frivolous pleading and, I mean, Congress couldn't have intended that.",
  "And I don't know that he's disputing that. I thought his dispute was there's got to be some means for us to respond to what was a new issue as a result of the reports of the two court-appointed experts, the issue of malingering. And I don't know that he's saying it's got to come in one way or another way, but there's got to be a means at least to respond to that new issue. What's your answer to that?",
  "Mr. Cruz, may I just go back to the suggestion that there be, in effect, a remand to the State court. If we accept that proposition, then we are turning the United States district court in effect into an appellate court reviewing the State judgment and the State action, and that certainly is not what habeas is.",
  "No, but it's acting, it's acting in its own right. Some of the factual record that it must be concerned with is determined by what happened in the State courts; but it's not reviewing the State court as an appellate court would do. But if it can remand and say, you didn't do enough for whatever reason, it seems to me it's exercising the equivalent of appellate jurisdiction.",
  "Sure.",
  "At page 42 of the appendix, all -- all there is is a subsection 1.",
  "But you don't know how much to pay, do you? I mean, when they send you the notice they don't send a notice that says, we're looking into this and we think you're going to end up owing $5,000, do they? They don't give you a figure.",
  "Do they name a figure at all - -",
  "-- when they give you the initial notice?",
  "That's true. That's true. But you can make that argument. That argument, if you accepted it, would be an argument for having no amendment to subsection (h) at all.",
  "And the question is, why is the grace confined to some taxpayers and not to others?",
  "They've said it if we accept your view of the exclusivity of the amendment to (h).",
  "It's worthless. Okay. Now I guess, if you can't keep the poor person out for such a reason then you can't keep the rich person out for that reason. So you tell me what the rationale is in keeping the rich person out any more than the poor person. They have the same claim, same amount, same cause. The cause, by the way, was that some bureaucrat in the IRS forgot to send a notice so nobody knew what was happening. That was the cause. And the reason it didn't get abated is because a different bureaucrat got mixed up, okay? Same claims.",
  "No. The standard of discretion is the same for the poor and the rich, isn't it? The only difference is that the poor can get into court and the rich cannot.",
  "So it's a question of remedy, not standing.",
  "Who were the PRPs, or who are the individuals other than PRPs who are likely to, to avail themselves to the cause of action under Section 7? That's one of the problems I have. I mean, it's got to be someone other than owners of the land now, owners of the land then. I mean, who's going to bring these actions?",
  "But can you give me an idea of generally - -",
  "That's not -- you know, that's not a private party within the meaning of the quotation.",
  "Pardon?",
  "Well, it's not the United States of America, but we wouldn't normally refer to it as a private party. And -- but I don't mean to get tied up in that, but can you think of any individuals or corporations who are not likely to come in to one of the four categories in 7 who would, who would take advantage of this?",
  "No I realize that. I'm trying to - -",
  "No. Those are people who would have a defense under the later sections of - - subsections of Section 7. They are still people who would fall within the first four categories.",
  "Well, you know that when they go into court. Let's assume they bring the action and the answer is well, you fall into one of the categories one through four, and the person says oh, but I -- I'm not liable because ultimately I will have an innocent party defense. Would we then have a collateral trial on the innocent party defense in -- in the cause of action for, for reimbursement?",
  "But I mean if that would be the first issue, we'd have to try the innocence of the person who was bringing the action?",
  "Well the -- the trouble with having, I mean the trouble with that approach is that whatever you, whatever may be the ultimate effect of subsection (b) is referred to as defenses. And the way you're using it the so-called defenses would be an -- an affirmative element in the action for, for, for cost reimbursement with is just -- and I mean it certainly at the least would involve a very odd language usage in the statute.",
  "Well, what about the - - what about the statement in the red brief that -- that there is presently in existence a directive that EPA not proceed against any Federal agency?",
  "Well, excuse me. Are cases that you referred to cases in which EPA has gone against a -- we'll say a third party polluter, but the Government is also involved?",
  "Okay. Now, has EPA during the pendency of that directive gone directly against any Federal agency?",
  "No.",
  "All right - -",
  "What if, what if one of the PRPs they so identify is the Department of Defense?",
  "Do they have to get the Attorney General's approval before doing that? Before naming the Department of Defense?",
  "However they initiate, I don't know as a matter of procedure how they initiate enforcement action - -",
  "It's by that letter - -",
  "Do they need the Attorney General's approval to send the letter?",
  "What if, what the Department of Defense says \"nothing doing\"? What does EPA do then?",
  "Well, what does it do about the Department of Defense?",
  "In my hypo, the Department of Defense says you know, we are not talking with you.",
  "Maybe it does. But let's just talk about EPA. What does EPA do in the case that, when Defense stonewalls?",
  "And at that point 113 would kick in - -",
  "-- regardless of Defense?",
  "But in -- in response to your -- going back to your response to Justice Breyer, I take it the -- the right under -- under 107 was affected to the extent, or at least you would agree that it was affected to the extent that if there is a settlement they are home free and there can't be a 107 action; is that correct?",
  "Okay. So it disturbed the old scheme to that extent.",
  "So the only thing they would need the Attorney General's approval for would be institution of suit?",
  "Could they institute suit?",
  "Well, are you saying then that in a case in which the bus is stopped, the car is stopped and so on, the role for the test about whether a reasonable person would regard himself as free to leave is a test to determine when the, when the seizure ends, as distinct from when the seizure begins?",
  "There's no other role for that test.",
  "Yeah, but you're taking the position that whenever you are in a vehicle that is stopped, you are seized?",
  "Well, but why -- why doesn't plain view kick in just as readily, once it is conceded as it has to be, that at the point that he was making the arrest, the officer was acting lawfully? And if he was acting lawfully when he made the arrest, why doesn't he get the benefit of the plain view doctrine to the extent that he saw any evidence before him at that point? And I take it the plain view exception would at least cover the, I forget what it was, but the materials that were in the, in the passenger well of the passenger car, that -- that were known to be used as a source of, of ingredients for making methamphetamine?",
  "No, I realize. But we've got -- we've got a choice here, I mean, I think Justice Kennedy's questions brought this out. We've got a choice here of two ways to look at the State action at the moment of -- of the arrest. One way to look at it would be to say it was a product of an unlawful stop. Another way to look at it would be to say it was an act of executing a validly issued warrant. And you concede that they at least could lawfully have executed the arrest, they didn't have the arrest warrant but there was an arrest warrant issued for them and they could lawfully execute that warrant and arrest him at that point. Let's assume that those are our two choices. On choice number one the State, the police officer, is acting someplace where he shouldn't have been. On choice number two, the parole violator, your client, is in a place where he shouldn't have been because he should have been arrested and he should have been back behind bars at that point. If we have a choice between those two ways of looking at the case, why don't we for any purpose, give the casting vote to the lawfulness of the arrest, to the warrant which was issued by a neutral and detached magistrate at some point? And if we do that, then why isn't not only a search incident to an arrest, but the seizure of materials which were in plain view at the moment of that arrest, subject to a -- an admissibility rule?",
  "Okay. But it was, it was a warrant that was lawful for Fourth Amendment purposes, is that conceded?",
  "Okay.",
  "All right.",
  "Well, all right, but you're simply saying we give, we put the greatest emphasis on act A, stopping the car rather than act B, lawfully arresting, regardless of the legality of stopping the car.",
  "But do we, do we have do we have in any of the cases -- I, frankly I don't recall. I remember Brown but I don't think there was anything in Brown comparable to the lawful authority to arrest independent of the stop. And -- and that's what makes this case unusual. And -- and if we emphasize the lawfulness of the arrest, quite independent of the circumstances of the stop, and we also bear in mind that the point of the exclusionary rule is -- is to deter police conduct, and you've got another priority here, the driver, who can invoke the exclusionary rule and deter police misconduct. I don't see where the interest would lie in, or where the justification would lie, in our saying we've got to put, as it were all the eggs in the basket of the unlawful stop, as opposed to the basket of the lawful arrest.",
  "It seems to me that you're, you're blending two tests together, and tell me if I'm wrong. One test is there is no question that if the police get control over people, those people are not free to go.",
  "And those are the motion cases. The most extreme example being the -- the roadblock. Hodari D, did they -- you know, they were trying to catch him but did they actually get to the point of a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes? Then you got another category of cases in which there is no question that someone is stopped, that a police officer can exercise control, and that control if so exercised is certainly going to be seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes. But we don't know whether the officer really is exercising control, so we ask the question would a reasonable person in the position of the individual stopped have believed that he was free to go? Aren't those two quite distinct tests? The first test assumes the answer to the question in the second test. The second test assumes the answer to the first test, i.e., they're stopped, subject to control. Aren't they two independent tests?",
  "Okay. So you were engaging in shorthand? You, you accept the analytical distinction but you say look, in the real world once you stop, we -- we know how the person would have felt?",
  "A reasonable person would have felt.",
  "No, but aren't -- you are saying, I thought by agreeing with you what you were saying was once the car is stopped, a reasonable person under those circumstances would not have felt free to leave.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, then you're -- you're blending the two tests together again.",
  "You have either got to accept their analytical distinction or not.",
  "Well, consistent with that answer, consistent with that answer, what we're concerned with in these cases is not, in cases like this, is not literally the moment of the stop, but the moment of the stop plus one. And in cases like this the -- I take it you concede the question is would the passenger, would a reasonable passenger in, in that situation feel free to leave. And in the absence of a hypothetical like Justice Alito's in which the loudspeaker says, all I want is the driver, passenger is free to go, and so on, absent something like that, what is the argument that the, that a reasonable person in the passenger seat would feel free to open the door and traipse off?",
  "Have you ever been stopped? Have you ever been subject to a traffic stop?",
  "Okay. The heart rate went up. The blood pressure went up. But - -",
  "Don't you think that a reasonable passenger at that point would assume that the officer is in control and that, in the absence of some affirmative indication that the passenger can go, that he's supposed to sit there until this thing gets over with? Isn't that the reasonable response of a passenger?",
  "Mr. Zall, assume, and I realize you don't assume, but assume for the sake of argument, that, that there is a seizure here. What's the significance of the arrest warrant, or -- yes, I guess there was a warrant as I understand it, although it was not on the person of the officer who stopped the car. Is that correct?",
  "Okay. What's the significance of that for the outcome of this case?",
  "But don't we have two problems if we go to that stage? The first one is we would be applying a test that was not applied by the court we're reviewing. And number two, correct me if I'm wrong, but the, the -- assuming you win, as it were, on the general point about the significance of the, of the arrest warrant, there are still going to be questions about the suppression of the evidence because there are going to be questions about whether the legality of the arrest on that theory suffices to justify the seizure of the evidence. You recall the colloquy I had with opposing counsel about the possibility of applying a plain view test here. Aren't those issues that should all be decided in the first instance in the State courts?",
  "No, but that's I think our sticking point. If the, if the plan sponsor decides to purchase an annuity, it's accepted I think by you and by everybody that there are two decisions being made. Decision one is terminate the plan. Decision two, distribute the assets by purchasing an annuity that gives the beneficiaries what they should get. And so on. But when we come to the question of merger, you're saying there's only one decision, and I think that's where I'm having trouble with your argument. When we come to the question of merger, it seems to me there are two decisions again. The first decision is we're going to terminate the plan that we've got. What do we do with our assets. We have decided to merge - - one possible decision as an alternative to annuities is to merge the plan with, with another one. Why aren't there two decisions in the merger case just as there are two decisions in the annuity case?",
  "Why do you say that's the threshold question? I thought the threshold question is whether to terminate what we've got now.",
  "If they say, look, we're not ending our plan. Let's assume you have an ongoing business and they say, we're just sick of the form that it's in now and we can get a good deal by letting somebody else administer this, so we're going to merge. I can see that as a single decision. But that's not what you've got here. As I understand it, the decision to terminate was made, it was over and done with. The question was what are they going to do with these assets? It's at that point that PACE arrived and said: Give them to us through a merger. I don't see how you eliminate the, the termination decision before the merger decision.",
  "The form of the plan is going to be zero. Our plan is over. We are terminating our plan. What do we do now? We have two choices roughly, maybe three. We can either buy annuities, we can give the assets to the beneficiaries or we can give the assets to PACE in the form of a merger.",
  "Are you saying you can't have a merger of a plan that has already been terminated, so that the merger decision is necessarily a decision that has to be made before the termination - - before a termination decision.",
  "That's what I keep suggesting.",
  "Why isn't exactly the same point true with respect to purchasing annuities?",
  "What if the plan document doesn't say anything about what will follow termination. There is nothing in there about annuities. Is the annuity -- the decision to purchase annuities a decision subject to fiduciary obligation.",
  "The decision to -- to take the option of purchasing annuities or offering annuities to the beneficiaries, that is a fiduciary decision.",
  "If the plan is silent.",
  "What if they say, we will distribute by going to the top of the building and throwing the money out on the street. Fiduciary problem?",
  "No. Reserve your time.",
  "Then why are we having this argument? Why isn't it simply a question of construing the provision for options in the original plan.",
  "Then why isn't - -",
  "Then why isn't the simple argument, you can't merge because the plan didn't provide that as an option.",
  "Was that position presented, I should have asked you - -",
  "So we've got to assume that the plan is silent in the sense that, insofar as the plan documents are concerned, merger is at least a possibility.",
  "Then why doesn't the administrator here take the position that it's going to reserve the five million for itself and merge what's left? If PACE wants a merger with what's left, fine; if PACE doesn't, end of problem?",
  "My question is why -- why isn't it an option here to say all right, number one, we got a $5 million surplus. We are going to terminate this plan and we are going to take the five million. Question number two, should we, should we use what's left to merge into the PACE plan? Is that an option?",
  "By doing it in that sequence could it reserve the five million for itself?",
  "If we assume that, can they keep the five million?",
  "I don't care how they make it; I just want to know under the terms of the plan and consistently with ERISA, could they keep the five million and in some sequence provide for a merger with PACE? And I think you're telling me yes.",
  "Okay. But what about the employees who are on board at the time the merger decision is made? Are you saying that an, an employer who continues to operate can say, I'm going to merge my sound plan, I'm sick of having to worry about it, I'm going to merge this financially sound plan into plan A out here, which is very, very shaky, and I know perfectly well that plan A, you know, may very well collapse, but I don't care. I just want to get rid of what I have. Is that an option for the plan sponsor?",
  "And you're saying in this case, this is sort of the square one question that I want to be clear on. You're saying in this case simply that the employer had to give consideration to PACE's proposal rather than cutting off consideration, we presume in part, because of the issue of the $5 million. It had to think about it some more. Is that correct?",
  "Okay.",
  "What if the plan, the plan provides that in the event of a merger there will in fact be a reversion to the employees, if they've paid in too much or to, or to the sponsor if the sponsor has overfunded, and there will be no merger except on those terms? Is that enforceable?",
  "If the plan document says look, if we decide to merge, anybody who has paid in more than he has to, employee or employer, gets the money back or there's no merger. In other words it's going to be the terms of the merger that there is a reversion. Can a plan provide for that?",
  "Had the State Department taken a position at that point, at the time the Act was passed?",
  "So the only thing they would have to do I suppose -- you've mentioned the due process point -- would be to perhaps give a hearing before the lien was declared and that would be enough?",
  "Well, provided that, provided notice of hearing was offered, the parking ticket lien would be in the same position as this lien, right -- the hearing.",
  "May, may I just ask, for a kind of a footnote kind of question? I mean you referred again to the text. And if we are going to go on a very strict reading of the text as I understand it, you don't have to claim a right in property, you have to have a claim in -- in which someone's rights in immovable property are in issue. So whether the, the - - and so long as you create a cloud on the title, however that cloud is classified, it puts in issue the title of the named title holder, so that the debates about the distinction between a lien and easement and so forth is essentially irrelevant as long as it's a cloud on the title. If we are going to be that, if we are going to be literal, isn't that so?",
  "Yeah.",
  "Is it only the case that the, that the only instances in which, consistent with the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act the State could say you get the house, would be instances of litigation arising out of commercial activity?",
  "Yeah.",
  "May I ask you a question in your remaining time. With respect to the statute that authorizes the, the charge against foreign aid, would that statute have any application except either in a commercial case or a case like yours?",
  "Okay.",
  "That's right. You can go directly.",
  "So in practical terms, with the possible exception of a counterclaim, the foreign aid setoff would simply apply to a case like this, then?",
  "I was going to say, if you deny all the statutes you've got to - -",
  "Isn't there a further problem here, though, that the order of the district court gave no explanation? We have no way of knowing exactly why the court ruled the way it did, and for that reason the appeal, the review, was that the original appeal was taken properly to the court of appeals, so that we are here not on appellate jurisdiction, but cert jurisdiction, if at all.",
  "Well, there'S no direct appeal. We have appellate jurisdiction only if there's a direct appeal and there's no direct appeal. This is coming from the court of appeals.",
  "What pages are the text of 412 set out on? You're going to have to help me here.",
  "I realize, before you leave that I realize that on a jurisdictional issue like that we have an obligation to raise it ourselves. But I'm - - I'm -- I'm curious, was -- was jurisdiction contested in that case?",
  "Wouldn't they get into - - no, you.",
  "Well why doesn't it matter who the defendant is? Because I don't, this so-called office of Senator Mark Dayton is a construct that I understand, and there is no immunity problem there. But if, if that office is gone now and getting to your hypothesis, if the, if -- if the true party is the Senate of the United States, has there been any unequivocal waiver of immunity with respect to the entire Senator or the Senate of the United States as an institution?",
  "I'm Justice Souter.",
  "You're very flattering.",
  "Yes, but I was just going to say if this case continues we've got to accept the proposition that the Office of Senator Mark Dayton is still a, some kind of an entity that has got to be accorded reality by the judiciary, right.",
  "Yes, but at this point that's silly. There's no Senator. There's no office in any sense.",
  "Is it unequivocal?",
  "I mean, when it's done on the basis of this fiction, is that what we should accept as an unequivocal waiver?",
  "Yes, but what if the Senator doesn't want to put it in? I mean, what if he does not want to waive the privilege? Is his only choice in effect to sit moot and lose the case?",
  "\"Mute\" I guess I should have said.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, why don't, why doesn't that -- why doesn't being placed in that dilemma in effect implicate the clause, and why can't he invoke the clause as a basis for dismissal?",
  "Well, yes, so far as the member's immediate financial concern, they took care of it. But I'm not sure about the careful way. They in effect said, you know, if this gets into Speech or Debate Clause issues they prevail. And that kind of just leaves us with no solution for the problem that Justice Stevens raised and that I'm concerning with, unless there's, there's going to be an automatic dismissal when the member says, look, I cannot respond to this without getting into, into acts within the legislative process which are privileged. Unless you want to recognize that as kind of an absolute defense upon its invocation, I don't see how we get out of the problem.",
  "And there's no jurisdiction under 412 because?",
  "But it will -- the money is simply Senate money.",
  "But none of those funds are, as I understand it, are somehow subtracted from or contributed by the funds of individual senatorial offices while a Senator is in office. I am assuming that those, that there is a separate appropriation for the payment of -- of any such judgment, is that correct?",
  "Okay. In the real world then at this point isn't the Senate the -- the party?",
  "Did the FTC ever adopt a regulation saying you've got publish these measurements?",
  "But if one of the companies had said, we're sick of doing this, we don't like the numbers we're getting, whatever, we're just not going to do it, presumably if we, you know, accept that testimony at face value, the FTC would have moved and said, okay, I guess we're going to have to have a reg or a statute or what-not. During that period of time, the company wouldn't be committing any offense?",
  "What is this -- I'm just not following it. What is the source of the so-called \"FTC number\" to which advertising must conform?",
  "The Cambridge test, yes.",
  "I understand that. But if the -- if a given cigarette manufacturer simply said, we're not going to give any numbers, we're simply going to say \"Smoke Marlboros,\" and the FTC wanted numbers and they wanted the numbers in accordance with the Cambridge testing method, they would then have had to regulate, adopt a regulation, or get Congress to pass a statute.",
  "Okay. Now, in my hypo they just say: Look, we're just going to say \"Smoke Marlboros.\" We're not going to say the nicotine is low or anything. The FTC would not at that point have any basis to charge a violation?",
  "All I'm getting at is the FTC had no basis other than a voluntary agreement to require them to publish any numbers or to publish any numbers in accordance with the Cambridge - -",
  "Right.",
  "What if in your hypo the Government came along and said, in order to run your hospital, you've got to disclose certain facts. Otherwise we're going to shut it down. And those facts from that point on are like your hypo. Would your conclusion then follow, that they were acting under?",
  "Why isn't that the situation that we've got here?",
  "You're taking this because, in effect on a four corners facial criterion.",
  "But one of the issues in this case is whether that is an appropriate methodology, so will you address that?",
  "We're not talking about subjective intent here. We're talking about what Justice Breyer raised a moment ago. That is, we are looking for the public political context in which the ad is run. He gave the example of the Faircloth Edwards ads. Anyone in North Carolina knew what they meant. Someone in Idaho or New Hampshire probably did not, because they did not know the context. Your argument, seems to me is, ignore the context. And my question is, why should we ignore - - why should we do that?",
  "But doesn't any communication depend upon the understanding of the listener? Can we even sensibly talk about what a statement means or an advertisement means without understanding the context in terms of the listener's understanding?",
  "No. The question is, what do the words mean.",
  "And it is impossible to know what the words mean without knowing the context in which they are spoken.",
  "My question is, why should we ignore the context? How can we tell what something means without the context?",
  "But that -- those don't go to meaning in the sense of, for example, the Faircloth Edwards example does. Why should we ignore the aspects of context which determine meaning, i.e., the understanding that a listener would have?",
  "You mean the people in North Carolina were unaware of the Edwards position, they were unaware of the distinction between Faircloth and Edwards?",
  "Of course they knew that.",
  "Of course they knew that. And just as presumably, you knew the position of Senator Feingold in these advertisements, and the people in the state knew because of your other -- because of your other public statements.",
  "Why should those things be ignored?",
  "You think they're dumb?",
  "You have a web site. You have a web site that calls their attention, and you think nobody's going to it?",
  "Nobody's paying attention to what the Senator is doing?",
  "You think the only source of information about Senator Feingold is your advertisement?",
  "Then if your advertisement is not the sole source of information, then why do you assume that no one in Wisconsin knows what the senator has been doing when he votes.",
  "So your position is that we ignore context because no one -- because the voters aren't smart enough to have a context?",
  "That's -- give us the third one. I want to go back to - -",
  "Okay. May I go back to your second criterion? It seems to me your second criterion is simply the injection of magic words back again. You're saying if we don't use certain magic words it's okay. That's a magic words test. You're not looking for any particular word. You're looking for the meaning and breadth of the, of the item.",
  "Well, but you said if we don't mention the election and the candidacy of this person for this election, that is one of the sufficient -- one of the conditions with the other three which would be sufficient to justify the, on First Amendment grounds, justify running the ad. That seems to me simply to be reinjecting magic words in a negative form.",
  "But your test, as I understand it, is the test to determine whether you fall within this sort of heartland of the statute which we upheld on facial challenge. Yours is a test where exclusion from the facial rule; isn't that correct? That's -- that was why you were giving the answer to Justice Scalia that you gave?",
  "What you're saying: I have three criteria and if I satisfy those criteria, then the, then the facial validity of the statute is not an answer to my claim. That's basically what you're saying.",
  "And of course, if you success in that you're saying, okay, the Government then has the burden of satisfying strict scrutiny. That's the reason for your test, isn't it, to get you out of McCain-Feingold -- I mean, to get you out of the holding in McConnell?",
  "Sure. You're saying this is an applied challenge which is different in some relevant respects, so that the facial holding in McConnell shouldn't apply to us, it shouldn't bar, shouldn't justify the Government barring our ad. Isn't that your logic?",
  "You want to go further than that, I know. But that's your first step.",
  "That's what you were getting at.",
  "The way to do that is say, there's something different about my case from the case which was taken as typical in upholding statute against facial challenge.",
  "But your, your principle concern at this point is getting yourself out from the holding of McConnell, in other words, by saying we have a case which was not the typical case in McConnell, that's why it's an as-applied challenge and that's why this is a new ball game. And I take it your principle argument for that in criticizing the Government's position is that the Government didn't use to say that there's something significant or something insignificant about naming the candidate, and now they do. That it seems to me -- if I understand your argument -- goes back to this context argument or not. Because the argument that's being made is, in context we know perfectly well what's going on.",
  "You're saying you shouldn't look at the context.",
  "Then why did you refer them to the web site? There's nothing remote or speculative about what happens when they look at the web site.",
  "Anything about Senator Feingold?",
  "Did the web site indicate the -- the Wisconsin Right to Life's position on Senator Feingold?",
  "That's part of the context, isn't it? In other words, you're supplying some - -",
  "-- context for the ad. You're saying, if you want to know the context in which we're saying this, look at the website.",
  "You don't believe that's what you are doing.",
  "The FEC doesn't regulate anything else in the broader political context except what the statute allows. My point is, it seems to me you are referring to context. Why therefore is it illegitimate for a court to look to context?",
  "Okay.",
  "Then why didn't Congress adequately give the equivalent of what you call the \"only if\" language when it began (iii) by saying the cost of reimbursement described in clause two? The reimbursement described in clause two is described in terms of the clause that Justice Scalia is zeroing in on.",
  "I'm sorry. I'm just not getting this. Can you rephrase that?",
  "General, as I understand it the parties are now free to come up with any scheme they want to for selecting an official candidate.",
  "Let's assume the Democratic Party decides to have a State convention. If the law in Washington provided that the nominee selected by that convention could state on the ballot not merely a preference for Democrats, but a statement that, I am the nominee of the Democratic Party, your position in this case I take it would be exactly the same.",
  "Okay.",
  "Do you know any Democrats who go around saying I prefer the Democratic Party who do not regard themselves and register themselves as Democrats? I mean, in the real world I don't know that -- I don't know whether this is fatal to your case, but in the real world, it seems to me the distinction you're drawing is simply not drawn.",
  "It's helpful to your case, but, going back to my question, do you know any people who go around saying, well, you know, I really prefer the Democrats; I'm a Republican myself? I mean that, that doesn't happen.",
  "There's always one. But seriously, as a systemic matter, do you really think that's -- that's a distinction that anyone would recognize?",
  "No, but that isn't responsive to my question. Do you really think that that distinction is a distinction which is accepted as a working way of thinking in this world?",
  "You really do?",
  "But it means that they - - they will prefer the candidate of one party or another, assuming they vote and there's no independent candidate running. But it seems to me that the very declaration, the very assumption of status as an independent says, I don't as a systemic matter prefer one party to the other; a pox on both their houses.",
  "It could. But do you really think, again, in the real world, that that's why people register themselves as independents?",
  "Well, however the statement is made.",
  "But may not claim that on the ballot itself?",
  "What do you -- what do you say about the fact that you have a right to select and designate an official candidate and it's independent of this ballot procedures?",
  "Okay. If the rationale in Jones was that the defect was that the association, political association, was being adulterated by the method of, of the use of ballots, to select what was an official nominee, that problem does not exist here.",
  "You're saying in practical terms, this is a nomination, even though there may be a separate official nomination that nobody pays attention to?",
  "Then why is one party going to the trouble of establishing a convention system to make nominations?",
  "Well, they will pay no attention, I take it, in the sense that there will be nothing indicating an official nomination on the ballot itself. But as I -- I am also assuming that the parties through a convention, or whatever other scheme they can come up with, can -- can designate an official nominee quite independently of this ballot. And if they do so designate, they can campaign on that person's behalf. The person in campaigning can say, I am the official nominee of the X party. And those facts are true, aren't they?",
  "You're saying that a right to nominate has to be a right to exclude everyone from the ballot except the nominee -- everyone from the ballot under that banner, from the nominee.",
  "You -- you have identified -- in the course of your argument, you've identified two separate problems with the -- with the scheme as you see it. One is, as you put it, that it masks the identity of an official nominee, and the other is that it in effect allows competition on the ballot by a person under the same party banner with the official nominee.",
  "Right.",
  "I -- I -- no, I understand that to be your position, but my question is, and I realize there is a certain awkwardness to this, but we -- we've got to face it: If the masking of the identity of the candidate is the real flaw, then the -- the hypothetical that was included in the -- in Jones, in the dictum, of the -- of the party that -- of the ballot that has no party identification whatsoever, that would equally be bad, wouldn't it?",
  "But if it's the masking that's the problem, the -- the nominee is going to be just as well masked on the ballot or better masked on the ballot that allows no statement of preference at all.",
  "And -- and I'm not saying that that's fatally your case, but I mean it's -- it's something we need to be careful about when we're doing our thinking, and that's why I'm pressing you on it.",
  "But if -- but if it's just masking in a partisan system, then it seems to me you're making the same argument that you make when you say, by allowing statements of preference, we obscure the character of the official nominee and in effect allow somebody to have a -- a second shot at -- at getting Republican support as a Republican. It seems to me that if it's masking in a partisan ballot that's the real problem, there's only one objection and the objection is not so much the masking as it is the submergence of the official nomination by allowing competition under the party's name by another candidate. Isn't that fair to say?",
  "What's your answer simply to the very simple argument that because the floor was set on the assumption of a 100 to 1 ratio, set by Congress, that any other sentencing assumption, regardless of the particular justifications in a given case, is simply incoherent with the statutory scheme and for that reason should be regarded as unreasonable?",
  "It is the coherence problem that is bothering us.",
  "But is that an argument for saying, well, in the LSD case, you approved of incoherence and irrationality, therefore, you want to do it across the board? I mean, there is still an argument here on the merits regardless of Neal that there is an incoherence between the minimum and the kind of discretion that you're talking about.",
  "Did we have the cliff problem in the LSD case?",
  "So we are in the same boat, then, you say with Neal in that respect, too?",
  "That just goes back to Justice Scalia's point. There may very well be an implicit Congressional directive that the Commission did not follow.",
  "It did not reject them, you are saying? So, therefore, in effect, there was a Congressional ratification?",
  "If you were representing the one who got the 80 to 1 ratio you would file an amicus brief, no error in judgment?",
  "Isn't your answer also to Justice Breyer's question the post-Neal amendment to the statute which in effect says, you know, make your Guidelines consistent with the statute?",
  "Quite -- quite apart from the specific rejection of the proposal they came up with.",
  "Congress has legislated in this area after Booker. They have not imposed the 100 to 1 ratio throughout the -- other than as a mandatory minimum and maximum.",
  "But that, as you say, in effect, makes a certain element mandatory. And why doesn't that come up against the same Sixth Amendment judgement that we made in Booker?",
  "And that's the problem.",
  "Now, why - -",
  "Why wouldn't the judge in, as it were, the second case give some consideration, be required under abuse review to give some consideration, to what is sort of the norm in that circuit so that he doesn't stand out as either a \"let-them-loose\" judge or a hanging judge? Doesn't abuse of discretion at least require a broader view than simply the -- literally the case before the court?",
  "And wouldn't there be at least under the Chief Justices's hypothetical, wouldn't there be a possibility of looking to those other cases rather than just automatically affirming on -- on abuse review?",
  "Okay.",
  "You're saying -- you're saying two things. You're saying it's got to follow the Guidelines -- it can depart from the Guidelines, but it's got to do so based on the facts of this case or in some way relevant to the facts of this case. And when you put that latter criterion in there, what you're saying, and I think this was Justice Scalia's concern, you're really saying you've got to find that this case is somehow an outlier to the broad range of cases so that the policy does not fit. And that's a different thing from a general disagreement with the policy itself. Isn't that what you are saying?",
  "Then what is it in the facts of this case that is crucial to the appropriate determination?",
  "Sure. But if the reasoning that you just articulated is reasoning that should be accepted, it's reasoning that should be accepted in every case. And it -- i.e., the mind is less -- the brain is less developed in the case of everyone under a certain age. And that amounts, in effect, to a rejection of the policy for a certain swath of individuals, relatively young individuals, for whom the judge is saying age is relevant, the policy says age is not. That's rejection of the policy.",
  "You're saying that if a judge disagrees as a general matter of policy, once in a while he could make an exception to his disagreement. But it's still, it seems to me, on your reasoning, that he has rejected the policy with respect to a certain class of defendant.",
  "You're saying that there's a fairness component to the Guidelines in reasonableness review.",
  "When you start talking about disparity, you're talking about a fairness across a range of sentencing that is actually imposed. So you're saying -- I think you're saying, there's got to be a kind of substantive fairness component to it.",
  "Well, that's kind after subset, isn't it?",
  "Okay.",
  "Then under your theory the employee who gets paid shows up for work the next morning; and so, of course, under your theory it would be promotion.",
  "I would have the same concern if we were dealing with concealment.",
  "If the robbery takes place in a dark alley, is that automatically concealment?",
  "That's going into the alley instead of doing it out on the - -",
  "What if he puts it in a tin can and buries it in the garden? Is that additional conduct?",
  "Why isn't it? Do you put your salary in tin cans in the garden?",
  "I just don't see how you can make the distinction you're making, and therefore I don't see how you can avoid Justice Stevens's problem.",
  "The, the problem that I have in the analogy you are drawing on the application of your principle based on the general election cases is this: There is concededly -- and you mentioned this earlier -- there is concededly no unreasonable barrier to somebody who wants to become a delegate. He's got to get 500 signature, but that can be done. The burden that I understand that your clients are complaining about is the, in effect, the burden of influencing the ultimate decision-maker to decide to nominate that person. And that burden is -- is focused on two points: number one, the entrenched power of the political bosses; and number two, the difficulty - - well, I guess three points -- the difficulty of fielding, for a dissident to field a whole slate of candidates who in effect, once elected, would make the nomination desired; or, three, the capacity of the intending or the aspiring candidate to influence the delegates directly once they're selected, because the time is short. And those aren't -- those aren't, it seems to me, complaints about access to the electoral process. They're complaints about the capacity to influence those who are elected, who make the ultimate decision. And that's the difficulty I have in the analogy that you are drawing or the parallel that you are making between the direct election cases and your claim here. Could you comment on that?",
  "But it's still the case that at the end of the day, the nub of your claim is that the intending judicial candidate cannot effectively politic, does not have a reasonable chance of getting selected; and I don't see that as a -- as a direct ballot access claim. Let me put the question in another way: Your -- your friend on the other side, Mr. Rossman, in response to a question, said that if this election of the judicial candidate for the party were made directly by the political bosses, whatever their titles are, the ones who are supposedly in control here, he would not see any constitutional objection to that. What if New York had a system that provided precisely for that? The political bosses, as I understand it, get elected every 2 years and the State law would provide that those party bosses, whatever their title is, would in fact select the candidate. Would that be unconstitutional?",
  "But the party isn't objecting.",
  "The party -- the party likes it.",
  "And you are the -- the claim here: These people are not, as I understand it, bringing a case on behalf of rights of the party. They're bringing a case based on a premise of a principle of participation, which is theirs. And that's why, it seems to me, that the hypo that I posed is not significantly different, provided the parties aren't objecting, in which we have a different case. But it seems to me that my hypo is not significantly different from the one that gave rise to the question that Mr. Rossman answered.",
  "Well, the Federal system in practice entrenches United States Senators. I'm -- I'm not sure that, in terms of political participation on the part of an intending or an aspiring judge that the system that I suggested in the hypo, in which the party bosses select the nominee, is for constitutional purposes significantly different from the Federal system for -- for picking district judges.",
  "Sure. And in my hypo the only election is the election for the party boss.",
  "Okay. But isn't your argument still that, because there is a limitation on the participation of the intending judicial candidate, there is ultimately a constitutional problem? So let me pose a different question to you, and this one is not hypothetical. The nub of your case is that the political bosses in effect are controlling the process because they tell the delegates who to vote for. Does your -- does the intending judicial nominee whom you represent have any difficulty in getting to the political bosses and saying: I want you to consider me?",
  "Sure. They -- for political reasons, they're saying: We don't like you. There are -- there are a lot of people who go to United States Senators, and the United States Senators say: Scram; we don't -- we don't like you; your politics aren't good enough for us. And so I'm not saying that -- that -- on my hypo the person who lobbies the bosses directly is --is claiming a right to success. I think they're claiming a right to have a chance to influence the process. And why don't they have the chance by going to the boss?",
  "And I don't know of any enemy of a United States -- go ahead.",
  "No, but what you are calling -- and correct me if I am wrong. Maybe I misunderstand this. I think what you are calling the severe burden is the difficulty of assembling a whole slate that can control the meeting or have a majority in the ultimate meeting of that delegate, of those delegates, and therefore actually select the candidate who wants to put the slate together. And it's control over result rather than the capacity of any individual to get elected a delegate which I think you are objecting to. Am I wrong?",
  "Yes, but when you say \"meaningfully participate\" you talk about putting -- and candidly talk about putting -- a slate of delegates together. If I put a slate of delegates together, it is because once those delegates are selected they're going to support me; and that's why it -- I think your real argument is not that somebody has difficulty becoming a candidate for a delegate or even getting elected one. The difficulty that you're claiming is that it's hard for the intending judicial candidate to assemble a large enough group of people to give that candidate success once the delegates are elected. It's a success argument that you are making, not an access argument.",
  "I mean, it's more than knowledge. I mean, you mentioned recklessness. It's got to have either knowledge of or a willingness to maintain an indifference to the consequence.",
  "But you're saying --",
  "But as I understand your argument, it is the difference between aiding and abetting liability on the part of the Respondents and liability as, in effect, as first line principles, is their intent, or at the very least in knowledge that they were committing a deceptive act as part of this",
  "Yes.",
  "Now, how many times are parties of the position of Respondents ever going to engage in those acts except with exactly the state of mind that on your judgment makes them principals, rather than aiders and abettors.",
  "No. No, I realize that you have to plead it. What I'm getting at is: Are you making a distinction that in the real world is not a distinction? That, in reality, no one is going to do what these Respondents did without the kind of knowledge or intent that makes them, on your theory, principals rather than aiders or abettors?",
  "In other words, it's deceptive but not deceptive in relation to, or for the purpose of, deceiving the -- someone like the Petitioner.",
  "I thought you were telling me that in each case there may be a deceptive act but not a deceptive act in relation to somebody like the Petitioner here.",
  "But that's a different answer, I think, from the one you were just giving Justice Scalia.",
  "You don't defend the position --",
  "Now, I take it, though, you liability -- that there must have been a statement addressed to investors.",
  "Well, do you --",
  "Would you answer my question first? Do you take the position that there can be no 10(b) liability without a statement addressed to investors?",
  "You mean the statement as such or a statement which could not have been made but for the statements of the Respondents must be communicated to the investors? Which one?",
  "So are you -- so you are saying that there can be no causation and hence, you know -- and I think you're going further. You're saying 10(b) unless there is a statement directly addressed to the investors, is that correct?",
  "Well what about in this answer of yours, the answer was that Arthur Andersen knew what was going on. If I've -- if you are -- and as I understand it, that's not what was charged -- but if that's correct, Arthur Andersen did know what was going on. Can Arthur Andersen be held liable under 10b-5 --",
  "-- whereas your client cannot?",
  "And the difference is?",
  "But --",
  "What if Arthur Andersen --",
  "What if Arthur Andersen has a footnote in there saying, this is okay because we have Respondents it was, saying there's been inflation and therefore we've got to renegotiate the prices and jack them up 20 percent, Arthur Andersen knows that that is false and the Respondent who made it knows that it is false, can the Respondent who made it then be held liable?",
  "Yes, but doesn't --",
  "Yes, but doesn't -- doesn't the Respondent in that case know that it is likely that the auditor is going to indicate the basis for its statement, that the transaction is okay --",
  "-- and, therefore, isn't it reasonable to suppose that they anticipated that their statement would be communicated to the market?",
  "But there's a communication to the market there --",
  "-- and there's a reason to expect that communication.",
  "Doesn't that make any difference?",
  "Is the word \"only\" in there?",
  "Is the word \"only\" in there?",
  "In the statute?",
  "So you have an independent defense quite apart from -- from the construction of 10b-5?",
  "Why?",
  "Congress intended an expert agency to address solely aiding-and-abetting cases. My question is if there is an overlap -- A, can there be an overlap? And if so, I don't see why Congress's intent to reserve aiding-and-abetting alone to the agency affects the determination of this case.",
  "For example, for example, let's assume in this case that Charter said we've, we've got to let the investors know that our cost of doing business is going up, and we want to you make an announcement that you're jacking up your price 20 percent. In that case there would be primary liability.",
  "Why in that case is there not also aiding-and-abetting? We know perfectly well why they are doing it, and they are doing it solely to aid and abet Charter in its scheme themselves enjoying a wash transaction. Why isn't that both primary and aiding-and-abetting?",
  "We know it's primary. Why isn't it also aiding-and-abetting?",
  "So you are saying there can be an overlap but there is no overlap that helps the Petitioner in this case?",
  "Has the SEC publicly taken a position on that question?",
  "Why isn't it -- why isn't your argument more directly that the issue here is -- is nonweapon use by A versus nonweapon use by B? You represent B and you say B wasn't the one who used it in a nonweapon sense?",
  "And if you are right, that's the end of the case.",
  "But you're not -- as you said before, you're not arguing for the overruling of Smith, and therefore, you concede that the other party to the transaction used the gun.",
  "In a nonweapon sense.",
  "It's really not a bad one. I mean, you don't - -",
  "But that does not answer the question use by whom. As I understand it, we are not really arguing about whether the gun was used in the transaction; we are arguing about whether the defendant was the one who used it.",
  "Yes, but I mean, the problem you, it seems to me you've got that you can't totally paper over is that that's not usually the way we talk. I mean, if I buy a car, and pay money for it, I do not use the car in the transaction. It's what I have after the transaction is complete; and you, you got that kind of linguistic problem here, it seems to me.",
  "It adds an additional element you have to prove but it doesn't answer the linguistic point.",
  "But the only way you can make that argument is to define the crime as consisting of the agreement as opposed to the consummated transaction.",
  "Well, I thought you said a minute ago that he was using it because he agreed to accept it.",
  "Well, you're -- you're - - as I understand it, in order for you to prevail on that point, the only -- the only conclusion that has to be drawn, as I understand it, is that the Texas courts have subject matter jurisdiction of this kind of -- of order, and that the bar that Texas is asserting is simply, in effect, a procedural bar; and, therefore, in order for this Federal rule to preempt the State bar is not to give the State courts jurisdiction they don't have, but to remove a bar to the exercise of their jurisdiction that State law, absent preemption, would impose; is that correct?",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, may I ask a further - may I ask a further question?",
  "Let me try one other variation to make sure that I understand your argument. What if the President of the United States had said this judgment, the Avena judgment, will not be enforced, and this Court interpreted the Avena judgment as binding, as providing a rule of decision and a rule of decision which was entitled to respect by Texas? Would this Court's authority to make that declaration and issue a judgment to that effect be displaced by the President's determination that it would not be that the Avena judgment would not be enforced?",
  "Okay.",
  "So - -",
  "But it does follow then from what you've said that if we take exactly the position that I outlined in my hypo, we could avoid the entire question of presidential authority.",
  "That's in effect a judicial version of one of the variants in Justice Jackson's hypo in the Steel case - -",
  "He's talking about the President and Congress; we're talking about the President and the Court.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, that's the -- that's the argument, but your brother the Solicitor General has conceded that if we take the position in this case that there is a -- a rule of decision that should be respected in this Court and, hence, the subject of a judgment to Texas that, among other things, would suspend Texas's procedural bar law -- that that would obviate the question of presidential power.",
  "Mr. Cruz, you have frequently emphasized the non-self-executing character of the optional protocol. Is there any rule, any positive rule in existence today either of international law or domestic law that precludes this Court from being the implementing authority as opposed to the executive or the executive and the Senate?",
  "These treaties including the optional protocol.",
  "That's right. Yeah.",
  "Why?",
  "What's the rule -- what is the positive rule of international and domestic law that precludes it?",
  "They've made the treaty. We have got the optional protocol. Whatever the optional protocol means is Federal law.",
  "But you're -- my point is, my -- I'm accepting as premise of the question the limitation which you assert, i.e., non-self-executing; and my question is, may the execution, if you will, be made by this Court? Is there an independent rule that precludes this Court from that role?",
  "I don't mean to be disrespectful of your judgment but what do you base it on -- tradition?",
  "You're saying by -- by non-self-executing, they mean you have to come back to us? The terms - -",
  "Then what you are saying if I understand you is that Justice Scalia was wrong when he said that would be making it Federal law. I think you were saying that would be a -- the branch that was responsible for determining how to execute, i.e., to apply, Federal law. Is that your point?",
  "I think - -",
  "Is -- I don't want to reduce the issue down to something too simplistic, but is there a rule that says don't lie, don't commit fraud?",
  "Am I -- am I right that we really do not have to - -",
  "Am I correct that we really do not have to determine that issue this morning?",
  "All we have to determine is whether it is possible for the Petitioner here to be within the class of those with standing?",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Stewart - -",
  "Mr. Stewart, may I go back to the question of multiple recoveries. And by that term, as I understand it, the term does not mean duplicating recoveries. And I don't understand -- and this is what I want you to explain -- why there couldn't be a recovery in a case analogous to this both by the FCM and by the ultimate customer. Let's assume that the settlement price is, in fact, rigged. The FCM cannot meet the resulting margin call and folds, and hence a situation like this. And this happens quickly enough so that the ultimate transaction is never consummated. So that the -- the contracting party on the FCM side of the trade doesn't get the benefit of what would have been a favorable contract. Couldn't you have recovery in that case both by the customer and the FCM?",
  "It may be that I don't understand how it works.",
  "But in my hypo, the FCM is claiming damages because his business folds. So the damages are not limited simply to those flowing from this transaction itself. The customer is claiming damages for failure to consummate a contract that would have been favorable to him.",
  "Right. And I am assuming - -",
  "Neither are they the person who can end up personally liable, and -- I mean, they don't have -- they are not subject to margin calls. There is something very different about this set of relationships from the broker/seller relationship in buying and selling a house.",
  "But you're saying that because a trade is on or subject to, the only thing that can be on or subject to is a trade. And it seems to me that that -- that's the point at which we have difficulty following your argument. Why -- what is your reason, textual or otherwise, for saying that because a trade is on or subject to, no other subtransaction can be on subject to?",
  "But I take if -- if your ultimate, let's say, policy reason for confining it to that is the -- is the policy against multiple recovery.",
  "Their current argument is, basically, that's all Congress was thinking about.",
  "But, as I understand your position, it's something more. Congress was also thinking probably about multiple recovery, and it didn't want that. And we will impute that intent to Congress because multiple recovery would be a very bad thing for the industry. That's basically your argument.",
  "Okay.",
  "Mr. Andre, it may be that things would fall into place easier if you would give us an example or examples of instances in which any other law enforcement officer would be engaged in detaining property in -- in the course of enforcing customs or excise laws. If we can understand that, then we are going to have a better sense of how the exception might work. Can you give me an example of the other law enforcement officer engaged in customs excise?",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, may I ask you -- this goes to your ambiguity point. May I ask you this question? If Congress wanted to cover all law officers, the only reason for mentioning the customs and excise people would be to make it very clear that they were within that category of all law enforcement officers, and I take it that's basically what you're saying.",
  "Right.",
  "But wouldn't - -",
  "But wouldn't the way to do that would have made it at least clearer that that's what Congress or what he had in mind and what Congress was getting at would have been to provide that the - - that the exception referred to law enforcement officers including an officer or customs of excise? In other words, they would have made it clear that at that point, the old historical customs and excise rule was sort of the tail on the dog, and the dog was law enforcement officers. Instead, however, the order is exactly different. On what your reading is -- on your reading, what is now the tail of the dog comes first, and the general clause \"law enforcement officer\" comes second.",
  "So, number one, it is less clear and it really raises the question: Weren't they trying to get simply at law enforcement officers who were doing the customs and excise function? So my question is, why doesn't the order of the words cut against you by putting, on your theory, the tail of the dog before the dog?",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, before you get into policy, may I just suggest that there is a possible fourth category, really. You had mentioned three, and one -- a fourth possibility might be \"law-enforcement officer,\" in a very broad sense of the term, but one who is simply providing, let's say, protective service in aid ultimately of the revenue laws. And the reason I have thought of this is that this sort of situation went on in my -- my native State in this past month, in which the United States Marshal Service, which at the time all of these statutes were enacted was a fairly large agency, took control of some real estate in -- in New Hampshire which had been the property, or was the property, of tax protesters. And they -- they held custody of that. They took control of that real estate for about a week to make sure that there were no booby traps and bombs that -- that would -- that would blow up the IRS people when they went in there to enforce their tax liens. That would be an example of \"law-enforcement officer\" in a very broad sense. It could cover the Marshal service, the FBI, and whatnot; and, yet, the - - and No. 2, they would be exercising, you know, typical law-enforcement functions, protective functions. And, yet, they would be doing so in -- in aid of -- of the tax or the revenue laws. That would be a plausible reason for -- for sticking in the general phrase, and it would be a plausible reading of the phrase, wouldn't it?",
  "Do IRS agents have -- have expertise in -- bomb detection and dismantling?",
  "Well, there don't seem to be many cases because -- I mean that's why we've got this one at this point.",
  "Over what period of time?",
  "Well, I mean that's not - - that's not a deluge of litigation. I mean it seems to me there is reason to assume that no matter what reading we give it, there is a plausible reading that can come up that -- that confines the actual application of the \"other law-enforcement officer\" fairly narrowly.",
  "Yes, but the question of what is -- what is ambiguous or not is -- is a question of context. And if you take the phrase \"law-enforcement officer,\" and you say is that ambiguous, and you say well, gee, no. But if you stick it in this particular statute and it happens to follow these specific references to tax gatherers and tax and excise laws, then it seems to me it's fair to say it does become ambiguous, because it gives rise to a reasonable question. Were they just getting at law-enforcement officers who were performing these kinds of functions, or did they really mean it as broadly as the phrase in real isolation would have meant? That's ambiguity, and that's what we've got here.",
  "But then you are saying, don't read the statute as a whole. That argument, in effect, is saying isolate the phrase -- and we don't do that.",
  "I agree with you. And if I make the assumption that it's unambiguous, your argument is unassailable. But if I don't make that assumption, then your argument risks circularity.",
  "And my suggestion is that it is the context that makes your argument a tough sell.",
  "They were on point for my dissent. I know.",
  "Mr. Coad, may I ask you a question that involves the comparison of what, for shorthand purposes I'll call Subsection (20) and Subsection (33). I take it, it is your position that - - and (20) applies here. But I take it that it's your position that under (33), your argument could not prevail because the language of (33) makes it clear that there's got to be a -- in effect, a revocation of the right first, before there can be a restoration within the meaning of that statute? You accept that?",
  "Now that applies as I recall to cases, or primarily to cases, in which there has been a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence, is that correct?",
  "Okay. If your position prevails, then Subsection (20), which applies to more serious offenses, would in effect be held to provide for a restoration when, in fact, nothing had been taken away. Whereas under (33), which applies simply to a relatively minor set of crimes in relation to (20), would not provide this relief. So you would have the anomaly that in the more serious cases, you would win. In the less serious cases, you would lose, because the statute was more onerous. That's anomalous. And my point is, and this is what I want you to comment on, I'll assume for the sake of argument that you're pointing out an anomaly here if you just look at (20) alone. But if you look at (20) and (33), by going your way, we're going to create another anomaly, the other anomaly being that the more serious offense or the more serious offender gets better treatment than the less serious offender. So either way we go, there's going to be some anomaly. Am I right in reading it that way?",
  "But none of them is less serious in the classification of the crime than those covered by 33, because 33 simply covers a misdemeanor of domestic violence.",
  "Yes, but the State's judgment about trustworthiness may very well be the same in each case. So the trustworthiness criterion, it seems to me, is being -- would be applied differently in the two cases if we take your position.",
  "Well what if an individual received actual child pornography in the mail that had not been solicited. And he calls the chief of police in town and says I just opened my mail, and this envelope is full of child porn. And he's right. I mean, there are no body doubles. This is the real thing in here. He has presented child pornography to that chief of police and he's violated the statute, hasn't he?",
  "You say no, but you say no because we won't enforce it that way. But the -- but the objective component and the subjective component in my example are both satisfied.",
  "That's -- that's fine, but before you get to that point, you have -- there's still an indictable offense. You don't prevent -- you don't present affirmative defenses until you're already indicted.",
  "But the ban on possession is not the real problem because, under a normal possession statute, you would indeed have a problem not merely in terms of -- that could be raised not merely by affirmative defense but as an element of the statute. If the possession is merely a matter of happenstance, there's an intent problem and presumably there's no - - there's no offense. There's no knowing offense in acquiring material for the possession. But in the pandering statute, what we've got here is there is -- as you put it earlier, there is an understanding which happens to be correct, objectively correct, that there is child porn, and there is a very clear intent to convey that message by way of presenting this material to a third party, in this case the police. So I think this is not merely comparable to the problem of haphazard possession.",
  "But how would you do it in the case -- you mentioned that if there is not actual child porn shown, and there is a truthful or honest statement about it, that there is nothing to worry about. But what about the movie reviewer who is reviewing the latest re-release or something of the \"Lolita\" film and says this depicts sexual activity with a minor? That statement is true. It would be taken by some naive people as saying boy, this is what it shows, the real thing. That is a truthful statement. And yet, it would still fall within the prohibition of the statute. As I understand your position, the only way that statement would be truthful in a way that would excuse would be if the reviewer said this depicts sexual activity with a minor, but of course the actor wasn't really a minor. Isn't that correct?",
  "What if you are 17 years old and you haven't gone to law school and you haven't read these cases? You may very well assume that.",
  "Wouldn't we use -- wouldn't we use a reasonable personal of the sort who goes to movies?",
  "I would suppose my 17 year old, non- law-school graduate would be within the ambit of the reasonable class.",
  "No, but isn't the problem the problem of your answer to Justice Breyer's hypothetical. He said, you know, what if we have this appendix and we list -- I forget what he said, three dozen examples that the Solicitor General says wouldn't be covered and that sounds fine to us. Your answer was well, there would still be some examples not covered. But isn't -- isn't the answer to that that there would be some conceivable overbreadth, I suppose, no matter what the appendix said? Somewhere out there there would be an example not covered that would be the basis for an as-applied challenge, but there wouldn't be substantial overbreadth. And isn't that the case? That if Justice Breyer's hypo were in fact the decision of this case, there wouldn't be a fair argument that there is any substantial overbreadth left to the statute, isn't that so?",
  "But isn't the answer to that you may still have some overbreadth left, but it's not substantial? Most 17 year olds are, in fact, going to realize that the real thing is not going on in, you know, the Lolita movie. And if we accept that as a factual proposition, which was the Solicitor General's answer, and if we also accept, not by way of appendix but way of rationale in the opinion, that these various activities have got to be given an essentially commercial or quasi-commercial character, so that they don't pick up the conversations with the neighbor, then that's simply a matter of statutory interpretation that could be part of our rationale. If we accept the factual proposition about what reasonable viewers are likely to know, and we engage in that kind of interpretation following the Solicitor General's view of how this serial list of activities should be construed, don't we eliminate the possibility -- wouldn't we eliminate the possibility of substantial overbreadth? Some things may get by. There may still be legitimate applied challenges, but substantial overbreadth, would that be left?",
  "It can, but can you give me an example of a class of activities that would not be, in effect, insulated from indictment by these two steps in the opinion, that would be of substantial character?",
  "No. But you are also relying, as I understand it, on State common law, in effect. And you are saying, that so long as the State common law does not give less by way of remedy and relief than the Federal decision requires, the State is free, as a matter of State remedial common law, to do more. That's your point, isn't it?",
  "You are saying that, ultimately, the State's choice in this case rests upon a choice of State common law about procedure leading to remedy.",
  "Mr. Butler, if as you say Teague is, in effect, a comity rule, then what is your answer, in effect, to Justice Scalia's point that we make a decision when we come down with a substantive legal judgment about the Constitution, we make a decision as to whether the rule is retroactive or not? And he says that if you look at Teague as simply, in effect, a comity decision, that's inconsistent with the determination that we have made, because if you say okay, we as a State will apply it earlier than the Feds say we have to, you, in effect, are changing the substantive determination that we have made, that the decision is not retroactive. What is the retroactivity analysis that underlies your comity analysis of Teague?",
  "Alright, but let's be more specific. What does it know about retroactive application under Griffith?",
  "And it will apply to some cases that depend upon facts and have eventuated from trials that are - -",
  "Right. So that there's is going to be some retroactivity?",
  "And if there is going to be some retroactivity, then I take it your position has got to be and is our substantive decisions are not so much retroactive or non-retroactive, but retroactively applied, to some extent, and not retroactively applied to others, and a State is free to apply it more retroactively than ours. Is that the nutshell?",
  "So your answer to Justice Scalia is, I take it, not that the decision is retroactive or not, but there is a decision about the degree to which applications will be retroactive or not? That is what underlies your case?",
  "Then how do you -- how do you reconcile that answer with the point that your brother made just before he sat down, and that is, taking standard Griffith analysis, the application of a so-called new rule is going to vary depending on how long it takes a person on direct appeal to get through the State court system? And it seems to me that that is inconsistent with your view that there has got to be one rule with respect to the date of application as a matter of substantive Federal law, because we know for a fact that, depending how long it takes to get through the State appellate system on direct review, the new rule may be applied and it may not be applied.",
  "I understand your -- your point about finality, and finality has a well-known operative effect. But one operative effect when the Federal courts have defined finality and have said it is not final until -- a case is not final until direct review is over -- one consequence of that is that a substantive Federal rule will be applied to an individual in one State whose crime and whose trial procedure is different in time from that of a defendant in another State. So that the consequence is that the substantive rule will apply to some people who acted on date X and it will not apply to some people who acted on date X; and that, it seems to me, is inconsistent with your answer to Justice Stevens's question.",
  "And if it is inevitable, I don't see how you can answer Justice Stevens's question the way you did.",
  "And the finality point in effect establishes a way of calculating the application of a rule in any given State in any given case, but it will not result in the uniform application of the rule. Isn't that correct?",
  "That's sort of like defining order as random order, isn't it?",
  "And -- and the concern is a concern not so much.",
  "Mr. Diamond, let me ask you a question. Let me ask you a question which is totally off the point of the Federal Constitution, I guess. That is, if Minnesota really wants the rule that you want it to have, its legislature can provide that that will be the rule, can't it? The Minnesota legislature can pass a statute saying nobody gets more than Teague allows.",
  "Can the Minnesota legislature say: Look, the -- the Supreme Court of the United States has -- has come down with some rules. We won't characterize them as minimums or anything else. We'll just say it's a set of rules. It's called Teague, and Teague is going to be the law for the application of Federal rights in Minnesota State courts. Is -- can the Minnesota legislature do that?",
  "So the answer is yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "May I approach the same issue this way? When a State board in this case determines what method of valuation it is going to use, what does it consider? What are the reasons that it chooses method A rather than method B?",
  "Well, what should the reasons be?",
  "Well, but the professional standards, I take it, are not simply rules that one can grab out of thin air depending on one's mood. Doesn't - -",
  "Doesn't one have to choose the methodology based on some factual determination on -- which would support a conclusion that this is a better methodology for this case and others - -",
  "-- for this case than others?",
  "But at the end of the day, it's a determination which is based upon facts. There are good reasons in fact to choose method A rather than method B, right?",
  "Would it make sense then for a reviewing court to review the basis upon which the methodology was chosen, and if in fact there is a reasonable basis for choosing methodology A rather than methodology B, accept it and defer it to that extent?",
  "I'm talking about reviewing the judgment of the State authority in choosing one method rather than another.",
  "But we don't -- we don't know, there is no way of telling whether there is a variation, or there isn't a variation under the congressional formula, unless we first have a formula for determining what the value -- what the true value of the railroad property is. We know that can vary. That can vary depending upon the methodology chosen. The methodology chosen is dependent upon good facts, to pick one or the other; and therefore, doesn't the very -- the very criterion that Congress chose ultimately depend upon the methodology?",
  "What if you take my variation on it, and that is, we don't defer it to the State's choice in the abstract, i.e. if we -- if there are 10 methods, as long as it's one of the 10 it's okay? Rather, if we defer at all, we defer it to the choice that is made to -- to accept one or the other methodology, and we look to the reasons that the State gives for making that choice? Would that take all the teeth out of the Federal act?",
  "Your point is well taken. It has a variety, and then it makes some kind of a judgmental choice as between the results it gets. But that I guess just makes my question more complicated. As long as it -- as long as it has good reasons for selecting, let's say the three competing methodologies that it uses, and as long as it has a rational -- gives a rational basis for the ultimate resolution, should we not or should a court not defer to the choices?",
  "But doesn't the judgment get exercised in determining what facts are good reasons for selecting this methodology, or this variant of methodology, for this particular case?",
  "Isn't the point not that anyone is denying that there can be a range, that there -- everybody agrees that there is not here, simply because there is not one methodology, there is not an exact science which is operating? But isn't the real point the point that Justice Scalia made, that when Congress uses the term \"true market value,\" when it has a criterion of truth, the one thing that does seem to be clear is that, if you are looking for truth, you do not defer to a party in interest? And isn't that the one point? And if you accept that point, then doesn't it follow that methodology is up to the assessment of the district court.",
  "How could it say it more plainly than using the criterion of truth?",
  "Truth -- whatever truth means, it doesn't mean deferring to a party in interest. Isn't that correct?",
  "We all accept that. The question is not whether we're talking about rocket science in valuation. The question is whether we are deferring to a choice made by the party in interest? And doesn't the criterion of truth imply that we do not?",
  "So Congress in effect was engaging in Pontius Pilate's exercise, what is truth?",
  "But what you are saying is that the -- that the court is simply being turned into a grade school math teacher who looks to see whether the sums are added up correctly. That can't be what Congress had in mind.",
  "In other words, there was -- there was a contest about the judgment used by the State in selecting one point of datum in its calculation, right?",
  "All right. If that kind of judgment -- if it makes sense under the statute to put that kind of judgment in question, why doesn't it equally make sense under the statute to put other questions of judgment such as the selection of the methodology to which the data point in fact is relevant? Where do you stop?",
  "I know that's why you think. My question is, if you agree that it's appropriate under the congressional statute to challenge one issue of judgment, why isn't it equally appropriate to challenge other issues of judgment, i.e., selection of methodology?",
  "Each one, as I understand it, is a question of judgment about what is appropriate on the facts of this case, or these kinds of cases.",
  "Well, if -- I take it to determine how far you could go with that, I take it though in your view if the State's appraiser had never done an appraisal before in his life, if he were plucked off the street by the State and said, you know, \"appraise the railroad property; we are making you a State appraiser,\" on your view the district court could not look behind that?",
  "Exactly. But the selection of the methodology by the guy off the street could not be examined.",
  "Well, it's -- it's one of the recognized methodologies.",
  "It happens to be the one that gives the highest number. But it's a recognized methodology and there are certain -- certainly examples in which that methodology has been used, and I take it that if the guy off the street picks one of those, and that's all we know about it, the district court on your view cannot look behind it.",
  "How could you say it on your theory?",
  "How could you say it consistently with your position here?",
  "Then why doesn't the court have an opportunity or the right to examine whether any particular methodology is reasonable as applied to this taxpayer and this kind of property at this time?",
  "I thought -- I thought you were saying that the reproduction method had such severe problems associated with it that it simply would not be a fair methodology to use and at least a reviewing court, a district court could -- could draw that conclusion. I thought that was your answer.",
  "We are talking about the railroads like CSX, and I thought your answer was that a -- a district court could conclude that as applied in a case like this, that there are so many problems that it simply would not be a reasonable valuation method.",
  "All right. Then well then how do you draw a line?",
  "If you can do that, why can't it do what -- what your brother is saying it should do in this case?",
  "Well, let's assume I'm making that argument now in my question. Why -- why can you draw the line that you want to draw?",
  "Doesn't that raise, in effect, sort of a distinction between Carbone and United Haulers? Or at least one way of understanding the distinction between those two cases? In Carbone the facility, in fact, was not the facility of the government.",
  "Here the, the immediate beneficiary of the bonds is, in Justice Alito's hypo, is a private entity?",
  "But -- correct me if I'm wrong, just a matter of fact. I thought in most instances the immediate beneficiary would be a private entity who, in effect, was enabled to borrow at a lower rate?",
  "So don't you have to take -- therefore, if you're going to answer Justice Alito as you did, don't you have to take the position that Carbone really is not good law and the Carbone/United Haulers distinction is not a -- is simply not a relevant distinction? As a dissenter in Carbone, I naturally do not find that the worst answer you could give.",
  "But don't you have to give that answer?",
  "But in that case, the only thing the State was doing was taxing. Here in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, in the case we've got, the State is also participating in a bond market.",
  "Why do we draw that line? I mean, you -- a moment ago you were talking about the -- the realities of subsidy. Why don't we confront the realities of -- of the fact that the State's participation in the bond market and the -- and the tax exemption go together hand in hand? It's unrealistic to divide them.",
  "So what? The economic reality is precisely the same.",
  "Not constitutionally, we have said, in cases in which the State is not acting purely as the regulator. Here the State is not acting purely as the regulator. The State has a dual capacity, and you say ignore one side of that capacity for the other; and my question is why?",
  "Yes, but it's not taxing an out-of-State commodity in the sense of a commodity which is manufactured or produced out-of-State.",
  "In which case the State was not a participant, but the State is here.",
  "No. Please.",
  "And this situation is somewhere in between the two. Because although we do not have what in form is a subsidy, we have what in economic reality is a subsidy for the benefit of the State's own activity as a bond issuer. So the question again is, why do we accept your characterization that this case should be treated exactly as if the State were acting merely in a regulatory capacity?",
  "And the whole purpose of - - of the combined effect of market participant for the - - acting for the purpose of providing an essentially governmental service is to give the State a free hand. Why do we ignore that in your argument in favor simply of the regulatory side?",
  "But the question is whether it will be treated as we treat a facially discriminatory tax when there is no market participation, there is no State participation for the purpose of providing a fundamental governmental service. If -- if in fact there is a good reason to treat them differently, then we don't follow the -- the facial discrimination test. Let me -- let me ask a -- a question with that as the premise. Assuming -- and I obviously do assume -- that we have a choice of analysis here, one good reason to choose the analysis that your brother has -- that the State is forwarding is the fact that we have historically a bond market which has grown up since New York issued the first tax-exempt or -- a bond.",
  "And we have an enormous market, the effect of interrupting which we really, as a Court, cannot tell very much. And that seems to me a very good reason to give the nod to the -- to the market participant, the essential services side of what the State is doing, as opposed to the regulatory side, and simply confront the thing under Pike. Why isn't that a good reason?",
  "Why -- why should the - - the filing fee penalty, in effect, go to the plaintiff when it wasn't the plaintiff's fault?",
  "May I interrupt you to this extent: As I understand it, if -- your position, if the plaintiff had filed on Form 5 and the EEOC had done nothing and the plaintiff then brought suit, you'd be making the same argument.",
  "How is it -- how is it new? I thought that you argued for that test in the court of appeals.",
  "Well, didn't -- didn't your brief say that was the appropriate test?",
  "Well, you -- I know you're bound by precedent, but if you think it's wrong, you can say it's wrong. And, as I understand, you did not say it was wrong; you adopted it.",
  "Well, there may be none, but if the -- if the employee indicates by the box checked that the employee does not want the company to know that the employee is making whatever this is, this statement - -",
  "-- how can it be regarded as a charge against the employer which sets in effect a litigation process?",
  "But you're okay because on that criterion your -- your client said, yes, you can tell them?",
  "Okay.",
  "It's not that you don't need Section 9. You want to get rid of Section 9 - -",
  "-- because Section 9 on its face seems to provide the opposite to what you're asking. Isn't that the problem?",
  "Why isn't -- I mean the argument that it is meant to be controlling is an argument, first, for the plain language.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Section 9.",
  "Number one, the plain language of the statute. Number two, an argument that that plain language, as a matter of historical fact, was deliberately chosen when Congress made a choice between two different, basic arbitration schemes. And they chose the arbitration scheme that, in effect, does not allow the -- the kind of variation that you're talking about. So they say the language is plain; the intent behind the language is plain. It is restrictive, and you can't do that. What is your response, in effect, to the plain language construed in terms of the historical argument?",
  "Well, it may not -- it may not say it for the simple reason that it says unequivocally what should happen, and you are asking for a variation on what it unequivocally provides. That may be the reason it does not go into contingencies.",
  "All right. But you're - - you're ignoring -- when you say that, you're ignoring the development of arbitration in the period after Justice Story; and you are ignoring the argument that the other side makes that a deliberate choice was made between two generally understood arbitration, statutory arbitration, schemes, and they choose -- they chose the one that is inconsistent with your position.",
  "Then how can you get any award enforced, even subject to your terms?",
  "Then you have to grapple with the question whether in fact under Section 2 you can provide for confirmation in a manner consistent with the provision for confirmation under Section 9.",
  "You simply -- I -- I don't -- maybe I'm missing something, but you seem to stand there and just say baldly: Section 9 doesn't apply. It doesn't apply, you've repeated that several times. And I at least don't know why it doesn't apply.",
  "Okay. And what you are arguing is: At this point, even though we didn't agree within the meaning of the preamble to the first sentence --",
  "-- we still have a right to have the award confirmed and enforced - -",
  "-- because we agreed to it under Section 2.",
  "And the question, I think, is when you argue in that fashion: Do you have a right under Section 2 to provide for confirmation and enforcement under terms which are inconsistent with the provision in Section 9. And I think that's the -- that's the question you've got to answer.",
  "The -- the cases - -",
  "The intent of the parties that's being enforced in those myriad cases is the intent of the parties to arbitrate. I don't believe any of those cases respond to the -- to the issue that we've got before us. And the issue we've got before us as you are now framing it is this: If you do not have a provision within the meaning of the first sentence of Section 9 - -",
  "-- for consummation and enforcement - -",
  "-- but you have a different contractual provision and its terms are different from the enforcement terms under Section 9 - -",
  "-- can that contract be recognized? Do you have a right, in effect, to modify the statute?",
  "And that's what you've got to come to grips with. And - -",
  "No, but it does not answer that question simply to say there are lots of cases saying that the intent of the parties to arbitrate should be enforced. This is a more specific question.",
  "Where do you -- do you have a case that says every facet of the agreement, no matter how inconsistent arguably with other sections of the statute?",
  "No, you don't.",
  "That's why we've got this case here.",
  "Okay, but - -",
  "If we do that, we've got to dispose of the red herring. So you're going to come back to that?",
  "What do you say to Mr. Phillips' argument that, within the meaning of the first sentence of Section 9, you don't have any agreement at all; and, therefore, you have no right to enforce anything? I take it that's not the position you took below, and that's not the position you're taking here, but how do you answer him?",
  "No, but the question is still here: Why should there be a limit if the parties themselves agree? Because if they didn't come in under arbitration and they simply came in under contract or whatever the causes of action might be in a diversity case, the court would have to be dealing with these issues anyway.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "That's true in any diversity case.",
  "Okay, why didn't Congress give any guidance? One suggestion that the Chief Justice made, and it played through my mind, is maybe the -- what seemed to be the plain language limits in Section 9 represent not necessarily a kind of policy choice in a perfect world, but a political policy choice. Maybe that was the term as you -- as you read Section 9, maybe that was the term upon which the act could be passed.",
  "We will, in effect -- we will say: Look, you got to enforce these contracts, arbitration contracts, but you don't have to go one step further. Maybe that was the political deal. Is there any indication that that was the case and that's the explanation for this limit?",
  "What do you say about her argument that we are limited in considering your argument by the severability ruling that you didn't appeal?",
  "No, but it does -- it does preclude -- I mean, her answer is an answer to the argument that you were making in response to a question of mine earlier, that in fact you don't have an agreement within the meaning of the preamble portion of Section 9. She says you do because you have one after severance and you didn't appeal severability.",
  "Wouldn't the theory be that if ultimately the other accounts could be robbed to sort of make up for at least part of the loss of this one, that for a loss to any account is a threat to all the others?",
  "Well, that is an oddity but what do you say to Mr. Roberts' argument that the only recovery under (a)(1)(B) is against the plan, and the plan doesn't have the money in the account so that if there is going to be any relief it's got to come from the fiduciary and that gets you into (2).",
  "Okay, but we've got to assume at this point that we've -- we've got a -- a Section (2) claim before us and the argument simply is, is that in effect to be disallowed because it should have been an (a)(1)(B) claim? And the argument that the United States has made, the argument that the other side has made is, we cannot get to any money under (a)(1)(B). We've got to get that from the fiduciary and we can only do that under (2).",
  "Well, the argument of the United States is you can't rob Peter to pay Paul, so that if in fact his account didn't have the money, the plan didn't have any place to get the money, and the only way the money could be had would have been from a fiduciary, which again gets you to subsection (2).",
  "Okay. But it seems to me you're answering a different question in that response. The argument here is basically an argument between the possibility -- an argument based on the claim that under (a)(1)(B) you can't go against the fiduciary. The only way you can get the money is from a fiduciary and therefore (a)(1)(B) would have been of no value to you. Do you -- do you take issue with that premise?",
  "Okay, then doesn't that leave you in the position of having to say that you've either got to bring the claim under (a)(1)(B), or you've got -- subsection (2) -- or you've got to bring it under subsection (3)?",
  "And the answer, if the premise you have just agreed to is correct, will be, \"you bet. He is entitled to have another $150,000 in his account for the benefit of future payments to him.\"",
  "\"But we haven't got the money and we can't rob Peter to pay Paul and therefore we are very sorry, go away.\" That would necessarily be the answer.",
  "But that's going to the - - it seems to -- with respect, I think that's going to the merits. And the question is, if you can recover against anybody, the claim is, the argument is you're going to get nowhere under (a)(1)(B) because the plan can't help you by itself. The only way you can get any value from your lawsuit is by going against the fiduciary. Maybe you have good reasons to defend that, but if you're going to have a suit against anyone, it's got to be under subsection (2).",
  "And they're saying they are careful and interrelated provisions mean that you got to go under subsection (2).",
  "And you're I think saying, we -- we agree with you that ultimately (1)(B) couldn't get you any relief because the fiduciary -- the plan doesn't have any money. And you're now arguing, well, if you go against the fiduciary, ultimately we have a good defense to that. But the fact is, the question before us is whom do you sue and under what -- under what section? And I think your own logic forces you to say that -- that has got to be subsection (2).",
  "Well, it hasn't been reached yet, has it?",
  "No, but you're arguing that ultimately he couldn't prove damages. We're talking about allegations at the pleading stage. Let me ask you a slightly different question. You said there's no -- there's no, as Justice Scalia put it, there's no slush fund; there's no pooled assets here. All the assets are assets which are accounted for, attributable to, individual accounts. Therefore there can be no -- there can be no loss to the plan which is not a loss to an individual account, can there be?",
  "Then what is your theory on how we determine whether a loss to the plan from an individual account suffices as a loss to the plan for purposes of pleading? Has it got to be, you know, 500 losses out of 1000? I don't see why that should make a difference. I'm going back to Justice Breyer's question.",
  "No, but why doesn't the - -",
  "There's something I'm not understanding about your argument. When you say the nature of the fiduciary breach pleaded is what makes the difference, I am understanding you to be answering the question whether on the merits ultimately there will be a -- they will be able to make out a claim. And I am saying, as I said once before, that that seems to me a question that comes after you answer the question before us. And the question before us is not whether ultimately you've stated a winning claim, but whether ultimately -- whether right now you have stated a claim for a loss to the plan. Now, that is not your view. Why is it that I am taking your answer to be an answer on the merits to a different question and you're saying my answer, i.e., nature of duty breached or -- is one that goes to the question of pleading at this stage?",
  "If you do that in two accounts is that enough?",
  "Why not one?",
  "If it -- if it is the - - and I still don't get this, but if it is the nature of the particular dereliction in duty that counts, why do we need more than one?",
  "It's an individualistic kind of breach when it is viewed as -- as only one account, but it is a breach against the plan when it is understood that there is nothing to the plan except an aggregation of accounts. You can't have a breach against one without a breach against the plan.",
  "Then why, if that is your answer, why does it matter what the nature of the dereliction is? Because you're -- you're saying the - - the really important question is the nature of the dereliction. If it is, then I don't see why the multiple of the number of accounts affected has anything to do with it.",
  "And then you've got a lot of plaintiffs but what difference does it make?",
  "That may be close to the way you read it, but why is your reading correct? Why should that make any difference?",
  "Which will -- which will get him nothing.",
  "Yes, but it's the individual who has to file the 1040. What the trustee is filing is the 1041. And -- and why do you place -- I was going to ask the same question that Justice Alito did, and that is why do you place so much significance either in the label, i.e., it's fiduciary return, or in the peculiar fact that it is a fiduciary who is filing that return? It's a tax return and -- and I think your - - the government's argument is that with respect to -- to other items that may be disputed, you should regard them at a fairly general level, i.e., investment advice, not fiduciary investment advice. But when you come to the tax return, you don't regard it as a general -- at a general level; you regard it at a very specific level, i.e., a fiduciary tax return. It seems to me that the government with respect to the tax return is doing exactly what it criticizes the taxpayer for doing with respect to investment advice. And I don't understand the distinction.",
  "Well, it's the only tax return that the fiduciary has to file; isn't that correct? The fiduciary files that tax return and the beneficiary files a 1040.",
  "But the only return the fiduciary's filing is the 1041; isn't that right?",
  "Okay; I understand that that is a factual difference, but I don't understand what it is that makes that a difference in principle.",
  "Well, can't you ask it - - can't -- can't you ask this question pointing towards something unique: If the individual investor does a very poor job of managing his investments, all he can ultimately do is cry about it. But if the trustee does a very poor job, the trustee is going to get sued. So that when the trustee asks for an investment advisor's advice, the trustee is addressing an issue that the individual does not have. The trustee wants to be covered. He also, I presume, wants to be a good trustee. But he is in fact doing something which is, to use your phrase, in addition to what the individual investor would do. He is looking out for somebody else and he is looking out for himself if the investment goes south. Why isn't that a sufficient difference that is at least comparable to the difference that you talk about in the filing of a fiduciary tax return?",
  "Yes, but whether -- whether he gets socked with damages or not is going to depend in part whether he is covered by an investment advisor's bit of advice; and that is -- that is a different item in the calculus of liability. He is providing for something that the individual investor does not provide for or need to provide for.",
  "So your -- your argument -- it seems to me it's not that easy, because your argument is assuming that by virtue of the \"may continue\" language, the State of New Jersey acquires a new power, and the new power in effect is to -- is to make grants of subaqueous land that belonged not to New Jersey but to Delaware, and that's the stretch. It -- it seems to me that that is such an extraordinary position or proposition, that you've got to have something more specific than \"may continue\" in order to construe that as meaning an agreement which was intended to give New Jersey the power to grant away Delaware land.",
  "No, I'm simply saying that your position -- and I accept your position -- that the Compact is intended to continue to operate whether or not the boundary is -- is ultimately determined, and if so, after it is ultimately determined -- and once we get to that point of continuing to operate after, then necessarily the only way it can operate on your theory is to give New Jersey the power to grant Delaware land. And if New Jersey has that power, it must have been a power that was intended in the 1905 Compact, and that intent strikes me as a very extraordinary intent; and -- and my -- the point of my question was the application of the Compact in the new circumstances, as you claim it to be, would be so extraordinary that you ought to have language more specific than \"may continue\" in order to establish that extraordinary result.",
  "Well, if you emphasize \"under its laws,\" then don't you lose? Because New Jersey does not -- I presume New Jersey does not have law, for example, in its constitution, providing that it can grant Delaware land.",
  "But I'm going on the assumption that it, in fact, had jurisdiction; that it had land below -- beyond the low-water mark.",
  "It didn't so much lose -- I mean it had a generalized recognition of power. In order to exercise that power, it had to possess certain attributes, i.e., land. Once it lost that land, it had nothing to exercise the power over. In fact, it had a little bit left. It had the distance between the high- and the low-water marks, so it still had the power. But the -- the recognition of the power in 1905 was, in effect, a formula; and the formula depends on facts to be applied; and the facts changed once the boundary was determined.",
  "What if Delaware took the position that there simply is the maximum amount of allowable building in the river, and from now on it will not, in fact, agree to grant, authorize, whatever the title is, any further wharves and piers on New Jersey's side? Does Delaware have the authority to do that?",
  "It's passed a statute.",
  "Is the statute effective?",
  "I'm talking about a new statute. Delaware says enough is enough; no more wharfs and piers from the New Jersey side. Is that statute effective and enforceable?",
  "But, Mr. Frederick, if the -- if the legislature of Delaware passes that statute, I assume they intend it to mean what it says. And as against a claim by New Jersey or on behalf of a New Jersey grantee, is that Delaware statute effective?",
  "It depends on what?",
  "Forget the Federal right now. We're talking about construing a compact. So far as this Compact is concerned, so far as the domestic laws of the two states, New Jersey and Delaware, are concerned, would the Delaware statute be effective?",
  "I'm not asking you what Delaware would say. I think I can imagine what Delaware would say. I want to know whether Delaware would prevail when it got here --",
  "-- in your view?",
  "Why?",
  "Well, that is before there was all these wharves were out here, and Delaware is now saying the facts have changed.",
  "But again, you're changing the hypothetical. Your answer, I -- the answer that you just gave, I presume would be the same whether Delaware had passed any particular statute regarding wharfage from the New Jersey side or whether it had -- you were giving an answer which took into consideration the Compact but which basically depended upon we'll call it the general riparian law. The question, however, is the effectiveness of a Delaware statute directed specifically to this issue that says \"no more.\"",
  "Well, that's the question.",
  "Then your answer to Justice Alito is, tell me more about the circumstances and I will then give you an answer.",
  "Well, I understood your earlier answer to be exactly what Justice Scalia said. Are you now saying that Delaware can prevent it only on the grounds of preventing a nuisance?",
  "I'm not saying whether that would be a classic exercise. Is that the only circumstance in which it can be exercised, or conversely, does Delaware have the authority to say no simply because it says no? I thought your answer the first time around finally was the latter. It can say no. And I think that's what my brother Scalia thought. Now are you saying it can say no only if there is a nuisance or some other specified reason?",
  "And it can limit it, I presume, subject to some reasonable rule of health and safety?",
  "Okay. It simply cannot say as a matter of legislative view case no more wharfs?",
  "But isn't that answering the wrong question? I'll be candid with you. I'm not sure that whatever Morales-Travelers distinction there is really counts here, because the issue here is different from the issue in some of the -- in most of the preemption cases, because the issue here starts with the, I think, the agreed assumption that Congress wanted to end a certain category of regulation. And the question is would Congress have wanted, in effect, to permit a degree of State regulation when it was for a particular purpose? And the question then is not whether Congress intended or had as an object when it passed this statute an interference with the State's regulation of juvenile contraband. The question is whether it intended to permit any regulation with respect to delivery services to survive; and isn't that the tough question that you've got to face?",
  "That's because most regulation, you know, has an economic purpose involved. But the ultimate object, it seems to me, was to end the economic effects of State patchwork transportation regulation. And therefore I think the question you've got to address is why would they have allowed a certain category of regulation that clearly affects the way these companies perform their services to survive solely on the ground that the regulation was entailed at the State level by the State's choice to go against youthful tobacco use?",
  "But the Synar -- I don't have it in front of me, but the Synar Amendment refers to -- to a number of objects of State legislation that would be required, but it doesn't say anything about regulating transportation.",
  "Right. And we don't normally think of a delivery service as a distributor of goods. I mean, we -- in the sense, I think, that the statute meant. I -- I read the Synar Amendment reference to distributors as being wholesalers, people within the industry who get the cigarettes from, you know, the manufacturing point to the corner store, as opposed simply to a delivery service that delivers all kinds of goods.",
  "They concede that they can do it beyond the requirement, beyond the force of the statute that precludes the knowing distribution. In other words, they -- they're not appealing the one provision of subsection D that makes it a crime knowingly to get the tobacco into the hands of minors and so on, but do they concede anything beyond that?",
  "Well, you prove it without a presumption to start with. That's what the -- that's way the issue was left by the district court.",
  "Mr. Stern, when you say that it takes one second to -- I forget whether you said scan or -- or examine a label, do you -- are you describing simply the physical act of a human being looking at the label?",
  "You can't tell unless you have an extraordinary memory for all the names on the Attorney General's list. You can't do that simply by looking at the label. And I -- I thought maybe what you meant by the one second was that the list was -- was in a computer, and you had a mechanical device that scanned the -- the name on the label and -- and it either matched something in the computer, or it didn't. But I take it you are talking about physical, visual inspection.",
  "No, I -- I just wanted to know what you meant by the \"one second.\" I take it what you mean is there is a physical, visual inspection of the label. And in that one second, in practical terms, the person looking can tell whether the name is on the Attorney General's list, because there will be some tipoff in the -- in the name of the company that -- that will alert him?",
  "Okay. But - -",
  "If someone on the unapproved list wants to -- for whatever reason, wants to avoid a tipoff term like incorporating the term \"tobacco\" on to their label, then the person making the one-second inspection is not going to pick it up. And the only way the company is going to be able to protect itself against the imputed knowledge is either by a visual inspection of the Attorney General's list to see whether it matches what the person is looking at or by some computer scan, right?",
  "Well, to the extent it was grounded on 401, it was error, wasn't it?",
  "Well, if you have three supervisors, and one is discriminating and another is discriminating, isn't that some evidence that you're in an industrial situation in which discrimination goes on, and therefore doesn't it have the tendency that amounts to relevance under 401?",
  "Well, what about my question?",
  "No relevance at all?",
  "What about my question? We have evidence that there are three supervisors, two of them are discriminating. Isn't that some -- doesn't that have some tendency to indicate that in an equivocal situation, that one was -- it may not be strong evidence, it may not win the case, it may not be powerful, but it has the tendency that gets you over the line on 401, doesn't it?",
  "I don't want to -- I don't want to emphasize my question, before we get the - -",
  "What if you've got 20 supervisors and you've got evidence that 19 of them have discriminated after making expressly discriminatory remarks. The 20th is the subject to the action. Is the evidence of the 19 admissible?",
  "Is a nexus there?",
  "All right. So, if we've got 19 and there's a question of 1, we've got a nexus. If we've got three and there's a question, two are accounted for as discriminatory, and the question is the third, we don't have a nexus. Is that the way you're doing the math?",
  "At this point, I'm saying three supervisors out of a whole company. Will that do it?",
  "Three supervisors, and that's all there is in the company. That consists of the company. Have a nexus then?",
  "Okay.",
  "How do we know?",
  "May I ask you to elaborate on that somewhat?",
  "I went through to kind of pin down what the facts of consequence were. I went through the offer of proof. I don't have my notes in front of me, but I think my recollection is right on this. It struck me that the admissible evidence that was indicated by the offer of proof boils down basically to this: There were three employees who would testify that, following their dismissal, some or all of their work was done by a younger person.",
  "There was one employee who would testify that he received -- she saw a spreadsheet in front of one supervisor that indicated age. There was one employee who would testify that her immediate supervisor had made age-discriminatory remarks. And another employee would testify that her supervisor's boss had made age-discriminatory remarks. Now, basically, out of this company of 70,000, that seems to be the sum total of the -- the kind of circumstantial evidence of culture that you presented in the offer of proof. Am I selling your offer of proof short here?",
  "Let's assume the testimony at least shows these points that you and I agreed the offer of proof offers to prove. They're going to be met -- I think it's reasonable to suppose, they're going to be met by counter-evidence.",
  "We're going to have litigation on these points, and they're going to take - - in effect, become subsidiary chapters in this trial. And what concerns me, I guess, is that, at the end of the day, it's -- it strikes me as though there is reason to believe that the proof itself is not going to be anything close to overwhelming. We will have had a potentially confusing trial on this subsidiary third-party evidence. And we seem to be very close, if we have not gotten over the line, of the subsidiary evidence, in effect, being substantially misleading or prejudicial. And -- and basically I'm raising a question of weight under 403. What's your response to that?",
  "Doesn't that get to the point, though, hasn't the last hour of questioning from the court shown that what we really ought to take place here is a remand to the trial court for a 403 balance?",
  "Okay.",
  "There -- there isn't much reason, is there, to think that the trial court was being very critical of the prosecutor's answers? My recollection is that, after the O. J. Simpson remark had been made in final argument, that the ultimate resolution of that involved the trial judge saying that one reason that was not a racially significant remark was that the prosecutor had neither -- had mentioned neither the race of the defendant nor the race of O. J. Simpson. Now that is not a critical mind at work, is it?",
  "And because - -",
  "And because you suppose not and I certainly suppose not, the -- the fact is that we have to -- we have to consider the O. J. Simpson remark in trying to evaluate what went on, in trying to evaluate, for example, the lack of critical follow-up in -- in a disparate way by the prosecutor. And that, in fact, is a fair and potent argument that the other side has, isn't it?",
  "Do you believe that, if there had been a white defendant here, the O. J. Simpson case would have been mentioned?",
  "See, I'd be candid -- I will be candid to say to you, under the -- under the circumstances of the record in front of us, I find that highly unlikely. And because I find that highly unlikely, I put significance in the O. J. Simpson remark which even you concede is significant.",
  "Well, do you -- do you believe that it would have been appropriate at that point for the prosecutor to invoke in his argument any case from any state in which a criminal defendant had unsuccessfully feigned insanity as a reason to decide - - for the jurors to decide that this defendant is -- is feigning insanity?",
  "Brooks says okay.",
  "Well, I wouldn't take it at face value if there had been a further question asked of Mr. Brooks saying, are you really satisfied you have nothing to worry about? And he says well, gee, boy, I sure hope I -- I'm able to make that requirement. But nobody asked that question.",
  "All we have is got is \"okay\" on the one hand and \"I can make arrangements\" on other.",
  "He knew nothing about that juror except what Justice Stevens and you have just been reciting. If that's all you knew and you were a prosecutor, would you have struck him? Would you have said: I don't want -- I don't want anybody on this jury who's got friends in the police department? Would you have struck him for that reason?",
  "How about you?",
  "Would you -- would you have gotten rid of him? Would you have said: I don't want any cop lovers on my jury?",
  "No, you wouldn't have, and neither would I.",
  "Mr. Olson, that still leaves the -- sort of the hiatus that Justice Kennedy's question was addressed to. And I -- I don't think I understand your answer to it. His question was what if the manufacturer has learned that there is -- that there's a problem that somebody hadn't anticipated? The manufacturer has told the FDA, and the FDA has not yet acted. Leave open the question of whether the FDA is slow or whether it just takes time, but there's a - - there's a hiatus here. And an injury occurs because of marketing that took place during the hiatus. Does preemption still apply?",
  "Okay.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, let me ask you to -- a textual question which perhaps would be better directed to counsel for the Petitioner, but let me get your take on it. If the only objective in the -- in the preemption clause were to preclude State PMA in addition to Federal PMA, there would have been no reason to include the phrase -- would there have been any reason to include a preclusion of a requirement that is different from in addition to a preclusion of something which is in addition to?",
  "\"Addition to\" would be - -",
  "Okay.",
  "And how do you draw the line between those instances and the ones that you say are not preempted?",
  "They -- they were requirements, in other words, of positive law? They were State regulations?",
  "So the - -",
  "Okay. So the line is simply enactment of positive law versus jury award? That's the line?",
  "No, I just want to make sure - -",
  "-- what your position is. That is where you draw the line then?",
  "Okay.",
  "Is that possible for your -- let's say your six clients at this point or for any of the Guantanamo detainees, I guess, because wouldn't they all run into the problem of -- the neutrality problem that you raised? The commanding general, the Secretary of Defense, in effect, have already said these people belong where they are. Wouldn't that make it impossible, really, at this stage of the game to substitute a military procedure?",
  "I understand that.",
  "I'm just wondering whether assuming you win this case, that would be an appropriate form of relief. And I'm not sure --",
  "I have a quick question. I don't want to interfere with his five minutes of rebuttal.",
  "I mean is that personal representative also under an obligation to report back to the military anything that might be unfavorable to the person he is supposedly representing?",
  "So he's not -- he is not in the position of counsel, as we understand the term.",
  "But doesn't the resort to the All Writs Act beg the question? And that is -- I mean the All Writs Act is there to protect jurisdiction, and the question is whether there is jurisdiction to release. And you say there no textual impediment to it; and, yet, we know -- I forget which brief it was in -- from one of the briefs the -- the instance of the prisoner Ali, one of the Chinese -- is it \"Uigars\"? Is that how it is pronounced?",
  "Who was one of what, 12 or 13, who was found not to be an enemy combatant, and the Government's position there was: Go back and do it again in front of another tribunal, another panel, which, in fact, conveniently found that he was. So the practice of -- of the Government, it seems to me, has clearly been to deny the right to release.",
  "Okay. It was a practical problem. But the fact is that the effectiveness of habeas jurisdiction, for example, in requiring new trials, and so on, depends upon the ultimate sanction, which is the authority of the court to let somebody go if the Government does not comply with a condition. And the -- the Government practice so far under the DTA seems quite contrary to that.",
  "But aren't you simply rearguing Rasul?",
  "We have passed that point; haven't we?",
  "It -- it -- it wasn't, and I didn't want to get into the prisoner of war point. But if you want to get into it, the problem with your prisoner of war point is the United States is not treating them as prisoners of war. They have not been adjudicated prisoners of war, or otherwise, under the Third Geneva Convention, and that argument on the Government's part is entirely circular.",
  "And the three Spanish soldiers were -- were ultimately found to be prisoners of war, And, yet, they had process to get into court. There was no question of the jurisdiction of an English court to entertain their claim.",
  "The relief was denied.",
  "That had a hearing under the writ.",
  "Then how did the court ever come to the conclusion that, in fact, they were prisoners of war?",
  "On their -- on their own showing, but, in fact, the proceeding did not end until the court had come to that conclusion. It was not a conclusion that the court assumed simply on the basis of a Government claim in the return to the writ.",
  "On the basis of a Government claim formally or informally proffered to the Court. They -- they came to that conclusion, as you said, based on the -- on the prisoners' own showing. But the court certainly -- there is no authority in the prisoner of war case for saying that if the Government make as claim that one is a prisoner of war -- contrary to the Government's prior position, incidentally -- that that forecloses the possibility of consideration under the writ -- the petition as filed.",
  "Well, was that because they were reflecting 1789 practice, or because they were reflecting the Defense of the Realm Act? I don't know the answer to that.",
  "Unless you can answer my question, we don't know what the snapshot proves.",
  "They were exercising habeas jurisdiction in a court -- in a polity in which Parliament is supreme and Parliament had already passed the Defense of the Realm Act, and I don't -- I mean it. I don't know the answer to the question I asked you. But I think unless we have an answer to that, we don't have a reliable clue as to the understanding of the English courts at a time that's relevant to our inquiry.",
  "And you are operating today under a broader concept, as I understand it, of \"enemy combatant\"?",
  "Than was indeed the case for example in our early litigation, let alone at the time of Kirin.",
  "But how can -- and this again, maybe I should know the answer to this, but I don't. How could that be litigated under the DTA? Doesn't any proceeding under the DTA simply have to accept the statutory definition?",
  "You mean -- you're saying if it gets to the court of appeals, they can raise the constitutional claim that the definition is broader than constitutionally could be enforced. Is that what you're saying?",
  "If you win, we never get to these issues.",
  "You can't win without reversing the Court of Appeals.",
  "If we affirmed on alternative grounds, leaving the court of appeals' reasoning as it stands, these interesting questions that you referred to will never arise.",
  "Why would they litigate that adequacy if they have determined in advance that substantively the individuals who are petitioning have absolutely no rights?",
  "At the end of the day, the only thing, as I understand it, that could possibly be adjudicated would be the question of formal adherence to procedure or not. There would never be an adjudication that ever went to the merits because the merits issue, as I understand it, is already -- I mean merits of relief -- have already been prior admitted by the existing determination of the circuit in this case.",
  "You were arguing that the question of the adequacy of the substitution should, in fact, be litigated in a plenary fashion in the Court of Appeals or the district court for that matter?",
  "I thought you said a moment ago that there were all of these interesting questions that could be explored if there was a remand?",
  "Maybe I misunderstood you.",
  "You are talking about in effect about evidentiary procedural questions?",
  "But it wasn't directly challenged here, was it?",
  "That regulation was not directly challenged in this case?",
  "Mr. Meade, why was your client not allowed to withdraw the voluntary departure option, withdraw from it?",
  "So all we have on the record is just an IJ's determination that he would not accept it?",
  "But at the time he filed, he had not overstayed, because he filed on Friday afternoon, right?",
  "So -- so maybe the point is we didn't have time to rule on it simply because he filed it on Friday afternoon and he had to leave on Sunday, and therefore, we should not take that as a determination that had he filed in time for timely action by the court he would have been denied.",
  "Well, that may be. But Congress passed a statute that grants a statutory right to file a motion to reopen no matter what the relief is. And the thing that seems strange to me, I guess to carry Justice Scalia's question one step further, is what seems strange to me is that Congress would have granted that right in effect across the board, regardless of what the reason for the reopening might be and yet would have done so knowing that the, that the time for adjudication before the IJ is likely to take longer than the period of the, prior to the moment of required departure. It sounds as though Congress on your view would be -- would have been giving a right to reopen that in practical terms in most cases will avail the alien absolutely nothing because he'll have to get out before there can be an adjudication.",
  "Why?",
  "Okay, but isn't the question in this case whether what Congress did was as modest as you say? Because if it is as modest as you say, then in at least a substantial category of cases in which a motion to reopen will be filed, it will in fact be no time in the real world to act on that motion before the voluntary departure date. And the question is did Congress really intend a right to reopen that is as modest as that.",
  "And it seems strange that it would have.",
  "Well, it was -- was the regulation -- was the current regulation in place at the time of the '96 Act, that the -- that the departure of the alien, whatever the term is, waives the motion to - -",
  "So, we assume that Congress knew that.",
  "Okay, then Congress knew at the time of the '96 Act that, if in fact the motion to reopen was filed in the normal course, it probably couldn't be heard prior to the date at which (a) the alien either will overstay and be in trouble for that or (b) will have departed and, under the existing regulatory regime, have forfeited his right to reopen. And it's the strangeness that Congress would want - - would have wanted to extend the right to reopen to a statutory level under these circumstances unless it contemplated some kind of a tolling scheme that would avoid this sort of Kafka-esque result.",
  "Yes, but you can't get to court if you haven't been to the BIA, right?",
  "And, again, we are talking about a short period of time, like 30 days. In practical terms there's no way he is going to get through the BIA in 30 days. And, therefore, when he leaves the country, he cannot then try to get or complete his BIA review, and he therefore will have no chance to get into court, right?",
  "There's no reason to assume that you could.",
  "And by doing that you do preserve your right to appeal; and you will preserve your -- will you also preserve your right to go to court if you lose in front of the BIA.",
  "Okay. We got that straight.",
  "Is there any reason he could not unilaterally relinquish the voluntary departure status as distinct from having to get approval from the Board or bureaucrat?",
  "Well, I know it doesn't - - it doesn't address the issue, and my question is - -",
  "Why?",
  "No, but the Board is saying, look, I'm granting your request -- we are granting your request for a voluntary departure status and there are certain consequences that that status carries. He is saying, on my hypothesis, I relinquish that status. Why are conditions that attach when he has the status an indication that he cannot voluntarily relinquish that status without further action by the Board?",
  "Mr. Verrilli, are we in the difficult position in hearing your answers that, in effect, we're being asked to make findings of fact about the availability of medical personnel and the feasibility of training and so on that the trial court never made because it didn't think it had to make a comparative analysis here, so that if, in fact, the comparative analysis is crucial to the case, we should send the thing back for factfinding by a trial judge rather than trying to do it here. Should we remand if we accept your argument?",
  "May I ask you another question?",
  "May I ask another question about the state of the evidence. It really goes to an understanding of your position that was discussed a little bit earlier about the preferability of simply barbiturate dose as opposed to the three-drug combination. You said a moment ago that the evidence was -- and I think it was undisputed evidence -- that three grams of the barbiturate actually used would be sufficient to cause death; is that correct.",
  "And that was undisputed?",
  "Okay.",
  "So that if the current three-gram dosage were used and the second and third drugs were not administered, death would occur based on the undisputed evidence in this case.",
  "Secondly, my understanding, my recollection, is that in a couple of places in your brief, one at least, you referred to the preferability of administering a, and I think the term was, massive dose of barbiturate, which I took to mean more than the three grams. Is that what you meant?",
  "That is the massive dose.",
  "Is there any evidence in the record about what the enhanced dose would appropriately be if you decided or if a protocol author decided that there would be no chance whatsoever that death would not occur, and the amount should be greater than three grams? Was there any evidence in the record about how much there ought to be if you were going to go above three grams?",
  "I take it this is obvious, but I wondered when I went through the brief. I assume this phlebotomist is not an MD?",
  "What is the training? I mean, \"phlebotomist\" is somebody who works with veins, I take it. What is the training?",
  "So it's somebody like the Red Cross worker who puts in the needle when somebody donates blood.",
  "Well, isn't it required by Kentucky law?",
  "Okay, so something more is involved than merely veterinary practice.",
  "Right. But in the setting of Kentucky law the legislature of Kentucky has said we are going to make this a legal requirement and I assume they had some reason for it other than the fact that vets do it that way.",
  "Why was that necessary to pass a law if the standard veterinary practice was not to use T I'm obviously trying to get to what evidence we have here for a finding somewhere that we can take into consideration that there is a comparative benefit under the, under the veterinary practice as distinct from the protocol which has been devised so isn't it reasonable to suppose that the Kentucky legislature needs some kind of a finding came to some kind of a conclusion that in fact there was /SEUG deleterious about using the second drug.",
  "Okay.",
  "The only cost correct me if I'm wrong but the only cost that you have identified in using the one drug only are number one, the appearance cost which you equated with dignity in your response to Justice Stevens and number two, the possibility and I don't know how strong a possibility but the possibility that the one drug would not work. Is there any other cost? In using one drug.",
  "And I take it you don't have a figure for that Justice Stevens said 10 minutes and I don't think you had a clear answer one way or the other as to whether there was likely to be more.",
  "And 30 minutes is against some risk of excruciating pain is, that in effect is it reasonable to say 30 minutes is too long.",
  "Is your point that there is simply no quantification of what that risk is.",
  "Okay what's your.",
  "So the nub of your argument really is they have not made a case or they do not have a record case for any significant likelihood of excruciating pain is this.",
  "What do you say to the response which I think was in the briefs that the substantiality requirement has been derived in the course of conditions of confinement -- sort of litigation -- and we really should regard execution as sort of a -- a separate subject for purposes of coming up with a standard. What do you say to that?",
  "Well, we did for purposes of making a habeas 1983 distinction, but I -- is the distinction supportable when we come down to the question whether there should be a standard specific to execution as opposed to other conditions?",
  "Yes but if we don't do something like that in this case Mr. Garre another case is going to come along and we are going to be right back here a year from now or 18 months from now and wouldn't it be better to get one case litigated thoroughly and get the issue decided rather than simply wait here for another one to wind its way.",
  "Sure but if we decide it on this basis the next Petitioner is going to say I'm coming into court with evidence these people did not present and therefore we are going to have a new case and new round of litigation and I think what's disturbing Justice Breyer what's disturbing me and others is we want some kind of a decision here, and it seems to me that the most expeditious way of getting it if comparison analysis is appropriate and I will be candid to say I think it is is to send this case back and say okay do a comparative analysis, make the findings and we will then have a case that will in effect resolve the issue as much as one case can ever do.",
  "Would you go back to I think it was to Justice Ginsburg's question about the comparative significance of the waiver here. The paradigm examples of waivers that have to be personal are, you know, waivers of counsel, waivers of the right to put the State to trial. This question of waiving an Article III judge as opposed to an Article III appointed magistrate just does not seem to rise to the significance of -- of the -- of the -- of those other paradigm waivers and what is -- what is your response to that? You started to say that, you know, that the Framers said Article III judges are important because they -- they have independence and so on. But beyond that kind of high theoretical level, is there anything in practical terms that you think brings this kind of a waiver to the point of significance of, say, waiving counsel?",
  "Peretz, also, if I understand the case correctly, equated the waiver with a failure to object. It seems to me that Peretz undercuts your argument.",
  "Well, you say they are ambiguous, but isn't it -- I've reread Peretz after many years getting ready for this argument, and it seems to me that it's difficult to read Peretz without reading the \"waiver failure to object\" phraseology as being equivalent.",
  "Well, except for one thing, and that is, if -- if it is sound to say that Peretz equated \"waiver\" with \"failure to object,\" \"failure to object\" is a -- is a failure, if you will, of counsel, not of the defendant. Defendants don't get up and make objections; counsel do. And, therefore, it seems to me the implication of Peretz is that it would be a -- a decision of the lawyer that would count for constitutional purposes.",
  "No, but the point was you were saying that in fact Peretz cannot be read as authority for the Government's position because the facts in Peretz, quite as you correctly note, were that the -- the client had in fact consented, or that was the representation to the Court. And my point simply was that does not seem to have been the reasoning of the Court, because the reasoning of the Court in equating \"waiver\" with \"failure to object\" was a reasoning that in its reference to \"failure to object\" seemed to pinpoint the actions of the lawyer alone. Clients don't object; lawyers do. A failure to object, therefore, refers to, in effect, a failure by the lawyer, alone; and that would be the only significant datum for constitutional purposes. What is your response to that?",
  "May I ask you a question which is going to come up sooner or later? And it's kind of a threshold question. So, if I may, let me interrupt you with it now. You emphasize the significance of the limiting condition \"with respect to the stock.\" But before you get to that phrase, Section 301 refers to a distribution by the corporation. And my question is this: Let's assume that we -- we accept your -- your position that the circuit was wrong in requiring an offer of proof of intent to return capital. Isn't it also the case that you would still have an obligation, if you're going to take advantage of this section, to offer some evidence with respect to the fact that there was a corporate distribution involved? And as I understand it, your evidence is or the Government's evidence and yours is that, you know, there was skimming, there was misdirection, et cetera, but there was no indication, there's no evidence that there was any distribution, in the normal sense of that word, by a corporation. So it seems to me that if you -- if you win the case in the sense of convincing us that the circuit was wrong with respect to the specific intent requirement, you would still be left without a defense because you have not come forward with any evidence that indicates a distribution. Am I wrong?",
  "Well, it certainly can be, and there's no question about that, but isn't there some point of informality or some point, I guess, of formality or relevance to corporate practice that has to be reached? In other words, he may keep lousy books, he may be very sloppy, but directing funds to one's girlfriend is not the act of a corporation. And it seems to me that the kind of -- of actions that he took to get or to direct the payment of moneys could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as an act of this corporation or of any corporation.",
  "Well, in this case, he's a 50 percent owner, as I understand it. He formed the corporation, but isn't 50 percent of the stock owned by the trust for the love child of him and the girlfriend?",
  "Well, it may be that he cannot embezzle in the sense of committing a separate private act or even a separate, a separate tort that the corporation could object to. But the question still remains -- excuse me -- whether the act of, of taking the money in this unorthodox way could be regarded as a corporate act within the meaning of the term \"distribution.\" And I think I understand your point, but I guess the only point that I'm making is the fact that it may not qualify as embezzlement, civilly or criminally, does not necessarily answer the objection that I'm raising.",
  "That explains why I'm making the argument and the Government wasn't in its brief?",
  "Well, aren't you -- aren't you saying not that the -- that the test of intent that the Ninth Circuit used is, in itself, a sufficient test; but that, rather -- and correct me if I'm wrong, because I thought this was the basis really of your argument. I thought the Government, in effect, was saying in order to treat it as a return of capital, it is a necessary condition that it be intended to be treated as a return of capital. But that is not a sufficient condition, because if, in fact, it turns out, as in Justice Breyer's example, that there are no earnings, then under 301 it can't be treated as -- as a dividend. And only then, under 301, would it be treated as a return of capital. So the conditions are, No. 1 necessary intent; No. 2, a determination at the end of the year that, in fact, there were no earnings. Conversely, if at the end of the year there are profits, even though the first necessary condition, intent, was satisfied, under 301 that would not be enough; and the Government would treat it as income. Isn't that the nub of your position?",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Well I -- let me -- I just want to get clear on how you understand it. I gave you one alternative in which you defend the Ninth Circuit. Justice Scalia has given you another alternative in which you don't defend the Ninth Circuit. Which - - which are you going to take?",
  "Yes, but why talk about that at all? I mean, on Justice Breyer's third and simplest example, he is basically saying let Section 301 make the determination, in effect, at the end of the year, when we know what the actual situation of the corporation is. If you wait and see, 301 takes care of it, and you don't have to get into the -- sort of the metaphysics of intent.",
  "Yes. Distribution with - - distribution with respect to stock.",
  "And I think he was assuming and I'm assuming that -- that that condition is met. But, in order to meet that condition, you don't have to have a specific intent that the -- on the part of the corporation that the distribution either be a return of capital or that the distribution either be a dividend. It simply has to be a distribution to this guy because he is a stockholder.",
  "Okay.",
  "It's income to him. You would be taking a different position if you thought you could attribute it to the corporation and tax the corporation, too.",
  "Right. And if you want to go after the corporation, you are specifically going to take the position in this guy's case that, in fact, it was income to the corporation. If there is no income to the corporation, then you don't care, and that's the situation you're in here.",
  "But it was not profits; it was not taxable income.",
  "It was not taxable income.",
  "I think maybe he was simply getting at the fact that under 301, assuming the possibilities of non-301 treatment are excluded, under 301 it will be treated either as a dividend or as a return of capital, depending on the corporate books for that year, and he wasn't making a proffer at that point precisely as to what those corporate books would show, but he was making a proffer that, under 301, it would either be classified as a dividend or as a return of capital. And wasn't that enough to -- to get him -- get him the right to introduce the evidence?",
  "Well am I -- am I right that all he would have to do in order to satisfy that burden would be this: He would have the option, which I gather he availed himself of, to show that, in fact, the -- the funds were loans or non-income to him. And he would also have had the option to follow that by putting on the corporate accountant saying: This guy is a stockholder. It's what the corporate books show. In fact, that's not in dispute. No. 2, the corporation didn't have any profits that year. No. 3, if the money was diverted, if the money was corporate funds, the only thing left under 301 is to treat it as a return of capital. And if, in fact, the funds exceeded his basis, to treat it as a capital gain. So all he had to do, in effect, to make the proffer, as I understand it, is to say: If you don't believe me that this was non-income like a loan, then all I have to do is to put in the evidence that the corporation didn't have any -- any profits that year, and Section 301 will take care of the rest of it. Because you have to conclude that it's either a return of capital or a capital gain. Is that fair? Is that correct?",
  "But doesn't -- doesn't he suffice, on a going forward burden, simply to show that he is a stockholder?",
  "I mean I agree with Justice Scalia, but doesn't he make it at least to the point of putting the Government to its proof by showing that he is a stockholder?",
  "Yes.",
  "But your answer, as I understand it, to Justice Breyer's question was, could be boiled down to this: The person whose disability benefit or total benefit following disability is calculated on the basis of age 55, is less likely to have worked or is likely to have worked less long than the person whose benefit is imputed and calculated on the basis of 20 years. And because the odds are that we'll say the person in the 55-year-old category has worked less and endured less risk, it is, therefore, fair to impute less time on average to such a person, and therefore, give a lower benefit. You're saying there is a tradeoff. And the tradeoff is because the 55-year-old retiree may get a benefit after very little work and very little risk, it is therefore fair and not a discrimination that on the average the windfall is less for that person by the imputation than the windfall to the person who retires on the basis of age 20. Is that a fair statement of your argument?",
  "Okay.",
  "That's -- you're sticking in a word, \"arbitrary,\" that appears nowhere in the body of the statute. You picked it up from the preamble, and that's -- and you're interpreting the statute with that. And it isn't customary for this Court to take words that don't appear in the text of the statute and read them in, based on some statement of purpose or preamble.",
  "But he is saying one thing more. He is saying it's also highly unlikely that the 55-year-old has worked as long subject to risk at the point at which the calculation is made than is the case with the person who retires on the basis of 20 years. And so that there is a tradeoff. And, therefore, you constantly analyze this as the kind of garden variety of discrimination based on age which Congress was aiming for.",
  "Yes. I didn't get it either.",
  "They are exactly the same people. The only thing that distinguishes the one class, those who voluntarily do and those who are disabled, is happenstance; and the happenstance is disability in the line of service.",
  "The reason for that is that we accept the criterion at the outset that your pay bears some relationship to what you do. We are now in a situation in which the benefit does not bear a relationship to what you are doing or going to do.",
  "As I understand it, though, Mr. Smith, the trial court didn't rely on, simply on the associational standing of the Democratic Party, did it?",
  "And is doing so by forcing them to get people properly identified.",
  "Well, you're telling us that, you know, we've got to be careful and it's difficult. But Justice Alito's question is: What are we supposed to look at, how are we supposed to do it?",
  "Let's get down -- let's get down to the question of quantification, which is one of the issues that he raised. What's your response to the issue that there is no quantification of the actual burden measured by the number of voters who are going to be adversely affected? What's the answer to that?",
  "Well, let's talk about Indiana. What have you got -- what is -- what is your best argument for Indiana?",
  "And how many of them are going to suffer from an unreasonable denial of an opportunity to get the ID which the State will provide through the Bureau of Motor Vehicles? How do we quantify that?",
  "Well, I know that. That's why it's a tough issue. But how do -- how are we going to -- how is a court going to arrive at some kind of a bottom line judgment on this issue?",
  "Okay, that's on -- that's on the other side of the issue.",
  "But walk -- walk us through -- if you were writing the opinion and what you wanted to put in the opinion was a reasonable estimate of the number of people who are going to be substantially burdened in having -- who do not now have the identification, substantially burdened in getting it. What approximate number would you arrive at and how would you -- how would you get to it?",
  "I take it you accept the figure of, what, about 50,000, to be further discounted by those who might vote absentee and so on?",
  "No, I just want to -- I just want to know what your figure. Mr. Smith was starting with 400 and then getting it down 2 and so on. And my recollection in the red brief is that you said, all right, let's take the 43,000 figure. I forget what you discounted it for, but it got it down to 25,000. Some of those would be able to vote absentee, but this -- I take it you're conceding that, at least subject to some discount, there are probably about 25,000 people who may be affected by this adversely. Is that clear?",
  "Well, isn't that a little bit of a stretch, too, when you say \"infinitesimal\"? I mean, if you take your two-thirds figure and so on, isn't it fair to say that you're probably going to get down to something like 10,000 people or 10,000 plus who are going to be affected in the sense that they're going to have to scurry around if, if they're going to get the appropriate ID?",
  "Okay. But 10 -- isn't the concern over 10,000 voters a sufficiently substantial concern to -- to be considered as something more than merely de minimis and is something that should count in a facial challenge?",
  "Well, we haven't endorsed -- I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but we haven't endorsed a registration procedure that would require as much documentation and as much travel as - - as the -- as this voter ID procedure would have.",
  "You agree that if you're going to take the -- if this Court takes the Salerno standard, there can never be a facial challenge to a registration requirement, a voter ID requirement. In other words, it's not merely that this facial challenge would be knocked out; there never could be one.",
  "Salerno says unless there are no cases, the facial challenge is inappropriate. And that -- in the real world that will never be true with respect to a -- a voter ID law, will it?",
  "It never will be true, will it?",
  "It never be -- if that's going to be the standard, there will never be a facial challenge.",
  "There never will be there one, will there?",
  "No, as to a pre-enforcement facial challenge to a law like this.",
  "Yes, but I want you to answer my question.",
  "We're not going to have facial challenges here, are we?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, are you making the argument that you can place a heavier burden on voters to identify themselves because your State officials refuse to follow the law?",
  "I think that's the argument you were just making.",
  "Even when we identify the duplicates, the local officials are still leaving them in the polls. I mean, surely you're not going to rest your case on that, are you?",
  "But you're still making the argument that there's a lack of confidence because our local officials won't cull the rolls of dead voters.",
  "Maybe there is a reasonable, obvious step you can take to make your officials obey the law when you tell them how to do it.",
  "Now wait a minute. Are you telling me that you are limited by some Federal statute from preventing local officials -- I'm sorry, from forcing local officials to take the action to cull the rolls of dead voters, when you have identified those dead voters for them?",
  "Then -- then it's Indiana's responsibility to cull those rolls. Right?",
  "It's not a legitimate argument to say we can put a heavier burden on identifying -- on voters to identify themselves because our officials are being contumacious. You don't rest on that argument?",
  "They didn't make that argument now. I mean we don't have to wait until after an election to hear that, any more than we have to wait until after an election to identify the voters that Justice Ginsburg has.",
  "That would be a - -",
  "That would be a virtue, but one of the vices would be that it would be after the election and the entire matter would be academic for another 2 years, until another 2 years had passed.",
  "And if we assume that everyone who has a decent claim under this Act went through the hoops to get the provisional ballot at the -- wherever the county office is and - -",
  "-- that's an assumption which need not necessarily be made.",
  "No, but you're also arguing, as I understand it, that the -- that the search, even in the case of the tax arrest, does fall within the rationale of search incident to an arrest because one of those two rationales is officer safety. Isn't that your point?",
  "Okay. So you reject the premise of the question then? The premise of the question was that the search incident to the arrest in the tax case is outside the rationale of searches incident to an arrest; and your position is it's not outside it.",
  "Okay.",
  "But isn't -- isn't the difficulty with that argument that we -- we have rejected the, in effect, the trespass rationale; and what you're telling us now, it seems to me, based on in effect trespass concepts, is that so far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned an arrest may constitutionally be made, but the officer following that arrest may not take the step of determining whether the individual arrested has on his person anything that can be used to hurt the officer like a knife or a gun? And why should be we draw what seems to me -- if we scrap, as we have done, the trespass analogy, why should we make what seems to me at least an irrational distinction of saying the Fourth Amendment says it's okay to arrest but it's not okay to protect yourself after you have arrested? Why should we accept such a rule?",
  "Right. But we're starting with a different premise.",
  "We're starting with a constitutional premise.",
  "If that -- if that logic is sound and that logic depends on Justice Powell's use of the word unlawfully, then it seems to me the -- the only way to arrest an irrational system would to be conclude that, in fact, the arrest is not constitutionally lawful. Because on -- on your logic, you're still left with the problem that I raised; and a constitutional arrest in which the officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment by apprehending the person, and yet the officer is disabled from protecting himself, if we're going to have a sensible rule, we've either got to say the Fourth Amendment allows him to make the search incident and protect himself, or we've got to have a rule that says the Fourth Amendment doesn't allow him to make the search -- make the arrest in the first place. Otherwise we've got a crazy system.",
  "We would never know about it if the -- if the misdemeanor, or jaywalking offense, was not committed in the officer's presence.",
  "That's not a problem for you here, but that is a limitation on what we have held.",
  "What do you -- what do you make, in answering Justice Scalia's question, what do you make of the fact that this contract included, I guess, a choice of law provision to the effect that California law applies, and if California law comes in so does the jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner? So that in effect you have implicitly agreed to take the Labor Commissioner as well as agreeing to arbitrate, and the argument is the Labor Commissioner comes first.",
  "Do you agree that the question of implicit option of California law is at issue in the case as it gets to us?",
  "Well, that may be great as a means of informing the Labor Commissioner, but it virtually destroys the value of arbitration - -",
  "-- because the expeditiousness of arbitration is gone once you start down the California procedural road. They don't want to go to arbitration 8 to 12 months later. They want it now.",
  "Then they probably shouldn't have agreed to arbitrate, but they did agree to arbitrate, and they want to arbitrate now. And one of the points of arbitration is to get the ball rolling fast, and that cannot be done under the system you are arguing for.",
  "Did you make that argument below, that implicitly they have imported the California labor scheme in as a -- in effect, as a condition precedent to the arbitration?",
  "But you didn't go further than to decide that case. Is that correct?",
  "Then why did it use the word \"otherwise\"? Why didn't it use the word \"likewise\"?",
  "It would have meant something different, wouldn't it?",
  "\"Otherwise\" means in some other way.",
  "Well, yes.",
  "That's usually the best way to understand each other is by, you know, assuming that.",
  "But in -- in doing that, you've got, in other words, to understand what \"otherwise\" means. You've got to look at the language that follows \"otherwise.\" And that's -- that then refers to \"risk of serious injury to a person.\" And in effect, it is saying the common element is risk of injury to the person. How that risk is raised may be in different ways from the way the risk is raised, say, in a burglary case or what-not. And if that is the proper analysis, then it seems to me you've got a tough row to hoe here.",
  "No, but it says \"person,\" not -- it says \"person,\" not \"reputation.\"",
  "You're saying the violence can be against the reputation. That's not what the statute is talking about. I mean that is -- that's inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.",
  "It doesn't talk about violence in the abstract. It talks about physical force against the person of another in number 1; and in number 2, where we are here, \"a risk of physical injury to another.\"",
  "Well, it has to do with the idea of risk of violence. A burglar when he commits burglary does not want violence. He wants to get the silver out of the sideboard and get back down the ladder. He doesn't want any violence with anybody.",
  "And the problem is that, by being in the situation he's in, he creates a risk that violence will occur. Somebody may show up. And the person, likewise, who commits DWI doesn't want to hurt anybody, but he has placed himself in a situation in which, if somebody shows up driving another car in front of him or walking across the street or maybe even in apprehending him for his DWI, a risk of violence is raised. The two cases in that respect are parallel.",
  "When the drunk leaves the bar, doesn't he have the realization, unless he is just blind at that point, that he may be apprehended?",
  "He's not going to throw himself into the arms of the nearest cop.",
  "Right, but when a guy goes up the ladder for the silver in the sideboard, at most what he wants is the silver.",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, I take it that your response to Justice Ginsburg's question would basically be your response to the argument that the other side makes, that on your theory a State misdemeanor can be treated for purposes of the act as - - or a conviction for a State misdemeanor can, with the recidivism enhancement, be treated as a felony?",
  "But if they continue to use just the State terminology such that they continue to use the word \"misdemeanor\" with respect to an offense, which with the enhancement carries more than a one-year penalty, then the two-year provision, the two-year threshold provision, kicks in?",
  "Yes.",
  "May I ask you one question before you sit down? You mentioned a moment ago what you saw as the anomaly in the counter-argument, the anomaly being that someone with the recidivism enhancement could end up with a ten-year sentence when the maximum for the offense is five years. But isn't - - isn't the answer to that just as -- as the answer that you gave to Justice Scalia a moment ago, and that is simply that the statute speaks in terms of \"offense\" so that there is -- there is no anomaly in getting a ten-year sentence for something which for this purpose carries a maximum of five?",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, apropos of your answers to Justice -- first to Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer -- you said that when the -- when the recidivist is being sentenced he is being sentenced for the offense of the -- of the drug crime. Isn't it equally fair or wouldn't it be equally fair to say that he is being sentenced for two things? He is being sentenced for the drug crime which is the necessary condition of the sentence; and he is also being sentenced for the fact that he is repeating that crime. Isn't -- isn't it fair to -- to sort of distinguish between the two, in effect the two factors in the offense?",
  "-- each one of which is necessary for the -- for the ultimate sentence itself?",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, let's assume we get into conference and we are having exactly the same discussion that's been going on for 40 minutes there. There is one way to read it; there is another way to read it; there are various reasons to read it one way, various ways to read it the other way. What do we do?",
  "But you don't have to win this argument?",
  "No, but I thought your position was that the -- the defendant is not, this defendant is not subject to a maximum of 5 years, but gets 10. I thought your position was that the offense within the meaning of the statute should be an offense which carries a maximum of 5 years, but that this defendant is in fact subject to a maximum of 10.",
  "In other words, you can - - throughout your argument you make, I think properly, the offense/offender distinction, and isn't that the answer to the conundrum?",
  "How can you call it a passive investment, not only when there was -- I think undisputedly -- as -- as much interest and activity in Nexis's business planning by the Mead people? But to my mind even more importantly, when in fact Mead, I think a couple of times, merged with -- with Nexis -- with Lexis -- when that provided a tax advantage, by -- by giving them loss carryforwards that reduced their taxes. Why isn't it fair to -- to say under the operational function test that if -- if the company is -- if Nexis is -- is mergeable with Mead when it produces a tax advantage and is certainly in a very operational sense functional then, because it's saving them a lot of money -- and that's, that has nothing to do with passive investment. If it's usable in a merger scenario there, it ought when the -- when the tide turns be -- be regarded as close enough in operational function to be taxable when the gain comes in.",
  "That's -- that's right. But weren't the enrichment cases in which income was being generated by an investment? The investor, of course, was the -- was the taxpayer company, and it simply reaped the benefits of a profitable investment. That's something very different from merging corporations, then unmerging them, and then merging them again to provide not merely enrichment, but great tax savings; and if they are operationally close enough to produce great tax savings, why shouldn't they be treated as operationally close enough when in fact they -- they produce a capital gain?",
  "The gain alone certainly is not. If they had absolutely done nothing but make their investment and wait to see whether the ship came in, I would understand your argument. But between the investment and the return of the ship, they were merging these corporations back and forth for -- for their - - for Mead's tax advantage. And that seems to me to take it out -- take the facts of this case out of the sort of the paradigm of the -- the operational or the nonoperational function cases.",
  "Don't we start -- I don't mean to cut off your argument, but don't we start with the assumption that this is not a unitary business? Wasn't that the finding of the trial court which was not disturbed on appeal?",
  "You can say it if you want, but I wanted to make sure - -",
  "Mr. Barov, I just want to go back to an earlier answer to see how far you would go with the position that you took. Assume that, exclusive of Nexis, Mead is the same kind of unitary corporation as under -- under everybody's understanding now. Assume, also, as you suggested in a hypo, that Lexis was doing business in Illinois. So that at least a -- a portion of its own activity could be taxed in Illinois. And assume, third, that the relationship between Mead and Lexis is simply one of passive investment. Mead simply bought a lot of stock, maybe 100 percent of the stock at the right time; and, otherwise, it kept hands off. And at this point Mead now -- now sells. On -- on your theory, would -- would the State of Illinois be able to tax a portion of the capital gain?",
  "Well, but that would be, in effect, the portion of the Nexis business, total business that took place in Illinois, total sales, total payroll, however you do it.",
  "Okay. But the only point I wanted to be clear on to understand your position is that purely passive investment would be enough to trigger your theory?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, there's one - - there's one more wrinkle that you don't expressly advert to and that is the argument that what is in issue here are the -- are the systems and methods patents, rather than the -- the equipment component patents.",
  "And that with respect to the equipment component patents nothing is being retained, but with respect to the systems and method patents nothing was being granted. What is your answer to that answer to your argument?",
  "So the answer simply is that that the argument rests upon a mistake of fact which has not been challenged in the record?",
  "Yes.",
  "But not every infringement of the license is necessarily an unauthorized sale.",
  "So there could be a restriction in the license which is not a restriction on sale and that could be violated. And the exhaustion doctrine would still apply, and you might have remedies in some another theory, i.e., contract.",
  "What - -",
  "I'm sorry. No. I didn't mean to interrupt you. It's your - -",
  "Okay. But assuming a simple notice, the answer to his bicycle hypo is yes, they can chase me down the road.",
  "Yes, because they're saying --",
  "They're saying the reason they have done so is that the following distinction is significant. There's a distinction between a license that says you can't sell this unless certain conditions are satisfied and, on the other hand, a license that says you can sell this, but if you sell it to a buyer who is described by conditions A and B, you've got to tell the buyer that we're going to make a claim against A and B. And the ones -- in the first example, there is a limit to the right to sell. In the second example, there is no limit on the right to sell, but there's a warning about what we're going to do if you do sell under certain conditions. And I think they're saying that unless you have a contract of the former sort which limits your right to sell, then when you do sell, exhaustion applies and whatever you may do against the ultimate buyer is -- is a contract problem or what-not, but it's not -- it's not a matter of patent.",
  "Number one, do you think I am being correct in characterizing, describing the distinction they make?",
  "And B, if I am, why isn't that distinction an answer to your argument?",
  "No. I understand where you're going. So then what you're saying, I guess, is that the real issue does not involve this distinction between a - -",
  "-- a limited right and a right - -",
  "-- to go after people later.",
  "What it -- what it involves is the statement that they make that if you license the manufacture, use, and sale of a particular component and that particular component has only one reasonable use - -",
  "-- then you have necessarily licensed them to sell with that ultimate use in mind, and when you do -- when you license them to sell, the patent-exhaustion doctrine attaches to any patent right that you may have, whether you call it system - -",
  "-- or whether you call it component.",
  "And you are saying that argument is no good because that, in fact, is an implied license argument, and there were findings that there was no implied license.",
  "So I understand your position.",
  "Okay.",
  "Isn't the difference between \"conditional sale\" and \"limited sale\" -- you are saying they used the word \"conditional.\" You are saying it was a \"limited sale\" that only -- a \"limited license.\" It only licensed Patents A and B and not Patents C and D.",
  "Does it cover your client?",
  "Then it's ineffective here.",
  "And if it's ineffective here and Congress has made it clear that the only way to cure the ineffectiveness is with a separate provision and you don't have a separate provision, you're out.",
  "Well, Mr. Garre isn't the most that argument gets you that the only individuals who could complain against retaliation are those over 40? It doesn't get you out -- it doesn't get you where you want to go. It's not retaliation right at all.",
  "Well, is it any more anomalous than the fact that the only protection of the age protection is simply for people over 40? In other words, Congress didn't care whether there are employers in the world who don't like youthful people.",
  "They're just worried about the age. So if it's an anomaly it's an anomaly across the board in the statute.",
  "But why would it have thought that? In other words, if -- I can understand why you say -- if you're going to put a rational gloss on it, that must be what they were thinking, but why would they think such a thing?",
  "Isn't the remedy for the finding of market manipulation the abrogation of the contract, which is a separate process from, from the revocation of market-based tariff?",
  "The same reason may support each, but - -",
  "Maybe I think I led us into this, Mr. Kneedler. The situation that I was positing was a situation in which the power marketer had engaged in market manipulation in the context of which, at the time of which, it made this contract. And my suggestion to you, which I think you took, was that in a situation like that there would be a basis for public interest review and abrogation of this contract because of the market manipulation in fact. And the market manipulation would also be a reason to say market power had been acquired. It had not been mitigated, and hence, the market-based tariff authority would also be revoked. And that was the, that was the limit of my question. And I take it your answer there is it could do each of those things?",
  "No, but I guess this is what's bothering us. Your point does not seem, at least to me, to be a modest point, because if I understand where you're going, you're saying that in a market with the degree of volatility of this one at the time these contracts were made, no contract is enforceable. It will last only so long as -- as one party does not complain about a disadvantage, and the minute it does, it's back in front of FERC. And the argument is being made that in fact a market-based rate cannot be enforced through contract because the very premise -- i.e., what you call and what was called a competitive -- Judge Ginsburg called a competitive market -- was absent. Isn't that the consequence of what you're arguing?",
  "Well, how do we know when we're only in the second worst?",
  "Well, but I mean the problem is - -",
  "And I don't see any -- and I realize that you're giving me limiting principles to what seems to me in effect a general rule that says no contracts are enforceable, if they are made during periods of market volatility, however sensible they may be given the premise of that volatility. And your first proposal for a limiting principle is this is the worst of times, and I don't see how that's going to help because somebody is always going to claim, well, these times are -- are almost as bad.",
  "Look - -",
  "That's a good -- I mean that's a fine general phrase, but the question is, is it possible to make an enforceable contract under these circumstances?",
  "I haven't heard a limiting principle yet. You have three others.",
  "Did these -- did -- did the Petitioners here -- do you claim that the Petitioners here were guilty of failure to report?",
  "That's -- that's a different issue. That -- that may be that the Commission was derelict in -- in having a nonstatutory condition. But did these -- did these Petitioners -- do you claim, is it a basis for your claim before FERC, that these Petitioners failed to follow the reporting requirements that were in effect?",
  "That's what I thought.",
  "Okay, but here I just want to make sure I understand. You're saying one -- one limiting principle is the re-examination of contract might be limited or at least only prompted by a -- a failure to follow reporting requirements. I can understand that and that offhand seems to me perfectly fair. It may not cover this case, but I can understand that. What are your other two reasons?",
  "Okay, but that seems to me consistent with the problem that I have with your argument. And that is, if you make a contract in a period of high volatility, and it seems reasonable to the two parties to come up with a rate that is certainly a higher rate than anybody would come up with if they were going through cost-plus-return ratemaking, the contract is vulnerable. And it seems to me that Commissioner Massey's argument is consistent with the conclusion that all those contracts are vulnerable. So I don't see that as any limiting principle. What's your fourth one?",
  "Okay, I can understand - - under your fourth point, I could understand the position if the argument were this is above $74, and therefore it is suspect; but the claim you're making, as I understand it, is a much broader claim. You're saying the entire contract ought to be abrogated in the public interest, not merely above 74 but below 74. Isn't that correct?",
  "And when you get there, you're saying abrogate this contract.",
  "Are you saying -- have you at any point said reduce the rates to $74?",
  "I will -- I will stop the cross-examination, but I just wanted to get the four points.",
  "You were saying that the most -- the most reasonable thing for us to do was to enter into a long-term contract in order to mitigate the effects of the chaotic spot market. You understood that.",
  "Mr. Wright, may I go back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question? She asked you: What do you want FERC to do if it does what you want them to do? And you said: We want them to make the same kind of adjustments ex post that they made to the spot prices. Isn't there one big difference here to - - between readjusting spot prices and rewriting or abrogating a contract like this? In the case of adjusting the spot prices, in effect. What they are saying is: Somebody isn't going to make the killing that he thought he was making. It was -- a spot price indicates it was a snap decision. People were reacting to -- to changes in the market from hour to hour. And the Commission is going to go back and say, you know, you're out of luck on the killing you thought you made. When, on the other hand, the Commission, in effect, rewrites or abrogates a contract, it is saying something very different. It is saying: You may not engage in long-term reliance on the agreements that you make. And isn't that a huge difference?",
  "Yes, but with respect, doesn't that, in effect, mean -- going back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg -- that what you really want is to say there wasn't effective competition. There wasn't effective competition because the market was chaotic. And, therefore, in a chaotic market, including this one, a long-term contract which later turns out to be disadvantageous to one side is unenforceable. Isn't that what you -- your real answer to Justice Ginsburg is.",
  "No, but I mean -- that's where I don't think that, at least with me, helps your argument. We all know that there is a broad umbrella standard of justness and reasonableness. One index of justness is the set of conditions under which the parties operate. The conditions in this case were conditions of chaos. And what the other side is saying, I think, is: We each tried to make the most reasonable deal we could, the most advantageous for us that we could, under these conditions of chaos. They certainly produced a rate that wouldn't have been produced in a calm time either by market-based tariffs or by cost-plus-return ratemaking. But under the circumstances that we did operate in, this is what it produced. And we were dealing at arm's length. Nobody was engaging in fraud, et cetera. So that's just. And I think when you say, as you did a minute ago, there is an overarching obligation or standard of justness and reasonableness, I think you're saying that that reasoning that I just tried to outline is not sufficient reasoning for sustaining the contract. Now, if I'm wrong, tell me. If I'm right, it seems to me you're really saying ditch the contracts if they were entered into in a period of high volatility.",
  "Are you entitled to relief if there was manipulation, but these people were not engaging in the manipulation? In other words, they are, in effect, innocent of the manipulation; but they, as sellers, are in a chaotic market. Are you entitled to relief against them under those circumstances?",
  "The trouble is that justness is a relational category, and you are -- I think you are saying we don't have to consider justness to the parties who were doing -- we will assume for the sake of the question -- the best that they could under bad circumstances. You are saying justness only goes to the ultimate retail ratepayer.",
  "Aren't you really arguing -- no, but aren't you really making the argument that the notion of justness does have an equitable component that looks to the source of the trouble; and if the source of the chaos in the market are the very people who are trying to make a profit on your contract, that is a reason to say that that market-based rate is not a just one, because they created the conditions that gave them the leverage to get you to make the deal that you made? But if they are not guilty of improper conduct in making it, then, you know, everybody has to take his lumps. Aren't you saying something like that?",
  "No, but just as a general premise, in your answer to Justice Scalia weren't you assuming something like that?",
  "And, to the extent that you make that argument, that's an answer, sort of, to the question that I put to you a couple of times: Why, why isn't your argument anything less broad than the fact that you can't make a contract in a chaotic market? And you are, at least as a subset of what you are saying, telling us that if the contract -- if the chaos in the market was caused by the impropriety of one contracting party, that party should not profit from it. And I understand that answer. That if -- to the extent that that is your position, it is an answer to my question.",
  "But I think -- and here I want to be clear on this -- you're saying they were not just and reasonable on the date they were made, number one, if the market manipulation that caused the chaos was manipulation by these Petitioners. That at least is part of your argument. But I think you're also saying that the rates were not just and reasonable if they were the result of market manipulation by others, not these Petitioners. Am I correct that your argument is broad enough to encompass the second alternative?",
  "Okay.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, in your rebuttal, will you address the state of the record with respect to evidence or findings about possible manipulation by these Petitioners?",
  "But, in fact, it didn't get that articulate. The closest it came to answering my question, I take it, is at the point to which you referred me in the joint appendix, no effect on these contracts?",
  "Well, then what do you say about the standard of justness? In effect, I think you're saying it doesn't matter whether these particular Petitioners manipulated the market creating the conditions under which these contracts were made at a price which turned out to be much higher than the spot price would be later, it's irrelevant. That's your position, isn't it?",
  "I'm not talking about what FERC said. I'm talking about your position. I think your position is that even if these people -- even if these people -- Petitioners manipulated and that created the -- or contributing to creating the market under which these contracts were made, that is irrelevant in looking at the contracts - -",
  "I'm not asking what claim has been made. I want to know -- I want to know what the government's position is. And as I understand the government's position is that manipulation by these Petitioners would be irrelevant to a review under the public interest standard, is that right?",
  "Is that the best way to read the government's position.",
  "Here and now in this courtroom.",
  "It would be a tougher Court to make the argument on inferring a cause of action, period. But I don't know whether it would be a tougher Court to make the argument that, if there is a cause of action, it's got to include this, which was your point a moment ago.",
  "Yes, but it doesn't remain dirty simply because it goes to a place in which the appearance of this kind of cash does not have the dirty appearance that it does at home. Why -- why isn't that the correct answer?",
  "Why doesn't that make it laundering?",
  "No, but the design to conceal -- maybe I misunderstood the hypo, but I thought the design to conceal was you conceal the dirty character of the money by taking it to a place and using it in that place where use of large amounts of cash, whether for bank deposits or spending in luxury stores, does not have the dirty implication, the dirty appearance that it does in the United States. So, why doesn't that therefore satisfy the concealment?",
  "But if that's all they were getting at, they wouldn't have to have this international component at all, because if you totally eliminated the \"to or through\" requirement and you were able to focus or properly focus solely on the method of the transportation, et cetera, then you would cover not only cases in which the concealment ultimately would take place by crossing a border, but you would pick up cases in which the concealment would take place even within the United States; and that would certainly be in the government's interest. But if you add, if you say, well, but this is limited by a to or through requirement, then it suggests, it seems to me, as Justice Breyer's question does, that it must -- the statute must be getting at what happens when it crosses the border as opposed to the means of crossing. What's your answer to that?",
  "But that would be -- that would be equally true and an equally appropriate objective without the \"to or through\" requirement in there. In other words, you don't have to have the \"to or through\" requirement in order to give the government a tool for exactly the purpose that you describe.",
  "What if he gives it to his brother and says take it across for me, will you?",
  "If he tells his brother to put it in his shoe?",
  "I suppose then the brother should be -- giving the money to the brother should satisfy the statute.",
  "Because if I'm -- if I'm in the drug business and my -- my brother is an international social worker or something, I'm certainly going to conceal when I give it to him and he carries it across the border.",
  "Does your argument carry to the point of the same argument when regulatory compliance is raised as a defense, or regulatory violation is raised as a ground for liability?",
  "Well, whenever you - - whenever you raise FDA compliance, there is at least the potential for a response that they -- they defrauded the FDA; they didn't tell them what they should have, and - - you know, vice versa, when -- when it's raised on the other side. So you always have the potential there for -- for just what concerns you, don't you?",
  "So it's the withdrawal element, withdrawal of approval that kills it here?",
  "But if you get beyond the element of what the FDA would have done if it had known, then it seems to me you get into an issue which is likely to arise by -- whenever, by one side or the other, the question of regulatory approval is -- is offered as a mere matter of evidence.",
  "No, but that's what you've got here, except that the mere admissibility of the evidence turns in part on what the -- the FDA would have done.",
  "But essentially -- I mean you -- the fact is the evidence of the FDA approval is made admissible and conclusive, and whether that in fact may be admitted is subject to the -- what is it - - clause (b) that you object to, but it comes down to a question of admissibility.",
  "Well, that's not strictly correct. I mean, it \"paid or approved.\"",
  "-- which means there is a third way, and the third way of reading it is if the sub makes the false statement to the general contractor in order ultimately to get a false claim, i.e., the ultimate contractor's claim for conforming work, approved or this particular claim approved by the government when the government makes the ultimate decision to pay the general contractor, that would be covered by (2).",
  "But that can simply be done by the false claim to the general contractor, who either accepts it as true or, for that matter, knowingly understands that it is false, and ultimately submits the same claim, i.e., as an element of its ultimate bill for the whole project.",
  "With respect, I think there is a limiting point. You are certainly right when you talk about the thousands of contracts that the government ultimately makes or finances for the benefit of lower units of government. But it does not follow from the government's theory that if the United States makes grants to a sub-unit of government, not for the purpose of a given contract or a given project, it simply makes grants, revenue-sharing sorts of things, it doesn't follow from the government's position that when one of those sub-units of government then makes a contract spending part of that money, that it's covered by this statute. This statute would cover the myriad of grants made for particular contracts. It would not cover every subset of funds in a lower government unit, some of which had been contributed by the national government.",
  "-- injured by it because it, in effect, gets less than it paid for?",
  "If it were a cost-plus contract, the government would pay an extra 10,000 and it would lose.",
  "If they -- if they simply supplied defective parts, the government would get less of a machine than it paid for. But in the -- in Justice Scalia's example, the government ultimately ends up with exactly what it bargained for, and the person who's out is the person who paid for too much labor, which is general -- is that your - -",
  "And you would still -- your theory would still cover the case of the -- of the agency that gets 10 percent of its budget by -- through a general grant from the United States, no matter what it spent its money on, regardless of the fact that the United States has no connection with particular contracts. If in fact a fraudulent claim was presented to that agency, it would fall within the qui tam statute?",
  "Right, no strings attached.",
  "Why wouldn't there be?",
  "No, but when your salary is paid, in effect the government's interest stops when it pays for your labor. In the -- in the hypothetical in which the government funds 10 percent of a sub-agency's operating budget, presumably its intent generalized goes to everything that agency does.",
  "In the contract between the Navy and Bath, was there a provision that Allison's invoices would be shown to the Navy? In other words, was the parallel provision in the contract with the - - with the general the same as the provision between the general and the sub?",
  "Available but not necessarily transmitted.",
  "But the contract between Bath and Allison says: You give those to us, and we give them to the Navy. It was specific in saying they go -- your invoices, your -- your certificates, go to the Navy?",
  "Okay.",
  "I understand that.",
  "Why should that be? I mean, why should there be a different rule? Let's assume -- I mean I'll assume for the sake of argument that The Amiable Nancy does not settle the issue absolutely. Why, then, should the -- and it doesn't, it seems to me, settle this distinction at all. So why should there be a distinction between corporations generally and maritime corporations?",
  "Well, isn't -- isn't part of the reason, at least for the assumption that there's a distinction, something that I think was mentioned in The Amiable Nancy? And that is in those days, when a ship put to sea, the ship was sort of a floating world by itself. And the -- the contact with the shipowner was simply gone until the thing came back into port again. That is certainly not the case today, and we know it's not the case in the circumstances here. So if the -- if the relationship to the corporation, to the CEO, if you will, and the captain of a vessel is not in any way different from the relationship of the CEO and, say, a division chief of a corporation, I don't see why that distinction should hold today.",
  "That may be an argument for no punitive damages, but I don't see why it's an argument for distinguishing between maritime corporations and others. I mean, other -- other kinds of enterprises have a lot of risk in them, too. And I'm missing the distinction there.",
  "But you are right, and I want to make -- let me just make clear one other point. You are drawing a distinction, as I understood you to say to Justice Ginsburg, between the Restatement position and your position.",
  "Okay.",
  "May I go back to your civil-penalty point?",
  "Isn't the problem with the civil-penalty argument is -- that the civil penalties were calibrated for environmental damage, and what we are dealing with here is individual economic damage? So we've got an apples and oranges comparison, haven't we?",
  "To the -- for lost trade or something?",
  "Mr. Fisher, the problem I have -- maybe it isn't a problem I have, but a question that that argument raises is this: We know something now that Justice Story did not know, and that is we've had an awful lot more experience with punitive damages practice. And we've spent the last decade or so of this Court dealing with the problem of how to set constitutional limits for awards which sort of by most people's standards verged on the excessive. The problem that we've had -- we've had two problems in coming up with those constitutional standards: One is we can't simply substitute ourselves as lawmakers for the State. We're talking about constitutional limits, not optimum standards. And number two, given those limits on us, we have not been able to come up with anything that could be called determinant standards. We've never, for example, found a sufficient reason constitutionally to put an absolute ratio kind of limit on it. But here, as you were pointing out earlier, we're sitting as a kind of common-law court. We are in the position of the States here. Why shouldn't we recognize the difficulty of trying to deal with indeterminate limits which we've proven in the constitutional context and say, therefore, we've simply got to come up with a number, because no other way is going to give us any kind of an administrable standard; and our number -- and I'm not saying this should be it -- but our number is going to be double the compensatory damages? That's the limit. Would that be an illegitimate thing for us to do or an unwise thing for us to do?",
  "Well, let me ask a slightly different question from Justice Scalia's. Is it the position of the Philippine Government that there are any assets in the estate that the Philippine Government does not claim?",
  "Enough assets to satisfy the claims of the individuals who -- who brought suit in the United States?",
  "So the position of the Philippines, going back to Justice Ginsburg's question, was we have no objection and in fact I think it was we support the litigation in the United States, but when it comes time to collect a judgment we're claiming they don't get a penny because everything belongs to us. Is that a fair summary of the Philippines' position?",
  "Well, they weren't just suing to condemn the regime. They weren't asking for a declaratory judgment. They were asking for a judgment in money.",
  "No, but we live in a practical world and if in fact there were no apparent assets that might satisfy that judgment that the Philippine Government did not claim, then their -- then their support of the -- of the earlier litigation was at the very least in tension with their -- with their overall position.",
  "Then why doesn't the Republic take the position that, because that was vetoed for reasons apart from the Republic's discretion, that the current assets would be an appropriate source of payment?",
  "Well, it's been doing it on a fairly sporadic basis. If I remember the facts correctly, first it got a stay with respect to the disposition of assets, and then the stay expired and the government didn't do anything about it, and then the government didn't come into action again until this particular claim was raised.",
  "Maybe -- let me put the - - sort of my response in the form of a question. In drawing or refusing to draw the conclusion of \"indispensable party,\" do you claim that a court may or may not consider the equitable or inequitable behavior of the government?",
  "Well, maybe - -",
  "Well, maybe they have been have been candid about their claims, but they -- in real-world practical terms, the claim to these assets and the representation at the same time that it's appropriate for these people to proceed in the United States for a money judgment, are at least in some tension with each other, aren't they?",
  "Well, doesn't the -- maybe this makes no difference, but doesn't the Philippine National Bank have the -- whatever they call them, the share certificates or stock certificates that represent the Arelma assets at this point?",
  "Okay. Couldn't they - - couldn't they bring an in rem in the Philippines based on the presence in the Philippines of those two certificates?",
  "Okay.",
  "Wait a minute. I missed your last step. If it's an in rem proceeding against the share certificates what -- what difference does it make whether they ever belonged to the Philippines?",
  "So you're saying an in rem proceeding against the certificates simply will not resolve the issue; that's the -- that's the guts of the answer.",
  "But may I ask you this question, though. Merrill Lynch refused in the year 2000, but if the proceeding that Justice Breyer has just been describing takes place and there is a judgment to the effect that the share certificates are properly held or the property of the Philippine Government, and the Philippine Government now makes, or then, makes a new request to Merrill Lynch, the fact that they made a request that was refused in 2000, which may be too late to sue on, isn't going to prevent them from suing on their present adjudication that they are the true owners of the share certificates and want the money.",
  "Okay. You're saying -- I think you're saying that the demand would be ineffectual this time for the same reason it was ineffectual the last time.",
  "And the suggestion I thought that Justice Breyer had made and that I made was this time they can do something further. They can take the judgment and go into a United States court and say: We've got this judgment, there's no question that these shares and what they represent are ours; so make Merrill Lynch give us the money. What prevents them from doing that?",
  "May I go back on exactly that point on the equity to Justice Breyer's last question? I thought you had given or anticipated his question in something you said a moment ago, and then you didn't repeat it, and I may have misunderstood you. I thought you had told us that the courts of the Philippines did not recognize, for enforcement purposes there, the judgment that your clients had obtained in the United States, and that in effect they, therefore, if they were going to make a claim on assets in the Philippines, they would have to start from scratch again. Is that correct? Did I misunderstand you?",
  "Let me ask you this: Did the Philippine Government formally take a position in raising these obstructive barriers, the $8 million filing fee, for example?",
  "Okay. That was sua sponte with the court?",
  "Okay, so the --",
  "What is the -- so the point of the magistration is that is the point at which a reasonable time starts running within which Texas must afford -- appoint counsel, isn't that your basic point?",
  "Okay.",
  "So there's no claim that there was anything invalid about the magistration proceeding --",
  "-- itself because there was no counsel there.",
  "There's no claim -- for example, had there been a probable cause hearing, that the attorney would have been required to participate in the probable cause hearing under --",
  "There has simply got to be one appointed within a reasonable time after the magistration. That's -- that's your argument?",
  "What you're saying, in answer to Justice Kennedy's question, that an individual can be brought into court, held in jail for three weeks without charge, and no right to counsel applies? I think that's your answer, but I want to make sure. I'll be candid to say I'm surprised. But if that's your position, I want to make sure I understand it.",
  "I want to know what your answer is here. Get to authority later, but I want to know whether your position is that an individual may be brought by a police officer before a magistrate, charged with no crime, required to post bail, and if he doesn't post bail, be held for three weeks without charge.",
  "I'm not asking whether it could happen; I'm asking whether it would be constitutional without appointing counsel.",
  "Without charges filed? In other words, if the lawyer comes in and says, you know, my client is sitting in jail, you've had him there for three days now, and no complaint has been filed against him, we don't know why he is being held -- your answer -- the -- it's a constitutional answer to say, well, you know, that's for us to know and you to find out?",
  "You mean no complaint needs to be filed by the police? If the magistrate says, what's this guy doing here, don't the police normally have a complaint, in this case a -- what was it, a possession of a gun by a felon, say, you know, we're filing this complaint that charges him with possessing a gun with a felony record? And wasn't there such a complaint displayed here?",
  "Would they have been obligated to get somebody to come?",
  "Under the Sixth Amendment?",
  "No.",
  "And that would be subject, wouldn't it, to sort of a condition subsequent, because if it turned out -- I mean we -- no counsel is required if there's no incarceration. So that even if the right had attached, if it turned out later that there was no incarceration or even attempt to incarcerate, then that would relate back, and there wouldn't be a Sixth Amendment violation. Isn't that right? Wouldn't that be the answer to the -- a partial answer?",
  "Now -- no, please.",
  "If Mr. Rothgery had, immediately upon being admitted to bail, said: I want a -- I was going to say a probable-cause hearing. You have a different term for it.",
  "\"Examining trial.\"",
  "At that point, under Texas law, the right to counsel within one or three business days would have attached?",
  "Now, at the -- may I? At the examining trial, is there a charge filed?",
  "What are they finding probable cause for if they don't know what the charge is?",
  "No, but I realize if the -- if somebody is going to demonstrate probable cause, the probable cause has got to be probable cause to hold someone to answer for a particular charge. So why hasn't there, as a matter of definition, got to be a charge, even on your reasoning, by the time the examining trial is held?",
  "That is right. It is a probable-cause determination, and you've got to have an answer: Probable cause for what?",
  "So -- so, in other words, you determine whether a crime has been committed without charging the individual with the crime.",
  "Well, I'm just asking what you do. Is that the case? Is no charge filed? Then, at the end of the probable cause hearing you say: Well, we -- the judge says: Well, you've got probable cause to hold this person for possessing a gun after having been convicted of a felony, but there doesn't happen to be any charge to that effect here. Is that the state of the law, in fact?",
  "So what you are -- what you are saying is that the individual has a right to challenge a Federal law which in effect would disarm the militia and make it impossible for the militia to perform those functions that militias function. Isn't that the nub of what you're saying?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well isn't it -- isn't it more restrictive in the sense that the English Bill of Rights was a guarantee against the crown, and it did not preclude Parliament from passing a statute that would regulate and perhaps limit - -",
  "Here there is some guarantee against what Congress can do.",
  "But isn't there one difference? Not every provision of the English Bill of Rights had an express reference to permission by law, which is a reference to parliamentary authority. So that there -- there -- there was a peculiar recognition of parliamentary legislative authority on this subject.",
  "May I go back to another point, which is to the same point, and that is consistent with your emphasis on the people was your emphasis a moment ago on the distinction between keeping and bearing arms. The \"keep\" part sounds in your, in your mind at least, to speak of an individual right not necessarily limited by, by the exigencies of military service. My question is, if that is correct and \"keep\" should be read as, in effect, an independent guarantee, then what is served by the phrase \"and bear\"? In other words, if the people can keep them and they have them there for use in the militia as well as to hunt deer, why do we -- why do we have to have a further reference in there to a right to bear as well as to keep arms? And my point is it sounds to me as though \"keep and bear\" forms one phrase rather than two. But I want to know what your answer is to that.",
  "But wait a minute. You're not saying that if somebody goes hunting deer he is bearing arms, or are you?",
  "Somebody going out to -- in the eighteenth century, someone going out to hunt a deer would have thought of themselves as bearing arms? I mean, is that the way they talk?",
  "But it's \"arms\" that has the kind of the military -- the martial connotation, I would have thought.",
  "And you want to talk about the standard, and your light's on.",
  "Then why have the first clause? I mean what is it doing -- I mean what help is it going to be?",
  "Is there any -- is there any record evidence that the anti-Federalist objections to the Constitution that ultimately resulted in the Second Amendment were premised on any failure to recognize an individual right of self-defense or hunting or whatnot, as distinct from being premised on concern about the power of the national government and the militia clauses in Article 1?",
  "No, but they didn't -- they didn't limit it to self-defense. I mean, what provoked it, as I understand it, was concern about the militia clauses, and here I mean you're certainly correct. I agree with you. Pennsylvania went beyond that. It was -- it was one of three States, as I understand, that did go beyond it. But the provocation for getting into the subject, as I understand it, was, in each instance including Pennsylvania, concern over the national government's power over militias under Article 1.",
  "Can we also look to current conditions like current crime statistics?",
  "Well, can they consider the extent of the murder rate in Washington, D.C., using handguns?",
  "The question is whether they may consider those statistics, and I take it your answer is yes?",
  "But I think -- I don't want you to misunderstand my question. My question is that by looking to the statistics, I'm not suggesting that there is only sort of one reasonable response to them. I want to know whether -- whether the policymakers may look to them; and I take it your answer is yes?",
  "They may be. I just want to make sure you're not making the argument that because there was not a comparable homicide rate, or for that matter, a comparable need for self-defense from handgun use in 1792, that there -- 1790 -- that therefore, the statistics of today may not be considered? You're not making that argument?",
  "But you -- isn't that one of the problems with your argument? Because there is something very strange about capping paralegal fees at the same amount that they would cap a lawyer's fees for, regardless of what that amount is and when they were setting it.",
  "No, I'm looking at it from the perspective of the original enactment on your theory at that moment. These fees were legal fees, were attorney fees, and they were capped at the same amount that a lawyer's time was capped at. And that's just odd.",
  "I'm sorry. Why wasn't it true in 1980? You simply mean in 1980 the two together wouldn't have gotten as high as the cap?",
  "Well in that case it would bill the paralegal in the same way it would bill, I take it, the expense of, let's say, having water tested in a pollution case. It would -- it would -- I take it it would bill the client dollar for dollar what it had to pay.",
  "And add - -",
  "They don't add a profit and they don't add a profit on to -- to travel expenses and things like that.",
  "And -- so if that is so, in each case cost means cost to the client, and you're coming up with a new category of expense, which is cost to someone else, and why should there be a subcategory of expense, in which cost does not mean cost to the client when every other category of expense does mean cost to the client?",
  "Because there is a separate provision for fees.",
  "Yes.",
  "I'm not sure why you characterize California as financing one side of a debate, because -- and this I think is sort of the nub of the disagreement between the two sides here -- their argument is that a State can determine what it wants to buy with its money, but what California is doing is telling its contractor what it can do with the money after the State has got what it paid for.",
  "And that's the - -",
  "I understand that is the basic distinction between a case like Rust and a case like this.",
  "They're trying to control their profits as opposed to determining what they get - - what you get for your money. And how do you respond to that?",
  "Well, is there any case in which California claims that it has not gotten the service that it paid for as a result of the position which an employer -- a grantee employer took on -- on a unionization issue?",
  "Why do you say \"while they are still State funds\" -- the -- the money that the - - that any employer is using, I presume, to the extent that it can be identified, is money in the employer's pocket. And the only claim that California would have, it seems to me from the pre-emption argument, is that in fact we are buying a form of speech or a form of promotion of labor policy when we contract with social service agencies or whatnot. But I don't understand that to be California's argument at all.",
  "Yes, but if they give them grant money -- let's say it's a grant rather than a contract, and I assume that's, you know, the point you're making. When they give them grant money, I assume they're giving them grant money in order to do or to perform whatever kind of service or function the agency is devoted to performing.",
  "Not to -- not to enforce labor policy of one sort or another, but to promote the arts or conservation or whatever the organization does. And there's no argument here that the organization is - - is failing to promote conservation or the arts or whatever, and that for that reason, California isn't getting what it's paying for. The argument is that whatever California has to -- I'm sorry, whatever the organization has to spend, say, on its labor relations, which is something that is left over from its promotion of the arts, cannot be spent except in accordance with California policy.",
  "Yes, but I assume they are entitled to some overhead cost which would include the cost of their employee-related -- managing employee relations?",
  "So that wouldn't be money left over. That would - -",
  "So, is the argument that the employer in fact -- that the employer is in fact devoting less of the grant money to the purpose of the grant, so that it falls within Rust?",
  "Then that -- then that, it seems to me, cuts the feet off your argument of a moment ago, that in fact the State's concern is that it's getting less of what it thought it was getting for with its grant, because more is being spent on labor policy. And now, it seems to me, you're saying no, that's not the case. It is simply the fact that the time that the employer spends in talking with employees, whatever the subject is, involves a policy that California does not want to support, and, therefore, California prohibits them spending that time for purely policy reasons.",
  "Well, your argument a moment ago is that they were using the State's money because in fact they were providing less of the service that the grant was for and spending that in -- in conversation with employees about labor unions. And it seems to me your answer to Justice Scalia was inconsistent with that. Your answer to Justice Scalia, as I understood it, was it is simply that they do not want that policy being implemented by anyone who gets any money from the State within that State.",
  "But on your argument, there is no \"your own money.\" You're saying that everything that the grantee gets in a grant situation is the government's money.",
  "But that distinction that you just made in answer to Justice Scalia could not be drawn.",
  "No, the hypothesis of this whole argument is that we are talking with a grantee who was fully funded by -- I thought fully funded by the State, and I thought that was your strongest argument. So that this alternative -- well, you can use your own money -- is an alternative which, you know, by the very hypothesis that we are arguing on, will never exist.",
  "Well, what about the situation in which the contract runs for a year and you bill monthly? On your theory the contract is still going on and yet there is no prepayment. I assume on your argument they would be just as bound by the California policy as if they got a hundred percent payment up front.",
  "Well, do you concede that if they -- if all they did under a 12-month contract was -- was bill for services rendered every past 30 days, that there would be either no application of the California law or that the application would be pre-empted?",
  "It's like saying yes.",
  "Why aren't three years enough?",
  "Why aren't three years enough?",
  "Are there district court - - there must be -- district court cases in which the State trial court has invalidated on some State constitutional ground legislation redistricting that has been passed by the legislature? When that happens, have those opinions been precleared?",
  "But isn't the reason that there would be no reason to preclear them? I mean, if the State court invalidates legislative redistricting, and does so before there has been a preclearance request, in other words, if it gets into State court right off the bat, then there's no State law subsequently to ask the feds to preclear.",
  "Well, I guess what I'm saying is your \"No\" answer does not prove much. In other words, you're trying to make the case here that there is something extremely unusual about this. And I thought your answer to Justice Scalia in effect was one reason that it's unusual is that we don't have any of these cases in, in which a State court has knocked out a State law that is then subject to some kind of preclearance review. And my only point was, if I understand the situation, as long as the preclearance review had not preceded the State constitutionality judgment, following the State constitutionality judgment there would be no law to take to Washington, whether it be to -- to the Justice Department or to -- or to the Court, and ask to have precleared. So the fact that there are no such cases doesn't prove anything.",
  "Well, that may be - -",
  "There never would have been perhaps preclearance if it got it right soon enough.",
  "Well, but if the -- if the challenging parties go into court at the first opportunity and you don't have an election sort of coming up next week, I would suppose that in cases like that, the State would at least allow the State litigation to proceed to some level. And if in point of fact that State litigation resulted in a declaration that the new statute was unconstitutional in some fashion, one would not expect the State then to bull ahead and ask for preclearance, as opposed to trying either to appeal at the State level or to correct the statute.",
  "I will assume that.",
  "May I ask: You're not - - correct me if I'm wrong. I didn't think you were arguing that because of the preclearance followed by the State determination of unconstitutionality, that the State was required to follow that unconstitution law. I thought your argument simply was that, in effect, there was a stalemate at that point, and the State was going to have to come up with some new law that would be precleared. Am I correct?",
  "And isn't the answer that no law would be in effect? I mean, you're in the same situation then that you would be in if there had been no judicial litigation going on, the law had been brought to the Justice Department or the D.C. court, had - - preclearance had been refused. The State at that point didn't have the old law because it had been repealed. It couldn't apply the new law because it wasn't precleared, and somebody in Alabama would have to do something. Aren't we in essentially the same position here?",
  "Well, it was in force and effect.",
  "Does the theory require that we assume it remains in force and effect by virtue of the preclearance even when there is a subsequent determination of unconstitutionality?",
  "Why as a matter of Federalism is it more extraordinary to review a court determination than the determination of a popularly elected legislature?",
  "But they are not saying State law is different from what it means. They are saying that you cannot put a change in effect until you get it precleared.",
  "Isn't the problem with the argument that Hirota did not at any point in the per curiam opinion saying -- say, we're coming to the conclusion that we come to of no jurisdiction because there's an international force? I mean, Hirota said, you know, there's this, that, and the other thing, and under all these circumstances we don't think there's jurisdiction. Well, one of the things that's different here is you had Japanese soldiers in Hirota and you've got American citizens here.",
  "If it is, there's something -- the implication of that I think is what is bothersome, because in effect it means, if that rule is applied to this case, it means that the president acting alone can make an agreement for an international force or a cooperative force and that agreement of the executive alone in effect eliminates habeas jurisdiction over an American citizen. And that obviously is in tension, if not inconsistent, with the suspension clause and it's a little scary.",
  "No, but in real world terms isn't it the case that they are under United States authority? You've got an American commander, you've straight-line authority right through, and -- and one knows -- to be realistic, one knows perfectly well that if any order were given to the American military involved, they would not hand them over, i.e., they would obey the order, international -- agreement for international cooperation or not.",
  "Go ahead.",
  "I think -- I think you're right.",
  "It may be -- I mean, Hirota was a literally, I think, a two- or three-day per curiam opinion. It occupied less than a page, and it had this kind of whole ball of wax sort of reasoning involved in it. And as precedential authority, if this case turned on the question of whether we look to the theory of international authority rather than, I think, the realistic fact of American domination, I don't think Hirota is a very strong precedent against our at least taking the realistic view of it.",
  "Doesn't that -- doesn't that issue that you raise at least deserve litigation before the court?",
  "Why shouldn't they? I mean, if a -- if a court may consider the imminence of lynch-mob action either sanctioned by the requesting government or tolerated by it, why cannot the same point be made about a claim of torture if there is at least enough color in the claim to say there's something to inquire into?",
  "Then why don't you have - - why isn't your answer different in the lynch-mob case?",
  "Sure, but once they're turned over to the prison authorities they're in the situation that the NGO brief describes. I mean, that's it seems to me ultimately what the concern is.",
  "Well, I guess that just gets me back to my earlier question. Isn't that something that ought to be explored as an evidentiary matter in determining whether there should be a permanent injunction?",
  "In answering that question, would you go back, please, and clarify something that I'm not too clear on in your answers to comparable questions from Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens? And that is, you say we do not claim that there would be jurisdiction within the zone of hostilities. Is it your point -- and you then go on to say, well, they've been moved to this camp. Is your point the simple point that the camp gets them out of the zone of hostilities? And is that the reason that you answered Justice Breyer's question by saying this is comparable to an occupation rather than a war zone? Is that the simple point?",
  "So you're saying within what is technically a zone of hostility, there are places, physical places, I take it, within which the military has a degree of discretion; and that discretion is what makes this situation comparable to an occupation? I mean, I'm just not following how you're getting from A to B. That's -- that's my problem.",
  "Then you've got to say that there is habeas jurisdiction within the zone of hostility. I thought you said the opposite.",
  "An abstention kind of doctrine then is what you are getting at?",
  "What - -",
  "All right. Let's get to that. What manner? Tell me exactly what should such an order would look like.",
  "So Releasing at place A, not place B.",
  "Don't push him out the gates; take him somewhere else, and then release him. That's the order?",
  "Okay.",
  "Mr. Garre, would you address this question at some point? Assuming -- assume an officer in the national government arrests somebody unlawfully in Portland, Oregon, and transfers the person across the country to Portland, Maine. The person files for habeas in the district court in Maine, and the district court says: Yes, you are right. You are being held unlawfully. Does the court have the authority to tell the United States to take him back to Portland, Oregon, and then release him?",
  "Do you have a position on the answer to my question?",
  "Yes.",
  "The habeas court says, look, it is not complete relief just to put him out on the street in Portland -- in Maine. He's broke, and he's 3,000 miles from home. Take him back to Portland, Oregon. Does the habeas court have the authority to do that?",
  "Well, I think it means the same thing that the point of my question was. He is saying you can't release him at point A, which would be tantamount to transfer; you've got to take him to point B, somewhere where his release will not result in the automatic arrest. And that's why I asked my question.",
  "Was -- was the further explanation that what they were doing in amending the firearms statute was tailoring it more precisely to the possible felony by a police officer situation, and they simply did not face that possibility in the explosives statute?",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Hillier, I -- you know, I will accept maybe more than just for the sake of argument that if you stick to the text alone you've got an argument here for some uncertainty, for some ambiguity. The trouble that I have with your argument is that we're here to consider not only text but statutory history, And the statutory history seems to me pretty tough for you to get over. The statute was amended. The word \"unlawfully\" was dropped from it, and there was no amendment made, with respect to its cognates, to conform it to the cognate section on carrying a gun that specified \"in relation to.\" And it seems to me that the most reasonable inference to draw from that statutory history is that when Congress amended and technically re-enacted the statute, when it dropped \"unlawfully,\" that it did not want \"during\" to be read, as it was in the handgun statute, \"in relation to.\" And I -- that's seems to me the tough point of the argument. What is your response to that?",
  "The different object -- I mean, the trouble with the different object argument is, as the Attorney General said, there was an evident concern in amending the handgun statute not to sweep in the rogue police officer who happens to have a gun on him when he does something that in fact is unlawful.",
  "The negative inference from that is that there was an intent in the cognate explosives statute to sweep in people, whether in fact it was in relation to or not in relation to.",
  "Okay, fair enough so far as the argument goes. But that still leaves Congress taking the -- sort of making it as difficult as possible for you to take the position that you're taking, rather than as easy as possible. Why didn't it put in \"in relation to\"?",
  "It can do it, but why would it have done so? You've the -- you've got the gun example sitting there. And why would it not have done so if, in fact -- so obvious a thing to do if that's what -- if it intended to come out your way?",
  "But Mr. Stancil, I mean, you say make the record. You said a moment ago, have standby counsel who can take over. It seems to me that the -- that the trouble with these proposals is that by the time the record is made, if by that you mean courtroom performance, or by the time standby counsel is required to take over, the damage is done. And it -- it seems to me that a trial judge in those situations who says, okay, I declare at this point that the trial has become so farcical it cannot go on like this, the trial judge at that point is -- has got a damaged product in the part of the trial that has already taken place. And the tough question, I think, is not whether he can simply tell standby counsel to take over, but whether anyone can take over without declaring a mistrial at that point. And the cost of mistrial is a cost in addition to the cost that the State has been arguing for, that it should not be regarded in the public eye as the sponsor of farces. What do you say to the problem of the likelihood that a mistrial is going to be the cost of correcting or switching over once the -- once the damage has been proven?",
  "What difference does it make?",
  "Because the trial judge has got a problem, and it doesn't matter whether he was on medication or not on medication. He was saying things like the things Justice Ginsburg has just read.",
  "Well, a great -- frankly, a great deal of psychiatric testimony is irreconcilable with the facts. Psychiatric testimony can be found for either side of any issue in cases like this.",
  "Mr. Stancil, I'm not sure that I'm following your argument, Because if I understand your most recent answers to these questions, it is no longer your position that an individual who is not disruptive, but merely incoherent and making the trial farcical by his incoherent responses or actions - - it is no longer your position that an individual who is merely incoherent could be forced in the midst a trial, after this has been demonstrated, to accept standby counsel to manage the trial. And, yet a moment ago I thought that was one of the fail-safe devices that you were arguing for.",
  "So to the disruptive point?",
  "Somebody who is totally polite to the Court, who does not scream and yell, who talks only when he is allowed to talk, but talks total and complete nonsense, can never be replaced, in your view, by a standby counsel in the middle of the trial after this has been shown to be the way he's acting; isn't that correct?",
  "How about \"yes\" or \"no\"?",
  "In your judgment, was the Dusky determination in this case erroneous? Should he have been held incompetent to stand trial because of the nonsensical things that Justice Ginsburg just read?",
  "He should have been found incompetent.",
  "In fact, you do know, I presume, on the statistics that the odds are three to one against there being a confirmed plan.",
  "I am -- I don't quite follow the leap you just made.",
  "Isn't it odd that the - - isn't it odd that the Congress would have required, we will assume, this escrow procedure when the odds are three to one against the non-taxability? It seems to me that just as matter of simple efficiency, they would not have required this elaborate procedure when the odds are that the procedure would be to no avail to the bankruptcy State -- the State.",
  "Is it relevant, as your friend on the other side pointed out, that the particular section in question occurs within the statute under the general heading of \"Post-Confirmation Matters\"?",
  "But isn't the -- isn't the normal reading, if we're going to give any weight to the placement in the statute at all -- and I think we're entitled to give some, that unless there is the kind of clarity that you've just been describing in these two exceptions, that, in fact, the placement there indicates that it is dealing with a post-confirmation matter?",
  "Why? Why?",
  "Well, isn't -- isn't the difference that, in Holmes, it was the textual basis \"by reason of\" through which the -- as we read it -- the proximate cause standard was -- was brought into the statute. Here, in fact, there -- there isn't any text, it seems to me, that you can -- can rely on. The fact of fraud itself doesn't do it because the statute speaks in terms of an offense for which an individual should be prosecuted. So it's looking to the criminal rather than the civil model. And isn't that the distinction, in effect, a textual distinction, between Holmes as a means for importing proximate cause and the statute in this case as a means for importing first-party reliance?",
  "Why hasn't it done so simply or sufficiently done so by referring to the -- in effect -- the criminal mail fraud violation?",
  "Yes, but we didn't have - - I don't think we had in those cases the phrase that occurs here. I think the phrase here is \"could be prosecuted or indicted\" for something -- I think it was prosecution -- which tends to narrow it down to the criminal model, rather than allowing us to roam into the civil field.",
  "Okay. Well, that means that to that extent the criminal -- in effect -- the criminal cause of action is narrowed down. It doesn't follow from that that the statute contemplated adopting a civil model regardless.",
  "You're going to have to help me do that.",
  "No, but - -",
  "But isn't the problem with your argument that if this isn't direct enough, there is no injury at all? The county isn't hurt by this. The county has got its rotational scheme basically to avoid favoring particular bidders who appear in multiple guises, but the county isn't getting hurt. So that if it's not direct enough for -- for the Plaintiffs in this case to sue, then nobody has a direct enough interest or can show direct enough causation for RICO.",
  "But how could the property owner be hurt if there is -- if we are dealing in a situation here in -- in which the penalty is zero percent, and everybody is bidding zero percent, then this is a situation in which the property owner isn't going to get hurt no matter who ends up with it.",
  "Yes, but that's the - - that's the case here. So if your direct-injury requirement, as you construe it, applies here, I think we are still left with a situation in which on these facts, nobody would be injured, because nobody -- or nobody would be -- be able to prove injury by a sufficient direct route to establish causation.",
  "Yeah. Right.",
  "Is your client still bidding on -- on these - -",
  "Isn't -- isn't the weakness of the argument that you're, in effect, dividing mail and fraud? You're saying there are two requirements, and therefore, fraud here is just like conspiracy in Beck. But in fact, mail fraud is -- is a single term of art. It refers simply to a criminal violation for which there -- there is no exact civil counterpart. And so, if you take mail fraud as being a unified term of art, then it seems to me that your argument falls apart, because you can't treat the fraud in the mail fraud the way you treated the conspiracy standing alone in Beck.",
  "But there was no definition of bankruptcy fraud as a separate definition, was there? Whereas in mail fraud, we know what it means.",
  "Well, are you saying that the -- that the regulatory authority could be broader than the adjudicatory authority?",
  "No, but if that kind of implicit consent applies in the tax context, I don't see why in theory it doesn't apply in the situation we've got here.",
  "If somebody is going to do business with the tribe, with tribal members, in a way that affects the tribe on the reservation, it makes just as much sense to say, well, they implicitly consent not to discriminate against tribal members because of their Indian status.",
  "Well, I thought it was implicit in the tax situation, as you responded to Justice Ginsburg's question.",
  "All right. Let me take another example, the other explicit example from Montana, which mentioned taxing and licensing. Are you saying that if a -- in any particular activity, say, running a filling station or advertising oneself as a certified mechanic in the -- at the filling station on the reservation, and the tribe says, well, we are going to license mechanics to make sure they are competent. Are you saying that there has got to be an explicit agreement to the licensing in order for the tribe to enforce its licensing restriction against somebody who goes to work for that gas station?",
  "Okay. Then, that's -- that's implicit consent then, isn't it?",
  "He doesn't sign a document saying \"I consent\"; he just goes to work. And your answer says, okay, that's enough to catch him on licensing. In Justice Ginsburg's example, if they started doing business, that's enough to catch them on taxation. And if that is so, why isn't tribal dealing sufficient in effect to supply an implicit consent not to discriminate?",
  "All right. Why draw the line where you want to draw it? We've got a line in which the -- I'll put a blank, the \"X\" consent -- what did we want -- whatever adjective we want suffices for taxation and it suffices for licensing. Why doesn't it suffice for nondiscrimination? Why do we draw the line where you want it drawn?",
  "Mr. Banker, you several times have raised a point which seems to me to go to the nature of the first exception in Montana on an issue we haven't discussed yet, and I want to get clear on it. You have emphasized consistently through your argument the need for consent whether we call it actual, explicit, some kind of consent to at least the regulatory jurisdiction upon which a judicial jurisdiction is premised. And my understanding is that that's not what -- I don't have Montana in front of me, but my understanding is that that is not what Montana, in effect said with respect to the -- to the first exception. As I recall what the court said in Montana it was that there may be situations in which a nonmember enters into a consensual relationship with the tribe or tribal members, and as a result of that consensual relationship, it then would be appropriate to recognize jurisdiction, for example, to tax regulatory jurisdiction. My understanding is that the consent that Montana was talking about was not a consent to the specific jurisdiction whether it be regulatory or adjudicatory, but rather consent to some kind of, or a consent forming some kind of a relationship that would make it appropriate for the tribe to assert regulatory jurisdiction. So that the consent does not have to relate to jurisdiction as such. Am I -- if that is correct, then your argument for consent seems to me to miss the point. But maybe I'm missing the point of - - of Montana. What is your response to that?",
  "But the point of my question was do you agree that there -- within the - - the description of the exception in Montana, that there need not be a consent, either to the regulation or to an adjudicatory jurisdiction to enforce the regulation?",
  "So you're saying the Montana exception has been modified by later cases.",
  "Okay.",
  "But if that's your argument what's left of the first exception?",
  "So the first -- but as I understand it the first exception would have no independent application unless the second exception were met -- were satisfied, i.e., there was a tribal need based on self-government, economic self-protection and so on which, which would in effect validate the tribe's attempt to regulate, which seems in effect to say that everything turns on the second exception, not the first.",
  "Why -- why isn't that an equally response to what Justice Ginsburg just gave as a recitation of what the what the judge had said.",
  "She quoted and summarized the judge saying he's going to do it again.",
  "Anybody knows that what the judge is getting at is I'm going to put him away as long as I can put him away. Isn't that just as much notice or just as much a -- a stimulus to the response that you want to give, as your reformulation of the -- of the issue?",
  "So it's not the question of notice; it's the question of time to respond.",
  "I don't understand your mandate rule as being consistent with your general theory of the case. Because if the court of appeals cannot order this kind of relief, how could it be that the court of appeals' mandate would authorize the relief? It would seem to me that you've either got to take the position that the mandate is, in effect, a kind of neutral order. The district courts may or may not have authority to do something after the mandate comes down. But I don't see how you can take the position that the mandate, itself, by the court of appeals will, itself, determine what the district court can do.",
  "Because, in effect, I think you are saying, by structuring the mandate in a certain way, the court of appeals can open the door to something that the court of appeals, itself, could not do. But by structuring the mandate in a different way, the court of appeals can cut off the possibility of district court orders of a sort that the court of appeals couldn't do. And that seems -- that is what seems to me inconsistent with your theory of the limited court of appeals jurisdiction.",
  "All right. Now, let's consider -- assuming that the mandate leaves open -- the question open entirely for the district court. You said ultimately what the district court can do depends on the mandate. Can the court of appeals also by mandate say: And by the way, district court, because we couldn't increase the sentence here, you can't do it either? Is that open to the court of appeals?",
  "Then what is the play in the mandate that you are assuming when you say it depends on the mandate? What the district court can do would depend on the mandate.",
  "Where is the -- what option does the court of appeals -- given the limits on what the court of appeals itself can order, what are the options that the court of appeals has in writing the mandate that will determine what the district court can do? What are you getting at.",
  "Yeah.",
  "Okay.",
  "Now you say that could leave open -- if a mandate is general, that could leave open. Can the mandate be specific in precluding?",
  "Yeah.",
  "Yeah.",
  "Well -- if that's the case, if the -- if the -- if it cannot be structured by the request for relief as the Chief Justice is suggesting, then on the Government's theory, in a case like this, if the defendant wins on appeal, he is in serious trouble when that case goes back to the district court; whereas if he loses, he can't be any worse off than he is now. That's a strange -- that's a strange rule.",
  "But in effect that means then -- and this -- I didn't understand this to be your position -- but that means, in effect, that the cross-appeal rule is essentially, as you're arguing for it, a formality. It limits what the district court can do, but it is not a rule that embodies the notion that when a defendant appeals the defendant ought to know, in effect, what he can gain and what he can lose; because if, on your theory, if the defendant wins and there's a mandate back to the district court, it is wide open.",
  "Well, I want to look at them but I want to know what your position is first. And I take it your position is that if the defendant wins, and he cannot by his request for leave limit the relief, as the Chief Justice suggested, then when the case goes back to the district court, in effect, the slate is totally blank and he's starting all over again and he is subject to -- to whatever outer limits he would have been subject to in the first instance.",
  "Then the cross-appeals rule is essentially a rule of appellate court procedure and nothing more.",
  "Yeah. But - -",
  "But it doesn't go beyond that?",
  "A blunder?",
  "Mr. Jorgensen, may I take you back to something you mentioned earlier in the argument? And I thought I followed it at the time, and I may not have understood you. As I recall, you were explaining the difference between (f)(1) and (f)(2)(A) and (B) by saying that in (f)(1), which was -- which does not embody any condition on who has appealed - -",
  "-- the concern is that, if there is an error, it's an error which will in effect infect all cases. It's a circuit error, and it's potentially there for any case that comes along for sentencing; whereas, in (f)(2), if there's an error, the limited damage is simply to the case itself, to the particular defendant. Where I don't follow that reasoning is in the fact that F 1 refers not only to an incorrect -- to a violation of law, but incorrect application of sentencing guidelines, which would seem to include a - - the particulars of a given case. So am I either misunderstanding your argument or maybe misunderstanding subsection 1.",
  "If that's all it said, I would certainly understand your distinction.",
  "I guess the problem I still have is some incorrect applications of the sentencing guidelines pre-Booker were, in fact, violations of law. But not all of them were, any more than all of them are now. But forget the situation now. Not all of them were. And I don't see how you can draw the sort of nonporous distinction that you are drawing. I mean it is a good try; but even pre-Booker there are some incorrect applications that could have been corrected on an abuse standard that were not properly described as violations of law per se.",
  "All right. What if - -",
  "What if, instead, the State simply defined the class as the class of those who commit rape, and then listed as an aggravating circumstance the rape of a child under 12 years old? That would be perfectly consistent with the narrowing jurisprudence, wouldn't it?",
  "Even -- even with respect to -- now, I'm asking you to - -",
  "-- to forget my question again for a minute.",
  "Even on the plurality analysis, your argument, as I understand it is, if there is any question left in Coker, in effect it's answered by Enmund/Tison.",
  "Okay, but then that's a different reason.",
  "Excuse me.",
  "May I go back to your -- to your answer on the murder question? And that was you said there's -- there's a murder analog to this narrow definition, and you gave the example of the murder of the law enforcement officer. And that raises a question that I had about how Lowenfield ought to be read. The example that you gave was one of the five instances which the Court said out in the Lowenfield opinion quoting the Louisiana statute. In each of those five instances, nothing need be proved except, as you have put it, the narrowing circumstance in the law enforcement officer in your example. But under the Louisiana statute which passed muster in Lowenfield, there were five analogs of which the law enforcement officer was one. Each of those crimes was defined as a killing with a specific intent to kill or specific intent to inflict great bodily harm. And then in each one of these instances, there was an extra element added: Law enforcement officer, intent to kill more than three people in Lowenfield, and so on. In fact, child under 12 was one of the examples. It seems to me that the -- one way to read the Louisiana statute there consistently with the - - with the value that Justice Scalia's question raised is this: That Louisiana, in effect, had created a general crime of murder with specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm. And then it had given five instances in which, as I put it a moment ago, there was an extra element: And that extra element, whether it be killing more than two people, whether it be killing a child under 12, law enforcement officer, functioned like the aggravating circumstance; so that, in fact, we didn't have a statute that merely said if you kill a law officer intentionally, that's capital, period. What we had was a capital scheme that says if you kill with specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm, that's murder. And if you commit one of these other five other elements, that narrows it down to capital murder. Isn't that a proper way of reading the Louisiana murder statute from which you took your example? And if it is, isn't that example inconsistent with the theory that you're arguing here that you can simply define child rape as capital and let it go at that?",
  "I quite agree with that. My point was just this: You made the argument -- as I understood it a moment ago -- that the Louisiana child rape statute is not unique; that, in fact, Louisiana defines other crimes very narrowly, so that you were making a different kind of argument. You were saying we in Louisiana define murder of a law enforcement officer very narrowly. No requirement to add any narrowing or aggravating circumstance there, and the statute passed muster. And my point simply is, I don't think that's the way to read the Louisiana statute. The Louisiana statute instead says killing with intent et cetera is -- is capital murder if there is a further circumstance added to it; and five are given. So all I'm saying is I don't think the fact that your capital murder passed muster under Lowenfield is authority for saying that the child rape statute passes muster here.",
  "Well, let's find out how much.",
  "And isn't -- isn't the difference -- isn't the difference just what Justice Scalia brought up in an earlier question to Mr. Fisher? He said what seems to count, the way we have targeted our jurisprudence, turns on how you define the class that is narrowed. And my suggestion to you was that the class that is narrowed under your homicide statute is a class that consist of all killing with specific intent to kill et cetera, which is then narrowed by five different circumstances set out. Here, the class is defined as child murder, and there is nothing in the aggravating circumstances, the possible aggravating circumstances that narrows it any more; and isn't that distinction correct?",
  "What do you say about the effect of Enmund and Tison as a -- as a means to understand how we ought to read Coker? You know what I'm getting at.",
  "What if you had a case and there's a suspicion of something like that that's here, although the courts below did not so find? What if you had a case in -- like this in which the first litigant said to the second, I brought my case and I lost. I want you to try again for me? And if you do and you win, I will give you a job making use of the fruits of the litigation? Would there be an estoppel in that case?",
  "Why.",
  "It held, as I recall, specifically, I think, that there was no collusion found. And the suggestion was that if collusion had been found -- and I was giving you an example of something that I would call collusion at least -- that the result might have been different.",
  "Why wouldn't my example have done so? In my example the agreement was I lost; please try again for me. And if you win, I'm going to give you a job making use of the fruits of the lawsuit. Would that agreement not have been enough to -- to sustain a collusion here?",
  "Why should that -- why should that matter?",
  "Right. But if we adopted -- as I understand it, if we adopted your theory across the board, it would preclude -- it would preclude a preclusion in the case of my hypothetical, and that's what I want to get at. Should we, by adopting your theory, eliminate the possibility of preclusion in the case that I put to you? And you're saying, I guess: Well, if - - even there, there should be no preclusion unless the first party controlled the case in the -- controlled the second case. And my question is: Why?",
  "Well, do you think that the collusion point was perhaps just ill-phrased here? There was no collusion, certainly, in the sense that there was any kind of secret dealing going on. The second lawsuit, the people involved in it, couldn't Taylor -- couldn't have been more candid, I guess, about what was going on. And so there was no collusion in the sense of concealment or underhandedness. Do you think that is perhaps the reason that the court of appeals found that there was no collusion; and that, therefore, we ought to discount that finding?",
  "But here the close relationship seems to boil down to this, and you correct me if I'm wrong here because I may be missing some fact. But it is inconceivable to me that any reason for Taylor's participation or Taylor's bringing this lawsuit could be found except the reason of trying to relitigate Herrick's lawsuit so that Taylor would then either get the job or have an easier time fulfilling the job of fixing up the airplane. I can't think of any other reason on the facts as I understand them from the briefs. Is there a -- on the facts of case, any other possible reason?",
  "Okay. But why else would he be doing -- why else would he have been doing this? What does the record show as another possible explanation?",
  "But if somebody walked in off the street and began this lawsuit and had absolutely no connection with Herrick, and so on, the issue of preclusion wouldn't come up, or at least it wouldn't come up in the context that it comes up here. But this isn't somebody who walked in off the street, and the claim is there is a preclusion doctrine because of the relationship between party one and party two. And the fact that anybody who comes in off the street could have asked -- could have made the same request, in effect, is not an answer to the collusion claim; is it?",
  "Look, I concede we can all see where you're going, but isn't the problem this: In effect, you're asking us to infer a finding of fact, and we're not the trial court. You've raised a good circumstantial suspicion case; but, either because it wasn't raised by your predecessor counsel as well or because the -- for some reason the district court just would not buy it, that's the -- the conclusion that you want us to draw isn't before us. And I don't see that we're the appropriate court to draw it.",
  "Okay. But at no point did the D.C. Circuit or the district court, as I understand it, say that request, in effect, was a request to relitigate this matter so that we both, the owner of the plane and the repairer of the plane, would have what I was seeking in my first lawsuit. They never actually crossed the line and drew that conclusion; did they?",
  "What did it - -",
  "Well, discrimination, when you say \"discrimination,\" I take it you're meaning discrimination not confined to the discrete categories of racial, age, et cetera. You're talking about discrimination for any purpose. And therefore, it seems to me that when you say the government cannot discriminate, I think, in effect, you're saying a government supervisor cannot fire somebody simply because he does not like that person, because that's a discrimination in relation to the people that the supervisor does like; is that correct.",
  "Right. It's not government efficiency; I just don't want to be around this person.",
  "Then it is the case, then, that if you prevail in this case, that the notion of paradigmatic, at-will employment within the government in any State that recognizes that now, that will, in fact, be eliminated to -- to the degree that there is a -- a class-of-one cause of action.",
  "I thought you just agreed that it would happen in the hypothetical because as I -- and maybe I do not understand at-will employment, but I thought the concept of at-will employment was that the individual could be fired for a good reason, a bad reason or no reason at all. Somewhere in that trinity we get Justice Breyer's hypothetical: I don't like him. And you're saying that won't pass muster, but it would pass muster under an at-will employment rule.",
  "What do you say to the argument that the conceivable-basis test is appropriate when we are judging legislation, because we don't know what goes through the minds of individual legislators. Whereas, these kinds of decisions, employment decisions, are, in fact, very specific state-of-mind kind of decisions; and, therefore, the equal-protection standard ought to take that into consideration and look to the specific reasons?",
  "Can we -- can we meet your objection --",
  "Would it meet your concern if we held number one, yes, there may be a class of claim in the public employment context, but any reason that would be a lawful reason for discharge under the at-will rule is a -- a reason that would satisfy the test; and therefore it would be the real outlier that would ever get to the jury?",
  "Well, let me ask you this. I mean, I wasn't trying a trick question but I -- let me be explicit about this. If we adopted the rule that said anything that goes under the at-will rule goes under equal protection class of one, would there be anything left?",
  "Okay. So the reason is, if we opted that rule you'd win across the board.",
  "Do you agree with me that if we adopted a rule that says that anything that goes for at-will employment goes for one-person-class equal protection, and that that in effect would eliminate any cause of action?",
  "Well your clients -- wasn't your client's latest filing that he intended to spend a million dollars.",
  "I think that's --",
  "So it didn't deter him. You're in the position in which it clearly didn't deter your client. He says, I'm going to spend three times as much as the threshold figure, and there is no empirical evidence that it's deterring anybody else.",
  "Don't we expect a chill argument to at least have a ring of plausibility? And your chill argument is that it is deterring. It didn't deter your client. There is no indication that it would deter anybody else and I have to say I don't see why it would.",
  "You mean if the -- if the other side had not had an enhanced spending capacity, your client would then have spent $2 million?",
  "Whatever it is, I mean are you saying that if the -- if the client -- if the opposing party had not had an enhanced spending capacity your client would have spent even more?",
  "That seems to substantiate the, at least the ostensible basis for this statute.",
  "I understand the distinction you're drawing at the present time or at least since the Bill of Rights was adopted. We have two regimes. We have the constitutional condition and we have hearsay rules.",
  "But with respect to the common law as it stood at the time that the Bill of Rights was adopted, there wasn't such a distinction; was there? In other words, to the extent that the confrontation right is informed by the common- law antecedent, the common-law antecedents were not drawing the line that you are drawing; were they?",
  "And if that is the case, then it seems to me you haven't answered Justice Scalia's question. Because Justice Scalia's question says: Let's just talk about common-law antecedents for a moment; and, given common-law antecedents, why were people worried about the consciousness of death under the dying declaration rule if there was this broader rule which is supposed to inform our understanding of the confrontation right, which would have let it in simply because the crime had forfeited the right to object. And it seems to me that you still have not answered his question.",
  "Isn't it -- isn't the -- isn't the weak point in your argument the following: Your argument assumes that when the employer implicitly says I admit the allegations the complainant made, that the employer is admitting, in effect, to disparate treatment. That he is saying: I did it because it was my purpose to discriminate against the old. But if we read the \"because\" language as also admitting the meaning, \"I did it or it had an impact by reason of the age, regardless of my intent,\" then this incongruity that you are arguing about disappears.",
  "In other words, for the purpose of discriminating against the old.",
  "And that's -- that's disparate treatment.",
  "In an impact -- no. In an impact case, he is saying: I admit that the impact falls more heavily on the old.",
  "And -- and it seems to me that's all he has to admit in an impact case. And he does so, and then he --",
  "Well, then you're -- then you're just saying that there -- that there is no such thing as a disparate-impact case.",
  "You're saying -- you're saying that there's got to be a disparate-treatment case.",
  "Well, then I'm not following you.",
  "Wards Cove, in other words, says \"because\" may mean \"correlation\" and it mean \"purpose,\" either one.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, but neither, neither does the fact that there may be dual capacities eliminate the fact that there are contrary tugs on the, the individual or the, or the organization that has the dual responsibilities, and there's no reason that the law should be blind to that.",
  "Okay, let's assume -- let's assume that I'm reviewing it, and I -- I don't find it as clear as you do, and I'm on the fence. Being on the fence, may I take into consideration the fact that there was a conflict of interest?",
  "And therefore I will say, okay, I wouldn't know for sure how to go in this case, but I see the conflict of interest and that's enough to make me say more probably than not there was a reflection of the self-interest of the provider, rather than the interest of the -- of the insured here; and, therefore, I'm going to find that the -- that the conflict did disadvantage the person insured. That would be, I take it on your view, a reasonable application of Firestone.",
  "Well, I just told you.",
  "I just told you how it weighed. I'm sitting on the fence. I'm not sure what to do. I take into consideration the fact that there is conflicting interest here; and, therefore, I conclude that the conflicting interest is the reason for the decision and I hold against the company. Is that a misapplication of Firestone?",
  "Okay.",
  "No. My hypothetical is the hypothetical of the person making the decision. I put myself in that person's position and I'm saying I can think of reasons that might result in concluding that this was a reasonable decision, period. And I can think of reasons that might result in concluding that, in fact, this was a decision that had been made against the interest of the insured because the person making the decision itself had an interest in it. I'm not sure which way to go, but I now take into consideration the fact that there was this conflicting interest in the person or the organization that made the decision, and for that reason, I am going to -- I'm going to break the tie, and I'm going to conclude that the conflict was to the disadvantage of the insured. I'm going to rule against the company. I understood that you said that would be a proper application of Firestone. Is that still your answer?",
  "Well, why wouldn't it be?",
  "No. In my hypothetical, I've taken into - -",
  "-- factors that say the company was right, factors that say the company is wrong. I'm not sure which. They seem evenly balanced to me, until I take into consideration the fact that there was conflicting interest, and I say that's enough to tip it. And it does tip it, and I rule against the company.",
  "And am I right or wrong under Firestone?",
  "That may be, but what's the answer to my question?",
  "Am I right or wrong?",
  "That is not going to - -",
  "That's not going to help the appellate court, my friends here who have to review my decision. They want to know whether I was right or wrong.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Rosenkranz. I think you set up basically three different kinds of scenarios. And I want to set -- I want to put them into my own words and -- and have you tell me whether I understand your -- your point correctly. Scenario number one is the case -- in each of these scenarios, we have the same relationship between the -- in effect, the trustee and -- and the beneficiary that we have here. There -- there is a - - there is a built-in conflict. We don't know what its effect is. In scenario number one, the -- the evidence is that the person making the benefits decision says let's let this person suffer so that we can keep the money. That is the easy case. Scenario number two - -",
  "That's right, the -- the e-mail shows up. In -- in case number two, there -- there is what you referred to as a decision within the zone of reasonableness, but instead of being sort of in the core of the center of the zone of reasonableness, it's close to the edge. A decisionmaker could look at that decision and say if there is no reason to be suspicious about it, it's still within the zone of reasonableness, and I don't think there is a conflict. But if the decisionmaker knows that there is this kind of structural conflict, the decisionmaker can say look, I wasn't born yesterday; the reason it's so close to the edge is that they were giving way to their own self-interest in the conflict, and I'm going to decide for the beneficiary and against the company. Case number three is the case of the person right on the fence, the decisionmaker. The decisionmaker says, I've -- I've looked at everything there is to look at and I cannot decide for sure what this is, whether it was a legitimate decision or a conflicted one in the -- in the decisionmaker's favor, unless I take into consideration the fact that there is this structural conflict.",
  "No the decisionmaker is the person who made the beneficiary -- the benefits decision. And if I take into consideration the structural conflict, that gives the decision to the beneficiary and against the company. Now, in case number two, it's close but the -- but the fact of the conflict is regarded as, itself, as substantive evidence and it -- it results in a decision for the beneficiary. In case number three, the evidence is in equipoise, and to get off equipoise, the conflict rule is taken as the tiebreaker. My understanding is that your view is the proper way to consider the conflict under Firestone is, as I did in my hypo, in both case number two and case number three. Am I correct?",
  "In other words, when we take -- it is taken as substantive evidence to -- to get us out of the zone of reasonableness in case number two. It breaks the tie in case number three.",
  "But -- but the record has the structural context.",
  "No. But in my hypothetical you weren't at the center of the zone of reasonable; you were close to the edge.",
  "Number three Honor we can't make up our mind.",
  "That's right.",
  "So -- so you -- I guess you are saying it may be considered as substantive evidence but it is not a process tiebreaker?",
  "All right. Here are two ways you could do it. You've spoken of reasonableness analysis. By \"reasonableness analysis,\" I mean and I assume you mean that the person who is judging the action taken says: Here are the good reasons on one side that support the action; and here are the reasons on the other side that in fact are critical of it, suggest that it was wrong. Which one of these sets of reasons is the strongest? That's what I sort of mean by \"reasonableness analysis.\" All right. There are two ways that the structural conflict could be taken into consideration in reasonableness analysis. One is it could be taken into consideration during this -- we'll call it the step one process. We put the structural conflict on the -- on the side of the scale that weighs against affirming the decision. A second way to do it would be to go through reasonableness analysis leaving the conflict aside for the moment, and say, on regular reasonableness analysis, do the reasons support the decision predominantly or do they go against it, and let it go at that. But when that kind of \"reasonableness\" analysis results in something close to equipoise, then we take the structural conflict into consideration; and that's what, in effect, sort of breaks the tie. Which of those models do we use? Do we use the structural conflict as a reason in the step one weighing, or do we use the structural conflict as a tiebreaker.",
  "It's a question of when you use it; and on the first hypothetical, you may not have to use it at all. On the second hypothetical, you have to use it because you can't make a decision any other way. So you're saying: Use it at step one as one of the substantive reasons in your weighing analysis?",
  "Mr. Olson, doesn't your answer in effect, in practical terms, exclude the possibility of inserts like that? I mean, what else would they be addressing except smoking and health? That's the only subject on the table.",
  "But, Mr. Olson, isn't the problem that Congress was equally clear, or has at least been assumed to be equally clear, in a contrary line of reasoning that holds against you? And that line of reasoning is this: You agree -- everybody agrees - - that the FTC can represent -- it can regulate advertising and -- and supposed deception on matters that do affect -- relate to smoking and health. It is pretty much hornbook law at this stage of the game that the -- that the FTC's regulation of deceptive advertising does not exclude State regulation of deceptive advertising as a general proposition. In fact, the FTC is very happy to have complementary State regimes. That state of the law is just as clear. It is at least as clear as you say the language is here. Now, given the fact that the FTC can regulate advertising of cigarettes in -- in the -- in the respect that matters here, why don't we have to give some recognition to this complementary regime of State regulation, which, as a general proposition, survives it?",
  "And all I'm saying is what we have here is, you say, a clear preemption provision. But we also have a clear regulatory regime which is at odds with that preemption provision, and presumably we've got to give some effect to that, too.",
  "Well, it's part of a national scheme, but in practical terms you can say that on any subject matter that the FTC regulates. And, nonetheless, the complementary State regimes of -- of regulating deception survive. So that the argument you are making here is an argument that can be made, I suppose, on every subject that the FTC touches.",
  "Perhaps we did not think of it.",
  "How can you accept that and then expect to prove damages in the case? You can accept it to this extent, it seems to me. You can accept it in saying that what we are going to prove at step number one is that it is false to indicate that smoking light cigarettes will result in the ingestion of less tar and nicotine; and we know why you're saying that. But in order to prove damages in your case, you would have to say: People get hurt because there is a relationship between the ingestion of tar and nicotine and their health; and the same cause -- the same causal connection is therefore appropriate for -- for -- is therefore necessary in order to prove that people were hurt.",
  "No, but you're asking for injunctive relief, I guess.",
  "And the reason -- and the reason the product is of different value is that in fact it is dangerous to health, as opposed to -- or more dangerous or equally dangerous to health as opposed to less dangerous to health; so that at the causation stage you've still got to prove the link between causation and health.",
  "Do you think you could recover if the evidence showed simply that all your clients had the health of Olympic athletes?",
  "You do?",
  "What would the harm be, sort of aesthetic?",
  "If they are healthy as horses, you have no proof that it is not.",
  "Yes, what's the difference in value?",
  "Why would the person have decided to quit or not to quit? The person would have made that decision based upon the health consequences.",
  "So -- you are proving a point which depends upon the relationship between smoking and health.",
  "Well, do you take -- do you take that as -- as -- as meaning that the union couldn't buy litigation insurance?",
  "Some of those -- some of those premiums are going to subsidize the defense in - - in -- in cases beyond this bargaining unit. In fact, most of it will.",
  "So -- so in your view, then, even if the agreement with the -- with the parent union in this case involved an explicit obligation on the part of the parent to come in and defend in -- if litigation arose in this unit, that would still be bad?",
  "Well, I'm not interested in insults. Is it -- is it constitutional, or isn't it?",
  "Then -- and -- and -- and you do take the position that a -- a genuine insurance policy issued by an insurer would not violate the constitutional standard?",
  "Well, there was -- there was mutuality of obligation in the hypothesis that I gave you in which the agreement with the parent union required an affirmative obligation of the parent union to come in and defend if litigation arose. And you said that still would not be constitutional.",
  "So the -- so the criterion has got to be something other than mutuality of obligation, right?",
  "And what is the other distinction?",
  "We -- we -- we start with that premise, but what is the other distinction, then? If it is not mutuality of obligation, what -- what is the -- what is the -- the -- the -- the point that separates the -- the sheep from the goats here?",
  "What -- what is -- what has rate setting got to do with -- with your basic point? Your basic point, as I understand it, is that some of the money that's being taken from the -- from the local union and in our example subsidized by the service fee is being used to subsidize litigation for other unions. And that is, it seems to me, exactly true in the insurance case. Some of those premiums will subsidize litigation -- speech -- involving speech in -- in other union bargaining areas. What's the distinction?",
  "I don't know whether that's true or not. If you buy labor litigation insurance I suppose it is not. Don't they set their rates with respect to the experience in labor litigation, not in - - on their experience with automobile accidents.",
  "Neither do I.",
  "You have several times mentioned the public forum as having a significance in drawing the line and I'm not sure I follow you there. Why did you say that?",
  "Let me ask you this. If an employer and a union local decided that you know they would really let the sunshine in and they would conduct their collective bargaining in a theater with microphones and anybody could drop in and hear, would that change the chargibility of, as against the dissenting nonmembers.",
  "But aren't they, aren't they equal chargeable? Isn't the unspoken premise of your argument and what Lehnert is getting at -- they are not only germane, but isn't there an unspoken premise that just as the union will support -- the union of the dissident objectors in negotiating a collective bargaining agreement, the union will also presumably support them if litigation is necessary later on to enforce it? So that the so-called standard by which the union's obligation to support the litigation and the unit that includes the dissidents is not somehow precisely spelled out. The assumption is that they do have some obligation to support the litigation if it comes to the dissidents' unit. And isn't that -- isn't that the point of your argument?",
  "Which is a covenant, in effect, of support.",
  "Okay, so there is no, there is no covenant of support. There is what? A covenant of support if the litigation in the local unit that includes the dissidents has wide significance, and therefore could affect other units? Is that what the - - is that what the obligation is?",
  "Is this any obligation at all? You said okay, there is an obligation of some kind of fair dealing. Given the question that we've got, that doesn't matter unless the fair dealing relates at some point to support for litigation, right?",
  "Right?",
  "Okay.",
  "And how do we articulate what that obligation is? If it's not covenant to support regardless of what the litigation is, how do we articulate what the degree of the obligation of support is?",
  "Yes, but the trouble with saying that is exactly the point that the Chief Justice raised. You don't take the position that no matter what the litigation is, the parent union has got to support it. Therefore, how do we identify the litigation that they will support? How do we know that they have any obligation at all?",
  "Well, it doesn't create a guarantee expressed like the terms of an insurance policy, but there is, in fact, a local practice to which one can refer. And it seems, it would seem reasonable in a case like that to say, okay, you can force the dissident to pay a fair share on the expectation that the same kind of enforcement litigation will take place if there is a dispute this year or next year. We don't have, as I understand it, a clear sort of expectation standard when we are talking about affiliation agreements that involve a parent and many, many other locals. And the point here, it seems to me, is to determine whether there is any obligation at all whether the dissident is getting anything or can expect to get anything for the fee. And what I want to know is how do we describe that obligation?",
  "I'm just not getting the -- I have never understood this argument and I still don't understand it now. What is it in the text of section 2 that would seem to leave it inadequate to touch equity as well as law?",
  "Exactly. And why, therefore, would anyone -- why would anyone be drawing distinctions as to how? It would be enforceable in any way that an agreement might appropriately be enforced in the courts of the United States at the time -- or any courts, for that matter, at the time the act was passed.",
  "It -- it made a categorical statement in section 2. Why did it need to be any clearer than that?",
  "Well, it could be, but why in the world would anyone draw that inference?",
  "Well, why does it set aside? This is the thing I guess I don't understand about the case, and that is what is really driving your side, given the difficulties that I share with the Justices on my right and left here. And the -- the tacit assumption seems to be that you in fact are going to get shortchanged on your arbitration right if you have to bring your arbitration claim in a State court. And I don't see that.",
  "I know section 4 doesn't, but section 2 does.",
  "You can -- based on the Federal act, you can in State court claim your right to enforce the arbitration agreement.",
  "Why don't you do it in the State court instead of going through these gymnastics?",
  "Then bring that up here on appeal from the State court.",
  "May I interrupt you there? I mean, why do you say that? I mean, we -- we have - - just getting outside the criminal law for a minute, we -- we've got a whole system of personal liability law in which the theory is that, in effect, requiring compensation for negligence, even though it is not an act of bad faith or malice, is -- is going to affect conduct. Why do you assume it will not affect conduct here?",
  "Don't you think it's probable that it will affect conduct? I mean, if the police know that they are going to lose the case because they are engaging in a negligent or objectively unreasonable way in -- in relation to their warrant-keeping, they are going to be more careful.",
  "But they -- but they also --",
  "But they also, as in this case, in the course of -- of committing their -- their negligent arrest find evidence of a crime.",
  "They can't know that, but we all know, as a practical matter, that that's why police want the -- the greatest scope to the arrest power.",
  "Because in the course of doing incidental searches, they find things. They know that, and we know that.",
  "What about reaching -- what about reaching your standard in cases in which the arrest is wrong, not because there's no warrant, but because there's just slightly less than probable cause? If there are isolated incidents of that are we going to -- are we going to say that in fact that does not violate the Fourth Amendment?",
  "No. We're starting with the assumption that there is a violation of the -- I think we're starting with background law at this point that there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment if there is an arrest without probable cause or without a valid warrant.",
  "The warrant itself may be subject to attack, but at least that's sort of the front line of our objective reasonableness inquiry. And you're making a dent in the warrant requirement for isolated incidents, and I don't see why we can't or why coherence would not require us to make the same dent in the probable cause requirement for equally isolated mistakes.",
  "Well, if Miss Karlan's figures are correct in Alabama there would be suppression.",
  "No. I said if her figures are correct and there's a 13 percent error rate either in the State of Alabama or at least in the department involved that we'd have suppression there.",
  "Well, it's going to function -- even on your theory, it's going to function differently on a department to department basis depending on the error rate.",
  "Well, if you've got a 13 percent error rate I think you've got a pretty good prima facie case.",
  "But the fact is unless the \"more\" showed that they were getting a 13 percent error rate in a negligence-free system, you would have suppression there and you would not have suppression there in the town next door or the county next door or the State next door.",
  "But I thought that basically was the distinction that you were arguing for.",
  "But I take it if you're not accepting -- if you're not accepting -- I mean, you're not accepting the proposition that the 13 percent error rate which is not somehow shown to be non-negligent should have a different result, you are saying in the 13 percent case we're still not going to suppress.",
  "But if you -- if you were to make that argument and it came down to that bald a proposition, I assume you would come in with some kind of evidentiary basis to tell us exactly what the cost is. And you have spoken of the cost today. You have not spoken of the benefit and the value of having relatively error-free arrest recordkeeping. But I haven't heard anything about the unreasonable cost of the exclusionary rule - -",
  "-- beyond the record.",
  "Sure, sure it is. But that does not even get us to, as it were, to half the equation. We want to be know how much of that there is and we want to be able to measure against that the value that society is getting by requiring valid arrest warrants and in a probable cause case by requiring probable cause. And you can't just walk in and say, well, there's a cost. We know there's a cost.",
  "Don't you think we should if we are in effect -- if you are making what sounds to me like an empirical argument -- there is a cost to society, cases are being lost, criminals are going free -- don't you think that we ought to have a factual basis to know what that cost is?",
  "We've done an exclusionary rule now and in effect you are arguing for an exception to it because the cost is too great, and it seems to me the burden is on you to tell us what the cost figure is.",
  "But if you take that argument to the extreme, we won't have an exclusionary rule at all, I suppose.",
  "But don't you take -- I understood you to take the position and I thought the Court had previously taken the position that the cost benefit analysis had to be a systemic one.",
  "No, I think that's -- I think that's true. I mean, we operate -- quite think frankly we operate on the basis of a -- of a good guess and I think your argument is saying let's have -- let's have an exception to the good guess. And if -- if you start with a good guess as the baseline it seems to me you -- you ought to have something more than another guess to justify the exception.",
  "Well, we do have a -- we do obviously require a justification for the bright-line rule itself. And -- and the problem that this case raises, I think, if anything more acutely than any of the others that we've had recently, is that it seems if -- if your position is -- is going to be accepted, to divorce the search totally from the justification for the Chimel rule. And -- and at some point we've either got to say, all right, it's no longer a Chimel rule, there's some other justification for the bright-line rule; or we've got to say, to purport to apply the Chimel rule in a case like this, handcuffed in the back of the police car and so on, is -- is to turn the law into nonsense. And -- and I -- I think we've got that choice in front of us. Do we have a new and different rule, or do we apply Chimel and say, you just can't go this far. This is like the station house.",
  "Do you know of any one of those cases in which the officer got hurt? Do you know of any one of those cases in which the person who got out of the police cruiser made a beeline for -- for his own car? In fact, so far as I know, we are -- we are not even sure that those people came out of automobiles before they were put in a police cruiser. But do you know of any case in which they went to their own car and tried to get a gun to hurt the cop?",
  "Did he -- did he have - - have his hands handcuffed behind his back?",
  "And he was able to drive the car?",
  "I'd really like to meet him.",
  "I take it you agree it's perfectly workable to say that if the defendant has been taken to the police station, they can't then search the car - -",
  "Why isn't it equally workable to say when the defendant is handcuffed and put in the back of a cruiser, they can't do it?",
  "Right. And -- and we are talking now about administeribility. The police station rule is administrable; it makes for a good bright-line rule; why doesn't handcuffs in the back of the cruiser make for an equally bright line?",
  "We can't decide this case based on sympathy to DuPont. I would understand the point of your argument. But if -- in theory the problem would be exactly the same, whether DuPont had expressed a doubt and paid it into the estate or hadn't.",
  "We have the same question before us.",
  "Yes.",
  "But isn't -- isn't the problem that it must be an indirect arrangement, and what you are arguing for here is an indirect effect. And it has that indirect effect on your reasoning because of the -- of the waiver and because of probate law. And it seems to me, as I read the -- the IRS reg, the \"arrangement\" that it's referring to is an arrangement which in and of itself would -- would effect the transfer. And that is not the case here.",
  "The only person who acquires it -- the only entity that acquires it is the estate.",
  "Do you believe, as I understood you to suggest a moment ago, that you could prove causation if the statement \"It is terrible\" or \"Sexual harassment is terrible\" had been uttered in effect in the abstract without reference to particular behavior or a charge of particular behavior on the part of a co-worker or an employer? In other words, if A says \"Sexual harassment is terrible\" and elsewhere in the company sexual harassment is going on and A is then fired, would it be your view that A would at least state a claim if A said, I had expressed disapproval of sexual harassment, it turns out there was sexual harassment being gone -- taking place elsewhere; and I was fired for that reason. Would that at least state a claim that would get a harassment case into court?",
  "What I'm getting at, doesn't the statement \"It's terrible\" or whatever the opposition may be have to be made in relation to some specific activity?",
  "Then what is the limit? It seems to me you've got a cause of action in effect under the statute that would be virtually unlimited. Anybody who thinks sexual harassment is bad and later gets fired can claim retaliation under the statute if it turns out just as a matter of good luck that somebody was being sexually harassed unbeknownst to the speaker.",
  "You mean if she had made complaints after she had answered the questions in - - and given the information at issue here, that would convert her prior statements into opposition?",
  "I'm asking you. You're in effect saying there has got to be some kind of what you call active opposition; and I took it from what you said a moment ago that if she had given the evidence in question here, and then in the period, subsequent period of two months, made some sort of complaint, that that complaint would have qualified her original evidence as opposition. Is that your position?",
  "You're taking about - -",
  "If the -- if the employee in response to the inquiry that's being made says yes, I saw my employer do \"X\" and it happened -- and I think it's terrible, that is certainly specific to the act.",
  "But the reason -- but the reason it doesn't cross the line is you are, in effect, saying that \"oppose\" within the meaning of the statute has got to be read more narrowly than the -- than the notion of oppose as we commonly use that word in common speech. And I don't know why -- I don't know what your -- what your authority is for saying that \"oppose\" was not used in its commonsense everyday connotation.",
  "But in my hypothetical, we're not talking about a general sense. In my hypothetical we were talking about a reference to a very specific act. So the generality problem doesn't arise. And yet despite the specificity, you say, and despite the fact that in common speech a -- a specific statement like that would be taken as opposition, you say it shouldn't be under the statute. And the statute doesn't have any definition that narrows it. Common speech wouldn't narrow it your way. Why should it be narrowed your way?",
  "Well, you say it's not made mandatory. Any employer who doesn't go through it is crazy. And I don't see how this Court, having imposed in practical terms the requirement that Justice Ginsburg just described, can then say, oh, but we're going to construe this indefinite term of \"investigation\" to exclude this kind of employer activity which our construction of the statute has virtually mandated. So that if in fact the employer's investigation succeeds in ending the problem and there is no EEOC complaint, those who participated in the investigation are absolutely helpless against retaliation. That would be a bizarre way to interpret a -- a statute in which we have any -- any opportunity to interpret \"investigation\" to include this kind of investigation. What do you say to that?",
  "No. But I'm -- I'm giving you an argument as to why we should construe it to elevate it, and -- and the argument is that we, in effect, in what I think were correct decisions -- you agree, you said a moment ago, were correct decisions - - have in practical terms mandated this kind of an inquiry. Why then would it be reasonable for us, if we have any option in construing the term \"investigation,\" to construe it to exclude this kind of investigation and exclude coverage of the people who under our decisions are supposed to come forward and - - and answer questions? Why would that be a reasonable construction?",
  "Well, why isn't it -- why isn't an investigation by the employer an \"investigation\"? That's the language of the statute.",
  "And instead they would substitute the -- the response to an EEOC investigation in which they would not have the leg to stand on in opposing respondeat superior. I suppose that would be an inducement for them to go ahead with the investigation; wouldn't you?",
  "By the way, I take it in - - in this case, although this is not the issue before us, that if you -- if you lose on the issues before us, it is still your position that ultimately you should win this case, because you have good evidence, you say in your briefs, to indicate that the reason for firing had nothing to do with retaliation. That's true, isn't it?",
  "Where was the statutory authority suspending the obligation to provide an EIS? You mentioned a regulation. Where in the statute does it say that the Council on Environmental Quality can dispense with this requirement?",
  "No, but that's not the question I am asking. I am not asking about the consequences of not complying. I am asking what is the statutory authority for the Council on Environmental Quality to dispense with the statutory obligation to prepare it?",
  "That's what -- as I understand it, that's what you're arguing in effect, as an intervening -- as of intervening legal significance. And I want to know what the statutory authority is for that. I don't see it in NEPA.",
  "Okay. As a general proposition that's fine, but what's the statutory authority for them to engage in rulemaking authority that dispenses with the government's obligation to comply with an EIS requirement?",
  "But you -- I mean, the claim is that you weren't complying with it at the time the request for an injunction was brought, and everything else is consequent on that. So I want to go back to the point, in effect, at which the claim was made that the government is not complying. One of your answers to that is right now, as a result of subsequent Council on Environmental Quality action, we're not in the same situation that we were in when the suit was brought. And I want to know what the statutory authority is for the Council on Environmental Quality to take the action with the effect that you claim it has.",
  "That - -",
  "-- seems to cut against you. I am not getting it.",
  "Okay, but - -",
  "Let me -- let me switch back. Chief? Let me switch back in time for a second to the beginning of these exercises. One of the -- I mean, one of the arguments, and you have alluded to it, for I guess the appropriateness of the Council on Environmental Quality's action, if it has any power to act, is emergency circumstances. My understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, is that the exercises began in February of 2007. My understanding is that it was in that same month of February 2007 that the Navy produced the EA, the environmental assessment, so that in effect, as I understand it, the Navy disclosed the fact that it would not provide an EIS at just about the same moment that it began the exercises.",
  "And I guess my question is, to the extent that there was an emergency, wasn't the emergency created by the failure of the Navy to take any timely action? I am assuming in my question that the Navy had decided before February 1st, 2007, that it was going to have these exercises. So it sounds to me as though that, if there is an emergency, it's one that the Navy created simply by failing to start an EIS preparation in a timely way at which it tried in effect to sort of neutralize by keeping everybody in the dark until the last moment. So, why -- why shouldn't we say that -- even assuming the Council on Environmental Quality can somehow dispense with the statute, why shouldn't we say that there was no emergency here except one which was created by the Navy's apparently deliberate inattention?",
  "Well, it was a gap of less than month, right?",
  "And how long does it -- how long does it take -- going back to Justice Breyer's question, how long does it take to prepare an environmental impact statement? It takes more than - -",
  "It takes more than a month, doesn't it.",
  "Okay.",
  "And the Navy knew more than the 1st -- earlier than the 1st of February that it was going to engage in these exercises, didn't it?",
  "Sure, but they wouldn't have been in the situation in January of 2008 if they hadn't been in the situation I described in February of 2007. And it sounds to me as though the Navy played its cards very close to its vest - -",
  "-- in 2007.",
  "Didn't both the circuit and the district court, although they mentioned that, in fact find that it was -- I forget what their phrase was -- beyond question.",
  "\"Near certainty.\"",
  "There is no -- there is no harm. I mean, the standard may or may not be bright, but there is no harm to the Navy in this case from - - from the use of that standard, I take it.",
  "Well, we -- we may, but so far as the case is concerned we may -- and we frequently do -- say there -- there -- that certainly there's no harm in this case, the error was harmless.",
  "But that -- in effect, you are saying the EA is the equivalent to an EIS.",
  "What is the difference between them? I -- I assume the difference is the EIS is a more comprehensive survey and -- and set of conclusions.",
  "So that without the EIS, the Navy is acting in -- in a state of -- of some degree of ignorance greater than would be the case if -- if it had done -- done the EIS.",
  "And that, I presume, is the harm that the -- that the statute is intended to prevent.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, don't we have to assess the need for -- for showing a specific threatened injury on a -- on a somewhat elastic standard in a case like this? Because the claim is made on the other side that if we do not allow, if we do not find standing to challenge the regulation per se, there are going to be a number of specific instances which in practical terms can never be challenged when that regulation is applied. There were one or two instances, as I recall, of cases in which on your theory there could be no challenge because the announcement of the action was made on the very date that the action was taken. So that if we do not find sufficient elasticity and standing to allow a challenge to the regulation on behalf of people of the sort that Justice Breyer described, there will, in fact, be a preclusion of any challenge to a lot of specific actions. What's your answer to that?",
  "Assume for the sake of argument that it is made in this case.",
  "What should you respond?",
  "But your response to that is going to be, I presume, that in fact, absent a specific activity before the court, the -- the challenge is not ripe. So that if you are going to stick to your position elsewhere in this case, they are going to fail in that enterprise.",
  "He doesn't know that in advance. That is the premise of Justice Stevens's question, and it is the premise of mine. There -- the point is being made by them that this happened so fast that the threat has been realized before they could respond to it.",
  "I will -- I will assume for sake of argument it is the exception, not the rule.",
  "Let's assume we have got the exceptional case. Would there be standing?",
  "So that if in Justice Stevens's hypo one could show that there had been three or four or five instances of action so fast it was impossible to challenge it, there would with that as a predicate be standing to challenge the regulation as these people are trying to challenge it?",
  "Okay.",
  "Tell us how they could challenge it, then? Tell us the right way?",
  "Well, if it's the forest next door that he is worried about and they have not tried a -- a -- a kind of quickie lumbering action in the forest next door before, he would not be able to challenge it.",
  "I think you never completed your answer in commenting on the National Wildlife Federation statement with reference to footnote 2. What is it that footnote 2 tells us in light of which we must read what the Chief Justice quoted?",
  "Well, you don't suggest that if there were 40 percent white crossover voting, we would find white bloc voting within the Gingles condition, do you? Do you think that is a serious possibility?",
  "No, but I mean you really do have an answer to Justice Alito's question.",
  "Aren't you adopting the principle of maximization?",
  "Let me ask you this, and correct me if I am wrong, because it has been a long time since Gingles came along and I may be forgetting things. But I -- I thought when you are given the alternatives you were just giving, one 80 percent and two 40 percents, that because there is not a principle of maximization there simply is not an abstract or bright-line answer to the question; and that in order to get an answer to the question, you look at all of the other things that districting authorities look to, and you see how they add up, whether we are talking about compactness, congruency with -- with -- with other political lines, and so on. And unless you look to all the other things that reasonably can and should be take into consideration when districting is done, you simply cannot answer the question, should there be two 40's or one 80. Am I wrong?",
  "But they weren't part of your answer to the Chief Justice.",
  "It needs to consider it, but I thought your answer was it needs to do it. Is that your answer?",
  "Okay if there is no reason for the super-majority. My point is that you cannot answer the question in the abstract. And when you start to answer it, as you are doing now, you are going beyond the abstract and you are getting into facts outside the mere choice between two 40's and one 80. And that seems to me to be correct. At least, if it's not correct, you and I are making the same mistake.",
  "I don't know why it would require maximization. It would -- it would certainly open the door to -- to more districts required by section 2 than if we have a 50 percent rule. But I -- I think your brother conceded that when -- when you draw a district, you are bound by our case law as well as tradition to look to something more than maximization, and maximization is in fact not the law. So I don't see why it would be required.",
  "What's that got to do with maximization?",
  "There is no question that if they are -- if they win this case, I think there is no question there will be more claims requiring -- or potentially more claims requiring adjustment of lines based on avoiding section 2 violation. I would almost think that was common ground. But that is a different thing from saying that the result of those claims is going to be a required maximization. And that's - - that's the only point that I -- that I meant to pick - - pick up on.",
  "You are saying they will tend to maximization in order to avoid litigation.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, since the district is drawn from the counties and there's a stipulation with respect to the counties, doesn't it follow in the absence of some surprising fact that there would be bloc voting or the stipulation would cover bloc voting in the district?",
  "But regardless, regardless of the -- the variations in mix, if you are stipulating that there's bloc voting in county A, bloc voting in county B, and you have got a district made up part of A, part of B, doesn't it follow in -- in the absence of some pretty specific evidence to the contrary, that in the district there is probably going to be bloc voting?",
  "Do you have evidence in the record -- did you put evidence in the record that this particular district is carved from some peculiar section of county A and county B, so that the general bloc voting pattern does not apply in the district?",
  "Well - -",
  "But just help me on the facts, because I may have misunderstood the facts. You're saying you did not stipulate that there was bloc voting; you stipulated that there was sufficient evidence for a factfinder to find that there was bloc voting. Is that your position?",
  "Okay, and you're at 130?",
  "Yes.",
  "But what do you make of the -- the beginning of the next paragraph? \"Plaintiffs hereby advise the court that they do not wish to be heard further or to present evidence regarding the remaining issues.\" Doesn't -- I'm not sure what that's getting at, but when I looked at it, I thought it meant that the stipulation can control, i.e., it may be found without objection that there is bloc voting or assumed without objection that there is bloc voting.",
  "If you don't wish to present evidence.",
  "Yes, I realize, but when you then say \"And we don't wish to present any evidence on it,\" it sounds to me as though you are conceding the issue.",
  "It's okay.",
  "But -- but you are saying it's an opportunity, and what you mean is it is sufficient to provide an opportunity. And Justice Breyer's question is: Isn't the two-to-one ratio something that we should consider as also being sufficient to provide an opportunity?",
  "Well, it's -- it's a greater opportunity than -- than would be given to them in -- in the district or a pair of districts that splits the minority population in half. But how is it in some abstract sense a greater opportunity?",
  "The opportunities are - - are measured on the ground, not in the abstract.",
  "I don't know if you litigate whether you are -- whether you are really talking about a -- a possible two percent variation. So that I mean, I -- I think you have to concede under your -- under your test that there's going to be more litigation. There is going to be more claims than there are under a 50 percent rule.",
  "Except that you have a better chance so you are more likely to do it.",
  "Two percent is pretty big in an election.",
  "Well, it seems to me that misses the point of the case. I mean, the point of the case is that consent to the police was established, consent to police informants was not, and that when I consent I am not consenting to the -- to the whole world. If I am consenting to somebody who is not a police officer, that is not equivalent to consenting to a police officer. That's the point of the case; and as I understand it, there was -- there was only one case at the time that this occurred which equated the confidential informant for the police with the police; and that was the Seventh Circuit case; isn't that correct?",
  "No, but that -- that equates -- in terms of existing law, that equates the government agent, which in this case is not a police officer, but a confidential informant, with a police officer. And it seems to me that is the nub of the case: Is that person equivalent, so that consent to one in effect is consent to as many police as want to come in, or is it not the case? And it seems to me what you have got to argue here is that the confidential informant and the police officer for Fourth Amendment purposes should be treated as identical.",
  "And there is no clear law on that. That's why we are here. There's one -- at the time that this search was made, as I understand it, there was only one case which held there was such an equivalence, is that correct?",
  "Well, first -- I want to hear what you say, but tell me, is it correct that at that time there was one case that held the equivalence?",
  "Which was not a circuit case, right?",
  "District case?",
  "So there were three circuit court holdings that the confidential informant was equivalent to a police officer?",
  "Okay, did you -- now, do you have other circuits that held that?",
  "Where is Pollard from?",
  "Sixth.",
  "Okay. Now why -- why are they correct? Why should the confidential informant be treated as equivalent to a police officer?",
  "He was trying -- and he was trying to make a deal to get leniency with the police.",
  "But you -- you certainly cannot argue -- maybe you are, but I don't see how can you argue in response to Justice Ginsburg that the integrity to be expected from a confidential informant, taking that as a category of law including all sorts of informants, is the integrity that we would expect in a police officer.",
  "Why can't I?",
  "Then if that -- if that is true, as it clearly is, they run the gamut from the good to the bad. You can't make -- adopt the proposition categorically that confidential informants should be regarded as having the same integrity as a police officer.",
  "We're talking about probable cause. If they got a warrant within an hour or two of the time that that informant says he saw them there, do you seriously question whether there would be probable cause?",
  "But we're asking for the basis. You're asking for a rule and our questions go to the reason for having that rule. And the officers may have said -- and I will assume they said -- in this case: Oh, gee, we weren't sure the drugs would still be there. But in terms of probable cause law, that's just not a serious answer, is it?",
  "They don't even need an anticipatory warrant. They need a warrant to go in and search that place on the grounds that there are probably drugs there, and if they saw drugs there a couple of hours beforehand and they had no affirmative evidence which they should bring forward under the Frank standard to indicate that the drugs were being taken out, is there any serious question that probable cause would be found?",
  "An informant just came out and said there were drugs there and they don't have probable cause?",
  "Why not?",
  "The reason the police are being faulted is that they didn't get a warrant. And the warrant requirement is a generally good starting place for a Fourth Amendment argument. Justice Ginsburg's point is that if they had an informant who had seen drugs in the place within two hours, they had, if they'd been before a magistrate, the basis in probable cause to get a warrant. And I still haven't heard why in fact they couldn't have got one or why they didn't have the probable cause.",
  "I'm not interested in what they personally believed. We're talking about objective Fourth Amendment standards. Did they or did they not have a basis to establish probable cause at that point?",
  "That is - -",
  "I will admit that is the most astonishing view of probable cause I have heard in this courtroom. Of course they had.",
  "Why doesn't it?",
  "Why doesn't it? As I understand, the record evidence is that their informant was in that guy's home, and within two hours of the point that we went through, the second entry, he had seen drugs. Why wasn't there probable cause within that two-hour period?",
  "Is that a reasonable belief?",
  "I mean, we're talking about probable cause, not an establishment of mathematical certainty.",
  "They clearly would have been if they had sent a police officer in. You're asking us to extend the police officer rule to include a confidential informant rule. One reason for doing so is, or would be, that in practical terms there is a need for it. Justice Ginsburg's question was, why is there a need for it, when they could have gotten a warrant? And we still haven't heard an answer.",
  "Then why didn't they use the confidential informant to get a warrant?",
  "That doesn't - -",
  "But if our question is should consent once removed be recognized as a doctrine that covers the confidential informant in this case, one question that we may sensibly ask is, is there a need to recognize that broad a consent doctrine? And one question that would bear on that would be, in these cases, is there difficulty or impossibility of getting a warrant under normal probable cause standards? And I think that was the point of Justice Ginsburg's question. Do you doubt that they could have gotten a warrant within the two-hour period?",
  "But isn't the reason it's insubstantial is that we have a rule for independent reasons having nothing necessarily to do with this kind of situation in which one officer's knowledge is regarded as another officer's knowledge. The police are regarded as a group, so that we have a rule ready, in place, saying: You show one, you have shown the whole department. We don't, however, have any such rule with respect to agents generally.",
  "Mr. Metzler, what do you say to this line of reasoning, we have in prior cases adopted the positions that for purposes of establishing probable cause, the knowledge of one police officer is also the knowledge of all police officers, at least within a department or working on a particular problem. So that if in a case in which there is a search without a warrant, if you add up everything that individual officers knew and that amounts to probable cause, then the search is good. Why don't we apply, in effect, the same rule in the hypothetical case that you have been given, which is a police officer who was admitted by consent and there are other police officers outside. At the point at which the police officer who has been admitted has the knowledge necessary for an arrest and has that knowledge as a result of the invitation and the waiver of privacy as to him, why don't we regard that on sort of general doctrinal grounds as a waiver of privacy with respect to the police in general, just as we regard police knowledge as being imputed to all police officers? That way you don't have the problem that, for example, Justice Kennedy's hypo raises, even in the case of exigent circumstances. But it doesn't open the door to what you were objecting to here. Why isn't that a proper solution or proper answer to this hypo?",
  "No, you are absolutely right in terms of his psychological process, the only person he has invited in is the one person. The reason for coming up with the answer I suggested is a broader doctrinal reason. That is the reason that we have for probable cause purposes regarded the police -- or the knowledge of one police officer as the knowledge for all. Why don't we, for the same reasons, since it is privacy that is at stake in all of these cases, regard the invitation of one police officer as the invitation of all, or to all?",
  "It would be consent to one officer plus a doctrinal basis to construe that consent for Fourth Amendment purposes as a broader consent.",
  "That's what we would be doing. We wouldn't be doing it because the individual in the trailer says I am inviting in the whole L.A. police department. We are doing it because he invites one L.A. police officer in, and we have doctrinal basis for regarding the police, as it were, collectively rather than individually for probable cause purposes when privacy is at stake.",
  "Would it not open the door to, I guess, to what you are objecting to?",
  "Right. I think I may have created this problem for you and -- and maybe I -- I should get you out of it.",
  "I'm not suggesting that the probable cause rule is what is operative here. I'm saying that for probable cause purposes we regard the police collectively, and why, since our privacy is at stake there and is at stake here -- why shouldn't we have a collective consent rule, too?",
  "That -- that's my proposal.",
  "Well, didn't we furnish the premise for that broader reasoning? Because we pointed out that the traditional role of the jury was standing in effect as the buffer between the power of the State and the individual, and our concern in the Apprendi cases was that the concept of elements was being manipulated in such a way that the jury no longer stood in that -- in effect, that buffer position. And I guess the question here would be, is there -- is there room for -- in effect, for manipulation by the law in the consecutive sentencing scheme or the potential consecutive sentencing scheme, so that the jury in effect loses control over the length, the ultimate length of time that an individual is going to serve? What is your response to that?",
  "No, but isn't the problem with that argument the problem that Justice Scalia raised a moment ago, where you could have made the same argument with respect to a mandatory State guideline, but nonetheless, the change in the law brought to bear on the new law an old concept. And this is a change in the law, to be sure. I agree with you, historically. The judges -- once consecutive sentencing came in at all, they were free to, in effect, do what they wanted to, subject to some kind of a rule of reason. But we've got to apply the Apprendi concept and the concern of the jury trial right to this new situation. So I don't think it's an answer to say, well, the judge has never had such a -- such a power.",
  "But we defined in effect what was the functional element of the greater offense in terms of the -- the power or the capacity of the judge to increase the sentence beyond the range that would have been -- that would have established the maximum in the absence of that factfinding, right?",
  "All right. And aren't we in exactly the same position here? Because the defendant here can correctly say: I cannot be sentenced to the more onerous -- under a more onerous scheme of consecutive sentencing unless some fact is found which has not been found by the jury in coming to verdicts of guilty in any of these crimes; a further fact must be found to expose me to the heavier penalty. And that is exactly the same as the situation in Apprendi with one possible exception; and that is, do you accept, as I thought you did, the proposition that consecutive sentencing is the heavier penalty or is a more onerous sentencing alternative. If you accept that, I don't see how you would escape the analogy with Apprendi.",
  "Everybody agrees.",
  "If you had a choice between two concurrent sentences and two consecutive sentences, you know which one you are going to choose. So we -- we know what is the heavier sentence or the heavier sentencing option.",
  "But the mandatory minimum is at least within the range of sentencing possibilities that the judge could impose anyway without any further factfinding by the jury.",
  "Mr. Lannet, one of the - - or perhaps the driving force behind Apprendi was the fear of abuse by a combination of the charging power and the sentencing power. What abuse do you see if -- if you lose this case? What potential abuse?",
  "That it would - -",
  "No, I didn't mean to interrupt.",
  "They -- they would do by consecutive sentencing the same sort of thing that they were trying to do or some legislatures, Congress was trying to do by the sentencing factors?",
  "They found the greater offense, so there would have been no need for them to go to the lesser included offense. Your trouble is -- and I think the problem that we are having is that in finding the greater offense, they may have done so under a theory of accomplice liability that was consistent with the accomplice simply coming in at a late stage in the proceedings.",
  "I mean, that's the difficulty we are having.",
  "Right.",
  "I thought the, the difficulty with using that as a means of answering the first error was that the way the special circumstance instruction was phrased, they could have found the special circumstance without finding anything more than that he came in at a late stage.",
  "The second -- go ahead.",
  "Yes, but isn't -- maybe I'm not getting it. Help me out here. One possibility under -- under the instruction at JA 13 is \"or assisted in the crime of robbery.\" And the other instructions because they are erroneous leave open the possibility of finding that he assisted in the crime of robbery only if he came in late. And that's why it does not solve the original error.",
  "I may be doing that.",
  "Yes.",
  "Where does it say that he must have assisted prior to - -",
  "Then that doesn't cure the error.",
  "Yes, but isn't the problem on your side of the case that there was another \"in for a dime, in for a dollar\" argument and that was the hypothetical holding the hands behind the back while some third party slugged the victim? And on that hypothetical, there was no reference to a definite crime. In that hypothetical the victim was killed, and under that hypothetical, there was no reference to the crime, i.e., homicide, and so it seems to me that the prosecutor's arguments, the dime-dollar arguments, went both ways.",
  "Sure, in that case. But there was another one in which the prosecutor didn't do that.",
  "I did -- maybe I dreamed this. I thought the prosecutor also gave as a dime for a dollar example the example of the individual, the accomplice who holds a victim's hands while a third party slugs the victim and in fact kills the victim. And I thought in that hypothetical argument the prosecutor was saying that the -- that the accomplice was an accomplice to homicide, even though he didn't know at the time the assault started that homicide was intended or would result.",
  "Well, if you take the argument as a whole you've got at best an ambiguous argument. You've got an argument that points to a \"the crime\" interpretation and you've got an argument part of which points to an \"any crime\" interpretation, and to the extent that your case may ultimately turn on the significance of the prosecutor's argument, it seems to me that the benefit of the doubt goes to the defendant.",
  "Maybe I'm beating a dead horse, but it seems to me that what we've brought in our questions from the bench is that that is not correct. In one instance the prosecutor clearly tied it to shooting. If that's all we had before us we wouldn't have an argument. But in the other iteration of the dime-dollar argument, the prosecutor didn't tie it to shooting.",
  "Well, excuse me. \"Intent\" is broad enough to go to the DA issue, isn't it?",
  "What's the answer to my question? I mean \"the\" and \"a\" are references to what the accomplice had in mind at the time of acting. That's an intent issue.",
  "Well, isn't -- isn't the argument for objective unreasonableness, number one, to begin with, what you just stated. Of course, there is some ambiguity there. I'll be candid to say that if I were stating it myself, I would say there is more than some ambiguity here. It seems to be, if not misleading, at least incapable of informing a jury of exactly what the law is. Number two, the -- the second point in the argument is, the jury comes back repeatedly, and although, as you point out, it is -- it may well be a proper answer to a jury request for clarification to say, go back and read the instruction; the answer is there. When it has been demonstrated by repeated jury questions that they are just not getting it, that they still have perplexity, the court has got to do something more than just say, oh, go back and do it again. And number three, in this situation in which there is ambiguity, there is a demonstration of jury confusion. There is an argument by the prosecutor which, in fact, is a two-part argument or a two-example argument and it cuts both ways, isn't it objectively reasonable to say under those circumstances that there was an inadequate instruction to the jury in -- in the correct Washington law?",
  "Then -- then what would it take?",
  "The -- the \"opposite\" in this case would mean that the jury was properly instructed and was in a position adequately to understand Washington law correctly? That's the - - that's the opposite position.",
  "I want to know what you mean. That's what you mean by the \"opposite position\"?",
  "Would you -- you are saying you want -- why don't you answer my question? My question is: I think you're telling me that it would be objectively reasonable to say that on the scenario I just laid out the jury probably understood Washington law correctly.",
  "And that way would be the way we just set out, wasn't it: That the jury, if -- if -- if, in fact, it's objectively reasonable to conclude that the jury did understand Washington law correctly on those circumstances, then -- then the -- the Respondent here cannot win in -- in his collateral attack?",
  "Well, it required it because that is what the FDA had approved as a label. But as -- excuse me -- as I understand it, the -- the company, Wyeth, could have gone back to the FDA at any time and said, either based on experience or just our rethinking of the data that we have, we think the label ought to be changed to say \"Don't use IV push.\" Wyeth could have done that at any time, and it simply didn't do it. And the -- the reason I raise this is because it could have done it at any time, where, going back to Justice Kennedy's first question, where is the conflict?",
  "But as I understand it, Wyeth's argument is not this argument. Wyeth is not saying the reason there is a conflict here is that we tried to give the kind of warning that the Vermont jury, in effect, says we should have given and the FDA didn't allow us to do it, so that, in fact, there is a conflict between a specific rejection by the FDA of the Vermont rule and the rule that the Vermont jury applied.",
  "As I understand it, Wyeth's argument is: Whatever is on the label, in fact, is the standard of conflict. It doesn't matter whether we tried or could have tried or didn't try. You simply look at the label and you look at what the Vermont jury did; and if there is a -- if there is a difference between them, there is a conflict. Am I right about your argument?",
  "Well, is it -- is it strict liability or negligence? In other words, are they saying you must have done so, or are they saying because you could have done so and didn't you did not conform to the standard of care?",
  "With respect to the obligation in this case, may I go back to an earlier question that Justice Scalia asked you? And I -- I - - if you responded to this particular point, I didn't get it. He said that he understood that Wyeth had in fact asked the FDA to modify the label, at least to strengthen the warning against IV push, and that request was -- was denied, so that in fact that -- that created the conflict. What is your response to -- to the factual basis for that -- for that comment?",
  "Well, regardless of what their, their semantic label was, was there a request at least to -- to beef up the warning against using IV push? And if so, did the -- did the FDA reject it and say no, you can't do that.",
  "What would it - -",
  "What would it have said?",
  "But you -- you also, to be clear on it, as I understand it, you do not accept the position that the FDA puts forward, that the obligation depends upon the accrual of new information.",
  "Any information, new or old, as I understand it, on your argument raises this obligation to -- to act.",
  "But getting to Justice Scalia's point, as I understand your answer to an earlier question, on the day that the FDA approves the label, if there is no further information indicating danger, then any liability that is based upon what the -- the kind of information that the FDA knew would be pre-empted. The only time -- you're saying pre-emption does not occur when there is -- forget the word \"new\" for a moment -- when there is further information, information in addition to what the FDA was told, whether it's 1,000 years old or discovered yesterday; and if there is liability predicated on further information beyond what the FDA was told, then there is not pre-emption. Is that a fair statement of your position?",
  "Okay, but if -- if the so-called misbranding is determined to be misbranding, based upon information which was given to the FDA, as I understand your position, you would admit that there was pre-emption.",
  "Okay. So there - -",
  "In other words, there is that one exception at least to the broad statement that you gave in answer to Justice Scalia?",
  "But the -- but the misbranding is of no consequence to liability.",
  "In other words, I think you're saying if there -- if there would be pre-emption it may be misbranded, but there cannot be any recovery in a State tort suit.",
  "Okay. So misbranding under those circumstances is a purely theoretical concept.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, is your argument that they couldn't have considered these comparative risks, because if they had, they would have come out differently; because they didn't come out differently, we have to infer that they didn't consider it?",
  "No, I - -",
  "Apart from your analysis that they couldn't have or they would have come out differently, how did we know that they didn't consider it?",
  "And do these -- when you say \"communications,\" do you mean starting with the original application for approval of the label?",
  "So, you are saying all the correspondence that we do know about, that is extant, fails to mention comparative risk.",
  "Well, there may -- there may not be, but let me on that score, take you back to an answer that Mr. Olson gave. Assume for the moment, for the sake of the question, that we were to read this the way Justice Kennedy and Justice Breyer suggested, and that is to draw a distinction between the reference -- the now reference between recognition and jurisdiction and say that the now refers to jurisdiction and it refers to the time of passage. If that is the way we read it, should we remand this case to the circuit? Mr. Olson said no. There is no claim that, in fact, the tribe was, in fact, under jurisdiction at the time of passage. What is your answer?",
  "Well, tell us what you want us to do.",
  "In any case, you are not here to represent that, in fact, we may assume that there was no jurisdiction over the tribe at the time of the passage?",
  "Well, if it hasn't -- if it hasn't, then you're not in the position to make the representation that Mr. Olson -- I think Mr. Olson's answer suggested would be a correct one.",
  "I'm sorry. Are we in a position to -- to draw or accept that conclusion here? I mean, that -- that wasn't worked out. Shouldn't we remand and have that specifically addressed and specifically address the question of jurisdiction?",
  "Well, you were -- you were saying that the -- that a distinction simply had not been drawn at the BIA level, I guess, between jurisdiction and recognition. And I don't think -- I don't think we are in a position to say, yes, that's so or, no, that isn't so. So that would seem to me to argue for a remand in and of itself.",
  "Would you agree?",
  "No. Please.",
  "And don't -- don't you suffer from -- doesn't your position suffer from a -- a more serious problem that doesn't even implicate the pre-emption doctrine? And that is, as I understand your argument, the -- the local governments are creatures of the State. Their powers are the powers that the State gives them by statute, as -- as you were pointing out. The same thing is true for corporations. Corporations are creatures of the State. They have the powers, and only the powers, that the State gives to them. It -- it seems to me, going back to Justice Stevens's initial question, that I don't see where the distinction lies between the -- in effect, the position of the local-government units and corporations, and - - and between the local-government units and the corporations. And it seems to me that that's a problem for you quite apart from any application of Federal law.",
  "Well, it has distinct rights under the First Amendment if State law creates a corporate form of -- of -- of business organization. And the -- the -- when -- when it comes into existence, it then does acquire some rights under the national Constitution. But if in the first instance it's a creature of State law, its powers, generally speaking, are the powers that State law gives it. And that is - - that same proposition is true of counties and towns and -- and other sub-State governmental units.",
  "All right. Then -- then it seems to me that your argument is not that State law controls what it may do and defines its powers. Your argument, it seems to me, has to rest upon the fact that what it is doing is a public, as opposed to a private, function. And that's the extent of the argument. Isn't that true?",
  "That's the only distinction that you can maintain. You can't maintain the distinction based upon the superiority of State law in defining the -- the extent of the governmental unit's powers and so on, because that is just as true of a corporation. So your distinction has simply got to be a distinction based on the nature of the function that is being performed.",
  "What -- what do you mean by the \"nature of\" - -",
  "Yes, it's doing -- it's doing a governmental job.",
  "We understand what that is, so I understand that point.",
  "No. But -- it -- it is, but I mean when you say, as I think you are now saying, the -- the law for the State to be the law for the subdivision because they are both governmental, the counter-argument is, in fact, there are resemblances to private organizations, too. And those resemblances are, in effect, their creation and definition by State law; their enjoyment of the powers, and only those powers, which State law gives them; so that, in fact, there is -- there is not only an analogy with the State government, there is an analogy with private corporations, too. And the question is why should we choose one analogy rather than the other analogy?",
  "No, but another way of looking at it is to say in each of these instances - - whether we are talking about the State taxing in order to perform functions at the State level or whether the State is authorizing taxation for functions for functions to be performed at the local level -- in all of these instances, the State is in the position to say not that it is sort of our money, but to say it is public money. And our decision is that public money will not be used to -- by a public entity to underwrite political activity. And why isn't the State in exactly the same position in making that judgment, whether it's talking about money that goes directly into the State coffer or public tax money that happens to be going into a -- a town coffer?",
  "But I'm -- I'm asking you why shouldn't - -",
  "Why shouldn't we, on the theory that what is important is not which particular coffer the penny goes into, but the fact that it is public money, i.e., money being raised from taxpayers under a statute passed by the State authorizing taxation; and it is going to -- and its justification for taxation is the performance of public functions. And if the State can say it is not a proper public function when the money is being filtered through our particular treasury, why isn't it equally valid for the State legislature to say that when the money is being filtered through a local treasury?",
  "Yes, but what you're saying is, I -- you're saying in effect that I -- that you reject my -- my hypothetical assumption here, that what we ought to regard as the proper characterization of the money is not \"our\" State money, but public money raised under a system of public taxation; and you're saying you should not go -- you should not characterize the funds that way. Of course that's your position - -",
  "-- because if you do characterize the funds that way, it seems to me you're in trouble.",
  "But why shouldn't I characterize them that way?",
  "The State -- the State legislature is making a decision as to how it wants the -- the programs which comprise local government to be operated.",
  "Well, but the point in the case that you concede that the government may make that choice is that the government is subsidizing it by the activity which the government is refusing to perform. So it's not nearly a case of saying there shall be this kind of speech and not that kind of speech. In each instance there is a decision being made in my hypothetical that the government will not subsidize that kind of activity, that kind of speech, by using public money.",
  "That's only -- that's only true because apparently they use up all the feed that they get. If, in fact, they found a way to manufacture to enrich more efficiently so that some feed was left over, I presume you would not be here arguing that they could not sell that feed on the open market even after they had delivered the enriched uranium to the buyer?",
  "Yeah, but why are they providing something that is very valuable that, in fact, could not be obtained by the enricher on the open market if those were the contract terms? The enricher buys it in the -- in the -- I forget the acronym in the case that you just described -- and we don't know -- we have no reason to believe the enricher couldn't go out on the market and buy it if, in fact, the utility didn't supply the feed.",
  "Sure. They would rather manage the risk of price fluctuation than, in effect, pay the premium that the processor would have to charge in order to hedge against price fluctuation - -",
  "That's why they are doing that.",
  "That is a way of looking at it. But another way of looking at it is because they choose to, in effect, take the risk of price fluctuation as preferable to paying a higher ultimate price, they are simply, for that reason, choosing to pay both in cash and in a -- a valuable commodity, i.e., unenriched uranium. You can look at it either way.",
  "Yes, but doesn't -- doesn't the ability to discern it come from the reasons given for not assessing fines? They said: We are not assessing fines. This is something new, and this is in effect a warning to everybody that things have changed. Isn't that a pretty clear indication that they are adopting a new policy?",
  "Well, one thing has changed. One thing has changed, I think, from the record. And let me ask you whether if the Commission had given this explanation it would in your judgment satisfy the arbitrary and capricious standard? What if the Commission said, you know, our touchstone under prong 1 is community broadcast standards. And we have assumed over the years that people really didn't get too exercised by the usage we have permitted. But we are now getting all this mail from people who are very angry about it, and they find it extremely offensive. And therefore, I guess our prior community broadcast standards were wrong. We weren't taking into consideration the way people actually felt. Now we know how they felt, because of the mail we are getting and we are changing our policy for that reason. Leaving aside the Constitutional sufficiency of that, in the matter of arbitrary and capricious standards, would it satisfy it?",
  "Well, the raw APA standard issue is what we've got here.",
  "If that's - -",
  "If that's the case, then the concept of constitutional avoidance is -- is somehow out of this case and similar First Amendment cases, because we are always going to -- and I -- when you say you really cannot separate that precisely, we were always going to be getting into the constitutional issue, either expressly because we accept your view or covertly because we said, boy, we know what's around the corner. And so, if - -",
  "-- if we accept your argument, we have to change the constitutional avoidance doctrine.",
  "Thank you. Thank you.",
  "But that -- I mean you are just -- correct me if I am wrong, but your colloquy with Justice Stevens sort of is a way of phrasing the issue in the case. Because you are saying, I think, prior to this -- prior to the change, the Commission interpreted \"indecency\" in terms of indecent practice. And what the Commission is now doing is defining \"indecency\" in terms of the meaning of a word. It's -- it's relatively going from saying indecency is a practice, i.e., a repetition of certain kinds of words, to saying \"indecency\" is - - is the use of any word which is itself indecent.",
  "Well, why should that be, given the fact that the day it is going to run from is the day that -- which the State of Texas is willing to take action. And if Texas is willing to let the matter ride as long as it rode here, why shouldn't the one-year statute apply? In other words, I guess what I'm saying is the -- the decision about what is appropriate, that, in effect, would start this period running, is Texas's And as long as Texas is -- is satisfied with it, why does AEDPA have an independent concern?",
  "Yes, but that -- in effect, I think that begs the question, because if -- if Texas says: Okay, we are going to -- we are going to recognize a direct appeal starting -- or a direct-appeal right exercisable now, then (d)(1)(A) applies by its own terms exactly at the -- at the conclusion of the process which Texas has at this date chosen to allow. Texas doesn't have any gripe. It decided it ought to act, and -- and, undoubtedly, it should have. As long as the -- as long as the State is protected, why is there an independent interest in enforcing AEDPA, or enforcing the shortest possible rule under AEDPA?",
  "Yeah, but we are -- we are concerned about State interests, aren't we?",
  "Well, you have got a -- in a sense, you have got a patchwork now. I mean not - - not every State rule for the commencement of a direct appeal in the normal course is -- is identical. So we -- we start with a patchwork.",
  "But aren't they -- and I will -- you know, I will take the examples, but I mean, aren't they varied because the -- the circumstances of error which led to these late appeals vary, too? And isn't that exactly the way it ought to be?",
  "It was also the distinction about the use of the word \"voluntary,\" in which the operative language which barred those people didn't have \"voluntary\" in it, and I forget what it was, the next textual section it was there, so it was reason to infer that voluntary activity was not a criteria for the bar. Isn't that right?",
  "Serious bodily harm?",
  "No, the reasoning here, Mr. Katsas, it seems to me implicates exactly what Justice Breyer brings up. We had a colloquy earlier on -- on the extent of the reliance by the BIA for its general policy on Fedorenko, and what the does a see cite mean and so on. But in -- in this particular case, going to page 6a or 7a from which Mr. Pincus was -- was earlier quoting, if you look on page 7a, the reason that Fedorenko is thought to be appropriate here is, he - - that is to say, the Petitioner here -- has not demonstrated his conduct is distinguishable from that of the alien in that case. The conduct of the alien in that case was identified as relevant by the voluntary/involuntary distinction. It was so identified because of the text of the statute, voluntary was used in one place; it wasn't used in the place where the bar was set up. So that it seems to me that by the express reasoning in this case, this case is governed by a rule that in effect says the distinction between voluntary and involuntary action is not a relevant distinction. So I don't thin k you can get by in this case without confronting just what Justice Breyer says. And I don't see how you can answer his point in this case without admitting that Fedorenko in fact was -- was improvidently relied upon, because it's not good authority here.",
  "This is not really consistency with Fedorenko. This -- in this case the BIA is saying that he cannot say that his conduct in effect is different from the conduct in Fedorenko. And what was relevant about the Fedorenko conduct was it did not have to be voluntary conduct. So it is bringing -- it seems to me, the reasoning in this case is relying upon a rule that says that the voluntary/involuntary distinction is not significant.",
  "Which answers Justice Breyer's question.",
  "I doubt it, but go ahead.",
  "Right.",
  "But one thing that Congress has not done and it didn't do it in this Act, is to make the express voluntary/involuntary distinction textually that the DPA made in Fedorenko. And it seems to me that the reasoning set out in this case says this is exactly like the Fedorenko situation; that implies that the same rule in Fedorenko should apply. If the same rule applies, presumably it should be on the basis of a statute which is identical on the -- on the textual voluntariness point to the statute in Fedorenko. This one -- this one is not.",
  "Well, you don't have the voluntary/involuntary distinction here in -- or -- in textual treatment that you had in -- in the DPA statute in Fedorenko, do you?",
  "You don't -- you don't follow that with the section that uses the word \"voluntary,\" whereas the bar does not use the word \"voluntary,\" right?",
  "Can you - -",
  "Can you give me a couple of examples of the voluntariness that creates in effect the same distinction here as under the DPA?",
  "Was that passed as part of the same legislation that created the bar section we are dealing with?",
  "But it's -- I don't want to split hairs here, but I mean the voluntary return behavior is a behavior of the alien in this country with respect to, in effect, an election under existing federal law; whereas, the voluntary/involuntary distinction in the DPA was a distinction that referred to the alien's conduct overseas at the relevant time.",
  "You have convinced me there are contrasts, but I am not sure that they are contrasts that raise the implication in a clear way as it was raised in the DPA. And I think that's my only disagreement with you at this point.",
  "But you do know that Aristotle was not construing this Federal statute, don't you?",
  "Let's assume that's - - that's what they did mean. I have to say I read it as broadly as Justice Scalia did, but let's -- let's narrow down the -- the Court's opinion to -- to -- to the claim that you are making right now. Let me go back to the Chief Justice's hypothetical and add one minor detail. Let's assume that in a given department they put into effect exactly the policy that you want. They have a fine system of -- of data collection, far more sophisticated than three by five cards, and the -- the boss D.A. says everybody in this office ought to know what kind of deals are being made and offered at all times. And they have such a system. And the boss D.A. also says and don't you disclose one word of it ever in any case. We are going to defy Giglio. If he made that or gave that order so that in every case there would be a defiance of Giglio, even though the facts were known, would he have absolute immunity?",
  "That's right.",
  "Well, you know if in a given case, if they had this system, and the lawyer comes to him and says, okay, I've consulted our system and I realize we that have got a Giglio obligation. And the boss D.A. says: Forget it. Don't tell him a word. There would be absolute immunity, wouldn't there?",
  "Okay.",
  "Why would the -- why would the answer be any different if he says don't bother me with particular cases? I am telling you right now what the answer is going to be in every case in which we have a Giglio obligation and that is, bury it. Presumably there would be absolute immunity, wouldn't there?",
  "What's your answer?",
  "The trouble is if you don't have an answer to that hypothetical, then we got to leave open the possibilities as far as your case is concerned that he would have absolute immunity in that case. And if he would have absolute immunity in that case, then the -- the -- the reason for allowing anything less than absolute immunity with respect to this data collection obligation reduces down to something like an almost a silly point.",
  "If you can get everything you want, and all the prosecutor has got to say is: Keep it under your hat and there is going to be absolute immunity and nobody gets anything. What is -- what is to be gained by that?",
  "But if the backroom function is reduced to an absolute nullity by an immunized decision to -- to bury the Giglio information in every case, then I don't see the point of saying there's no immunity for the supposed backroom function, because nothing will be accomplished even if there is no absolute immunity.",
  "When you say burglary, if you're at home, if you're at home it's going to get violent and aggressive.",
  "What's that got to do with increasing the risk of violence? I mean, I see -- I see your kind of elements argument, but it seems to be beside the point that - -",
  "Yes, but the crime is still -- the crime that we are concerned with here is still essentially a passive crime. He just doesn't show up.",
  "And given, you know, the close logical connections, I don't see that the close logical connections convert the passive crime into a higher degree of resisting arrest from any other. In fact, it suggests just the opposite.",
  "Well, you know, you may precisely be doing nothing. If I say, you know, it's Monday morning at 9 o'clock, I'm supposed to -- to report to prison, and I'm going to stay home, my purpose is to stay put in my armchair. That's purposeful conduct and it's about as passive as you can get.",
  "But your argument goes simply to whether there is potential and the statute says \"serious potential.\" Which gets us, it seems to me, to the point that Justice Kennedy is making, and that is, we've got to have something more than an instinctive belief that something bad might happen.",
  "They were taking as examples cases in which there was serious potential. But in any event, you can't lose sight of the modifier. It has got to be more than a so-called \"potential risk.\"",
  "May I -- may I -- may I ask you just to get some sense about what will qualify? I mean, I think we -- we all agree that the risk of violence in arrest is probably going to vary depending on -- categorically depending on the crimes. I think I would probably agree that white-collar crimes are not likely to -- to carry a very high risk of violence on arrest. So I -- there's one category. Can you think of others, other categories outside of white-collar crime, that are going to have a lower risk of arrest than, say, the failure-to-report category?",
  "They are going to be in category one.",
  "Yes.",
  "What is your answer to Mr. Fisher's argument that if that proposition of yours is -- is -- is, in fact, sound in response to this case, the State can put in its entire case by -- in a circumstantial evidence case, by way of affidavit and, in effect, satisfy the Confrontation Clause by saying, well, you can call the witness as part of the defense case and cross-examine there?",
  "Well, then that's what you have got to explain to me. Why is it an exception?",
  "Well, what about the -- the blue car going down the street statement? In a circumstantial evidence case the witness comes in and says yes, I saw a blue car go down the street at 10 o'clock. Is that testimonial?",
  "And the distinction between that and the lab report saying the substance that was shown to me which I analyzed was cocaine, what's the - - what's the distinction?",
  "Well, why - -",
  "Why does that make a difference? In other words, the -- Justice Scalia said a moment ago, you know, the -- the statement about the blue car is -- is tied in in the hypothetical case by another witness who said yes, at -- at 10:01 when I heard the gun go off there was a blue car there. In this case the cocaine is tied in by saying, yes, the cocaine which I delivered to X, about which he has testified, is cocaine that I took out of the pocket of the defendant. There is -- there is a temporal and physical path worked out in both cases. And it seems to me your attempt to distinguish them is to say well, the temporal path can be extended by one more step in the cocaine case because you can take the cocaine or take something from the cocaine sample and let the defense expert testify to it; which of course is true, but I don't see what that has got to do with the Confrontation Clause or the definition of testimonial evidence.",
  "But aren't you really saying that the confrontation right is therefore not so important because you have a greater opportunity in the cocaine case of coming up with -- with rebutting evidence, if indeed rebutting evidence can be found. In other words, if -- if -- if the State's witness is wrong, you've got a better shot at proving him wrong than in the blue car case. But if that is your argument, I don't see what it's got to do with - - with the basic confrontation right.",
  "Well, have we ever had - - have we ever had a -- a kind of lab report, public record kind of case in -- in which the record was prepared expressly for trial?",
  "Yes, but Justice Harlan did not take the majority view. I mean you -- I don't know where you get authority for the proposition that the public record prepared for the purpose of litigation would have come in under the, in effect, the founding era -- or would have been outside the founding era definition of testimonial.",
  "No, but you say that, it seems to me, because you are -- and I think consistently -- making a distinction between credibility issues and reliability issues. And I think you are implicitly saying the Confrontation Clause is there to test credibility but not reliability.",
  "The machine is reliable; therefore, it's outside of confrontation. And I don't understand the validity of this distinction that is implicit in your answers.",
  "Well, accuracy - -",
  "-- is an aspect of it.",
  "Do you see any reason - -",
  "Do you see any reason why a notice-and-demand statute wouldn't satisfy your concern?",
  "A bland notice-and-demand statute - -",
  "These other records, no, you haven't found them.",
  "Why don't you insist, even in that case, on the confrontation right to examine the person who actually conducted the test itself and generated the papers that the later expert testifies on in order to determine the admissibility of the -- of the -- the test results themselves?",
  "Okay. All I wanted to know was whether you were giving that away or not.",
  "Let me ask you this. There are -- there are -- there are three possibility subjects: Chain of custody, conduct of test, significance or meaning of the squiggles. As I understand it, you have said if the chain of custody is established and if the squiggles are admitted in evidence, an expert who did not do the test can testify about the significance of the squiggles. But that leaves the question of the -- the evidence about the conduct of the test itself. And I understood you to say to me that you were not conceding that you did not have a -- a confrontation right to examine the person who did the test itself in order to determine admissibility.",
  "Okay.",
  "But he did say that he agreed to the change.",
  "What do you mean by that? What specifically did they - -",
  "Mr. Bress, may I ask you a question - -",
  "May I ask you a question which sort of goes to the utility of raising that issue here, and it's a preliminary, not a doctrinal question. But - -",
  "-- my understanding is that in the United States District Court on the Federal habe -- the district court made a -- drew a conclusion based on the evidence before it, no deference to the State court, that in fact your client did not demonstrate prejudice. And my understanding is that that - - although the Fourth Circuit did not rely upon that, my understanding is that that -- that finding remains undisturbed. Is that correct?",
  "No.",
  "Oh, that may be. I didn't mean to imply you didn't have a Fourth Circuit question. I -- I guess I was raising a question to whether it is wise to make this the case to decide the Fourth Circuit issue.",
  "May I just ask one quick question? The -- the answer, I take it, on -- based on what you just said, the answer to the -- the need - to-exhaust point is you don't have to exhaust because you already tried to exhaust in the State court, and they didn't give you enough time to get your evidence in. That is - -",
  "Did he make any request from the State court for more time?",
  "Your brother is nodding yes.",
  "If we had -- if we had - - and I -- I emphasize I'm -- I'm not suggesting this is your case. But if we had a case in which with respect to the disputed issue he had asked for more time -- I'll make it easy. He had asked for more time and -- and had -- had indicated that there were leads that needed to be followed that couldn't be followed unless he got more time and so on, and the State court refused. Could he then come into the Federal court and say: My claim here is not only ineffective assistance, but ineffective assistance with the overlay of the refusal of the State courts to give me an adequate opportunity to develop my -- my ineffective assistance claim? And if he made a colorable showing on those two issues, would he then have an opportunity for a Federal evidentiary issue, and would the findings that eventuated from that be subject to -- in effect, to -- to being short- circuited by deference to the State court findings?",
  "But if you don't -- I guess what I'm getting at is if we don't in that circumstance recognize that there is a legitimately different claim which is not, for the reason I suggested to Mr. Bress, not subject to further exhaustion requirements because they tried and the State court wouldn't let them do it -- if we don't in that case recognize that there is a claim that can be litigated in the Federal court, which will not be subject to deference to State court findings, then there is a very clear hole in the law, and I assume Congress didn't mean to leave it. I understand you're saying that is not this case. But isn't that a legitimate problem to-- to face at some point.",
  "I think you're right in the main. I think that's generally correct. The case that I'm concerned with is the case of the -- of the Brady claim, because if we are proceeding under (e) then as I understand the cause and prejudice can only be established in the case we are talking about if there can be shown a probability of a different verdict. The Brady standard, however, does not require the probability of a different verdict. Brady uses the term \"reasonable probability that there would have been a different result,\" but that has been clearly defined in the cases to mean reasonable possibility. So that in fact with respect to Brady claims subsection (e) is imposing a higher requirement than Brady did and a higher requirement than would have been applied before Brady. And that is the case, it seems to me, that we - - it may not be this case, but that's the case that we've got to be concerned about in coming up with doctrine here. Isn't that a legitimate concern?",
  "But I don't, I don't think this Court understood the implication of it when you get into the Brady issue. And my only concern is we've got to leave that door open because I don't think Williams confronted that.",
  "I understand your position.",
  "Now -- but the road map that you are now saying could be followed is the same road map implied by -- in your earlier answer to Justice Scalia, your reference to the new claim as being a defaulted claim.",
  "But we are concerned -- I think we are all concerned with the -- with the claim in which it is not defaulted, in the sense that he is at fault in any way for failing to get it into the Federal court -- I'm sorry -- get his entire presentation now into the State court then. So that it is not a defaulted claim in the classic sense. It is not a claim in which he is at fault by having failed to present it in the State court. And in that case, if it cannot go back, if the State court will not take it back, don't we have to find at least implicit in the totality of subsections (d) and (e) the possibility of litigating the -- the fully developed claim in the Federal court without a need to defer to the State court findings?",
  "Well, he -- I agree with you on the -- on the cause part; but the -- up to this point. He has got to demonstrate cause and prejudice or at least he has got to develop cause. Let me put it - - ask you this question. If he simply says look, I tried to get this in to the State court, and he shows that, but the State court for whatever reason just would not take the evidence that he wanted to put in, is that enough for him to have - -",
  "I'm -- I'm not asking to you stipulate - -",
  "-- that it's this case. But it's the case we are worried about around the corner.",
  "If that is -- this Court - - that's why I'm saying it's a very established law as to what cause is, and external impediments. I mean, this Court has many cases that describe that. The lower courts are very familiar with determining that, and so they can -- they are capable to making that determination as to whether the Federal court can now look at a new matter whether it's a new claim or - -",
  "But all we are -- I think all we are really getting at is that there are different kinds of new matters. There are some new matters of which he absolutely knew nothing at the State court stage, and he is now saying don't hold that against me: i.e., I'm showing cause and I'll show prejudice. This is new matter that he did or potentially know about and tried to get into, and under our hypothesis, the State court says no, I'm not going to hear it, or I won't give you the time, whatever the case may be. In that case, isn't it -- don't we have to say under the statute all he has got to show is cause in the sense that he tried and the State court wouldn't let him? In order to - -",
  "Okay.",
  "It's a materiality standard, really.",
  "Mr. Sekulow, can I just ask: At what point in the litigation did you first raise the Government speech argument?",
  "Isn't the tough -- isn't the tough issue here not so much whether there is Government speech. I will assume and I do indeed assume that there is. Isn't the tough issue here the claim that there is -- is in fact a mixture, that it is both Government and private. And the argument for its continuing to be private speech I take it is simply the Eagles identification with the presentation and their espousal of what the monument says. How -- how do you think we ought to deal with the mixture issue.",
  "They probably are, but most of them -- and you correct me if I'm wrong here. But I don't suppose that most of them -- most of them contain as part of -- in a prominent place in the monument itself contain the statement that, you know, this is the gift of or the position of or what-not of X, Y or Z, whereas this monument does.",
  "We may have more cases coming.",
  "But tell me, what is the criterion that we should use to decide what the significance of the private identification is?",
  "Well, if it does, it changes it, as I understand your answer, by eliminating the private aspect of the speech. So that your real answer to me is it's not a mixture.",
  "And there ceases to be a mixture the moment the Government accepts it.",
  "So the city, in effect, if the city says, we are going to have a designated ten-acre field in which anybody can put up a monument, but you can't because we don't like your message, there's a First Amendment problem. But if the city hides the ball in effect and says in effect, we'll - - we'll let monuments be placed on -- we will accept monuments from people who want to place them on our property if the monuments have some kind of an arguable historical connection or a connection with people with long association with the community, as long as they have that sort of criterion in mind then they can select any way they want to?",
  "Nothing could be a more obvious control of the message than the criterion that says we will decide in -- in determining to accept it or not, we will decide on the basis of whether we agree with the message. That is control with a vengeance.",
  "Well, they -- they do in the example Justice Kennedy just raised and the example that I just raised. The Eagles come along say: Here's the monument; take it; it's all yours.",
  "And the -- the Government says: Okay, we'll take the Eagles monument. We will not on identical terms take the Summum monument because we disagree with the message. At the point they make the decision they don't own anything. What they are doing is controlling, in your words, and they are controlling on the basis of agreement with the message. Why isn't that a First Amendment violation?",
  "But we've got -- we've got to shut our eyes to the period prior to the moment title passes.",
  "Does that mean if we engage in viewpoint discrimination for three decades, we are home free?",
  "It wouldn't be a speaker on your view until it takes control of the monument.",
  "But those are cases in which, to begin with, the Government is engaging in -- a process of, in effect, sponsoring speech. And here we -- we have not, I think, reached the point in which the public park is to be analogized either with a publication or a magazine or -- or grants to -- to the arts.",
  "What's the answer to Justice Alito's question?",
  "It would be -- the trouble - -",
  "I see your point, but the trouble with that as an argument here is the private part of the speech is just as much chiseled in stone as the public part. So it's not going to go away at the end of the day, and there isn't any way that the Government in effect can engage in the gesture of saying all private speech is treated the same way, whatever way that might be. So we've got a -- we've got a -- we've got a more difficult problem here.",
  "What you are, in effect, saying -- and this may be -- I don't mean I think this is necessarily the wrong answer -- but you're, in effect, saying, yes, you can find instances of Government speech in which there is clearly a -- a private identification consistent with it, but the only appropriate analysis is the analysis for government speech. You can't have it both ways, you've got to pick one or the other; and it is -- it is the Government aspect which controls the First Amendment purposes. That, I take it, is your answer?",
  "There is nothing unusual about it, but we haven't had this kind of a challenge before. So, I -- I guess it still rests on you to say why should we submerge the private part to the Government part. There may be a very good reason, but I want to know what your reason is.",
  "How do they do that? What is the -- you mentioned that frequently in your brief, and I'm not sure what formality you have in mind when you say adopt.",
  "So this case -- your claim would disappear if this town in Utah had passed an ordinance saying we adopt the Ten Commandments Monument?",
  "But that's -- I mean, if that's all that's involved here, we're engaging in kind of a -- almost a silly exercise in formality.",
  "If we tell them you have got to take the monument down if they don't do it, don't you think they are going to pass that pretty quick?",
  "If that -- it that is so, what is the point of using the public forum analysis at all?",
  "That -- that may mean that you have the foundation for a -- a speech discrimination argument - -",
  "-- but that would not be the answer if we were dealing with a -- a traditional public forum in -- in the sense that the Court's cases have used the term.",
  "So it seems to me that your use of public forum is just by kind of remote analogy here, and I -- I'm not sure that it's helping you or would help us if we used it as criterion for decision.",
  "No, but it doesn't -- it doesn't have to do that, say, for time place and manner restrictions for access to a public forum if it really is a public forum. There is something more involved here. This is closer to the case of the individual who says sure, put the McCain sign on -- on my lawn. No one is going to doubt that the person whose house is there is in favor of McCain; and -- and it seems to me we are in the same situation with the monument in the city.",
  "Sure, but when you get the monument - -",
  "We do not -- there is no pervasive understanding or non-pervasive one, I would have thought, in the United States that anyone who wants to display a message in granite in a public park can put it there. No one assumes that. Everyone assumes that, if the granite monument is there, the city or whatever has said, yes, we approve it, put it there.",
  "It may create the First Amendment problem, but it seems to me, going back to Justice Alito's question, that the City's decision is a clear adoption of the monument.",
  "Yes, but even on your own criterion, if the city passes a resolution saying we adopt this, you're still -- you're going to be faced with precisely the content discrimination problem that you're arguing about here.",
  "You're basically just arguing for a clear statement rule. I mean, Justice Alito's question, my analogies are suggestive of the fact that there is an affirmative Government act of some indication of approval when it says, yes, you can put the monument here. And what you're arguing for is, well, we want a clearer statement, we want it to say, yes, we really adopt it, it's ours from the heart. And that seems to be the difference between your position and the -- and the position that acceptance of the monument is enough.",
  "Well, you can - -",
  "You can make that distinction. There's no -- I understand the distinction you're making, but because I don't see that that's a distinction that a reasonable member of the public would understand to be implied by the -- or at least to be - - to be raised by the placement of the monument, I don't know why it's a distinction that should be significant for First Amendment purposes.",
  "You want a signing statement as well as a signature?",
  "But it's not disclaiming it here. The Government isn't disclaiming it. And the difference it seems to me between you and your friends on the other side is you want this clear statement. You want a statement -- for example if you took Justice Scalia's statement, that would satisfy you, and it would also be the poison pill in the Establishment Clause. Isn't that what's -- I mean, that's okay with me. I don't see that as an illegitimate object. I was a Van Orden dissenter -- I mean, but isn't that what is driving this?",
  "Mr. Salvatore, you take the position that the only thing that is at stake here is simply, in effect, a selection of the arbitral forum. What do you -- what do you say to the argument that, in fact, the -- under -- under the collective bargaining agreement the employee is subject not merely to the right of the union to choose the arbitral forum, but, in fact, to -- to assert any claim at all? What -- what is your answer to that?",
  "Well, there is at least some. The collective bargaining agreement is in here. And if we are deciding anything at all, we are going to decide whether in this case the -- the Second Circuit was correct. The question is posed in generalities, but we are not going to decide the general question in total ignorance of this case. And in this case we've got the particular collective bargaining agreement in front of us, and you started to answer the question that -- that I and Justice Ginsburg posed by referring to the \"no discrimination\" clause.",
  "And will -- will you go on to that?",
  "Where did we get this phrase -- where do we get the language \"or the union will turn over to them\"? The only thing that I can see in here that addresses that is on page 46a. And the - - the clause there reads: \"All union claims are brought by the union alone, and no individual shall have the right to compromise or settle any claim without the written permission of the union.\" There is -- there is a lot of gray area in that, but the one thing that seems clear is that the union has total control over any claim, including an arbitration claim. And that seems to lend some substance to the -- to the point made by the other side that if we accept your position here, we are accepting a position not nearly as far -- that the designation -- a procedural designation of a forum should be enforced but that, in fact, total control over the assertion of a statutory Federal right is also being ceded. Now, why doesn't that language from section 46 support that?",
  "Well, then, \"all such claims\" -- \"such claims\" refers among other things to the statutory right.",
  "And if the statutory right is the appropriate section of an arbitration agreement and the union has ultimate control of the arbitration agreement, then it follows that the union has got ultimate control over the assertion of the statutory right.",
  "Where -- where is the guarantee that the -- if the union says, we don't want to touch this, as in this case, that the employee has the right either to arbitrate or, for that matter, to sue? Where do you find that?",
  "Even in a case in which you don't have -- assume -- just assume for the sake of argument that we don't have the discrimination issue or the conflict issue. I understood you elsewhere to be arguing that there had to be the kind of knowing, intelligent and individual waiver, which I would suppose a collective bargaining agreement will never include. So I thought it was the -- ultimately the implication of your argument that in any -- in any case in which arbitration is claimed, there would have to be -- or a right to go to arbitration is claimed by the employer - - there would have to be, not merely the collective bargaining agreement, but a specific waiver by the employee to -- to go ahead and do that. Is that right?",
  "Right.",
  "Go ahead.",
  "But the one thing that's uniform throughout in your answer is that the collective bargaining agreement alone can never subject the employee to -- to mandatory arbitration?",
  "Well, but those -- I'm sorry. Those examples are examples. You're getting down to individual cases. I thought you drew the global line in answer -- which would answer Justice Breyer's question by saying the -- in the cases that we're talking about here, Congress has passed a statute giving a specific individual right and that individual right cannot in effect be compromised except in -- except in violation of that statute, and that's where we draw the global line so that when you got to torts, you'd look at the individual situation rather than draw a categorical line.",
  "I agree with you, but I think -- I don't want to put words in Justice Breyer's mouth - -",
  "But I thought what he was getting at is, if I hold for you here, am I going to have to hold for you in every case in which somebody has in effect a tort claim which is subject to an arbitration clause?",
  "But doesn't it boil down - - doesn't your argument really boil down to this: That the only case in which it's really going to matter is the case in which the arbitration agreement contains a clause that gives the union plenary authority over the disposition of the claim? And I say that for this reason. If -- if this is outside the subject of mandatory bargaining, then the employer can impose it; in effect, as a matter of individual contract. If it's within the subject of mandatory bargaining but it's not effective unless the employee also signs at the time of the incident or at the time he is hired an individual waiver, then, in fact, the only case in which it's going to make any difference as to whether you win or he wins is the case in which the agreement has got a clause in there that gives the union plenary authority to dispose of the claim. Isn't that correct?",
  "Is that written down somewhere?",
  "I mean, they didn't turn it over, did they, until the action had been brought in the Federal court? I mean, they didn't -- maybe I'm wrong in this, but I didn't think that on day one they -- they said, oh, well, because the union doesn't want to proceed with this, you're welcome to chug ahead by yourself.",
  "Well, what if they hadn't -- what if the parties hadn't resolved it?",
  "Yes. How would the -- how would the Special -- what would be the authority of this Court to make an order that the Special Master be paid X dollars?",
  "Okay. We just, we just regressed one step. Where does the authority come from?",
  "Yes.",
  "So that the authority to compensate is inherent?",
  "Are you making -- would you make an inherent authority argument here?",
  "Regardless of original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction, would you say that this Court simply has the inherent authority to, to in effect to decree these sorts of claims.",
  "Do you -- may I ask you a statutory question just about the application of the statute. As -- as you have pointed out, if the $40 applies it's because I -- it is, in effect, a determination of a particular item under section 1920: Judge and clerk of any court of the United States may tax its cost. My question is this. One of the items covered by 1920, one of the items that a judge or clerk may tax, is fees of the clerk. Under section 1911, which relates entirely to the Supreme Court, there is a provision that the Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its clerk. That is totally redundant if 1920 covers the Supreme Court of the United States. Doesn't it follow, therefore, that section 1920 was -- despite its reference to any court of the United States, doesn't it follow that that statute was not intended to apply to the Supreme Court; and doesn't it follow from that that either the Supreme Court's authority is to fix the fees if this is a fee to be charged by the clerk or, in the alternative, that there is no statute on it at all? But the main point is unless 1911 is totally redundant in -- in referring to fixing the fees to be charged by its clerk, then 1920 must not cover the Supreme Court.",
  "I'm greatly flattered.",
  "You're not the first to have done that.",
  "Oh, we didn't -- no question about that. I recognize 1920 goes a lot further. But there is no -- there is no need in 1911 to say to that the Supreme Court may -- may fix the fees to be charged by its clerk if the Supreme Court is already covered by 1920.",
  "In other words, if it's redundancy it proves too much is what you're saying?",
  "Okay.",
  "May I just get clear on your view of inherent power? As I understand it, you're -- when you answered it, in a situation in which the slate is completely clean, we would have inherent power, you're using \"inherent power\" in effect to be a kind of default power. If Congress hasn't acted, somebody has got to do something. That's got to be us, so -- so we would have the authority. But you are not using the term \"inherent power\" in the sense of being a power which is sort of essential and indefeasible by Congress in any respect. Is that correct?",
  "Do you think there is - - there is any inherent power in, let's say, this Court - - just keep to it simple -- that Congress in effect could not eliminate? For example, if Congress passed a statute saying the Supreme Court of the United States shall not have authority to punish direct contempt, would that statute be constitutional in your view?",
  "Isn't that a pretty slippery slope then that you're on? Because if in fact parties are going to be reluctant to -- to hire the kind of experts that are necessary, unless they think that at the end of the day there is going to be some kind of an equitable disposition of the expense, at that point that starts interfering with the conduct of the kind of business that the Court ought to be engaged in.",
  "But that would be a matter of due process, not a matter of inherent power, I take it.",
  "May I ask you to follow up on that, because your statement about compatibility raises what for me is a fundamental difficulty in understanding this case. And I think my difficulty goes both to Chevron step one and step two. And that is this: I think we all start from the premise that, whatever else subsection (d) had in mind, it was imposing some kind of a technology-driven standard criterion. It's there in the words. The difficulty that I have is if you are going to apply on at least a site-specific basis a cost benefit analysis, I'm not sure how it would work. In other words, it seems to me that when you're talking about the possible harm from pulling in a few fish or a few plankton or a few baby clam larvae and so on, as against the cost conceivably of millions of dollars for extending intake pipes or putting technical expensive filtering mechanisms, you are dealing with such incommensurables that I don't know how on a site - specific basis you would sensibly apply a cost-benefit analysis. Are a thousand plankton worth a million dollars? I don't know. And my difficulty then is, I don't know how it would work. And because I don't know how it would work, it seems to me that if you are going to apply a cost-benefit analysis, the odds are what you are going to do is basically eliminate the whole technology-driven point of the statute. So that's my difficulty. Can you help me out on that?",
  "Do we know so far as intake pipes are concerned? I mean, maybe I'm being foolish in thinking it's a little easy to make sense of it when we're talking about toxic discharges, but leaving that aside, do we know that, with respect to these kind of intake technology decisions, that the cost-benefit analysis has been in any way sensible? In other words, maybe what Congress had in mind was this just doesn't work doing it on a site-specific cost-benefit analysis and that's why we're going to pass subsection (b) in the first place. So you say, well, we've had experience with cost-benefit analysis. What's the experience?",
  "Yes.",
  "And have these been applications of something more than the outside standard, which I guess everybody agrees would apply in a case like this, that when it just becomes wholly or outrageously disproportionate there wouldn't be -- that there would in that sense be a cost-benefit cutoff? These have been more subtle decisions than that?",
  "Isn't it easier to quantity that than the value of a plankton?",
  "It is -- let me -- I will grant you that agencies purport to do this kind of thing. But my question and I think Justice Ginsburg's question is, does it make any sense in these circumstances to think that you really can do a cost - benefit analysis? And if the answer is no, we have been purporting to do it but it really doesn't make a lot of sense, then it either means that there is just going to be an irrational process going on, or it means that the technology-driven standard basically is going to be read right out of the statute, because you are always going to find some disproportion which is going to limit your use of technology.",
  "Then why didn't they use the word \"cost\"?",
  "I mean, your -- your argument is they used cost here, they used cost there, they didn't use cost here but they must have meant cost.",
  "And maybe the inference to be drawn is the agency is not supposed to be taking any of these considerations into account.",
  "You've got the -- I mean everybody agrees that there is kind of an ultimate irrationality standard here. So that's -- that's not - - that -- that kind of a horrible is not really the point.",
  "Availability -- if availability includes economic availability, why doesn't \"best\" include economically best?",
  "But our problem is that we -- you've got a clear distinction in mind, and I -- I don't think we are getting the distinction. Is the distinction in crude terms this: they can consider costs in the sense that on an industry-wide basis they can ask, is there money in the bank or will there be money in the bank to pay for this? They don't ask cost-benefit in the sense of asking: is the money in the bank worth what they are going to get for it? So is -- is the line you are drawing a money in the bank line? Is that the point you are making?",
  "But if the only question, when you say they can consider costs, are you saying they are simply asking whether it is economically possible for the industry to afford this, regardless of whether it's any good or not?",
  "Is that what - -",
  "But is the variance a matter of statutory right or -- or is it available under a regulation?",
  "Why -- why isn't that simply another name for cost-benefit analysis?",
  "Well, you are doing it on cost-benefit. You are saying - -",
  "-- if we require this and the company goes bankrupt, the value of demanding it is not satisfied by the result.",
  "Well, is the reason they don't do cost-benefit analysis well because they are forced to do it in a political atmosphere in which it is difficult to make rational decisions? Is that basically the reason Congress would have come to that conclusion?",
  "Is that - -",
  "But I think -- I see your point, but I think if I accept your point, all I am doing is saying, they may in a kind of smoke and mirrors way take cost-benefit analysis into consideration sub rosa, when they decide what availability is going to mean; and they make take it into consideration when they decide what a -- a -- an undesirable environmental impact is; and that sort of gets the -- the weighing process out of the public focus. And if they do it that way, they -- they can bring in just the considerations that Justice Breyer is talking about, but they don't do it in an obvious way. And I think that's what your argument boils down to.",
  "What costs are relevant to that?",
  "When they made that decision, are they not in effect anticipating the kind of decision they would make on a more specific basis in a more highly charged political atmosphere, if they engaged in the cost-benefit analysis that you say they can't do?",
  "Ms. Underwood, if that's going to be the criterion, that they exclude a State cause of action as readily as they exclude a Federal cause of action, then isn't the State always going to win every case in which there is an issue like this one? Because unless the State is so blatantly discriminatory or so blatantly inadvertent as to leave a cause of action of its own making on the books, when it says, \"We won't hear the Federal one,\" what you posit is always going to be the case. And if that's -- if the rule is that as long as there is no State action comparable to the Federal action that is disallowed, the State wins, in practical terms the State always wins.",
  "It's not really that they are not the Supreme Court, but the -- the damages are limited, aren't they, because in the court of claims, as I understand it or under the statute, there can't be any punitive damages? Whereas if it were a straight 1983 action in the State supreme court, punitive damages would -- would be a possibility.",
  "They could be brought into the state supreme court - -",
  "-- which is a -- which is one of your jurisdictional problems because the - - the -- in effect, New York is saying the most -- the most egregious class of cases, the cases in which the correctional officers are not only doing some actionable but something outside the scope of their duty, well, we will hear them, they are fine. And we will provide punitive damages for them.",
  "Which -- which makes it a little tough to say that in the less egregious cases there is a -- that the -- that the exclusion of the less egregious cases is a jurisdictional exclusion as distinct from an exclusion based upon policy about how less egregious cases ought to be handled.",
  "No, but aren't you simply saying, look, we go around calling it jurisdictional. And -- and my point was, that isn't it difficult, isn't it, in fact, inappropriate to call it jurisdictional when you have a class of the most egregious cases under 1983 which the State supreme courts hear, and there is, nonetheless, a second class of cases, also 1983 -- they simply happen to be less egregious -- that they don't hear? Isn't it difficult, using jurisdictional in the normal sense of the term, to say that is a jurisdictional distinction?",
  "What if the New York legislature passed a statute saying the -- the State court supreme court will not have jurisdiction over 1983 actions for -- for harm committed on Wednesday, would you say that that was a jurisdictional rule?",
  "I will answer the question for you, if you want.",
  "You wouldn't have.",
  "Would you say it was jurisdictional so long as the Supreme Court said -- or so long as the State legislature said, no State or Federal actions for -- for -- for Wednesday damages? Would you call that jurisdictional?",
  "You might call it crazy outside of court, but the one thing you wouldn't do is walk in a court and say it's jurisdictional. And the -- my -- the point I am getting at is, the finer the comb that -- that -- that keeps the certain class of case out, the less plausible it is to say that this is a jurisdictional kind of criterion sense of it?",
  "It's not really that they are in the Supreme Court, but the -- the damages are limited, aren't they? Because in the Court of Claims, as I understand it, or under the statute, there can't be any punitive damages; whereas, if it were a straight 1983 action in the State supreme court, punitive damages would -- would be a possibility.",

Isn't it difficult, using \"jurisdictional\" in the normal sense of the term, to say that is a jurisdictional distinction?",
  "When has the New York legislature passed a statute saying that the -- the new -- the State supreme court will not have jurisdiction over 1983 actions for -- for harm committed on Wednesday? Would you say that that was a jurisdictional rule?",

  "And that's what I -- that's why I keep getting at the point that when -- when you lay in some 1983 actions, the worst ones, the ones with the highest potential damages, but you say, well, the - - the less awful ones, the ones that may be within scope of employment, they can't come in, it seems to me that the -- that the teeth on the comb are getting rather fine. And in terms of our normal usage in -- in applying this criterion, it -- it is not plausibly jurisdictional.",
  "But it seems to me the problem with the argument is that to say it is inconsistent with the opinion we implicitly have to say that the Oregon Supreme Court has to confront State law issues in a certain sequence, and that if it does not do so those issues are waived, as it were, not only by the court but by the party who raised it. And the difficulty, I think, with your position here is that on the assumption, which I do make, that the -- that the issue, \"correct in all respect\" issue, was properly raised by the other side, if we accept your position, we in effect are saying the other side is not going to have an opportunity to argue that before the Oregon Supreme Court. And that's, it seems to me, kind of a steep hill for you to climb.",
  "I know you are saying that but why -- why does the disposition that you are asking for not entail what I just said, and that is, in effect you cut off the claim by a party raised before the Oregon Supreme Court, not considered by the Oregon Supreme Court, and you cut off that claim simply because the Oregon Supreme Court chose to approach the issues in the case in a certain sequence? What business do we have to do that?",
  "I know the language that you are referring to.",
  "But the referring to that language simply skips over the issue that I am trying to raise. Isn't there a problem that we should be concerned with if we accept your position in cutting off the claim made by one party to the case which was never heard by the Oregon Supreme Court?",
  "Isn't the place to make that argument in the Oregon Supreme Court?",
  "Wouldn't it have been appropriate to -- to hear the -- the issue that they are raising and for you to make the reply that you have just made?",
  "I realize it's a Federal law question and in approaching that question, I keep asking the question which I think I have now put to you three times and have yet to hear an answer on the merits on: Why is it appropriate for us to have a rule here that cuts off the right of a party that properly raised an issue in the Oregon Supreme Court and has yet to be heard on the merits in the Oregon Supreme Court?",
  "Maybe -- maybe this Court insufficiently appreciated the significance of the issue which is now before us. And I still want to know, is there a good reason on the merits why it is fair for us to cut off the right of the other side to raise an issue that they raise or to argue an issue that they raised in a timely fashion?",
  "Didn't she also say that she was going to give, and ultimately did give an instruction, to the effect that punitive damages are punitive, they are not for the compensation of this person or any other person, and to -- she then turned to Philip Morris's counsel and said: What about that? And Philip Morris's counsel said okay.",
  "It doesn't sound like much of an objection.",
  "The problem that I think we all have is how do we guard, in effect, guard against making constitutional decisions which are simply going to be nullified by some clever device raising a procedural issue or an issue of State law when the case goes back? Is there any way for us to ensure against, in effect, a bad faith response to our decision except by purporting to require the State courts to follow a certain order of battle in the decision of issues before them so that when the case gets to us, we can be assured that there is no lurking issue that has not yet been decided as a matter of State law that in effect could then be resurrected to nullify our decision? Is there any way to guard against that except by telling the State courts what the sequence is in which they have to make decisions?",
  "I -- I see the problem. I mean, that's why I raised the question, how can we ensure - -",
  "Okay. Your -- your answer is there is -- there is no way to guard against it except - -",
  "-- by reviewing the good faith of what the court does on remand.",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Miller, could you help me out on how the system works in practice in a different way? One of your answers a few moments ago was that when -- I think it was Ms. Simmons was told why she lost, she in effect got as much notice as she would have needed to have to in effect do better on a remand. My first question is: Is there an automatic right to a remand?",
  "With new evidence?",
  "Okay. But even on the - - on the functioning of the system as you have explained it, at the -- at the very least the person says -- let's assume Simmons says: Oh, now I understand and I will get the following piece of evidence, which I didn't realize was my responsibility. Even on that explanation, it means that the claimant is going to have to go through another stage in the administrative litigation process. So I assume that ought to count as some sort of prejudice, and I assume it's something that, as it were, the burden of championing the VA ought to bear rather than the claimant.",
  "No, but you are going to have to go through another stage of litigation. One of the functions of the burden rule, and it might be too subtle a function to worry much about, but one of the functions is to puts the party with the burden on -- on notice that if you fail in your obligation, you're the one who is going to have to pay, unless you can convince everybody that there was in fact no harm done by this. And this induces the party with the burden to do what the primary obligation says the party ought to do. And on your -- and on your analysis, since the government would not have that obligation, the government has less of an inducement to follow the statutory obligation.",
  "Well, it may have a strong inducement, but I'm talking about a stronger one. If the government knows that it is going to bear the burden of any doubt about the significance of its failure, to some extent I suppose that is going to induce the government to be on its toes.",
  "Well, I mean that's the essential problem with common law adjudication. And there is not much we can do about that.",
  "At that point is the claimant disentitled to have a lawyer?",
  "But at the point they get the notice and they are trying to evaluate the significance of the notice, they are not entitled to a lawyer?",
  "Well - -",
  "No -- at the point where the statute requires original notice, they are not entitled to a lawyer.",
  "We agree on that. Now, they have gone through stage one of the litigation and they have lost. And they are getting a statement of reasons. At that point, are they entitled to have a lawyer?",
  "But whether -- I guess the situation that I am concerned with is, the person up to that moment not only does not have, but is not entitled to have a lawyer. The person then gets a piece of paper in the mail that says, \"You lost. These are the reasons.\" If the person -- if the claimant then says, \"I don't know what they are talking about. I will go get a lawyer,\" then I can understand at that point a relatively sophisticated mind is going to come in to understand it. But if the client simply reads it and says, \"I really don't know what they are talking about here or at least I think I know what they are talking about, and I guess it's hopeless,\" the person is not likely to have legal advice. And what I'm getting at is that the person at that stage, at the moment the notice arrives, is in a position, I would think, of extreme relative disadvantage.",
  "You can see where I am going with the argument.",
  "No, but it seems to me that there are two points at which the veteran is at a disadvantage. And you are talking about the second of the two. I am talking about the first of the two. And the first of the two is the point at which the -- I mean, following the hearing, the veteran gets the notice and the veteran is not in a very sophisticated position to evaluate what the veteran is being told.",
  "Well, that may be the assumption on this case, but that may not be the assumption on the next case. And I understood you to be arguing that you wanted us to hold that at -- well, you wanted us to hold whether we are dealing with a regulatory case or in Justice Breyer's example, where there is -- where there is no independent regulation, that the greater includes the lesser; that A, there is no duty to deal and therefore there is no obligation that can be violated under the antitrust laws by a price squeeze that does not rise to the level of predatory pricing. Is that your position?",
  "Well, the best way to do that is to start with a yes or no answer. That way, so I know where you are going.",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay. But what I think we are trying to get at is, should we foresee a situation, with or without the regulatory participation of something like the agency here, in which there would be a duty to deal, which would support a price squeeze theory that did not amount to predatory pricing?",
  "With respect to your argument that there is going to be an upstream disincentive to investment in the monopolist if we do not come up with a clear rule that you want, are we at a stage or is the fashion of economics at a stage where we can say that there is a clear consensus supporting your argument? And if the answer is no, then isn't the only sensible thing for this Court to do to is leave it to rule of greedy?",
  "For the reasons you gave, in effect, the investment disincentive?",
  "Is that, in effect, uncontested within the profession except for the margins?",
  "I follow the argument. The trouble I have that I have is I don't know whether, in the practical sense, that argument is a significant argument or not. I don't know what's going on out there. And unless we reach the point in which the economic literature makes this a kind of slam dunk decision, then it seems for me the only thing for a Court to do is leave it for reasoning and analysis.",
  "Is there - -",
  "But - -",
  "No, I didn't -- I didn't want to interrupt your answer, go ahead -- just go ahead.",
  "Isn't it -- isn't it the case that if in effect, we -- we refuse to come down with a -- the kind of blanket answer, with a rule that you want, that the parties here can go out -- the complaining party here can go back to the FCC and say there's something wrong with your wholesale pricing order; look what's happening; and the FCC may adjust the wholesale pricing order as a result of that. And if that is true, if they can do that, and the FCC can act, isn't that a good reason for us not to be developing new antitrust doctrine, if there is no need of it?",
  "Well, you're certainly asking us to -- at the very least -- to clarify the significance of Alcoa. You're -- you are asking for an articulation of something -- of the significance of Alcoa today, which we have not done. So in that sense you are asking for something more than we've got on the books now; and my question is, if the agency in effect can deal with -- with -- with what the -- the monopolist is concerned with, and what the entrant is concerned with, why do we have to take -- why is it wise for us to take the step of making or clarifying new antitrust law?",
  "So you are saying in practical terms that if there is a squeeze, it's highly unlikely it's going to be anything but a Brooke Group kind of squeeze, and therefore it's - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Either you or anybody else in the Ninth Circuit?",
  "Does he support - -",
  "I thought somebody else was -- does he support recognition of that claim in the circumstances in which there was regulatory involvement like the FCC here?",
  "Why do we need to?",
  "Why can't regulation handle it?",
  "You believe that the materiality judgment is yours to make, the State's to make as sort of a gate keeping measure? Isn't the materiality an issue for the fact finder?",
  "You exclude -- do you believe that you can, in effect, suppress any piece of evidence on -- on -- on the State's judgment that it will not prove to be material in the context of the whole case?",
  "Do you think that's a proper judgment for the prosecution to make?",
  "Right. And - -",
  "Wouldn't -- wouldn't he err on the side of turning over the matters because Brady leaves the materiality judgment, like all materiality judgments, ultimately, to the fact finder?",
  "Isn't the prosecutor's obligation to make an initial assessment as to whether the evidence tends to be mitigating evidence or favorable to the defendant? Isn't that the prosecutor's judgment?",
  "Isn't this evidence clearly of a mitigating character?",
  "You don't think -- you don't think it would be favorable to the defendant getting the evidence that Justice Breyer summarized a moment ago?",
  "Maybe I'm being -- but Justice Breyer made the point, and made it, I think very clearly, that although that evidence was in, the argument here -- the argument that was made before the jury in this case is that the witnesses upon whom the defense was specifically relying, were witnesses whose account of the defendant's drug use came solely from the defendant himself. Given that fact, wouldn't it have been mitigating evidence to learn that other people, at times relatively close to the events in question, without being coached by the defendant, had concluded that he was a drug user? Wouldn't that have been mitigating evidence?",
  "We are not asking about materiality at this point. We are asking about the mitigating character of the evidence. Would it have been favorable to the defendant? Would that have been its tendency?",
  "That was not my question. Was it favorable evidence? Did it have a tendency to favor the defendant?",
  "Then I will be candid with you that I simply cannot follow your argument because I believe you have just made a statement to me that is utterly irrational.",
  "What -- what do you say to the argument on the other side, that these various items of -- of Brady material were averted to and were discussed on a purely isolated basis; they were not discussed in terms of their cumulative effect, which Kyles v Whitley says is the standard. What's your response to that?",
  "Well, in your view if an officer was going down the street and he saw an individual as to whom he had no suspicion a crime was being committed, had been or was about to be, but he said that guy looks like trouble for anybody who has anything to do with him, so he goes up to him and he says, I want to talk to you, and because he has reasonable suspicion that the individual looks like trouble, he pats him down. Is that a good pat down?",
  "The individual gives him - - gives him mean looks and he has a bulge of something on his hip.",
  "No, but in my hypothesis there was nothing that would satisfy the first prong of Terry. There is no lawful traffic stop, there is no indication that the individual has committed a crime or is about to or is doing so. So, so -- so Terry one is blank in my hypothesis, and you nonetheless conclude that as a result of dirty looks and the bulge of a probable gun on the hip, the officer can in effect initiate the action with the individual and pat him down.",
  "But I take it, if I understood your earlier answer, you would extend the application of the rule as you understand it to the encounter simply on the sidewalk by a police officer who has no suspicion that the individual he wants to talk to has been, is or is about to commit a crime, but if the officer chooses to initiate the conversation, he then, in effect, if he can articulate any suspicion, like we'll say the dirty look and the bulge on the side, he can go ahead and pat down. Is that -- is that your view?",
  "Well, there's something fundamentally wrong probably about that, but the - - the -- I think the problem that sort of drives the questioning is that if you extend the rule as far as you want to extend it, we have to take into consideration that the standard of articulable suspicion is the standard that, in practical terms, can pretty well always be met. You can -- you know Benjamin Franklin's remark, it's great to be a reasonable person because you can think of a reason for anything you do. And that's what's driving, at least driving my questions.",
  "Yeah, but what the officer cites is going to be a matter of fact, and the facts at that point are gone, they're in the past. And all you've got is the officer saying, you know, this is - - this is what I perceived. And maybe you've got the a - - defendant somewhere saying, oh, no, it wasn't like that. But in a -- in a situation like that, if articulable suspicion, in effect, can justify a sidewalk pat down without any articulation of a basis to think crime is afoot, then you've got a -- you've got a pretty wide open standard in the real world.",
  "Can we pursue that for a minute. What -- I guess -- we -- we all start with the common assumption that -- that there was at least a legitimate stop to start with.",
  "And my -- my question which -- which goes to who was right about whether the seizure, the legitimate seizure had stopped and the consensual encounter had begun, my question is what is it beyond the conclusory statement of the officer that in effect justifies drawing that conclusion that the stop was over?",
  "Do we have -- do we have any evidence about duration here?",
  "If in my -- my problem in this case, I guess, in taking your position is, I don't think we have got an evidentiary basis to conclude that what we start by assuming is a legitimate stop has in fact run its course. I don't see how we can draw that conclusion. That's what I'm getting at.",
  "Well, then, in other words, you -- you are -- I -- I'll be candid with you. I would have started with the assumption, based on Brendlin, that if the stop of the car and its driver also effects a stop and a seizure of the passenger, that you start out with the assumption that the seizure of the passenger is going to last for the same duration as the seizure of the car and the driver unless you have a good reason to draw some line and say, no, it doesn't. And I take it that you are not making that initial assumption; am I correct in that?",
  "I think you're rejecting it, aren't you?",
  "What are those -- what are those special facts?",
  "Are you saying -- are you saying if there are a driver and a passenger and two police officers, and one police officer is dealing with the driver, saying, you know, where's your insurance papers and so on, and at the same time the other officer is questioning the -- the passenger -- are you saying that that independent questioning of the passenger in effect eliminates the -- the passenger's seizure as - - as following from the seizure of the driver?",
  "I -- I don't get it. Why should the fact that an officer, a separate officer is talking to the passenger, ultimately have anything to do with the duration of the passenger's seizure, absent a situation in which officer two says, \"by the way, you're totally free to go\"? We don't have that kind of strange situation. But short of a strange situation like that, why does the conversation with the passenger have anything much to do, have any bearing on the -- on the length of the passenger's seizure?",
  "Yes.",
  "But we accept as hornbook law when they are -- when the police are questioning one individual whom they stopped, let's say for a traffic violation, that during that period of seizure, the reasonable period of seizure, the officer can ask questions about other subjects, and that doesn't end the seizure.",
  "Like the -- passenger.",
  "I don't want to -- I don't want to take up your whole argument on this hobbyhorse of mine, but I mean my -- my only problem is, I don't see that we have got an evidentiary basis here to say that because of the duration or the mere fact of the questioning, there is a reason to say that as to the passenger, a reasonable passenger could say I am no longer seized, and -- and this encounter is totally consensual. The -- the officer testified, no question about it, but the test is subjective.",
  "Well, Mr. Garre, isn't there more involved here than simply derivative liability for the acts of others? I -- I've got a bunch of excerpts from the complaint, but let me just go to one, on section -- paragraph, rather, 97. That charges the defendants Ashcroft and Mueller with willfully and maliciously designing a policy. It doesn't sound like respondeat superior. I mean, it seems to -- to charge them directly with coming up with what these people are complaining about.",
  "Well, why don't -- may I just interrupt you there? Why don't you think the reference here in the language I just read, to designing a policy, includes the policy which is several times described as being one which called for holding -- for Arab Muslim men of certain countries of origin without reference to any penal purpose? I mean, that -- I think that is adequately described in there as part of the policy.",
  "Even -- even if, as the Chief Justice said, they knew and condoned the policy?",
  "Well, you may be -- you -- I mean, you may be right. I think there's -- there's a lot of tension in the -- in the allegations here. I -- I grant you that. But isn't the proper way to deal with those tensions at this stage to file a motion for a more definite statement and find out for sure?",
  "The difference, it -- and maybe this isn't a sufficient difference. But the difference in my mind between this and Bell Atlantic was that, in Bell Atlantic you had a set of allegations in which in -- in effect it was an either-or choice. There were two possibilities consistent with the allegations in Bell Atlantic. One was a conspiracy possibility; one was a -- a lawful parallel conduct possibility. And there just wasn't any way to pick one as being a more probable interpretation of what they were getting at. Here the problem is not so much an either- or choice as to which we are clueless, but a just vagueness or uncertainty. Does the -- Does the talk about the -- the racial criterion go to the policy as devised or the policy as implemented? And so on. And it seems to me that here we're -- we're in a kind of conceptually a squishier situation and it might be better to get a more definite statement than to say, well, you -- you've got to make a choice, and there's no way to make a choice.",
  "But, Mr. Garre, you are using the word \"plausible\" or you're taking the word \"plausible\" out of Bell Atlantic, I think, and you are using it to mean something that probably can be proven to be true. Bell Atlantic drew that distinction. They -- the plausibility there is a plausibility that if they prove what they say, they will -- they will establish a violation.",
  "Okay. I -- I think you are right that if somebody makes just a totally bizarre allegation that nobody in the world could take seriously, that -- that the issue can be raised. But in Justice Breyer's case, the -- that -- that may be the case if the claim is that the president of Coke was -- was personally putting mouses in bottles. But the claim, it seems to me, that the Attorney General or the Director of the FBI was establishing a policy of no release until cleared or a policy that centered on people with the same characteristics as the hijackers does not have that kind of bizarre character to it and, I think, would not run afoul of the -- of the plausibility standard.",
  "Well, I would agree, but this is about as far from common government operation as one can get.",
  "Oh, I know, but the courts can't --",
  "The courts can't ignore the extraordinary circumstances, either.",
  "Mr. Reinert --",
  "I want to throw you a question. I'm not sure it's a softball question. You can --",
  "You can let me know. I -- I'm starting with the assumption, which I think is -- is in Bell Atlantic, that what we are concerned with in context is that the -- the context tells us how specific you've got to be versus how conclusory you've got to be, and the reason it does so is that some allegations are -- are more likely to be true than others depending on the context. Is it fair to say -- going back to Justice Breyer's question, is it fair to say that your basic pleading here rests on the following assumption: That it is more plausible that the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of the FBI were in fact directly involved in devising a policy with the racial characteristics and the coercive characteristics that you claim, than that the President of Coca Cola was putting mouses in bottles?",
  "So you would say, if -- to the Coke question you would say, yes, they've got to get more facts there, this is just -- this is just crazy to think that the president is putting mice in the bottles. But you're saying that, so far as the close involvement of the Attorney General and the FBI director, it's not crazy to assume what you -- what you say, and, therefore, you don't have to get into more detail in order to have an adequate claim here. Is that --",
  "May I ask you this question? And -- and I ask it, you know, mindful of what you've just said, but I -- I'm not sure that the two issues can be kept as -- as separated as you suggest. Another avenue to responding to the problem, I think, that Justice Breyer's last hypo raised would be as follows -- and then I'll tell you the difficulty that I have with it, and I was going ask you to comment on the difficulty. He said that the -- the allegation -- one way to read the allegation, and I think a fair way, is to say that the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI devised a policy and condoned the implementation of a policy that was based on racial and religious grounds with no penological purpose. Well, under the circumstances of immediate post-9/11, it is not surprising necessarily that they -- they devised a policy that had reference to religion and national origin and so on, given what we knew about the hijackers. What is not so easy to accept, as a matter of adequate pleading, is the claim that there was no penological interest involved in the decision of how to and how long to hold the individuals who were picked up. One answer to that, which I think is -- is in your pleadings, is that you refer to specific individuals and in particular to your own client, who was in the position of being held under these conditions for a considerable period of time, and it turns out there's -- there's no indication that there was ultimately a justified penological interest. So that might be your answer to Justice Breyer's question. There's enough in here about specific detentions to make it plausible for pleading standards that they were being held without any penological interest. The difficulty I have with that line of thinking is this: You also allege in there that lower level officials were making decisions on an ad hoc basis without adequate criteria as to -- as to how they should make them. And that particular line of allegations suggests that what was really going on here, including what was happening to your client, wasn't the result of -- of clear policy decisions made by the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, but they -- they were just being scattered. So, what in the context of your whole pleading makes it adequate simply to charge on a conclusory basis that these two defendants were devising a policy that had -- that was intended to have an effect of no penological interest?",
  "Did -- you'll have to help me out. Did you allege that?",
  "Okay. That's what you're saying --",
  "Are you -- are you saying that the -- that the claim that there was no penological interest for certain decisions goes simply to the distinction between the decision whether to classify as \"of interest\" versus as \"of high interest\"?",
  "Yes, but why can't you make exactly the same kind of analysis here? People here are not showing up for work. They are staying home and getting retirement benefits. And every day a person who was out for 90 days because of a physical illness other than pregnancy is getting a retirement benefit with an extra dollar. And everybody who was out -- who was out for 90 days for maternity is only getting an extra 33 cents. And -- and why isn't the payment of the retirement benefit exactly on par with the payment of the salary in Bazemore?",
  "Well, do you -- do you see Ledbetter in effect as -- as overruling Bazemore?",
  "And -- and at the time, in Bazemore, that the private employers discriminated for racial purposes, that was not unconstitutional or illegal, either.",
  "No, but I mean, that -- with respect, I think that sort of begs the question because if Bazemore is the right template for analyzing this case, then you're not in compliance when you -- when your payment of the pension benefit reflects the pregnancy differential.",
  "Would you -- would you -- excuse me -- would you agree that if -- well, let me be less rhetorical about it. What if Congress passed a statute providing that, starting one year from the effective date of the statute, no pension plan will differentiate in computing pension benefits on leaves taken between -- as between leaves taken for -- for conventional sickness and leaves taken for pregnancy. Would that statute be unconstitutional?",
  "Yes.",
  "To make it retroactive. Yes.",
  "So your -- your argument simply is a -- a purely statutory construction argument: That isn't what Congress had in mind.",
  "If Congress would have had in mind, then there would be a question whether Congress could do it, and you agree that it could. So the question is simply: Did it or didn't it in this case?",
  "Do you -- do you think Ledbetter modified or overruled Bazemore?",
  "Well, why does it upset --",
  "So far as pension benefits are concerned, it doesn't upset any employee's expectations. The ones who don't have a pregnancy background are going to get the same pension that they -- they bargained for.",
  "Well, but that -- I mean, that's -- that's an issue that you touched on, on your second point. I don't know if it is a zero-sum game. And if -- if I were faced with -- with a problem, and I may be, in which I really have two choices -- I've got two analogies in our cases, I can take either one, and there were evidence in here that the -- that this was going to be so traumatic to the pension system that it would be manifestly unfair and perhaps endanger benefits for others to force these benefits to be paid, that would be a good reason to go one way. But I don't think we have that in the case. And --",
  "And if we don't have it in the case, then this isn't a zero-sum game.",
  "The -- the point that is not true that -- that Justice Stevens is bringing out is that, in this case, you had a plan which was established at a time when the plan was -- was lawful. And, in effect, you are saying there is -- there is no value to be given to any reliance interest on the part of the company that established the plan when it funded according -- prior to the passage of the Act, when -- when it -- it calculated it's funding on the basis of what was, in fact, lawful conduct. And you are saying that is irrelevant. You didn't have that factor in Bazemore.",
  "Well, how would it do that?",
  "Well, you're -- you're not asking the Court to do that, are you? You -- you're saying, look, pay -- pay pension benefits to these people exactly as they would have been calculated if, in fact, their pregnancy had been treated as whatever the regular sick leave was, so that they would get full credit for the time they were out. You're -- you're not asking for any remedial order that gives them anything less than 100 percent of what they want.",
  "How -- how do we -- you think that? How do we know that?",
  "How do we know -- maybe -- maybe I can put the same question in a different way. Let's assume -- and this isn't a bizarre assumption here -- that we've got two lines of cases, and we could rely on either of those lines of cases, go one way if -- if we rely on line a, and go another way if we rely on line b. What are the good reasons, apart from simply statements of the cases themselves, to go with the one line or the other line? One reason would be reliance interests in setting up a pension plan to distinguish this from Bazemore. How are we in a position to make that judgment?",
  "But assuming -- assuming the tribunal takes up some such issue as Justice Kennedy has mentioned, it will start with the assumption that the Cubic judgment is in fact a valid judgment. It will not look behind the Cubic judgment as such, will it?",
  "But that's an entirely separate proceeding. Assuming the Cubic judgment has not been reversed through the appellate process that it is going through, then the tribunal will take the Cubic judgment as it finds it.",
  "Okay. Doesn't it make it pretty tough to say that the Cubic judgment is at issue?",
  "I mean, I think we understand that. And -- and it's clear that the United States, in effect, is taking the position that that's all we need to bear in mind. But it suggests to me that the drafting of the statute did not go as far as it might have gone to protect the interests of the United States.",
  "\"At Issue\" means related to -- \"At Issue\" means related to an issue in a separate case.",
  "That's what it boils down to, doesn't it?",
  "Well, doesn't it?",
  "It means that at the end of the proceeding one side or the other gets the property.",
  "And that is not going to be the -- what one side or the other gets in this proceeding is going to be a new judgment. And that new judgment may or may not be satisfied by dealing with the prior judgment. But that doesn't mean that the prior judgment is at issue; it simply means that the prior judgment may be used to discharge in an appropriate case an obligation which is determined in the later proceeding.",
  "Okay. So Iran - -",
  "I understand that, but it's still executive clemency.",
  "When a clemency decision is made, it's not being made by these other people who are helping out the president. It's being made by the executive.",
  "Of course, it would have made sense for Congress to use to other -- as a way of referring to the states simply because it would have been a matter of indifference to Congress whether a State process was executive or was other in some way, in effect, just leaving the issue open as an irrelevance.",
  "That still leaves you with the question that the -- what the words \"or other\" can possibly refer to, given the present state of federal law and federal constitutional law, unless they refer to State proceedings.",
  "But it does -- here's the problem that I am having and I think others may have. We start, number one, with a definition, as I understand it, of a pollutant that includes suspended solids. Number two, there is an existing regulation to the effect that wastewater from this particular method of extracting gold shall simply not be released, shall not be put into a water body. And then the two agencies come along and in effect they say by regulation, if the suspended solid in effect comes out of a mine, or if the wastewater has got suspended solid in it, we are going to call it \"fill\" and leave it entirely to the Army Engineers under 404, subject to an EPA veto. And on the face of it, it sounds as though they are simply, number one, defining one -- one variant of pollution out of the EPA's jurisdiction, and, number two, with respect to the wastewater, in effect coming up with a contradictory determination about what should be done with it. And it sounds as though, under the Administrative Procedure Act, that with the statutory and the regulatory regime on the one hand and this joint regulation on the other, you've simply got a flat contradiction, and query whether that can be anything other than arbitrary and capricious under the APA. Will you address that?",
  "Well, let's assume -- and I don't mean to cut you off there, but before you're done -- I am at least raising it because I find it very difficult to get a handle on this case without dealing with that problem. So you may say, well, they didn't raise it well enough, but I still want you to deal with it on the merits.",
  "That's pretty cold comfort when you treat as an impoundment area a natural lake. I suppose if the -- if it's proper to do what they're doing here, then the lake in the middle of the Everglades is an impoundment area, or a Great Salt Lake is an impoundment area.",
  "This is a long way from a settling pond.",
  "Yes, but what's that - - what's that got to do with the definition of \"impoundment area\"? My problem is that you are treating -- the Corps is treating as an impoundment area a whole natural lake as distinct from a settling basin.",
  "You keep saying they are rigorous. My understanding is -- and I didn't think it was seriously disputed here -- is that during the period in which the deposits are going to be made, the natural life of this water body is going to be destroyed.",
  "And the Corps comes along and says, oh, when it's all over, it will come back. But when you're destroying the entire living sort of corpus of this lake, it seems to me that it's getting more lenient to say that there are rigorous environmental standards.",
  "No, but as I understand it, and you correct me if I am wrong here, I thought \"suspended solids,\" I guess is the buzz word for it, is a form of pollution. So you're saying, well, we're destroying the fish with one form of pollution rather than another form of pollution. And I don't know that that advances the ball for your side.",
  "Yes, but this comes back to my initial question. You are simply, or the Corps is simply, defining what would otherwise be a pollutant, suspended solids discharged into the water, by calling it fill material. And it -- in effect it's defining one subject of -- of discharge regulation right out of the law of the United States by redefining it and saying, oh, it doesn't exist if it's coming out of a mine.",
  "But to apply the effects test, the legal effect, is it not, is to define one form of pollution as no longer existent so long as that form of pollution falls within the Corps of Engineers definition of \"fill.\"",
  "Is that correct?",
  "But it's going to kill every living creature in the lake, right?",
  "Wait a minute. It is going to kill everything in the lake.",
  "Why does that mean anything more than you've got to get a 404 permit without addressing the question whether you can get a 404 permit if it has, in effect, the -- the -- if it has the effects which are supposed to be regulated by the effluent limitations?",
  "Where is -- where is that in the appendix?",
  "Well, would you -- would you agree just as a general rule that unless we find - - unless there is some rule under which we can conclude that the State court should have held a hearing, that there is no occasion to have a Federal evidentiary hearing?",
  "That would be the general proposition.",
  "Okay.",
  "Was -- was -- is all of this factual material in the -- in the documents submitted with the habeas, with the State habeas and the response to the State habeas?",
  "What -- what did they do? Did they submit the trial transcript with the -- in - - with the response to the habeas petition at the State? In other words, how did it get in front of the State court, is all I want to know.",
  "Ah, okay.",
  "Then if we get to that point, I think your argument is as follows. I'm not sure. I want you to tell me. If the State court adjudication was -- was contrary to what Justice Stevens' hypo suggested might be the \"total fool\" rule, in other words no one but a complete nincompoop would have failed to -- to press forward with this defense, then we can decide the case simply under Strickland, because Strickland unreasonableness is certainly going to cover the total fool case. But if we have something less egregious than the total fool case, then we've got to look for more precise Supreme Court precedent, and that's what gets us into the Musladin or Musladin rule.",
  "And if we get to the Musladin sort of level of generality, we do not have any determination from this Court, any clearly established law from this Court, that would indicate that the State court's adjudication or determination was unreasonable here.",
  "Is that your road map?",
  "No, but you're saying - - the need for the evidentiary hearing, as I understand it, was raised by you in the following way. You said to the California Supreme Court: There is on the face of the papers filed here a violation of Strickland and a - - or a misapplication of Strickland in -- in the way the California trial court came out; but if you do not find a facial violation of Strickland based on these papers, then you should remand for an evidentiary hearing. And it doesn't seem to me that that follows at all. If there's no Strickland error, that seems to me a -- a -- an odd premise to say you ought to remand for a hearing. Aren't you under an obligation to specify factual issues that -- specifically that need to be developed, before you would make out a case for saying they were in error in not holding the evidentiary hearing?",
  "But you're saying that you specified the evidentiary issues that you wanted to develop?",
  "Well, with that, I'm just asking you - -",
  "I'm asking you -- I'm throwing you a softball.",
  "Are you saying that that was, in effect, an adequate way to tell the California Supreme Court that these are the issues that we want to develop in an evidentiary hearing that aren't sufficiently developed in the documents? Is that your position?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, maybe -- maybe he did, but when we come to judge prejudice, don't we have to judge prejudice by considering exactly what Justice Ginsburg just said? In other words, our standard, the -- the standard -- No. 1, the standard for Strickland prejudice is -- is an objective -- I mean the standard for -- for -- of -- of performance is an objective standard. And the standard for prejudice has got to be an objective standard, too. And even though he said, I didn't do this for tactical reasons, if a -- if a sound lawyer would have entertained exactly the tactical reason that Justice Ginsburg just outlined, isn't that crucial to the determination of prejudice?",
  "Well, shouldn't that be?",
  "How did he know that?",
  "Yes, but the judge hadn't sentenced him yet.",
  "You are saying the terms of the sentence had to be 25 to life?",
  "So there was no discretion on the trial judge's part.",
  "What discretion did the judge have?",
  "Well, Mr. Verrilli, you have spoken of -- of overruling a bright line, but I think there is something else that would be involved in the overruling. And I -- I haven't pulled Jackson back out since I came on the bench, so this is where you've got to help me out. There is a -- there is a difference between the way you are phrasing the Sixth Amendment right and the way, for example, Justice Scalia has phrased it in his question. Justice Scalia has phrased it in terms of determining what is a coerced confession. You have phrased it in your argument in terms of saying a right to rely upon counsel, which is a much broader concept. Does Jackson support the notion that he simply has a right to rely upon counsel? I think that is your principal argument here because that would be the argument that supports your claim that there shouldn't be a distinction between a case in which the State simply appoints counsel without being asked and a case in which he actually asks for counsel. That would be a nice way of rationalizing that distinction. Isn't it the case that you understand Jackson to be a broader rule than a merely no-coercion rule? And, number two, if that is so, then overruling Jackson would, as I take it, in your view be more than simply substituting a -- a one bright-line coercion rule for a different bright-line coercion rule. So what are your responses to those two questions?",
  "Excuse me. They advised him, you say, of his right to counsel. If they gave him the standard Miranda warning, what they said was: You have the right to have a counsel appointed. They didn't say: You have a lawyer who has been appointed. And, in fact, his testimony at least is that they told him the opposite. But if all they did was give him the Miranda warning, they certainly were not informing him of his Sixth Amendment right or his Sixth Amendment status.",
  "But that doesn't go to the issue in this case. The issue in this case, as I understand it, is not that he lost because he failed to make a request. He lost because he failed to make it affirmatively clear that he accepted the appointment of the lawyer who had, in fact, been appointed for him as he had been told. That's not a request. As I understand it, under the -- under the State court ruling, if he had stood at the 72-hour hearing and the court had said, we're appointing the X office to defend you, and he had said, great, that would have changed the result in this case; isn't that correct?",
  "So the issue is not request. The issue is acceptance. That's what it seems -- just to get my point, that's what seems to me to be the acute point of several of the questions you have been asked. Why -- we're not talking about requests. Why should it make a constitutional difference whether the man stands in a Tennessee courtroom and simply stands silent when they said, you've got a lawyer - -",
  "-- as distinct from a case where they say you have got a lawyer, and he says, that's fine?",
  "You're not merely defending the State court here. You're asking for a -- in effect, a different rule from that which the State court applied.",
  "Then are you equating positive affirmation with request for a lawyer?",
  "Then on your -- then on your theory, this individual's Sixth Amendment right would not have attached if he had stood in the courtroom and said, thank you very much, that's great.",
  "But you're also arguing, it seems to me, that a request -- well, you're -- I think you're arguing two different things. On the one hand, you're arguing that a request is necessary, and yet on the other hand, I understood you to concede in answer to a question from me that if he had stood in the courtroom in Tennessee, having been told that counsel was appointed for him and had said, yes, thank you, I accept that lawyer, that that would have been sufficient to satisfy Jackson, and that would have made the difference in this case. Those are two different positions.",
  "Well, so far as I understand it, and you correct me if I'm wrong, but as I understand it, what the State Supreme Court said was not that he had to make a request, \"I want a lawyer,\" but simply that he had to indicate in some way that he accepted the appointment of the lawyer which he had been told had been appointed for him; and that is a different situation from Jackson. So if -- if you are saying, yes, if he had said \"thank you, I accept the lawyer,\" that would have been enough, then that in effect is -- is maintaining the position that the State court took; but if you're saying something more, that he had to say then or later on, \"I want a lawyer,\" then I think you're going beyond the case that we have in front of us. Am I wrong?",
  "Okay.",
  "May I ask you a question that goes at least to one possible application of -- of your argument? Your argument for the State, the position that you just took, would -- would apply to the period of time, as I understand it, in which the individual named, the defender named Sleigh, had been appointed to -- to represent the defendant. And as I understand it, when this case was argued in the Supreme Court of Vermont, the State conceded that, in fact, some prejudice should be attributed and it should be held against the State that Sleigh in effect did nothing. They said, well, don't hold it against us quite as much as you might, but, in any case, that can be held against us. Here you don't take that position, and I -- I don't know whether it's open to you -- it seems to me that it's not open to you -- to take a different position with respect to Sleigh here than the Attorney General of Vermont did when it was before the Supreme Court of Vermont. And I -- I have to assume that you just see it differently from the way the Attorney General did. But would -- would you comment on -- on the position that the State took and tell me why you can take a different position here?",
  "Yes.",
  "But it was conceded, wasn't it, in the -- in the Vermont Supreme Court?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, then, why isn't that concession binding here?",
  "Well, it is, but that is not an issue that is necessarily implied by the -- by the concession that the Attorney General made in the Vermont Supreme Court.",
  "Before you start, let me just make a comment and a -- and a question based on it. The comment is I -- I'm willing to accept a lot of what you say here, there is plenty of blame to go around. But you accept, as I understand it, the proposition that the State has simply got an affirmative duty to make some kind of effective trial and representation arrangement. It -- it -- it has that duty through providing the public defender, it has that duty simply through providing a court that will keep things moving, and I think that's common ground. If that, as it seems to be, is common ground, then do we have anything before us in this case, except sort of going through the list of counsel, the list of reasons, the list of delays and reviewing the Vermont Supreme Court on, in effect, the details that it assumed in applying the rule? In other words, it seems to me that there isn't an issue of principle dividing the parties here, it's a series of issues of details. Is that an unfair way to look at the case as we've got it?",
  "Yeah, but if you take Sleigh, Donaldson, and the period in which there was no -- I guess, following Sleigh, in which there was no counsel appointed at all, you're already up to just about a year. And a year is -- is enough to trigger Neil v. Biggers. And so, it seems to me that what - - what the fight, what the serious fight is about is, well, within the further total of two-year period, who is to blame for this, who was to blame to that, and I'm -- I'm not sure that it's of any value to just go through and second-guess the Supreme Court of Vermont on those details, because you've got enough in Neil v. Biggers before you even get to those details.",
  "Right.",
  "With respect to that last point, let me ask you this question. Let's assume we - - we have paid counsel in a criminal case and, as a result of -- of delays by the prosecution, but primarily as a result of requests for continuance after continuance after continuance, the -- the case is not tried; it's a simple case and it's not tried for three years. Is -- is it open to a reviewing court on constitutional grounds to say that the State has got an affirmative obligation, a non-delegable obligation, to bring cases to trial in a reasonable time? And whether the reason for the failure in this three-year case is because counsel just kept trying to -- to shove it off, or the courts were not diligent in scheduling it for trial, at some point that non-delegable obligation has been violated. Is -- is that a -- a possible constitutionally based position?",
  "Well, what if the -- what if we change the facts slightly. What if the defendant himself never says anything on the record? The only thing we've got on the record are repeated requests by paid counsel for continuances, and then after three years the defendant fires paid counsel and says: I've been sitting in jail for three years awaiting trial, and I shouldn't have to wait that long. The State has failed in its non-delegable duty. Would your answer still be the same?",
  "Lots -- lots of very effective criminal trial lawyers believe that the first tactic is delay, delay, delay, delay, delay.",
  "Well, you couldn't, could you, because the -- an organization can consist of an individual. And it seems to me that all of the requirements that you have been specifying would in an individual case be met simply by showing that there was -- there was an individual in business who had a brain.",
  "Well, but, if I set up a newsstand, it's a sole proprietorship and that's all I have to do. And if I have a functioning brain, I have a decisionmaking mechanism. I remember from day-to-day what I did, so I have continuity. And -- and it seems to me that all of these requirements are -- are virtually satisfied as a matter of course by an individual who engages in any kind of business that might have interstate-commerce implications.",
  "Oh, absolutely. But it seems to me that it -- it puts you in sort of a -- a difficult position to -- to be calling for or -- or requiring jury instructions that call for, as necessary conditions, findings of structure, continuity, decision - making, capacity and so on, when in fact on -- on at least one variety of enterprise, these conditions are - - are met virtually automatically simply by having somebody doing business in any way.",
  "Oh, I agree, but an individual can be an -- an enterprise.",
  "And -- and an association, in fact, can be an enterprise. And if we accept those two propositions, then I think you've got a tough row to hoe in saying that any enterprise which is not an individual has got to have all the formal characteristics that you talk about, given the fact that those characteristics are automatically satisfied by an individual.",
  "Why -- I guess that's where I'm losing the argument. Why is it difficult?",
  "Then why don't you dispense with the association-in-fact category and simply go with the individual?",
  "Your point is not that he should have gotten the reduction. Your point is that the government should have made the recommendation.",
  "Isn't it? Isn't that your point?",
  "The agreement called for them to make a recommendation and they didn't make it. In fact, they recommended the contrary. And that's your gripe, right?",
  "But why -- why should the defendant have the option to withdraw from an agreement when he got everything under the best possible circumstances that he could have expected?",
  "No, but we are talking about the Chief Justice's hypothetical at this point. And they -- in his hypothetical, the sentencing judge says, I'm going to give you the three points; you are going to get everything that on the rosiest scenario you could have hoped for. Why should he be able to withdraw his plea at that point?",
  "In other words, your position is -- is kind of a theoretical formalistic position, that -- I'm not sure if this is the wrong words here -- there is a metaphysical quality to the plea, and even though things turn out as well to him as he could possibly have expected had the agreement been kept punctiliously, if the government simply omits the words he can walk away from the plea? I mean, that's your position?",
  "Yes, but usually -- I mean, the theory of relief in contract law depends upon relief from something. And if, in fact, there is -- there is no discernible damage that has been suffered, if on the other hand -- again, taking the Chief's hypothetical - - there is an affirmative demonstration that no damage occurred, normal principles of contract would say there is nothing to give him relief from. The law of contract is -- is not a metaphysical construct. Why should the law of plea agreements be?",
  "Well, I think you are. I mean, you are saying even though he has come out with, you know, a rose in his mouth, he can still, if he is crazy enough, throw away the whole plea agreement.",
  "What I'm getting at -- I think what we are all trying to get at -- is in order to have a rule, an absolute rule like yours, we usually look for a good reason to have that rule. And since we are talking about an agreement, the place to look for the good reason is in the consequences to the defendant. And when the consequences are terrific, when they are the best that he could possibly have hoped for, there doesn't seem to be a good reason to adopt your very theoretical construct of agreement. Is there some reason that we are just not seeing?",
  "Never mind what the government can cite. I'm asking you if there is a good reason to adopt this absolute rule of yours.",
  "Excuse me, were you -- Justice Kennedy, were you through? I'm sorry, I thought you started a question again. The problem I have with the harmless error suggestion that you've made is this. If the government does engage in some breach of the agreement, it seems to me the consequence is that an individual has given up a trial and as a consequence of that has given up liberty, without either the trial that he is entitled to or fulfillment of the conditions for giving up the liberty. And isn't there -- isn't there a very high value to be placed on the fact that nobody in the United States under the constitutional guarantees should be - - should be sitting behind bars without either a conviction following full trial, invocation of whatever rights he wants to invoke, or a voluntary agreement to be behind bars? And -- and when neither of those conditions is fulfilled, don't we have an error that as a matter of constitutional law cannot be regarded as harmless.",
  "I -- I think I would agree with you there because, by whatever means, the defendant has gotten everything the defendant bargained for.",
  "It may have come by a more circuitous route, but he got it all.",
  "But in the case when, unlike the Chief Justice's hypothetical, when we don't know that, when we -- the judge sort of keeps his thoughts to himself or herself, then don't we have the -- the problem of the -- the individual behind bars, neither as a result of trial nor as a result of the deal that he made?",
  "Doesn't -- whether we accept that proposition or not that the analysis must differ, doesn't that really depend on -- on what value we place on the importance of the proposition that I started with? If somebody's behind bars, it's either as a result of a valid conviction after trial or a voluntary agreement that says, yeah, I will stay there. And if -- if we place a very high value on the liberty interest -- in -- in retaining liberty except under those two conditions, then isn't it fair to us -- isn't it sensible for us to say even in a plain-error situation, we are going to recognize this -- this kind of prejudice, despite the fact that he didn't object? If we place a high value on the liberty interest, we wouldn't accept your position; isn't that fair?",
  "You are right, there is no question about it. If -- we are saying we will take a -- a less efficient process, a process less efficient perhaps even for getting at the truth, because we think the liberty interest is that important. You are entirely right.",
  "Will you give me an example?",
  "No -- no question, but it seems to me that the answer to that is, it's an incentive that would never come into play if the government kept its word.",
  "So why -- why should -- why is the government really in a position to object to that?",
  "Well, could the breach have been cured? I mean, the point -- it seems to me, the point at which the defendant would have known that the government had breached the agreement was when the government stood there before the court and said, \"In fact, he hasn't accepted responsibility. He went out and committed another crime while he was behind bars.\" It seems to me that that's the point -- and maybe this phrase occurred somewhere in the record - - that that's a bell that you can't unring. For the defendant to get up and object and said, \"Wait a minute, were you supposed to represent to the court that you agreed that I did accept responsibility\" -- to require the government to fulfill that undertaking at that point would have been ridiculous. I suppose the U.S. attorney could have said, \"Oh, yes, he's right, Judge. We agreed that he accepted responsibility.\" But the U.S. attorney has already just said a moment before, \"He hasn't. We really don't mean that at all.\" There's no way, it seems to me, that there could have been a better outcome in a case like this, even if the objection had been contemporary.",
  "Which would have been silly.",
  "With respect, that is not what Olano says, is it? The -- the -- the basic Olano standard is a -- is a violation of substantial rights standard.",
  "And one way that you could show a violation of substantial rights would be a -- a demonstration that the outcome would have been different. But another possibility of showing that violation is -- is whether -- and I know you don't accept it, but it's the one that I proposed earlier, there is a violation of substantial rights if somebody is sitting behind bars without having gotten there by the performance of an agreement that he made, or as a result of a trial. And that, too, could satisfy the Olano formulation, could it not?",
  "But why -- why was it appropriate to have a special rule for transportation? In other words, everything that is covered by the transportation proviso would, on your theory would on your theory have been subject to consideration under McNabb-Mallory anyway. So why did they simply have a six-hour rule and leave any exceptions, transportation, unavailability of magistrate, medical emergency, whatever, to -- to the leeway that McNabb-Mallory allows?",
  "So basically -- I don't mean this disparagingly, but basically the answer is politics. Somebody from a State thought of it and nobody else said, well, gee, let's pile on some other provisos. It's as simple as that in your view?",
  "I see.",
  "But isn't there a -- a new factor now that the Court has decided Miranda? And you've argued that we should regard this in the post-Miranda light, but I think there is at least one way of doing that that cuts against the government's argument and I would like your response to that. That is that in the post-Miranda world in practical terms, if a -- if a court in considering a suppression motion finds that the Miranda warnings were given and that after they were given this individual said, okay, I'll talk, that is in practical terms the end of the issue. The notion that there is a -- an independent voluntariness concern is pretty much theory, not practice. Given what I think is the, kind of the real-world effect of Miranda -- say the magic words, get the defendant to say, I'll talk, that's it -- doesn't it make sense to have a further safeguard in something like the six-hour rule understood as preserving McNabb-Mallory after the six hours?",
  "Well, I agree with you; it is an issue of policy. But I thought your whole argument for considering this as a post-Miranda case was in effect a -- a policy context in which you wanted us to decide this.",
  "If that is the answer, why do we need (c) -- I mean, why did Congress need (c) at all?",
  "Then why didn't the statute say, instead of saying inadmissible, shall not be found involuntary solely by reasons of delay. Because it seems to me that your argument twain the two.",
  "I think it's a fluke, too, but you gave -- to my recollection, I forget where it was -- I think you gave citations to three or four cases in which that actually happened.",
  "Were the examples that she gives, the two or three cases, properly examples under this section, in your - -",
  "May I interrupt you just a second? When I meant examples, I meant the cited cases. There were two or three cited cases.",
  "What difference would it make? I mean, if he can satisfy the clear and convincing standard, which is tantamount to saying that on final judgment I win, hands down, what need is there to -- to go into irreparable harm?",
  "But -- but -- but that's - - no, but in any case, if he's got to show by clear and convincing evidence that he is going to have success on the merits, I don't see any point in any case of going into irreparable harm. If he goes into irreparable harm without the clear and convincing standard, he loses. If he satisfies the clear and convincing standard, there is nothing for irreparable harm considerations to -- to add to -- to the mix of factors.",
  "It's certainly more than a preponderance?",
  "But the ultimate -- the ultimate standard to which they look is a preponderance standard. In other words, the substantial evidence standard is keyed to what a reasonable factfinder could find reasonably, based upon substantial evidence. Is the substantial evidence sufficient for such a factfinder to find by a preponderance that this person has failed to meet, or, put it the other way around, that the factfinder has unreasonably failed to find that the Petitioner has met the standard? So ultimately you are talking about a preponderance standard, which is -- which is the key, isn't that correct?",
  "But and -- and I applaud the fact that you don't, but I don't know how you can do it consistently with your view that \"stay\" in (b)(3)(B) means the same thing as the \"injunction\" in (f) when \"injunction\" in (f) is restricted as much as it is.",
  "God bless you, but I don't know how -- I don't know how under the statute, on your reading of the statute, you -- you can do it.",
  "All right. Then why doesn't that provide the broader authority under (b)(3)(B) stay provision that your friends on the other side are arguing for?",
  "But this is a longer temporary stay than you conceded a few moments ago. I mean, you were talking about Friday night to Monday morning, when you were -- when you were conceding the stay on the Hobbs analogy. I don't know how many months it's been, but this is no Friday night to Monday morning stay.",
  "Okay. Explain to me the - - the relevant scope of IMLA and the Rehab Act. The - - the argument that you made, that you just made, makes perfect sense if the Rehab Act applies to some kinds of -- of leases or contracts that the -- that the IMLA does not. And yet I -- I thought you were saying a little bit earlier that the Rehab Act applies to all mineral leasing, because that would be the development of the natural resource. And if that is so, then there seems to be a pretty clear conflict, even on your own argument, between the term provisions in the Rehab Act and the term provisions of IMLA with respect to -- to mineral leases. How do -- how do we get out of that problem for you?",
  "But it's a special protection and special duty that applies to every one of the mineral leases, including this one, that the Navajo may be involved in.",
  "So I -- what -- maybe - - maybe I missed the point, but would you go back to justice Scalia's question: How is it that there is not a conflict here between this lease and the Rehab Act?",
  "But that, in effect -- but that, in effect, is saying this -- this provision will never apply to a mineral lease with the Navajo or the Hopi. I mean, you are reading it right out of the act with respect to these two tribes.",
  "With respect -- my point is with respect to every mineral lease of the Hopi and the Navajo, you are saying the term provision never applies. Am I correct - -",
  "But it only applies to those two tribes. And there is something very, very strange, it seems to me, in saying that the -- that the kind of -- the saving sentence at the end of section 5 reads its very term limit provisions out of every -- out of every possible application for mineral lease by these two tribes. And that's what you are saying.",
  "I realize that.",
  "Okay. But that, in effect, means that -- and I don't want to overdo your barber shop analysis or example, but that, in effect, says - -",
  "-- on -- on trivial lease contracts there are term limits, but on the ones that really count, where the real money is, doesn't apply at all.",
  "Let's assume that, and I -- I -- I think your argument is well taken. But assuming that, don't we also have to assume that the stress in IMLA on placing primary responsibility on the tribes, not on the Secretary should, in fact, also be imported to the application of the Rehab Act as you say it should be applied.",
  "What's not an authority?",
  "Okay. You made a good argument a few moments ago for the fact that it would have been at least at one time inappropriate to thrust that responsibility on the Navajo, but there was no Navajo exception in IMLA. That responsibility was thrust on the Navajo - -",
  "-- and this Court recognized that.",
  "But your -- your argument is that simply because there isn't that kind of an exclusion in (a), there must have been an intent to permit liability.",
  "And why didn't - -",
  "May I just supplement Justice Kennedy's question? Why can't the development of the mineral leases be regarded as an adjunct to a business enterprise?",
  "I mean business purposes. I - -",
  "Do the regs specifically address the scope of business purposes?",
  "Okay. But your whole argument that the -- that the juror was illegally sitting and the jury was illegally constituted is a - - in effect a statement of the effect of State law. And the State supreme court doesn't think that's the effect under State law. So it seems to me that the -- the full premise of your argument that there is something inherently unlawful about the seating of that juror is simply in -- in effect denied by the State supreme court. And we take our law from them.",
  "But you -- you in effect are saying that any violation of State law with respect, let's say, to criminal trial procedure becomes, if not remedied, a due process violation under Federal law. That's -- that's your -- your unstated premise, isn't it?",
  "That goes back to the point which you rejected when I suggested -- I suggested earlier that you were in effect arguing that every violation of a State statute in this criminal context amounted to a due process violation. And you say, no, that's not what I am arguing. It seems to me that that is exactly what you just said to Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Well, we were talking about peremptory challenges before and we are talking about peremptory challenges now. Have you changed your position from -- from the position you stated in answer to my question?",
  "Look, the question that I thought I was asking and I thought you were answering was this: Do you claim that every violation of State law in the -- we'll say in the selection of jurors -- is automatically, if not remedied by the State, a Federal due process violation? And you said, if I recall correctly, no. It seemed to me that in answering Justice Ginsburg's question just now you were saying yes. You said the State has to act consistently with due process.",
  "So -- so, do you stand by the answer you gave me or is it, in fact, now your position that every violation of state law that goes unremedied becomes a federal due process violation?",
  "All right. Then why does this one become a due process violation if it's unremedied.",
  "No, but that -- that then goes back to an earlier question. It's an unlawful adjudicator if state law says so. Federal law says you don't even have to have peremptory challenges, you don't even have to have a process for winnowing out the Gomez jurors. So, in effect, if you are saying that there is something unlawful about the seating of the juror, you are making a statement of State law, and the State Supreme Court disagrees with you, which seems to me to foreclose your argument.",
  "No, but the court -- the Supreme Court of Illinois did not find anything unlawful about the juror sitting. They said, yeah, the perempt should have -- the peremptory challenge should have been respected. But they did not say, and it seems to me they clearly rejected the notion, that there was something unlawful about the jury and unlawful about that juror's participating in reaching a verdict; isn't that correct?",
  "No, no. The -- the peremptory challenge should have been respected. But the Illinois Supreme Court did not say, as I understand it, that by allowing the juror to sit the juror was acting in an unlawful capacity, or that there was something unlawful under State law about the jury's actions and the jury's verdict. Am I not correct about that?",
  "Well, if they thought that tainted everything that happened afterwards, it seems to me they would have said, therefore, the verdict is no good.",
  "Yes, but it had everything to do, it seems to me, with the issue of State law. Regardless of whether they applied or misapplied a precedent of ours respect -- with respect to Federal constitutional law, it seems to me that the Illinois Supreme Court has to have meant it was okay so far as the validity of the verdict was concerned for this person to participate.",
  "So ultimately, there was - - there was no error under State law that needed to be corrected?",
  "But so far as the ultimate jury verdict was concerned, the Illinois Supreme Court, I understand it to have said, was there is no error that needs to be corrected under State law.",
  "Then why didn't they correct it?",
  "You read -- in other words, you read the -- the -- the Illinois Supreme Court as to say, this is a violation of our statutes and constitution, a violation that would -- would entitle this person to have the -- the verdict set aside and a new trial, but because the Federal practice, applying Federal constitutional law, is to engage in harmless error analysis, we won't correct our State law error as a matter of State law, and -- and we will in fact apply a harmless error analysis that otherwise wouldn't apply because it's Federal, and on that ground we will let the verdict stand. Is that the way you read the Illinois Supreme Court?",
  "Yes, well, that's what Batson says has to be done to in order justify the strike. When -- but is there any reason why a State couldn't go further to guard against discrimination in the use of peremptories?",
  "Okay. But no matter -- no matter what adjective or what verb you use, that's overruling a very clear rule of Thermtron. And we normally operate on a theory that when a conventional statute is construed by this Court, it stays construed until Congress changes it. And I don't -- I don't see how you can follow the line of reasoning that you're proposing, even though you talk about updating and harmonizing, without violating that basic stare decisis rule.",
  "We did -- we did not disavow the relationship between (c) and (d).",
  "You -- you think that choosing not to hear is distinguishable from a decision that it is inappropriate to hear?",
  "But even -- even on your analysis it seems to me that the -- the cart is before the horse, because it is -- it is not remanding because it does not have jurisdiction. What you are saying is that after it remands, it loses jurisdiction, and those are two very distinct categories. The -- the premise for the declaration that it does not have jurisdiction is a premise that even on your argument does not arise until a following agreement. So there's no way you can fit it, it seems to me, into the category of -- of remanding because at the point of deciding to remand it has no jurisdiction. That, in fact, is false.",
  "What if Shell went out of business and it had some stuff left in the tanks? At that point, they might very well hire somebody to do exactly what you're saying.",
  "That would be an eccentric situation, but it could happen.",
  "But I thought your definition of -- of disposal implied the disposition of something whose use had, in effect, been exhausted, so that I would have thought your answer to Justice Alito's question would have been different because even in the case in which they hired a sloppy delivery, they're not getting rid or the deliverer is not necessarily getting rid of a product whose use has been exhausted.",
  "But why do we -- I mean, do we have control? Shell says to its buyer, see that the delivery is made in the following way, so it doesn't spill all over the place. If Shell did control, it wouldn't have to say that to the buyer. In effect it could either order the buyer, as a condition of receipt of the product, or it could require that as part of the -- its terms with the - with the deliverer. It seems to me that the way Shell has set it up indicates that control has passed to somebody else at the time that the spigot starts going in the tank.",
  "He says, we won't sell you to unless you -- you -- you have these tanks, correct?",
  "Okay, so what is your -- no question, those are -- those are terms of their willingness to deal. But what is your basis for saying that when the truck pulls up and they -- the hose is turned on to deliver, that at that point Shell is controlling the process?",
  "So you don't -- but maybe you do claim, I'm not sure -- that Shell actually could, in effect get damages from its deliverer as a result of the -- the deliverer's incidental spillage. Is that your position?",
  "That is, that the spillage is a breach of the contract between the transporter and Shell?",
  "But do you have any basis for saying that if it had pursued that course of action, Shell would have succeeded?",
  "Then why is Shell in control?",
  "Well, yes, but you're saying that the delivery company would have had a defense, but you are -- are saying that Shell would have had at least a theoretical right under its actual contract with the deliverer to assert the -- the control over the manner of delivery that would have prevented the spill; is that what you're saying?",
  "That's the only way they could do it if the buyer did have bulk storage, isn't that correct?",
  "Okay.",
  "Mr. Stewart, could I go back to a -- we have been arguing about details. Can I go back to the -- to the broader question? What is your best response to the argument that Ms. Sullivan makes that \"arrange for disposal\" implies something significantly different from \"arrange for transfer,\" \"arrange for release,\" \"arrange for delivery\" -- that the -- that the combination of arrangement as an intentional act and disposal, as opposed to one of these -- these other processes, implies that the, in effect, the use of the product intended has become exhausted and that one in getting rid of waste as distinct from merely wasting something. What is -- what is your best answer to that?",
  "But if we're not arguing about that, what you are arguing about, then, is the - - is the implication of disposal, as opposed to a more neutral term like transfer or delivery or what-not. What's your answer to that?",
  "Oh, but those are certainly ways in which disposal can occur, as I -- I think came out in the argument. If the -- if Waste Management spills things along the highway on the way to the dump, it may be leakage, but a disposal is going on because in fact it is a way of getting rid of something that no longer has any use. So I -- I can -- I don't think the -- the inclusion of leakage within the definition answers the question whether disposal is something different from transfer.",
  "Well you have discharged, but you -- the question is whether it's disposal.",
  "\"Discharge\" is a more neutral term.",
  "No, but I mean, that - - that -- that begs the question. Because in the course of disposing, in the sense that she argues for, there can be leakage.",
  "The question is disposal versus transfer or some more neutral term.",
  "When?",
  "Yes, but you -- in that case, you have knowledge but you don't have control because you're using a common carrier.",
  "Then you mean simply control over your own choice process?",
  "Not control over the behavior of your hauler?",
  "General, the difficulty I have is that not only do they not say, so the Supreme Court of Hawaii didn't say so either. And it seems to me that we would be well advised to make sure that we understand the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Hawaii before we start talking about the relationship between the various Federal statutes and whatever this claim may be. I simply don't understand the claim myself. I do understand your point, because I think this much is clear from the Hawaiian opinion: That they think the Apology Resolution seriously affects the claim. That we can deal with, but once we get out of that, the -- the whole case seems murky to me. Am I missing something?",
  "But that's not what the Hawaiian Supreme Court said. I am reading from page 98a of the petition appendix, the concluding portion of the opinion. \"We hold, number one, that the Apology Resolution and related state legislation give rise to the state's fiduciary duty.\" The only Federal statute mentioned is the Apology Resolution, and the rest of their reasoning seems to rest upon some kind of State equity law or trust law. Now, that trust law may ultimately be inconsistent with prior Federal acts, but the only - - the only thing they are disclosing right now is -- aside from the Apology Resolution, seems to be State trust law.",
  "But trust law is based on somebody's property rights. We don't know whether they are talking about legal rights or equitable rights, and that's consistent with the statement I just read to you.",
  "But, General, I think - - with respect, I still don't know what the position of the Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to be if this Court rules that the Apology Resolution does not support the proposition that you just read. I don't know whether at that point the Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to say, okay, all we have got left to deal with now is State trust law, or whether they've got to pull another rabbit out of the hat and say, but there is -- there is some kind of -- of prior -- there is some kind of a -- a claim against which prior Federal law could not prevail. I don't know. And I -- that's -- that's why it seems to me, to -- to say the least, imprudent to wade into it at this point. The one thing we know that seems to have been significant to their decision is the Apology Resolution. And I think we would be wise to stick to that.",
  "But that doesn't seem to be what the Supreme Court of Hawaii has done. The Supreme Court of Hawaii, in effect, has said the land is tied up until these people who are currently negotiating, the State, the Native Hawaiians and -- what is it, the United Church of Christ, all come to a -- in effect, a resolution and a reconciliation. Whatever that means, it does not sound to me as though it is the recognition of a legal title claim or indeed the validity so far as courts are concerned with validity of any claim the Native Hawaiians are making. They are just saying, no more land transfers until these people sit down and make up their differences. Isn't that all the court is saying at this point?",
  "Isn't the fact that you and I are having this exchange a pretty good indication that we don't know what they meant exactly by that? The only thing we can be sure of is that that thought the Apology Resolution had some legal significance. They said, you know, it's required after the Apology Resolution. We can say you are right or you are wrong, and I think we know what -- what we are talking about. But to go beyond that, it seems to me, that we are wading into an argument that you and I can't settle here.",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, on page 99, the State supreme court is saying, inasmuch as the Apology Resolution and related State legislation give rise to a fiduciary duty. They are saying the Apology Resolution did so, too, not only State law.",
  "If the name said Anthony Kennedy, would that go to the jury?",
  "Does it -- does it even come close to supporting it? I mean, let's start out with your analogous position. Your analogous position is that the \"knowingly\" simply refers to the -- the - - the three acts which are specified by which the identification can be -- can be -- the misidentification can be perpetrated. Transfers, possesses or uses. Could Congress possibly have said, gee, he might not know that he was acting to transfer or to possess or to use. That is not the serious possibility. So, \"knowingly\" has to refer to something more than the three possible acts. And once you get beyond the three possible acts, and you say, well, we are going to draw the line between \"without authority\" and \"another person,\" that seems like an arbitrary line. And the arbitrariness of the line seems even more obvious when the \"without a lawful authority\" is set off as a parenthetical. And the real logic of the statute -- the real -- the operative description is \"a means of identification of another person.\" That's why, it seems to me, if you look at the text, you could say, well, of course, the \"knowingly\" has got to refer to the everything that follows, both lawful authority and another person. And that's why, it seems to me, if you are going to win, you have got to win on the grounds that Congress wouldn't have meant what seems so natural, because Congress wanted to help victims not defendants. Where am I going wrong there, if I'm going wrong?",
  "Is it worth two years?",
  "The only thing that we know for sure that is that Congress said it is not worth two years extra unless that of another person was involved. And if that is so significant or necessarily significant in getting a two-year add-on, then it seems reasonable, I suppose, that Congress -- the state of mind -- that.",
  "All Congress has got to do is to say \"recklessly.\"",
  "It's an -- it's an accepted term. Every -- well, almost everybody knows what -- is a model Penal Code standard, and so on. All they have to do is put the word \"recklessly\" in there. It would cover every \"knowingly\" case. It wouldn't omit anything that is covered by this, and it would solve precisely that problem. And they didn't do it.",
  "Well, I tell you what cuts one way or another. I -- I find it -- I find it, well, not surprising because I have heard -- I have heard the government do it before. You acknowledge that this is an ambiguous statute. That -- that on its face it -- it could mean the one thing or the other. I would normally conclude from that that we apply the Rule of Lenity. Since it could go either way, let's assume that the defendant gets the -- the tie goes to the defendant. What -- why shouldn't I resolve it that way?",
  "Well, he's -- he's not at this point. All he's doing is seeking evidence. We don't know -- he doesn't know presumably -- exactly what that evidence is going to show. The evidence may prove to be exonerating and it may not be. Until one knows the tendency of the evidence, one can't say that we have a Preiser problem. So if -- if we don't have that kind of a problem, then I don't see -- I guess I don't follow your argument that this necessarily sounds in habeas.",
  "Right. And if he was seeking damages in this 1983 action for false imprisonment or imprisonment under an invalid conviction, I would understand your argument. But what he is saying in effect is: I want process to know what this evidence has to say. And that is not seeking damages, and it's not seeking release.",
  "No. The difference -- the difference is that if he succeeds in this case in getting access to the evidence, that doesn't get him outside or even in position to go outside the prison door. All it does is get him some evidence to test. And what he does with that later, if he finds it favorable, presumably is necessarily going to be in habeas.",
  "Well, he's got to because he doesn't know whether he has any evidence of actual innocence at this point.",
  "He's not asserting it. He just says: I want to get to this evidence and see what it has to say.",
  "No.",
  "He has a singular objective in getting the evidence, but we don't know what the evidence means. The evidence may conclusively prove that he is guilty, for all we know.",
  "Well, it's a -- that's - - that's a fair way of putting it, but what he -- I think ultimately his strongest argument or his -- his basic argument is this evidence is potentially so important that the State has no valid interest in keeping me at least from seeing it; i.e., testing it. And you can call that discovery if you want to, but it's something very different from the normal discovery that goes on as an ancillary process to a criminal prosecution.",
  "Oh, that may be. I'm not getting into that here.",
  "I don't know that they're arguing with you on that score. What they are saying -- I think what they're saying, and this goes to a variety of Justice Scalia's question, is that under the Alaska statute in order to get to the evidence, or indeed in order to make his -- his postconviction claim, he's got to claim that the evidence of material fact requires vacation of the conviction or sentence. His argument is, I don't know whether it requires it; because I haven't been able to test it. What I want is to test it. And as I understand it, under this particular statute, he has no chance of doing so because he can't tell you in advance what the test is going to show. Isn't that correct?",
  "Well, first tell me whether that's correct or not. He doesn't know what the test is going to -- he doesn't know what the test is going to show; so - -",
  "-- he cannot say that it requires vacation of the conviction; isn't that correct?",
  "Okay.",
  "But Mr. Osborne doesn't know what that evidence is going to show. He hasn't tested it.",
  "Whether -- whether he believes he's innocent or whether he doesn't believe he's innocent, he can walk into court, as I understand it, and say, I am absolutely innocent. But what he cannot do prior to testing the evidence is tell you, is allege, that the evidence is going to require the vacation of the conviction.",
  "Mr. Katyal, the -- the right that they're asserting may be located not in procedural, but in substantive due process. What I - - what I would like you to comment on is what the government's or any government's interest, the United States or that of a State, may be in, in effect, in denying that there should be such a right. And this question occurred to me when I was going through the briefs: What if -- we'll make this Federal for your sake -- what if the United States had imprisoned an individual who came forward and said: Nobody realized it, but I was an eyewitness to the crime for which X is -- is -- has been convicted and is currently being incarcerated; and, in fact, I saw that crime committed and he did not commit it. X's lawyer arrives at this individual's prison and says: I want to talk to the guy. Would the United States have an interest in saying, you cannot talk to him?",
  "Well, you know, prisoners say all sorts of things. We don't know whether in the long run it is going to be exculpatory or whether this guy has some axe to grind. But the question is, would the United States have any legitimate interest in saying to X's lawyer, you can't even talk with him?",
  "Why wouldn't it?",
  "Why do you need a rule, I guess is what I'm saying.",
  "Oh, okay - -",
  "Are you starting with the premise that the United States would not have a legitimate interest in my hypothetical in saying, you can't even talk to him?",
  "Well, let's assume that if you let this guy talk to -- X's lawyer talk to this guy, other individuals may say, boy, I can have my moment in the sun, too; I'm going to claim this. You know, let's assume the worst case there. Would you still say, would the government still say, we have an interest for that reason in not even letting him talk to him?",
  "I haven't gotten to the constitutional law yet. I just -- I just want to know whether there would be a legitimate interest in saying no. I mean, you can see - -",
  "Is the irrationality ultimately that they require an assertion, with some basis for the assertion, that in fact there is evidence that would show innocence? Is the irrationality the cart before the horse?",
  "You -- you were asked a question earlier what it was in effect about the Alaska procedure which -- which in effect was constitutionally frustrating. I understood that you did not claim that the requirement to claim innocence was the problem, although they did require that; but that the -- that the real problem was that you not only had to claim innocence; you had to be in a position to claim that the evidence you were seeking would exonerate you. And in the DNA case you couldn't do that, ultimately, until it had been testing. And so it was that second point, in effect that they are putting the cart before the horse, tell us what the test is going to show before you test it, that I thought was the sticking point for you. Am I correct about your position?",
  "Well, that goes -- that goes to the first point.",
  "And I -- I was concerned with the second. I will be happy to get back to the first, but I just want to know your position on the second, the cart before the horse point.",
  "Why shouldn't - -",
  "Whether 1983 requires it depends in part on whether we recognize a free-standing right to test DNA evidence. As I -- as I conceive it, that sounds to me like substantive due process and rightly so. One condition for recognizing a substantive due process right could be that the individual claiming the right to test claims that he is actually innocent. What would unreasonable about that?",
  "Is your client prepared to make that claim?",
  "I'm not asking you. I'm asking for his position through counsel now. Do you know?",
  "-- that defense - -",
  "If he walks into court and swears, \"I am innocent,\" subject to penalties of perjury, \"Please let me look at the DNA,\" as I understand your answer, your answer will be, we will then raise issues of procedural default, waiver, et cetera. You will not say, on the contrary, \"let him look at the DNA.\" Is that -- is my understanding correct?",
  "In any - -",
  "I -- I don't see that the -- that the section 3 stay follows from that. It may very well be that in whatever ultimate forum the case is thrashed out in that the -- that the nonsignatories will be able to enforce the arbitration agreement. The question here is whether they can get a stay in midstream in order to litigate that as a separate issue. And one argument for saying that they should not, that the stay right should be limited to signatories, is that the policy of the -- the Federal Arbitration Act is to enforce arbitration agreements. It is not a policy simply to promote arbitration under all possible circumstances. It is a policy to enforce contracts because the contracts, in effect, were being given short shrift before the act was passed. If the policy is one to enforce contracts and, as Justice Ginsburg said, they had a chance to make an arbitration agreement and they didn't do it, then that is a good reason to say the Federal courts will not stay the proceedings in midstream for somebody who didn't get the agreement that that person could have gotten. What is your answer to that argument?",
  "Including -- and -- and you're saying that that covers, in effect, even a point of Federal procedure as to whether you get, in practical terms, an interlocutory appeal. That's a question of State law?",
  "And the question here is: What is the procedure to be followed in a Federal court when there is disagreement about that? And to say that that is a question of State law strikes me as a stretch.",
  "May -- may I ask you this? Let's assume State law said we -- we don't recognize stays at this stage of the game. Therefore, we will not give a stay to anyone. Would State law prevail?",
  "But isn't that the problem? That's what I'm getting at. Isn't that the problem for you in this case? Because you keep arguing that their substantive rights under the agreement are issues of State law, but the question before us is not one of ultimate substantive right. At some point there will be an -- an appellate process open to them and they can assert those substantive rights if they didn't get them at trial. The issue here is not substantive right. The issue here is a procedural right, and it's a procedural right which depends upon the terms of the Federal statute, and that's why it seems to me that it may very well be that the Federal statute determines not only the procedural right, the stay, but who may ask for it, that being a sensible Federal question rather than a State question.",
  "And your argument depends upon, as Justice Scalia pointed out a moment ago, reading section 2 as in effect incorporating State law for purposes of determining substantive rights.",
  "Okay, but that still begs the question whether the -- whether the incorporation of State law to determine substantive rights controls the question of what law determines procedural rights, when a Federal procedural right is claimed, which is what is involved here.",
  "And regardless of State law the answer to the Federal question is independent of it.",
  "Then I'm -- I'm missing the logic of your argument.",
  "But they are Federal procedural devices and State law could not contradict them. That's -- that's what we got into when I said what if State law said there could be no stay? You agree at that point that of course the Federal law would prevail?",
  "It would apply to what the judge is supposed to do at that moment when somebody says, I want a stay. And the judge at that point consults Federal law, not State law, doesn't he?",
  "Well, just stick to my question. He says: I want a stay. Does the judge look to State law or Federal law?",
  "Okay. And what is the criterion for identifying a section 3 stay?",
  "And your -- and your position is that the statute should be so construed that only a signatory to the written agreement has a right to the stay, indeed has a right to request the stay under article 3?",
  "What is your reason for saying that?",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. Why shouldn't the Federal law be even simpler than that? And I -- I proposed one, and -- and probably because I don't understand the law well enough, it may -- may have been simply simplistic. But my suggestion was the -- the issue before us should be construed narrowly as being the question of who can ask for a stay. And the answer to that would be only a person -- or one possible answer to that would be only a person who has signed the arbitration agreement, because the Federal policy is to enforce agreements, not force arbitration. And, therefore, it is sensible as a matter of Federal policy to say, we're not going to stop this trial in mid-track for arbitration unless you who are asking for it to be stopped signed an arbitration agreement yourself, and it's that agreement that you're trying to enforce. Now, that is maybe a -- a too simplistic approach, but tell me what's good or bad about that.",
  "Okay. That opens the door to my simplistic theory. Now - -",
  "-- is it a good theory or a bad theory?",
  "Okay. But it seems to me that that's not enough, because \"under the written agreement\" leaves open the question of whether the written agreement can be enforced right here and now by getting a stay only by somebody who signed it or by a third party beneficiary or -- or somebody dependent on the contract plus some other legal theory. My simplistic suggestion was: Keep it simple and simply say the -- \"under the agreement\" means an agreement signed by you, and the reason we confine it to an agreement signed by you is not because the phrase \"under this agreement\" tells us that. It doesn't. That leaves the question open. We say it is going to be confined to an agreement signed by you because that's really the -- the nub of the Federal policy. We want to enforce agreements, and we want to confine this extraordinary remedy of a stay to people who went to enough trouble to make -- and I don't know whether that's a good idea or not. And -- I mean it's favorable to you, so it's in your interest to say it's a good idea, but I may be getting into trouble by that. And that's what I want you to tell me.",
  "All right. Mr. Olson, the very fact that they do raises what I think is one of the difficult issues in this case, and it's raised by - - specifically by the -- the brief of the nine States, Alabama and so on. And -- and I would put it this way. It's not exactly the way that brief did, but I see the problem that you are -- that you are addressing as -- as not only a procedural, but certainly to a degree a substantive due process kind of problem. One of the factors that goes into the recognition of at least a substantive limitation when there has been none before is -- is the issue of timing. Is the political process in fact working now toward a solution? Because if it is, that kind of ethos of total unreasonability is -- is still being worked out, and - - and the courts ought to stay their hands. So my question is, what do you say to the argument that there is a political process going on addressing this issue? And I forget the details, but my recollection is that it may well have been that brief pointed out that the State of West Virginia itself has enacted some legislation since these events began to transpire. So the nut of the question is, is the political process in process and is that a good reason for us to stay our hand in recognizing a new procedural or substantive due process right at this point?",
  "Oh, I think we all recognize that. Is there -- is there a counter-political process going on?",
  "What happened in West Virginia?",
  "Is my recollection correct that West Virginia has, in fact, enacted some kind of limiting legislation?",
  "Well, it may not be per se unconstitutional, but it is certainly one contributing factor, it seems to me, to the argument that the system that we have depended on up to this point is not working very well.",
  "Well, I -- as I understand it, although you never directly, I don't think you ever directly answered it, I -- I understood you to imply in response to Justice Stevens that there would be no appearance problem that would ever justify a constitutional standard.",
  "And in fact - -",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Yes. And we have -- and we have an appearance standard under the ABA Canons, but I think it would be difficult to make a very convincing argument that that standard was effective in this case.",
  "Well, it's -- it's the matter of opinion that brings the case before us. And would you agree -- I am not -- I am not asking you to agree that the ABA standard was violated. That's not what you're here for. But would you agree that the ABA standard is certainly implicated by the facts of this case, whatever the ultimate recusal decision should have been?",
  "But - -",
  "Mr. Frey, you've tried a couple of times to -- to get to your -- your point that, even if we assume probability of bias is the standard, the debt of gratitude would not qualify. I'll be candid with -- to say that I don't see why probability of bias is necessarily an inappropriate constitutional standard, whether we should adopt it or not. But would you give your argument on why the debt of gratitude could not qualify?",
  "Because that may illustrate the point.",
  "Well, but I don't know what common law -- how much help common law is. Common law didn't have elected judges.",
  "Common law did not have this contribution system, which your colleague referred to as spiraling out of control.",
  "I don't take it as the principle, but I take it as an application of the principle. And I thought if you get to responding to the application, I may understand your position better on the principle.",
  "How long has Massey been in business, eight years?",
  "I mean - -",
  "If one is going to go into that calculation, one is going to assume that in eight years, there's going to be another three million dollars waiting to be spent.",
  "Well, one has hopes.",
  "One has hopes.",
  "Well, you say that and I say that because we took corporate law. But in -- in terms of my brother a moment ago spoke of we've been around Washington for a while, and I don't think that fine distinction counts very much on the issue that we've got.",
  "We'll have to see when the next election comes along. An expectation has been created that if there is an interest, the money will be spent, and it seems to me that underlies Justice Breyer's analysis just as it does mine.",
  "They all have not had the 3 million.",
  "No, but with respect, Justice Breyer disassociated his question from debt of gratitude. I understand you -- you are arguing against a debt of gratitude theory, but if I recall his question, it was not based upon the debt of gratitude theory.",
  "I think we know from this case they're likely to bring charges.",
  "No, but there's -- there's a difference here, and that is, as these cases illustrate, three phone calls for one trifling sale, two for another, this gives a kind of multiplier effect which it's -- it's hard to find a parallel for in the law. We go from a misdemeanor to 12 years, depending on the fact that there were -- there were a couple of cell phone calls. That is -- maybe -- maybe that is exactly what Congress intended, and maybe that's good law enforcement policy, but those are not sort of two intuitively obvious positions.",
  "Well, what about the question?",
  "He knows -- the difference, that -- he knows that he's committing a felony, and the possessor of a gram or less doesn't.",
  "Mr. Miller, in answer to one of Justice Breyer's earlier questions, he -- the premise of his question was the effect of the twin amendments from offense to felony and from felony to misdemeanor for possession of small quantities. And he said, well, in effect, is that combination of amendments really being rendered nugatory by the view that you take of the statute? And you said not necessarily, and you said there may be some drug transactions in which it is a misdemeanor on both sides, so that the statute would apply there. Are there any other -- are there many examples of that? I thought not. And are there any other examples of misdemeanor-misdemeanor cases that the -- that the statute would apply to so that -- so that the anomaly wouldn't be quite so obvious?",
  "Yes.",
  "In other words, how important is this? It looks to us -- I mean, I think it was the premise of the question and it was -- it was my assumption coming in that your view of the statute largely renders those two amendments, or the combined effect of those two amendments, virtually nugatory. And you said, well, not necessarily because there may be misdemeanor cases. And I want to know how many of them there are. Is that really a significant area for the application or nonapplication of this statute?",
  "How many separate -- how many misdemeanor-misdemeanor combined offenses are there under the -- under the code?",
  "You -- you don't have any figures on the number of actual prosecutions under - - under the -- in the misdemeanor-misdemeanor combination cases?",
  "So -- well, then, I guess that leads to my last question, and that is: Isn't it probably true that if we accept your view of the statute, then the effect of those two combined amendments, offense to -- to felony, felony to misdemeanor for small quantities, the -- the combined effect of -- of those two statutes is, in effect, rendered worthless in -- in most cases? In a substantial number of cases to which the -- the communication facility statute would be applied, it - - it would render those -- those two amendments, in effect, worthless?",
  "That may be a legitimate inquiry, but what about my irrelevant inquiry?",
  "It's going to -- your - - your view of the statute is going to render those two amendments virtually dead letters?",
  "As you said, you -- you don't have figures on the number of prosecutions. And the number of prosecutions under those misdemeanors, as distinct from the number of applications of the communications statute to conventional buyer/seller transactions is probably the difference between a very small set and a very large set of cases. And in the very large set of cases the two amendments are being rendered, in effect, worthless; isn't that true?",
  "Well, it runs into the problem, which is also a different problem for you, and that is the brandishing must be for the purposes -- for the purpose of intimidating.",
  "So that's probably going to eliminate the case in which the officer grabs the felon's gun. So the problem that it seems to me that it creates for you is that \"brandish\" is specifically defined to have that particular intentional element. There is, however, no definition of -- of the -- of the term in question here, which suggests that they did not have any discharge -- that they did not have any - - any -- any intent to impose an intent requirement. When they do it, they know how to do it. In this case they didn't do it.",
  "Why is it improper? I mean, it may not be conclusive, but it seems to me evidence that points in that direction.",
  "We have -- we have lots of cases in which it makes sense to disregard that presumption, and -- and nobody thinks twice about it, I mean, accomplice liability being an example. There are -- there are -- there are lots of State crimes in which it is dispensed with, reckless driving, death resulting. And in all of those cases what in effect the rationale is that the -- that the individual who is being charged has created a risk, no one can control that risk, including himself. But he bears the responsibility for, if you will, bad luck if the risk is realized. And that is the rationale for - - for holding him liable for discharge here without any particular knowing or -- or intentional act in making the discharge. So why doesn't that make sense and why is that not an answer to the usual presumption that there will be a specific state of mind required?",
  "Why? Why?",
  "Mr. Buffone, may I raise one preliminary issue? And it's an issue which is - - does not go to the reason we took the case, but I'd like your response to it. Your argument, your Ashe v. Swenson argument, assumes, as you have said in the brief, that the -- that the verdicts of acquittal essentially determined that your client did not possess insider knowledge, and I question whether the verdicts of acquittal did necessarily establish that fact. I've looked at the -- at the jury instructions, and I will be candid to say I did not parse the whole jury instruction, so you may very well correct me in the assumption that I'm going to make. But the point of the -- of the jury instruction that seemed to go to your argument is set out on page 105 of the Joint Appendix, and the judge is telling the jurists what they had to find. And one of them was that your client made any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as charged. It seems to me that the jury under that instruction could have come back with a verdict of acquittal simply on the assumption that your client had not made affirmative statements at the -- at the meeting in question, therefore he had no obligation to correct any statements, because it is not clear from this instruction that he had to correction the statements of other people who omitted material facts, and that therefore the only thing that the verdict proves or the only thing that the verdict may have assumed is that he didn't speak up and say anything. Is that a possible analysis?",
  "No, no, I agree that did seem to be the point of the cross-examination, and in fact I guess you set it out in one of the briefs. But is that enough? To my knowledge, we've never held that that is enough to convert or, let's say, to -- for us to assume, despite a more protean jury instruction, that the jury necessarily had to find a fact. And I guess maybe my question boils down to is: Why should what perhaps consumed 60 or 80 seconds of cross-examination suffice to tighten up a jury instruction which -- which basically is open-ended?",
  "Mr. Buffone, you're - - you're going through a logical analysis. If I understand your position, the logical analysis is not going to win the case for you because, as I understand the case that we've got in front of us, we have in effect two lines of authority, two models, that describe what the law might be in these circumstances. One model, on -- on the assumption that -- that the acquittals determined what you say they did, on that model there -- there is -- there is an issue preclusion that is raised. On the second model, the model of what we do in the case of a hung jury, there is no -- of course, no preclusion, and there is no bar to a retrial. And we've simply got both in the same case. The question is: Which model do we follow? Do we say preclusion is the most important issue here, or do we say the open-endedness and uncertainty of the hung jury, the - - the failure to reach a verdict, is the model that - - that tells us what we ought to do? How do we choose between those two possibilities, each of which is open to us?",
  "Look, I know that, and - - and by the same token, hung juries have long been recognized as raising no bar to a further trial. And the question is: Why are the values in the -- the acquittal case predominating, as you say they are, over the values of the retrial possibilities? Why do I choose one rather than another?",
  "We have got both.",
  "What -- what is it -- and I would almost suggest THAT it has to be something outside the lines of authority, because the issue here is which line of authority are you going to pick. What is it outside the lines of authority that says we should -- we should pick the acquittal model rather than the hung jury model to determine what to do here?",
  "But -- isn't -- isn't the real problem that you raised by your answer the following problem: That in this age in which there are, as Justice Breyer's hypo suggests, lots of overlapping criminal statutes -- you can indict not only for drugs but for telephones, and I don't know what other overlapping crimes there -- there may be. Therefore, that gives the government by joining a lot of overlapping charges or lots of charges with common elements in either one indictment through various counts or simply by a series of indictments to be tried together -- it gives the government a bigger chance of getting a hung jury or some irrational resolution on some of those issues. And if the government can bring loads of counts, increase the likelihood of getting a hung jury on one issue or one indictment, the government in effect has a key to avoiding just what Justice Breyer's hypothetical suggested. If they wait and bring the second count in June, there's an issue preclusion. But if they bring it together, they've got an irrational verdict and there's no issue preclusion. Therefore, isn't the policy behind both double jeopardy and the issue preclusion extension a policy that argues in favor of saying don't let the government have all these bites at the apple, because in fact it results or can result in seriatim prosecutions? What's -- what's your response to that argument?",
  "But does the -- does the government ask for something more than one fair chance when it comes in with 117 counts? Maybe the fair chance consists of a fair chance with a number of counts or a number of indictments that one can reasonably expect a -- a jury to handle without either getting totally confused or totally exhausted.",
  "That's right, I'm making an argument that he did not make.",
  "Mr. Olson, if the film were distributed by General Motors, would your argument be the same?",
  "But the -- the point, then, of similarity is you would, whether it was offered by General Motors or offered by -- by this Petitioner, in effect call for some qualification of the -- the general rule allowing limitations on corporate political activity of the speech variety?",
  "So how would we draw the line?",
  "Well, would every -- in effect, every limitation on corporate speech or on corporate expenditure and the nature of speech be subject, then, to in effect this all-factor balancing test?",
  "So -- so your -- your argument then is there's something distinct about the speech, which could be considered regardless of the corporate form?",
  "If that is the case, what is -- what is the answer to this? That -- that still is going to involve a -- a fairly complicated set of analyses, probably in a lot of cases. Why is that necessary or worthwhile to preserve First Amendment values when you could have done this with a PAC?",
  "That's right. You've got reporting. You've got limitations on -- on corporate contributions and so on, but in this case, for example, most of your contributions, as I understand from the record, were individual. They weren't corporate. There was one perhaps. There was some corporate contributions - -",
  "Okay.",
  "-- how many boxes we have? Doesn't this one fall into campaign advocacy? I mean I've got the government's brief open at -- open at pages 18 and 19 with the quotations: She will lie about anything. She is deceitful. She is ruthless, cunning, dishonest, do anything for power, will speak dishonestly, reckless, a congenital liar, sorely lacking in qualifications, not qualified as commander in chief. I mean, this sounds to me like campaign advocacy.",
  "But it -- it seems to me, the answer to Justice Breyer's question: This is a don't vote for Jones.",
  "As you -- as you've said yourself, as you pointed out, there -- there is a point at which there is no nonporous border between issue discussion and candidate discussion. But I think the - - the problem that -- that Justice Ginsburg is having, I'm having, and others is that it does not seem to me that with the quotations we're dealing with here, as Justice Breyer said, it's not a musical comedy. I think we - - we have no choice, really, but to say this is not issue advocacy; this is express advocacy saying don't vote for this person. And if that is a fair characterization, the difference between 90 minutes and 1 minute, either for statutory purposes or constitutional purposes, is a distinction that I just cannot follow.",
  "You say that. Why - - what -- what is your basis for saying that Congress is -- is less concerned with 90 minutes of don't vote for Clinton than it was with 60 seconds of don't vote?",
  "They are the characteristic advertisement. There is no question about that. That is the paradigm case. I agree with you. But I don't see how you -- you then leap-frog from saying -- from saying that is the paradigm case to saying that this never covers anything but the paradigm case when the only distinction is time.",
  "To point out how far your argument would go, what if a labor union paid and offered to write a book advocating the election of A or the defeat of B? And after the manuscript was prepared, they then went to a commercial publisher, and they go to Random House. Random House said, yes, we will publish that. Can the distribution of that be in effect subject to the electioneering ban because of the initial labor union investment?",
  "Well, does it come within electioneering because of the initial subvention to the author?",
  "We're -- we're talking about how far the constitutional ban could go, and we're talking about books.",
  "And the book was then taken over as a commercial venture by Random House?",
  "No, but prohibition only comes when we get to the electioneering stage.",
  "Okay.",
  "So for the -- for the labor union simply to -- to hire -- is there -- is there an outright violation when the labor union -- I guess this is a statutory question: Is there an outright violation when the labor union comes up with the original subvention?",
  "Let's assume for the sake of argument that they would not be. The subvention is made, the manuscript is prepared, Random House then publishes it, and there is a distribution within the - - what is it -- the 60-day period. Is the -- is the original subvention (a) enough to bring it within the prohibition on the electioneering communication, and (b) is that constitutional?",
  "You're -- you're right. I stand corrected. If the statute covered that as well, if the statute covered the book as well.",
  "That would be enough to bring it in, and - -",
  "-- the Constitution?",
  "Well, the time -- I mean, the time may very well run in the civil system, and yet I take it that under -- you accept Morgan and in the Article III system this -- in comparable circumstances, this Petitioner could seek coram nobis.",
  "And I take it you also -- I don't think there's any dispute that the All Writs Act applies to the Article I court as well as to the Article III court. And I take it -- and I would like your response to this. I take it you accept the fact that in testimony before the House, at least, at the time the present system went into effect the general counsel for the Department of Defense, Mr. Taft, testified to a House committee that coram nobis would be available in the -- in the Article I courts. And if that is so, isn't the kind of the most reasonable way to construe the statute, including Article 76, as allowing for this?",
  "What was the occasion for it?",
  "What were they amending at the time?",
  "You're way ahead of me because I don't know what the '83 amendments would refer to. What was the subject matter?",
  "Now, with respect to the boards of correction, I take it there's nothing specifically in the statute that says there's coram nobis jurisdiction?",
  "Yes.",
  "Now, if he was right about that, that would undercut your argument that, with respect to a special court-martial and subsequent proceedings, there could be no coram nobis because there's no specific reference in the statute in either case?",
  "Oh, I quite agree. The premise of my -- sort of my argument to you a second ago was that if we accept the proposition that Mr. Taft was making a correct statement of law - -",
  "-- then the logic would in effect answer your argument that because there is no specific grant of coram nobis jurisdiction with respect to special court-martials and subsequent proceedings, there couldn't be any. That's the only point that I was trying to make.",
  "It is pretty limited. What is it, it's limited to fact and fraud.",
  "May I ask you just -- and I'm doing this from memory, so my premise of the question may be wrong. But I do recall the quotation of testimony in the brief, and I -- if I recall it correctly, the person testifying said that the 73 was sort of a combination of coram nobis and new -- and new trial motion practice. But my recollection was that there was no statement, or at least it wasn't quoted in the briefs, to the effect that this is all there is. Now, there was -- it was explaining what 73 did, but it was not an explanation to the effect that if you didn't get under the tent flap in 73 you were out completely. Am I correct about that?",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay, I see.",
  "I know, but that's - - that's a different -- that's a different issue from - - from whether it -- it may retain some residual jurisdiction to correct an error with respect to someone over whom it has had jurisdiction.",
  "Well, you -- you made that point before. And I -- I want to follow up with one question on that. As I recall, it was in response to the -- to the Morgan argument. The -- the Morgan analysis was, well, this isn't a -- a new ground or a new assertion. It is jurisdiction as would be the case in habeas. It, in effect, is -- is kind of a metaphysical continuation of the -- the jurisdiction that existed before. And your response to that was, in effect, a Goldsmith response. And -- and you said past jurisdiction doesn't mean present jurisdiction. The past jurisdiction is over, and that's under -- under the statute and under Goldsmith that's -- that's the end of it. Couldn't that same argument simply have been made, however, in -- in Morgan? In other words, Morgan was a case in which the point of finality had been reached. There was no specific statute in Morgan saying there's coram nobis jurisdiction, and yet the Court's analysis -- I -- I called it metaphysical a second ago -- was that this really was simply a continuation of the past jurisdiction. If that was a sound argument in Morgan, why isn't it a sound argument with respect to the -- the military code here?",
  "It -- it did do that, and there's -- there is no question that it certainly made finality provisions in Article 76. But in the civilian system, so far as express provision is concerned, there are limits. There are statutes of limitations, and it seems to me that the same argument could be made there that was made here - -",
  "-- that was made there.",
  "Outside of 1531, is there any structural difference?",
  "You could say the same thing, that when the statute of limitations is passed in a habeas case or, indeed, after habeas has been fallen, so far as the statutes governing Article III courts are concerned, that's the end. And yet Morgan says, no, it isn't the end. There's this coram nobis jurisdiction.",
  "Where are -- where are the procedures set out for -- for military habeas?",
  "Are you -- are you arguing then that if it has habeas power without a -- a textual basis, there's no reason to argue that it lacks coram nobis power because there's no textual basis?",
  "What has direct review got to do with habeas?",
  "In the civil system we regard it as -- as entirely a separate proceeding.",
  "Well, Mr. Ostrager, is - - help me out, because this is an issue of fact, and I don't have the record in front of me now. But didn't the 1986 order expressly include permission for certain actions alleging insurer misconduct to proceed, those that had already been filed?",
  "I drew the implication from that that the -- that the bankruptcy court thought its order would be barring such actions if they had not already been filed. Am I right on the -- on the -- at least on the record point?",
  "But he was saying that - - in effect, that was simply articulating rather more than he had done the first time around and what he intended the first time around.",
  "How did they get the notice? You say it's broad notice. What exactly was done?",
  "What do you -- what do you make of the provision of the 1986 order to the effect that, as I understand it and as I asked your brother a moment ago, existing claims based upon misbehavior of the -- of the insurance company were not cut off? The reasonable implication, I think, of that is that any future claims based upon insurance company misconduct would be cut off by the terms of the '86 order. What -- what do you say about that implication?",
  "Yes, but it was prospective liability based upon misconduct of the insurance company, not merely derivative of -- of its insurance contract in -- in the conventional sense.",
  "Okay. If that is -- if that is the case -- let's assume that that is -- that it was that narrow. The fact remains, however, that at this point, as Justice Kennedy has suggested several times, my understanding is at least that you cannot collaterally attack the jurisdiction of the court who entered the order it did. And the only claim that you can make now is that the order by its terms did not cover your cases. Do you agree?",
  "So it's a question of the scope of the order?",
  "Okay.",
  "I didn't mean to cut you off. I'm sorry.",
  "May I then raise a question there? I mean, I think there is a legitimate question about that, given the -- given the rather general terms of the -- of the scope of the order. And I would like your response to this. It seems to me as a background consideration that we should have in mind in interpreting how broad that order was. It's been raised a couple times; Justice Breyer raised it a moment ago. And it's this: It is one argument to say that the bankruptcy court does not have jurisdiction, and derivatively an order that it issued should not be interpreted to cover, any claim that does not affect or cannot deplete the bankruptcy estate taken as a given fact at the time this later case is brought. Another view of jurisdiction would be that the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction and hence an order might be interpreted to cover any cases which, if contemplated, would have precluded the settlement that created the bankruptcy estate. If Travelers had thought that it was going to be liable for these cases of insurer misconduct, it might very well have said: We're not forking over X hundred millions of dollars, leaving this exposure open. So that the bankruptcy estate would never have attained the size that it attained if the - - if the insurer and everybody else had not understood that these later claims would be -- were being cut off. Is that argument a relevant -- number one, is that a legitimate jurisdictional argument? And number two, is it a relevant argument that we should bear in mind -- in trying to figure out how broad the '86 order really was?",
  "Everybody accepts at that much.",
  "But isn't it the case, to make sure I understand it, the Wise complaints are the -- are the exception. They are the only complaints, as I understand it in this current round of litigation, that claims that the actual harm to them resulted from actions other than actions of Manville. Is that correct?",
  "No, I understand -- or maybe I don't -- maybe I don't understand the -- every step in the liability claim. My only question was, among the plaintiffs, is it correct that the only plaintiffs who claim they were hurt physically by asbestos as a result of the actions of somebody, the only ones who are claiming that the somebody was other than Manville are the Wise plaintiffs. Is that correct?",
  "No?",
  "Simply because of Manville's position in the - -",
  "So -- so that you are saying in effect everybody ultimately is claiming against Manville, the Wise plaintiffs and every other set of plaintiffs in this -- in this group of direct liability claimants, right?",
  "I -- I understand your cause of action. Okay. I don't want to - -",
  "I take it the only issue that you have raised before us is whether the evidence that does raise a burden on the defendant's part has got to be, whatever this means, direct or not? That's the only issue?",
  "Am I right that the only source of argument for the proposition that it does have to be direct evidence is Justice O'Connor's opinion, separate opinion?",
  "There are arguments about the need for substantial evidence. But the argument for direct evidence goes back to the separate O'Connor -- O'Connor opinion.",
  "And are you -- I mean, we're going to hear about this. Are you going to make an argument to the effect that that should not be regarded as the controlling opinion, and if that is the source of it, that is the end of the issue. Are you going to get into that?",
  "I think you should.",
  "As I understand the White opinion, it had nothing to do with the character of the evidence. It had to do with the degree of persuasiveness of the evidence; is that correct?",
  "Then I don't understand what \"substantial\" means. What do you think he meant by that?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, correct me if I am wrong. I assume that in a jury case that simply was left to the jury, and the instructions would be something like this: If you find that the plaintiff has shown that age was a motivating factor, then you look to the next question. And that is: Has the defendant shown that he would have fired the plaintiff anyway? Isn't that the way it works?",
  "Regardless of what the parties may prefer, isn't it likely that the jury, regardless of instruction, is going to say something like this: If we find that -- that age really was in the boss's mind when he fired the person, and the boss comes in, regardless of the instructions, and says the guy's work was no good, he got late -- he arrived late and so on, the jury is going to say: Did they really fire him because he was old or because he didn't come to work on time? They are going to do the same thing that they are going to do on the burden-shifting instruction, probably, aren't they?",
  "You can't know it - -",
  "But if you said to the jury, do the right thing, they'd probably come out the same way it would come out if you gave the burden shifting instruction, I think.",
  "But the reason I raise the issue is, if -- if we are saying do we ditch Price Waterhouse, my questions I guess are suggesting something to the effect, what difference does it make?",
  "Juries -- juries are smarter than judges.",
  "Well, you will get to the jury and if the jury accepts all your evidence, the jury can find in your favor. But the difference between a prima facie showing and what has to be shown here is, the jury must actually find, based on your at least prima facie evidence, that age was a motivating factor, and until the jury makes that finding, if it is properly instructed, it doesn't get to the question of whether the defendant has any burden to show something in response. Isn't that correct?",
  "We can't -- I mean there is no question about quantitative evidence here.",
  "The adequacy of the jury instruction, but there isn't a question as to whether the issue should have gone to the jury in the first place. And I -- I think that - -",
  "Well, some -- some of those vessels, I take it, are taxed under other statutes. Is that correct?",
  "Well, do you -- do you take the position -- let's say that if the State of Alaska taxed all the other property you had mentioned except for the tankers and the city taxed the tankers, that that would by definition be discriminatory tax and/or on some other basis violate the Tonnage Clause?",
  "Well, the reason I raised it was that -- in -- in your response to my first question, you said, well, you didn't think the city was taxing these other -- these other pieces of property, and I'm -- I'm not sure why that is significant.",
  "How about the risk in the other direction, that the State will simply take over this tax and remit the proceeds to the city? Would the result on your view be the same if it did that?",
  "Let's -- let's assume that you're -- that a given tanker came into the harbor at Valdez on one occasion and one occasion only. Would the City of Valdez, under its own statutes, by the terms of its own ordinance, tax that ship?",
  "Well, let me -- let me just change the question then. If -- if it came in and sort of took half a tankful that didn't reach the point of a million dollars' value, there would be no tax then. Is that correct?",
  "Whatever it would take to get it under the minimum.",
  "Okay. Under the old tonnage laws, wouldn't that ship in the 18th century have been taxed?",
  "Well, the -- the point that I am getting to is -- and I'd -- I'd like you to address this -- one of the arguments on the other side is that one reason this should not be treated as a tonnage tax is that it relies upon the concept of a tax situs. And the -- the implication is that not every ship that comes into the harbor is going to be subject to the tax; whereas, under the old tonnage laws, any ship that came in would be. And what is -- what is your response to that argument?",
  "Where do we -- where do we look to find this out?",
  "Do you know of any source that we could look at to support the proposition that you just made?",
  "What about a - -",
  "I thought you said earlier or implied earlier that we couldn't draw a distinction, really, between capacity and value because tonnage in the 18th century was simply a proxy for the -- for the value of the ship?",
  "So a value tax is going to run into the same problem - -",
  "-- as a tonnage tax.",
  "But all you're saying - -",
  "All you're saying is that there are other factors that -- that preclude using tonnage simply as a single crude measure. But isn't it fair to say that, other things being equal -- the engine capacity, the hull construction, et cetera -- the tonnage is a rough measurement of the value of the ship, for just the reason that Justice Scalia gave? It determines the amount of cargo the ship can carry, and what it can charge for it, and that is capitalized into the value of the ship. Isn't that true?",
  "That may be the only way they can accomplish what they want to. Because as the Chief Justice's question suggested a moment ago, if in the 18th century the port of Boston said, \"We are not going to charge tonnage anymore. We are simply going to tax on the value of the ship,\" that is going to have exactly the same effect that a tonnage tax would have. So maybe exemption is the only way it can be done.",
  "What about the -- the broader tax situation at the -- at the -- in -- in 1789? Did -- did ports have sources of -- or exercise the authority at that time to tax property generally, e.g., real estate in the city to support the activities of the ports, or were they dependent solely upon things like import-export taxes, et cetera?",
  "So -- so that the argument they are taxing other things, therefore it's okay to tax this, would have been an argument just as potent in the 18th century or impotent, as the case may be, as it is now?",
  "Okay.",
  "Because technically it's just suspension, it's not -- it's not reenactment. I suppose you could say a suspension is a partial revival, but the provision doesn't exactly fit, does it?",
  "I agree.",
  "Why would -- why would Congress have wanted to make that distinction?",
  "Okay. Where are you?",
  "Okay.",
  "But it was -- the text of it was not limited to rescinding that designation. I mean, that's the problem, it seems to me.",
  "All right. Let's -- let's assume - -",
  "-- for the sake of argument that the reasons for -- otherwise the reasons for and against the point you've just made are evenly balanced. We are on the fence. Don't we resolve this -- shouldn't we resolve this in favor of the President's position, simply because in the absence of the statutes that we're talking about, starting with the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the President would have had under the foreign policy power of Presidents the authority to stop suits like this dead in the water simply by taking the position that that should be the result? So that if in doubt, shouldn't we construe these statutes consistently with the traditional foreign policy authority of the President, in which case we get off the fence and we go in the way of the Petitioners rather than your way?",
  "Well, it's been profoundly changed if we accept your argument. I mean, at the moment the question is whether it has been profoundly changed or not. We've got a statutory mess. And in a case in which the statutes are seemingly subject to - - to -- to arguments either way, why don't we go with tradition?",
  "Yes, but the President, quite apart from the immunity designation, the President had the authority to compromise suits.",
  "I don't know whether it continues to exist or not for the sake of this argument, and I'm not -- I'm not making that point for the sake of this argument. I'm simply saying that if it is otherwise unclear, given that that power was traditionally enjoyed by the President, why do we not construe the -- or resolve the equipoise if it gets to that point, in the President's favor rather than your favor?",
  "Well, he hasn't set it up because he thinks he has got the authority under this statute or had the authority under this statute.",
  "Oh, I -- I quite agree with that.",
  "So I suppose the first step in that direction is to stop the suit that's going on now.",
  "And I mean, just to add to that - -",
  "It said under 620A of Foreign Assistance or any other provision of law. Clearly they are going beyond, it seems to me, the - - the premise which your argument rests on, the argument that you've just made.",
  "Okay. Fine. But there is no textual basis for drawing the line once you get beyond 620A at the point you want to draw it.",
  "Why did -- why did he need the statute to do that? In other words if the President had the power to designate in the first place, normally that assumes the power to -- to rescind the designation.",
  "And it may also be an indication that he thought he had effectively accomplished what he wanted by -- by acting under this statute, and therefore he had other fish to fry.",
  "I -- I don't know, either. I mean, I can't -- I can't read minds, but there is an interpretation that is quite possible consistent with the text of this statute, that he thought that by acting under 1503, he had done everything that he needed to do. Why he had at some subsequent time said, well, you know, I'll -- I'll use belt as well as suspenders, I don't know. But it would be consistent with the assumption that he had the authority here.",
  "Why -- why do you say \"permanently\"?",
  "Just under -- just under this statute, if he makes inapplicable, he can rescind the action that made it inapplicable.",
  "Well -- no, but during the period in which the statute is applicable, I don't know of any reason why he cannot change his designation of inapplicability. So that the argument of a permanent change in the foreign policy of the United States or the -- or the powers relating to the foreign policy of the United States doesn't seem to me a legitimate argument.",
  "Let me -- let me ask the same question with respect to the new statute, the \"capital A\" statute.",
  "Would there be -- and I just -- I don't know the answer to this. Would there be authority under the \"capital A\" statute to undo the designation?",
  "Okay. He waived it, but the question is whether he would have had the authority to undesignate or -- or to rescind the designation of inapplicability if he had wished to exercise the authority under the \"capital A\" statute.",
  "I -- I thought the determination was that it had failed to provide funds that could reasonably accomplish the -- the -- the plan which the district itself had adopted.",
  "But the district agreed on that, I take it. The district said, you've got to do something. This is our plan. And I thought the district court then said -- the school district did that, and I thought the district court then said, well, the -- the funding that you have come up with, or the funding scheme you have come up with simply is not rationally related to the plan that you, yourself, have adopted. Am I -- am I wrong on that?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, I -- help me out then. I thought the -- the issue was not whether there had been any good faith attempt at compliance, but whether there were two deficiencies under the scheme, under the -- I forget the statute -- the new bill. One deficiency was that it limited the funding for any given student subject to -- to ELL -- to two-year funding when, in fact, the evidence showed that you couldn't get a kid up to par with two years of education. The second deficiency was that the -- that the State funds -- strike that, I'm sorry -- that Federal funds were being used to supplant what should have been a State responsibility rather than merely supplementing. I take it that is simply a matter of degree, but that was the problem. I thought those were the two problems, two-year funding, supplantation. Am I -- am I wrong? So there was no -- my point is that there was no denial that some good faith efforts had been made. The finding was that there were two deficiencies and these were the two deficiencies; is that correct?",
  "Well, it should -- has the state law changed?",
  "I mean, the reason -- the reason for getting into this is that the State required it. Has the State law changed?",
  "No, we are not talking about -- I'm sorry.",
  "What is the district court supposed to do? The attorney general for the State comes in and says, do it this way. It seems to me that the State has no standing later on to say: Oh, gee, the district court should have said: Sorry, Mr. Attorney General; you don't know anything about your State law; we won't do it this way.",
  "But that isn't what it -- I don't understand that it has ever said that. I thought the funding point was basically this: You, Nogales, have come up with plan A. You have come up with funding B. Funding B is not enough money to fund plan A. It is your plan, you've got to fund your plan. That is not saying that the Federal statute requires a particular level of funding. It's not saying that the district court can take over the responsibility of deciding what is appropriate funding in a school district. It's simply saying, \"If you choose plan A, you have got to pay for plan A.\"",
  "Am I -- am I wrong? Did it ever go beyond that?",
  "In other words, it should have said: Before I decide whether your funding for plan A is good enough, I have got to decide whether plan A itself is worth anything? I mean, I have got to evaluate plan A?",
  "All right. Let's go back to Justice Kennedy's point a moment ago. Let's just talk about Nogales for a minute. With respect to plan A, that was Nogales' plan. And the district court said: You can't fund that plan with the amount of money that you have appropriated. Did the district court go beyond that with respect to Nogales?",
  "No. But doesn't it - - doesn't it -- don't we come back to Justice Scalia's question of a moment ago? Even with the -- the changed plan to immersion, isn't the finding that two years of funding per child is not enough? And you are supplanting, not supplementing. Isn't that still the problem?",
  "But those are the issues that the court focused on; are they not?",
  "What has 60(b) got to do with the question of whether the attorney general represents the State before the court? If the attorney general comes back into court and says, no longer do we want this statewide, then you've got an issue. If the -- if the attorney general speaking for the State does not do that, then I don't see why Justice Scalia's point is not the answer.",
  "So the district court is supposed to referee a fight between the governor and the attorney general at this point? Is that what's going on?",
  "Doesn't the attorney general speak for the State?",
  "Let me ask you about another bright-line rule that I think you're assuming. You -- you said in the course of describing the justification for this search that one -- one of the points of justification was that there was a health and safety risk. And I assume from the way you put it that you are grouping every drug, prescription or over the counter, as posing a health and safety risk; is that correct?",
  "Why -- why should we accept that -- that blanket assumption? I mean, at some point it gets silly. Having -- having an aspirin tablet does not present a health and safety risk, and yet that's an over-the-counter drug, and presumably you would have gone through the same search for -- for an aspirin that was conducted here.",
  "Oh, and I agree with you, and I -- I don't have any question with this kind of a, let's say, a -- a broad swath of judicial hands-off in determining what is a risk and what isn't. But at some point it becomes sufficiently questionable that I do think we have to raise it. And if your rule would criminalize -- I shouldn't say \"criminalize\" -- would put aspirin in the contraband category and justify the kind of search that went on here, I think we've reached the questionable point. And I -- my question to you now is, why haven't we?",
  "Have you ever made -- has your side of the case ever made the argument that it needs this sort of blanket classification rule, any drug over the counter or prescription, because when a, a pill is found, they're not pharmacists, they don't know what it is, and therefore they've got to have a blanket rule or they simply cannot act effectively? I did not see that argument in the briefs. Has that argument been raised at any point?",
  "Where did you argue it? I mean, I want to know whether that argument is in the case.",
  "Is it? I don't remember it. Do you remember a page? Do you have a page reference offhand?",
  "But you say it's in your brief?",
  "Okay, I'll go back.",
  "Your basis -- your basis for saying that, I guess, is just sort of the practical one, we don't know how to do that type of thing. So far as the legal principle on the basis of which you justified this search, you could justify that search, too, couldn't you?",
  "But if -- if we hold in your favor in this case and the next school district says, all right, we're going to have classes in body cavity searches, then there would be no legal basis, if we accept your principle, for saying that's out of bounds as a matter of the Fourth Amendment; isn't that correct?",
  "So it would not -- it would not be out of bounds under the Fourth Amendment?",
  "But you are -- you are saying basically there is -- there is no general understanding that people carry ibuprofen in -- in their undergarments.",
  "And I don't see why your answer might not be different if, under the Chief Justice's question, he didn't know it was ibuprofen. All he knew was that it was a white pill. He's not a pharmacologist, he doesn't know what's in it. Wouldn't the reasonableness of the -- wouldn't the scope of reasonable search at least potentially be greater for the undifferentiated white pill than for the known ibuprofen?",
  "Let me -- let me just, not so much change the facts, but -- but emphasize a couple of different aspects of the facts. Assuming Justice Breyer's hypothetical of a moment ago and assuming the following thought process on the part of the principal -- I -- strike that. I will vary the facts in one way. Let's assume, following your categorical rule that the -- the principal doesn't know whether it's ibuprofen or not. He just knows that there's a pill and one of the other kids said this person has got pills on -- on her person. The principal says, I know as a matter of reliable fact that one student got sick, violently sick, within the past week or so on some pill; we don't know exactly what it was. We also know within a reasonable period of time from where we are now that there have been kids who died from ingesting dangerous drugs. I've got suspicion that some drug is on this kid's person. My thought process is I would rather have the kid embarrassed by a strip search, if we can't find anything short of that, than to have some other kids dead because the stuff is distributed at lunchtime and things go awry. Is that the basis? Is that thought process, that reasoning, the basis for a -- a reasonable strip search?",
  "That's right.",
  "Somewhere between the surface of the clothes and -- and the body.",
  "You -- you say that the - - the point of my question, this is what I'd like you to focus on -- you're entirely right, I would accept that argument and I think that argument is entirely right, if the stakes are lower. If the risk of a mistake is going to be less traumatic. In the hypo that I gave, the risk of the mistake may well be violent sickness or death. And the thought process in the principal's mind is, the reasonableness analysis in the principal's mind is better embarrassment than violent sickness or death. What's wrong with that reasoning under the Fourth Amendment?",
  "I'm -- I'm saying it.",
  "We -- We've got a new case.",
  "And I'm saying to you, why isn't that a -- a reasonable thought process within the concept of Fourth Amendment reasonableness?",
  "You've got reasonable suspicion that they are somewhere on the person.",
  "And with those stakes in mind, why isn't it reasonable? In other words, there - - there is a sliding scale of risk which is inherent in my hypo, and why isn't that a sound basis for a -- a Fourth Amendment analysis?",
  "I don't have a belief; I simply have a reasonable suspicion. That's what I've got all along the way. And it seems to me, when -- when you take the position that you -- you were taking, you are saying, better to have the risk of violent sickness or death than the risk of embarrassment. Isn't that what you're saying?",
  "Some search is -- is reasonable, I take it?",
  "All right. Now the -- we get to the point as in prior hypos, in which it does - - they find nothing in the pockets. They find nothing in the pocket book or other garments. The only thing that's left is a strip search, and that's where you draw the line. Why do you draw the line there, on the risk analysis?",
  "Do you take the position that without intervention though, nonetheless the government could appeal at the -- at the tail end?",
  "You don't think that - - okay.",
  "What do you -- what do you say to the government's argument that they -- it -- it may close these doors that -- that you're saying, but it opens a lot of others under other rules? The government says you're just asking for trouble under the -- under the -- a -- an undifferentiated number of other rules if we go your way. What's your response to that?",
  "The problem, Mr. Coleman, is that -- that the cases you are relying on, it seems to me, are cases in which ultimately what is being judged is a different result in the -- at the end point of the process which was starting. And the problem that I have with -- with using cases like that and -- and essentially the problem I -- I have with your argument is that it leaves a -- a municipality or a governmental body like New Haven in a -- in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. Because on -- on the very assumptions that you are making, if they go forward with -- with their -- their hiring plan, they certify the results and go forward with it, they are inevitably facing a disparate impact lawsuit. If they stop and say, wait a minute, we're starting down the road toward a disparate impact lawsuit and, indeed, there may be something wrong here, they are inevitably facing a disparate treatment suit. And whatever Congress wanted to attain, it couldn't have wanted to attain that kind of a situation. Why isn't the most reasonable reading of this set of facts a reading which is consistent with giving the city an opportunity, assuming good faith, to start again? And I -- I recognize there's got to be a good faith condition, and the -- the good faith can always be attacked. But isn't that the only way to avoid the damned if you do, damned if you don't situation?",
  "But you make no distinction between race as an animating discriminating object on the one hand and race consciousness on the other. There is no way to deal with a situation like this any more than there is a way to deal with -- with setting lines in voting districts - -",
  "-- without pervasive race consciousness. That is not unconstitutional, and it seems to me that you are not observing that distinction in -- in your reply.",
  "Well, what -- what if you've got -- what if you've got the basis of Justice Kennedy's hypothetical? You've -- you've got a municipality. It's a racially mixed municipality. It's got two tests. That's his hypothetical. One of them seems to suggest that there is going to be a significant racial disparity in the results if they use it. The other one from the other city or the other State suggests not. That's all they've got to go on. Is that a strong basis in evidence, or did they walk their way into a lawsuit by you if they adopt the -- the test that doesn't -- that at least in the other place hasn't produced the disparity?",
  "But you are -- as I understand it, you are imposing your strong basis in evidence test on what you referred to a second ago as the use of race, and that cannot be correct, because the use of race includes race-conscious decisions which are not discriminatory decisions, and they certainly do not implicate the -- the obligation that you want to impose. You -- if -- if your argument is going to be coherent with what we start with, it can't be based merely on the use of race because if it does, then you are, in effect, turning any race-conscious decision into a discrimination decision, and that equation we certainly haven't made and we're never going to make.",
  "Then - -",
  "But even - -",
  "I don't want to turn this into just a rhetoric exercise, but I think the rhetoric is important. You say the city took the position, we don't like the results of this test. That kind of a statement is consistent with saying, look, we don't like the race of the people who are going to benefit from this. It's also consistent with the city's taking the position that there is such a racial disparity here that we are either asking for trouble or walking blindly or perhaps foolishly into a -- a racial disparity lawsuit based on disparate impact. Those are two very, very different attitudes. The first one is discriminatory. I don't see how the second one is discriminatory.",
  "But the cost of drawing the distinction between this case and Justice Kennedy's hypothetical example is that if we draw that distinction, the only way the city can get itself out of not only a certain lawsuit, but quite probably a successful lawsuit, is to make, in practical terms, a preliminary case against itself.",
  "And it -- I cannot conceive that Congress intended to put a city into that situation saying you've either got to blunder ahead into a losing lawsuit in court, or you have got to stop and expose yourself to another lawsuit which you can only win by proving that you at least had taken some steps in violating the law the first time. That is inconceivable.",
  "I think your phrase was -- I think - -",
  "But does it have to be reasonable basis to believe they would be liable if they went ahead? Or can reasonableness refer to something other than the probability of or the -- the likelihood of liability?",
  "Okay.",
  "You are -- you are saying, as I understand it, that if the -- if the city in a case like this, prior to giving a test, looked at the test and says, wait a minute, this is going to produce really disparate results, they can stop, regroup, and think it through again and maybe come up with a different test.",
  "But if they don't realize that and they go ahead with the test, and they then see the -- the disparate results, it's too late. And it seems to me that the trouble with drawing that distinction is that the city is not in the testing business. They are unlikely to know what the results are going to be. So you're saying that the city that is -- that is prescient can adjust, the city that doesn't find out there's something wrong or at least undesirable from their standpoint until after the test results cannot readjust?",
  "But if they see it coming, they don't have to show a strong basis in evidence for changing the test prior to the time they give it?",
  "Another - -",
  "No, please.",
  "Well, if he's admitting it, what does the standard of the evidence matter?",
  "Well, he's not saying, I admit to a degree of preponderance of the evidence that it was over 10,000. He's saying, period, over 10,000. The burden of proof, the standard of proof doesn't matter.",
  "And he definitively resolves it by admission.",
  "No, I understand the facts of this case. I was commenting on your answer to Justice Alito's question, and it would seem to me that the answer to the question is there is no difference.",
  "All right, that really gets to the question that I was going to ask, and that is, I don't see how the modified categorical approach is something that you could admit would be sufficient because, as I understand your argument -- and it is in part an argument based on sort of standard grammatical construction -- you're saying that in the definition \"The term 'aggravated felony' means an offense that\" - - and you emphasize the \"that,\" the restrictive nature of the \"that\" clause -- \"involves fraud or deceit in which the loss exceeds $10,000.\" if I understand your restrictive clause argument, the definition of the offense has got to include the element of exceeding $10,000 or it does not satisfy your, the -- it does not satisfy the standard that you were arguing for based on the restrictive clause. So it seems to me that you've got to go the whole hog or you get nothing, and the whole hog is that it's got to be an element of the offense that the loss exceed $10,000. Am I wrong?",
  "Okay, how about this one. You were arguing based on this statute and you make an argument based on the restrictive nature of a \"that\" modifying clause, and if you're going to make the restrictive clause argument, it seems to me you've got to go the whole hog and say the element of the offense has got to include the loss in excess of $10,000.",
  "Well, yeah, you would prevail, but you would prevail, it seems to me, at the expense of this objection, and the government makes it. There are very, very few fraud and deceit statutes that define the offense by reference to a loss in excess of $10,000. My recollection from the government's brief is that they come up with three. The fact is also that this provision, the $10,000 figure, was placed into the statute at a time when Congress was trying to expand the category of deportable, removable offenses, and it would be passing strange in that context to define the offense by reference to a $10,000 figure as an element of the offense which would cut it down, which would cut the compass of the statute down to three offenses. What is your response to that?",
  "Well, once you get into the State statutes you get into the further problem of an utter and I would suppose unjust patchwork of statutory reference to which this would apply. If you -- if you steal the $11,000 in State A, you get booted out of the country. If you steal it across the State line in State B, you stay home. I mean, I can't imagine that Congress would have enacted that kind of scheme.",
  "A uniform test that produces both unjust results and I would suppose strangely unsatisfying results to a Congress that wanted to expand the concept of deportable offense.",
  "Well, when you say \"the clinical judgment,\" you mean the specific finding of a",
  "Okay. I grant you that under -- under the earlier case the 65 IQ was not dispositive, and I mean that was the -- the case in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical. But it was necessary under the early case to come to a determination of what the IQ was, even though that determination was not dispositive of the result. And because it was necessary to come to a determination, why shouldn't there be a preclusion?",
  "It wasn't necessary to reach that particular -- in other words, the determination of 65 was not necessary to reach the conclusion that they reached.",
  "And you -- you are saying the very fact that it was not dispositive of the result means that it cannot be preclusive now?",
  "Okay.",
  "But even -- even if that's so, that's not necessarily an -- an Atkins finding, isn't that correct?",
  "Atkin -- Atkin -- we didn't determine what the definition of retardation was. We - - we operated in Atkins on a broad conception of retardation and we came down with a general rule. But we left it for later litigation, starting in the States, to determine exactly how that line ought to be drawn. We didn't know where the line ought to be drawn at that point and certainly the clinical psychologists didn't know, regardless of what the - - what definition was being used.",
  "In -- in response to Justice Ginsburg's question, I don't see why it makes any difference which court is doing what. She -- she raised two objections. Number one is that so far as the issue being determined in the prior proceeding, the characterization of his mental state as retardation was at most a subsidiary, not an ultimate fact. Number two, the conclusion of that prior proceeding was that he lost. And she's saying in those, in either of those circumstances, the subsidiary finding is not preclusive and any finding is not preclusive in the manner in which he wishes to use it here. I don't see what difference it makes whether we're talking about court A or court B. What is -- what is your response to those two objections?",
  "If -- if the Ohio court had found, the court of first instance had found, that the IQ was at some different level, it could have come out exactly the same way it came out in this case, couldn't it?",
  "So the finding was not necessary to the result?",
  "I mean, we went through this with your brother, and he pointed out, yes, it was necessary to -- to consider the issue and to make some kind of a finding -- I don't know how precise it had to be -- but the finding that it made, the -- the actual number that was used or the characterization that was used to describe that number was not necessary in order, in fact, to impose the death penalty.",
  "And -- and the sense of necessity which is used normally in -- in this kind of preclusion analysis just doesn't apply here.",
  "But if that is the argument, then what is being preclusive here is not the first judgment. I mean, in preclusion cases it's the first judgment that precludes, and we identify a judgment which is preclusive in the way we've been describing. But in the hypothetical that Justice Breyer gave you, there's nothing preclusive about the first judgment because the first judgment stands and properly can stand. And you're saying there can't be a second judgment, but you are not depending upon a rule of preclusion that turns on the first. So whatever your argument is, it's not -- it's not issue preclusion.",
  "Sure, but you're coming up with a brand new rule. Whatever your rule is, it's not a rule of double jeopardy and it's not -- it's not the traditional rule of issue preclusion.",
  "No, but what your rule is, as I understand it in your response to Justice Breyer's question, is if there was a subsidiary fact determination in the first case, even though it was entirely consistent with the judgment against your client, that's subsidiary fact determination can be used as a defense by your client in the second case. That's your rule, as I understand it, and that is not the rule of Ashe v. Swenson and it is not the rule of issue preclusion.",
  "Well, you -- do you agree with me that you're asking for a brand-new rule here?",
  "We have never held this, and I don't know of any court that's ever held this.",
  "Well, why isn't it brand new?",
  "Well, maybe the unique procedural posture is precisely the reason that the rule is brand new. If it's unique, we've never had it before.",
  "But I'm not sure that there's even anything -- I mean, it does raise a judicial estoppel issue, but I'm not sure there is a - - a record hereupon which a -- a judicial estoppel claim could be maintained, because in the passages that you referred us to, first the State's concession and secondly the finding which -- which followed from it, it was a reference to mild mental retardation and a specific reference to an IQ of 69. I think it's a stretch, would be a stretch, to go from saying that a concession of mild mental retardation for purposes of mitigation analysis should be taken as a concession for dispositive mental retardation for Atkins purposes. So I -- I have difficulty in seeing any clear inconsistency in the State's two positions.",
  "Mr. Feinerman, can we go back to the time frame again? I've just got a question of fact. I should know this, but I don't. You said that if the -- if the parents and the school district disagree, it can be remedied fairly quickly because there's a fairly tight schedule set for the administrative procedure. What I don't remember, and my question is this: When the administrative steps have been exhausted, if there is still disagreement, is there any limit on the time in which the -- the judicial appeal has to be resolved?",
  "Isn't that the -- isn't that the kicker here? In other words, I -- I fully understand your -- your textual argument. I -- I can see its soundness as a possibility that is open to us and, perhaps on the face of it, the most likely possibility, but there is a cost, and the cost, it seems to me, is that once you get into the -- once you get into appeals, this thing can go on for years, and you can't wait years when -- when a kid is in this kind of condition.",
  "What happens when we get to court?",
  "What happens when we get to court? Isn't that when it turns into a matter of years?",
  "Okay. But I think we've got to assume that Congress has some concern for the parents who correctly say, this IEP is no good, it just can't be done in the school system, and the kid needs a special school. In that case, maybe -- your answer may be that's the exceptional case and it shouldn't drive the -- the inferences to be drawn about congressional intent. But in that case, if the district and the parents are at good faith loggerheads it can go on for a long, long time, can't it?",
  "No, but they get the due process hearing. The ultimate result is that the school proposes an IEP; the parents, based on what their experts tell them, say that isn't going to work, and the parents say the only way we can educate this kid without his falling behind more is to put him in a private school. At that point, with assuming good faith here, it seems to me you get into court and it can go on for a long time, if we accept your -- your analysis of the text.",
  "Yes, but doesn't that get to the point of something pretty formalistic? I mean, somebody in the brief said, given one day under the IEP and the -- if you win, ultimately the check can be written. That can't be right.",
  "But you are basically saying that the -- that the only necessary delay in order to satisfy a condition for eligibility, if the parents otherwise prevail, is a ten-day delay. That's basically your answer?",
  "Okay.",
  "But your position is that there are basically two situations: One, the situation in which there is an administrative order to do an IEP and the school district says, no, we won't do it. Millions for defense; we are going right into appeal, and we are not going to prepare the IEP. In that situation, as I understand it, you are saying, the parents have no way of getting relief under the statute. In the case in which there is an order for the IEP and the school district prepares the IEP, even though the parents think it will be inadequate, there in fact is a ready remedy subject to two delays: One, the time to prepare the IEP; and, two, ten days to give it a try before the parents take the kid out of school. That's basically the scheme that you are proposing that the statute provides; is -- is that correct?",
  "No, but the reference is to a right to be heard on certain subjects. It doesn't say anything about authorizing a particular individual or officer within a school system to award relief. The problem is, it says you can be heard. It doesn't say who will tell you or who will tell the school district to write a check.",
  "But can you raise the - - you can raise the claim to eligibility to a -- a private education here without the hearing officer having the authority to order the school district to provide it.",
  "No, but it might make senses to say that the hearing officer can determine eligibility; it is then up to the school to pay it; and if the school does not pay it, then you have got to go into court and get an award.",
  "But the odds are that it would be under the plan. I mean, what you say is theoretically possible, but in the real world it's probably going to be under the plan, isn't it?",
  "But the -- in the -- in the general -- in the field of criminal enforcement generally there isn't any provision comparable to what is now 36(f)(1)(B), at least to my knowledge, and it's set out on pages 46 and 47, the text is in the government's brief: \"The provisions of any State law to which a branch of a national bank is subject under this paragraph shall be enforced with respect to such branch by the OCC.\" And that mandate, it \"shall be enforced with respect to such branch\" sounds pretty exclusive to me.",
  "You can't tell for sure. But why would -- why would Congress, number one, if it -- if Congress simply assumed that there would be a -- a dual system of enforcement, that OCC could - - could say to the bank, you follow State law, and if you don't, we are going to go after you administratively, and leaving it to the State to go after, in any other fashion, what State law provided. If that was Congress's assumption, why would it have -- have passed this seeming mandate, \"shall be enforced with respect to such branch\" by the -- by the OCC?",
  "But that -- that's, in effect, saving clause kind of function could have been performed simply by a statute that says OCC may. And this says it shall be enforced by OCC.",
  "What do you say about the quotations in the -- the brief that Mr. Waxman filed, as I recall; it may have been the government's brief - -",
  "-- which -- which do have references to visitorial powers as including general conformance to the law. Those are not universal provisions, but they -- they were certainly understood in some cases.",
  "No, but there was -- there was a point in -- in distinguishing the visitorial powers that Blackstone, in the cases Blackstone was referring to, and those for example that would apply solely to -- to religious or originally religious foundations like Oxford and Cambridge colleges and so on. So there -- there seems to have been a reason to understand the distinction.",
  "But he didn't need visitorial powers to do that. I mean, the sovereign had that by virtue of the general law.",
  "But do you -- do you agree that -- that it is possible to read the \"shall\" both as -- as an unequivocal grant of power to OCC, but not necessarily as an exclusive ground?",
  "I want you to come back. I -- I won't stop -- I don't want to stop you from doing that, but I want to come back to this. Do you -- do you want to go on to your second example, or do you want to - -",
  "Is there any -- is there any legislative history whatever to the effect that at the time 36(f)(1)(B) was adopted -- to the effect that its effect was to pre-empt State enforcement for - -",
  "Senator D'Amato and - -",
  "Yes, but the -- the problem I have with that is, as a -- as a kind of clear statement of -- of something which is -- is -- would be extraordinary -- is that it talks in terms of supervision. It doesn't use the -- my recollection is it doesn't use the magic word \"enforcement.\" And I would have thought that if in the course of that colloquy the -- the statement had been made: The States will not have the authority to enforce this, that there would have been rather a dust-up. And there wasn't. It's kind of a \"dog that didn't bark\" argument. And, therefore, if -- if there is uncertainty as to how to construe 36(f)(1)(B), I'm not sure that I -- I don't think the legislative history supports your exclusivity view.",
  "Does that mean -- when they say \"review records,\" does that mean that the State auditors in effect can walk into the bank, as distinguished from what we have here, in which the bank is being requested to produce excerpts from records?",
  "Well, it isn't -- it isn't if - -",
  "Well, is it - -",
  "Is it the exercise of visitorial powers, or is it an action which covers the same subject that an exercise of visitorial powers would do? Let me -- let me propose a distinction, and I don't know whether this is sound. You know -- I mean, you tell me. I would suppose that if someone with visitorial powers dealing with discrimination in lending brought an action against the bank or tried to enforce it against the bank and couldn't do so in any other way then by going to court, it would go to court, and it would say court, tell this institution that I have some responsibility for, to obey the law. But I also assume that if the Attorney General of New York, which is not a visitor, enforces the law, it would go into court and say tell them to obey the law and to pay damages or recompense of some sort to these people whom they have wronged. The subject matter of each suit is the same, but the relief that is being requested and the judicial power that is being exercised is different in these two cases. Is that a fair distinction?",
  "That is the one with Senator D'Amato?",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "Exactly. I mean, I -- if -- if you're basing it simply on your subjection to preclearance and there's no contest between you and the government over preclearing anything, I'm not sure why you would be in court.",
  "Then isn't -- isn't that the time for litigating?",
  "But it's not affecting anything you're doing on a day-to-day basis, as I understand it. There's no claim that -- that your district is doing anything improper. No claim is being made against you. And I guess your whole argument would be maybe some day we want to preclear again, and maybe we wouldn't be as successful as we had been in each of the instances before. But I don't see how that gets you in court.",
  "But the suit -- correct me if I'm wrong, and I may be wrong on this, but I thought this suit eventuated from the fact that you had been denied bailout and that your entire case was brought on the refusal of bailout. I did not understand that you had brought a general declaratory judgment action or a -- or a facial attack in gross, as it were, on the statute. Am I wrong about your pleadings?",
  "Right.",
  "You separately asked for declaratory judgment?",
  "Well Mr. Coleman, this is important to me. Do you -- do you acknowledge that if we find on your favor on the bailout point we need not reach the constitutional point?",
  "Mr. Coleman, may I just raise a basic point here. And I'll be candid with you that it affects my view of your argument. I just want to start with it. Your argument is largely based on the assumption that things have significantly changed and that therefore Congress could not by whatever test we use extend the -- extend section 5. But what we've got in the record in front of us -- I don't have a laundry list to read, but I mean, we've got I think at the present time a 6-point -- a 16-point registration difference on Hispanic and non-Hispanic white voters in Texas. We've got a record of some 600 interpositions by the -- by the Justice Department on section 5 proceedings, section 5 objections, over a period of about 20 years. We got a record that about two-thirds of them were based on the Justice Department's view that it was intentional discrimination. We've got something like 600 section 2 lawsuits over the same period of time. The point that I'm getting at is I don't understand, with a record like that, how you can maintain as a basis for this suit that things have radically changed. They may be better. But to say that they have radically changed to the point that this becomes an unconstitutional section 5 exercise within Congress's judgment just seems to me to -- to deny the empirical reality. I mean, what it your answer to that?",
  "Well, the evidence that I've been getting into is a pretty good indication -- I would have thought Congress thought so and I would have thought so too -- that there is something to be concerned about on the issue of circumvention; that in fact the attitudes have not so radically changed as to render circumvention irrelevant.",
  "What about the evidence that Justice Breyer summarized, that I alluded to? I mean those -- that is simply evidence of racial attitude and it seems to me in the real world that can be taken as evidence that if the -- if the section 5 safeguard is taken away, the pushback is going to start.",
  "It has never stopped.",
  "They couldn't -- they couldn't be relied upon apparently in the some 200 cases in which the voting change was withdrawn after DOJ objection.",
  "This wasn't information over 30 years. My recollection -- and I could be wrong on this, but my recollection is that those were statistics from about 20 years prior to the reauthorization.",
  "Yes, that's correct.",
  "He would do the same thing in Justice Scalia's if it were an irrevocable trust. The trust could do exactly what the aggregator is doing here.",
  "-- that might protect those who assigned their interest to the trust, but I don't offhand see what difference it would make, what difference those responsibilities would make vis a vis you and your client.",
  "But the real issue is not whether the trustee can sue. The real issue is whether the trust can sue.",
  "It seems to me in his example if the trust can sue, why can't the aggregator sue? And your answer was, well, trustees have certain responsibilities. But I don't see that those responsibilities inure to the benefit of your client or to an opposing party in litigation that a trust brings. So I don't see how it would differentiate it.",
  "Could you explain that? That really goes back to your answer in Justice Ginsburg's question and I'm not getting it. She said why would you go to the Federal court if you can you go to the FCC, and you said, well, you get the benefits of being in Federal court. What -- I should be asking other counsel this question, but as you understand it what is the benefit of being in the Federal court rather than the FCC that makes this so attractive?",
  "So you don't know of any benefits?",
  "You don't know of any benefits?",
  "Well, you eliminate step one. I mean, you go to the FCC, you win there, then you've got to face an appeal before the Federal courts. Why not go right to the Federal courts immediately? You eliminate one level of litigation.",
  "Well, I'd like you to go back to the question that Justice Stevens, Justice Breyer, and I asked you. You said, oh, there's a problem, there's no counterclaim, we can't get the information. And we say, well, that happens in every accounts receivable assignment; there's no problem there. And then you say, well, that should be in State court. That's not right. I thought it was agreed, stipulated by you at the outset, that if there's a standard assignment for collection you can be in the Federal court; there is standing.",
  "And Article III.",
  "If you're saying, if you're saying that it's the aggregation that makes it difficult to reach everybody, well, that's a question of discovery, and it's still the aggregator's responsibility. If the aggregator can't answer necessary questions for discovery of the suit, the suit's dismissed.",
  "You also pay a price. I thought that's what you were going to get at. Talking about prudential standing, 1400 filing fees is pretty prudential.",
  "I'm sorry. The only way, it seems to me, that you can eliminate what you regard as a problem is by having 1400 separate actions, so that in any given case if you want discovery, your plaintiff, the person who has got to provide that discovery, is standing right there. And I don't see how you can get the benefits that you are claiming entitled to without having 1400 separate actions. If you don't have 1400 separate actions, whether you have an aggregation like this, whether you have a joint action, whether you have a class action, this problem of chasing down, as you describe it, is going to be there. So it seems to me the prudential question for this Court is: Do we really want to require 1400 separate actions so that you can have your perfect paradigm of private litigation? And to say, yes, we want 1400 actions, it seems to me is a stretch. What do you say?",
  "What does that have to do with -- I guess that goes to prudential standing.",
  "It has nothing to do with Article III standing.",
  "Are you saying, in effect, that if we get to the prudential-standing point, the answer is that in the absence of a rule comparable to Rule 23 we should not recognize prudential standing, but that if we adopted a rule that sort of regulated how this would work, prudential standing would be appropriate? Is that basically it?",
  "Mr. Englert, with respect to what weight we should give to those decisions, I just want to put a simple hypo and I'll ask a question on it. Assume that in this case the assignment -- well, assume another case, rather, in which the assignment is identical is identical to this one, except that the terms of the second agreement, i.e., if I the aggregator collect anything I give it to you. Assume that is part of the first agreement, so that there is an assignment and as part of the assigning document there is a stated obligation on the part of the assignee to pay all proceeds to the assignor. I am assuming that your position would be the same; is that correct?",
  "Now, my question is, you're taking that position, I think, just as you did in response to Justice Scalia, on the grounds that there is a huge body of law that assignment for collection conveys adequate standing. But are any of the assignment for collection cases in that body of law clearly cases like the one in my hypothetical in which the assignment itself by its terms requires the total payment of any benefit back to the assignor?"
