  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In bankruptcy, as in many areas of the law, Congress has tried to balance on the one hand, doing case-specific justice, and on the other hand, ensuring that the statutory scheme is administrable. Now, Congress certainly could have chosen to elevate simplicity over accuracy by telling bankruptcy courts to take a debtor's current disposable income and multiply that number by the number of months in the plan in assessing whether the plan is confirmable. But there are several strong signals in the code that that is actually not what Congress intended courts to do.",
  "Certainly not, Justice Alito. Bankruptcy -­",
  "Well, bankruptcy courts -­ we are not saying that bankruptcy courts should ever speculate about what might happen in the future. What we are saying is that bankruptcy courts should take into account what they know, in this case, already has happened, but also what they know will happen. And so to give an example of a change that would benefit creditors, if as -- as I mentioned earlier, if a debtor has secured a higher-paying job just before or just after she filed her petition, a Court should be able to take into account the fact that her income going forward would be greater than would be reflected in the calculation of her current disposable income.",
  "Well, likely to happen based on what you know now. I think -- we haven't suggested a particular burden of proof. I think -­",
  "Right. So there is an example mentioned earlier: If the debtor is repaying a loan to her 401(k) program, that is the type of loan that can't be extended time-wise. And so she will keep making those payments, which will be deducted as an expense in the calculation of her current disposable income, but -- but you know at a certain point, she is likely to stop making those payments.",
  "Not according to what I heard Mr. Goldstein say at the argument. Again, we do not mean to suggest that a court should use -­",
  "I think, in part, it depends on what type of change you are talking about. Again, we would never say that a court should speculate about what should happen. But, for instance, to take another example on the expense side, if a debtor when she proposes her plan owns a second home, a vacation home that is secured by a mortgage, then that secured debt payment is an expense that would be deducted from her income in the calculation of her current disposable income. But if she proposes to surrender that property as a condition of her plan, she will no longer have that debt payment going forward. And so that's the type of -- so it will no longer be an expense going forward. Under Petitioner's view, a court would not be able to take into account the fact that that current expense -­",
  "Well, again, in this -­",
  "Okay. But then, we wouldn't -- we are not trying to advance that view of \"likely.\" And again, in this case the change had already occurred, so there is no uncertainty about what her situation is now and what we can project it to be going forward.",
  "Well, this is -­",
  "Well, except that if the creditor or a trustee objects, then the calculation of projected disposable income is one of the conditions of confirmability of the plan. The court can't confirm it unless it can -­",
  "I'm sorry, if she got a higher-paying job just before? Is that what you're suggesting?",
  "Well, it could affect the -- well, one thing that is important to note that hasn't been brought up is under Section 1325(a)(6), the court is actually -- which is the feasibility provision -- the Court is actually required to think about what is going to happen in the future, whether a debtor is going to be able to repay her creditors. And so it doesn't make very much sense to, on the one hand, require a court to consider what it knows will happen in the future in determining feasibility, and then on the other hand, if there's an objection by the creditor or the trustee and 1325(b) comes into play, to prohibit a court from considering the same facts it knows about what is going to happen in the future -­",
  "Well, I think one purpose of having the 6-month lookback period in the calculation of current income is exactly to take into account those situations. There are many people who are gainfully employed full time, but whose -- whose income fluctuates over time. And so requiring that courts use the 6-month lookback period, I think, gives creditors a better sense of whether the current income figure provided by the debtor is accurate. It reduces the chance for strategic filing because it sort of takes some of the significance away of the time of filing. And so it seems fairer in that case to consider that 6-month average in a case where income fluctuates up and down as an accurate sense of what the -- what the debtor's current income is. And again, in many -- in a significant number of cases the calculation of a current disposable income will be a good prediction of what the debtor's disposable income will be going forward.",
  "Well, the special circumstances exception comes in, in the calculation of the debtor's current disposable income, but it doesn't tell you what to do in terms of projecting that disposable income. And so you can adjust what you think the current disposable income is based on an expense that isn't accounted for in the standard expenses or an expense that is accounted for, but is higher than is accounted for in those expenses. But again, it doesn't tell you what to do -- how to project that number going forward.",
  "Well, that is certainly true of this debtor, of the Respondent in this case. That is not an option available to all debtors, many of whom are facing foreclosure proceedings or imminent foreclosure proceedings. Delay is simply not an option. And if I could address Section 101(10A)(A)(ii) option that the Petitioner offers -- I mean, one thing to note is it doesn't give the Court the discretion to set any other -- to just pick any other 6-month lookback period. They pick a date and go 6 months back from whatever that date is. So if a change occurs very soon before the filing of the petition, it makes it very hard for a court to use that provision to change the lookback period because you would have to wait 6 months, essentially, after the filing of the petition to set it back. But again, the biggest problem with using that section as a workaround is that that is an option that is available to debtors, but not to creditors. If a debtor files a Chapter 13 petition along with all the Schedules that are required under Section 521 of the code, then the debtor has no option for -- excuse me, the creditor has no option and the trustee has no option -­",
  "They can object to confirmation of the plan, but on what -- what basis? If the Petitioner argues that the calculation of projected disposable income is merely a mechanical multiplication of the current disposable income times 60 or 36, then they have no way of allowing the court to take account of a change that has happened just before or after the time of the petition that would inure to the creditor's benefit.",
  "They could say that, but it's not clear in the code that that is a basis for refusing to confirm a plan. I think they would have to make the argument that -­",
  "I think unless there were bad faith it's not clear how that can be a basis for not confirming a plan, and that was the -- the reason that my friend on Petitioner's counsel suggested. But again, it's not clear how that would be bad faith, if a debtor proposes a plan that -- that commits all of her projected disposable income under the trustee's view of what that number is, it's hard to see how you could say that that was a plan that was proposed in bad faith. So again, I just want to -- just to respond to the -- the argument that the government in Respondent's view reads the 6-month period totally out of the code -­",
  "Okay. The calculation of a -- a debtor's current disposable income will often be a reliable predictor of her future disposable income and when that's the case, then a reliable way of projecting is simply be multiplying.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Respondent in this case agrees that when it accepts Federal funds for its correctional system it voluntarily waives its sovereign immunity to private suits in Federal court to enforce RLUIPA, and it is clear under this Court's decisions in cases such as Franklin and Barnes that that voluntary waiver encompasses a waiver to suits for money damages.",
  "Well, it would depend on the context to answer both questions.",
  "Then the answer would be yes as to the States. This Court has been clear in cases such as Franklin and Barnes that in the Spending Clause context, unless Congress indicates an intent to rebut the presumption somehow -­",
  "In the Federal Government probably not, although this Court has looked to background principles in interpreting words such as \"appropriate.\"",
  "Well, I would say two things. First, in both cases what you want is a clear statement of an intent to waive the sovereign's immunity, either by the Federal Government or the State government. And also that it's important to keep in mind that in cases such as Franklin and Barnes, this Court was construing statutes that did not say anything about what remedies were appropriate, didn't mention remedies whatsoever. And so we don't rely so much on RLUIPA's use of the phrase \"appropriate relief\" as we do on the Spending Clause context.",
  "Those cases did not involve States, that's true. But -­",
  "On the contrary, as to the dignity point, Your Honor, if -- the State voluntarily waives its immunity when it accepts Federal funds that clearly condition the acceptance of the funds on the waiver of its immunity. The State in this case doesn't contest that it has waived its sovereign immunity voluntarily to some universe of suits to enforce RLUIPA.",
  "No, Your Honor.",
  "If you were construing a State statute that voluntarily waived its own immunity, then you might -- we might say the use of appropriate relief in that statute should be construed the same as the use of appropriate relief in RFRA. But in this case you are not talking about a State's waiver of its immunity through its -- through statutory language. The Court said in College Savings Bank that when a -- when a State takes Federal funds that are conditioned on a waiver of immunity, it is the act of accepting the funds that is the waiver and it waives its immunity to suits to the extent that it has noticed that it is doing so.",
  "That's right. But again, it's -- it's the act of accepting the funds that are clearly conditioned that constitutes the waiver. So that the waiver -­",
  "But there is no basis in either the Eleventh Amendment or the statutory provisions in RLUIPA for distinguishing relief of an injunctive nature from relief in damages against the State. The Eleventh Amendment talks about suits in law and in equity, and there is nothing in RLUIPA that would give the States notice that they are waiving their immunity to suits for injunctive relief, but not give them notice that they are waiving their immunity to suits for money damages. This Court -­",
  "But even -­",
  "Well, two things if I could, Your Honor. In Lane v. Pena, the question before the Court was it wasn't -- it was outside the Spending Clause context, because the question was whether section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act applied to the Federal Government, and when the Federal Government applies, even in the Spending Clause context, conditions on itself there is no contract-like relationship. But the second thing this Court said in Barnes -­",
  "It has to be unequivocal, but -- but the context in which you are construing whether -- whether the sovereign is expressing its intent to waive its immunity is different when you are talking about the Federal Government applying obligations on itself than when you are talking about the Federal Government offering money to a State in -­ in exchange for its agreeing to comply with -­",
  "Right. And again, we are not relying so much on the use of the phrase \"appropriate relief\" in the statute. What that -- the work that does is it affirms that the background presumption of the Bell v. Hood cases applies to proper defendants under RLUIPA, which include State governments. But as this Court said in Barnes, when a -­ when a recipient of Federal funds takes the funds, it is on notice that it is going to be subject not only to the remedies explicitly provided in the text of the relevant legislation, but also to remedies that are traditionally available in suits for breach of contract, and those include compensatory damages and injunctive relief. Now the State would have this Court turn that presumption, in terms of traditional contract rules, on its head by saying that this -- that this Court should hold that the State presumptively waived its immunity to suits for injunctive relief but not for damages.",
  "Well, I would give you the same answer I just gave, which is that we are not pointing so much to the use of the -- using the phrase \"appropriate relief\" in the statute as we are to the Spending Clause context. And this Court has held that when there is these conditions placed on Federal funds, the recipient of the funds understands when it takes the money that when it intentionally violates the conditions to which it has agreed it will be subject to suit for money damages.",
  "Well, this Court has consistently applied a clear notice requirement to conditions that Congress places on Federal funds. That clear notice requirement arose out of cases like Pennhurst and South Dakota v. Dole, in which there were State recipients of Federal funds. And the Court said that the validity of Congress's constitutional action in exercising its Spending Clause authority depends on it giving the recipients of the funds clear notice of the conditions that they are agreeing to because of the contract-like nature of Spending Clause legislation. Now, that same rule was applied in Franklin and Gebser and Davis and Dole, even though the defendants in those cases were not sovereigns. It's still the same notice requirement and there is no reason to think that a county government would be able to understand, would be on notice that it would be subject to compensatory damages suits, and a State government would not. To be sure, the State government has more to give up. It might be a harder choice for the State about whether to take the money or not. But the choice is the State's, and when it says yes, I'm going to take this money, it agrees to the conditions that are attached to the money.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted section 1512(a)(1)(C), it sought to protect the integrity of Federal criminal investigations and prosecutions. The statute requires the government to prove four things -- an actus reus, a mens rea and two Federal nexus elements, one of which is at issue in this case. The actus reus is murder, the mens rea that's common to every prosecution under section 1512(a)(1)(C) is an intent to prevent the communication of information to a law enforcement officer. The first Federal nexus element requires that that information relate to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense; and the second Federal nexus element, the one at issue in this case, requires that there's a reasonable possibility that the information would have been communicated to a Federal officer if the murder had not occurred.",
  "Well, it comes from trying to construe all the different relevant provisions of the statute to make sense together. Section (a)(1)(C) specifies that a defendant has to have an intent to prevent the communication of the relevant information to a law enforcement officer; section 1515 tells us that the law enforcement officer has to be a Federal law enforcement officer, that's the definitional section; and then section 1512(g)(2) specifies that the government doesn't need to prove any state of mind about the fact that the officer is a Federal officer.",
  "Yes. In our view there are two different ways to prove a violation of the statute. One is if you just read section (a)(1)(C), a natural reading of that section is that if a -- if defendant has a specific intent to prevent a communication to a Federal officer specifically, then that's a violation of the statute. What subsection (g)(2) tells us is that you don't need to prove a Federal officer's specific intent for every violation of the statute, but if you can prove that, then that's enough. And so in this case there's no evidence that the Petitioner had a specific intent as to a Federal officer, but, for example, if Officer Horner had said, hey, I'm the FBI or hey, I'm calling the FBI right now, and then he had killed him, that would have been enough whether it were true or not.",
  "Yes, that's right, and in section (g)(2) it's described as a circumstance that the Federal, that the officer in question is a Federal officer, and so that's -- that's a fact in the world that the jury needs to make a determination about. Of course, it's a fact in the world about -­",
  "That's okay. I was going to say it's a fact in the world about something that by -- by the design of the defendant is never going to happen. The communication that's at issue when you -­ when you don't have the Federal officer's specific intent, is a communication that's never going to happen, and so the jury has to make a reasonable prediction about what could have happened in the absence of the murder.",
  "If they -- if they -­",
  "But if -- if the same -­",
  "So they say, we have to shoot this guy to keep him from talking to the FBI? That's still a violation of the statute, because they have the requisite intent as to a Federal officer.",
  "Well, just to be clear, the realistic possibility part only comes in where the defendant doesn't have a specific intent as to the Federal officer specifically. So, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, the intent was to prevent a communication to the FBI in particular, and if a defendant has that specific Federal officer, a specific intent, it doesn't matter whether it might have happened, would have happened, could have happened. Where the reasonable possibility standard comes in is in cases like this one, where the defendant has an intent to prevent a communication to a law enforcement officer for sure, but doesn't have any specific intent as to the Federal nature.",
  "Well, I think the jury instruction would say, you know, you need to make a determination about what could have happened if the murder hadn't occurred, and if you find that there is a reasonable possibility that there would have been a communication with the Federal officer -- and that can be proved in any number of different ways in any particular case -- then you find that there's a violation of the statute.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I think that's an interpretation of the statute the government could live with, but the effect of that -­",
  "But that -- indeed. But that is a more aggressive reading than the reading we're offering, because Congress went to the extra step of defining \"law enforcement officer\" to mean \"Federal law enforcement officer.\" So the interpretation you're positing would essentially read that out of the statute.",
  "Right. The reason -­",
  "I mean, Congress could have written the statute that way, but when Congress defined \"law enforcement officer\" to mean \"Federal law enforcement officer,\" presumably, they meant that to mean something. And in (g)(2), what they do is they take the Federal nature of the law enforcement officer out of the mens rea part of the offense, but they describe it as a circumstance, and so that presumably is -- has to relate to something that could have happened in the world in the absence of the murder.",
  "Correct.",
  "Except that not all crimes that could be prosecuted as Federal crimes are prosecuted as Federal crimes. For example, there are -­ most drug crimes are prosecuted by State authorities rather than by Federal authorities, even though -­",
  "Not all of them. If -­",
  "No, it doesn't. And I think in a particular case, if the drug crime is the underlying crime, that could serve as the predicate crime. But I think that what matters is what the jury has reason to conclude, and jurors generally don't understand the way that the Federal system works vis-à-vis the State system. And so if there's no reason for the jury to think that the information might have gone to Federal officers, then they wouldn't have a basis for a conviction under the statute.",
  "You could -- you could give that instruction, but I -- I think -- I took the hypothetical from Justice Scalia to be that you wouldn't need to show that there's any -- any chance that the communication would have gone to a Federal officer. And I think that would read the Federal officer definition out of the statute, if all that was required was that the offense be a Federal offense. And then could you just say, well, you know, in theory -- and it's true that anybody who has information about a commission of a Federal offense, theoretically, could someday choose to give that information to a Federal officer, but that -­",
  "I think it would, Justice Alito. I think in the first case, the jury wouldn't have a reasonable basis to conclude that the information might have gone to Federal officers in the absence of the murder. In the second case, they would have a very reasonable basis to make that inference.",
  "It doesn't have anything to do with the defendant's intent. Again, there are two different ways, in our view, to prove a violation of the statute. One is if the defendant has a specific intent about preventing communication to a specifically Federal officer. If the Federal nature of the officer is in his mind, that's one way to prove a violation of the statute. If he doesn't have that specific intent, which is going to be in most cases, honestly, that are prosecuted under the statute, then you have to prove that there's some reasonable possibility that that communication would have happened -­",
  "But in your hypothetical, which I think you borrowed from Justice Alito, there was a specific intent to prevent a communication with the FBI, and so there they have the Federal officer specific intent.",
  "But the reason it's weird is because the design of the defendant in killing the victim is to prevent something from happening, and then the jury is asked to make a -- make a determination of whether that thing might have happened or not. And so you don't -- if you place too high a burden on the government, you're basically giving a defendant who acts efficiently and early in the criminal process a leg up, because you're -- if you require the government to prove that it's more likely than not that the communication in question would have happened with the Federal officer, then what you're doing is you're not giving sufficient protection to those communications to Federal officers that would cause a Federal investigation to be initiated. Right? You're -- it's not how -­",
  "Well, I guess what we see -- where we see the -- sort of the ballpark is, either the government needs to prove that it's more likely than not that it would have happened, or they just need to prove that it's a reasonable possibility. And so we would opt for the second of those two options. You could -­",
  "The difference in proof -­ I mean, it depends on the particular case. Right? In many of the cases that are actually prosecuted under the statute, there's already a Federal investigation underway, and in those cases, this element -­",
  "Easy to prove, yes.",
  "So the cases that are at issue are cases like this, where the murder happens almost contemporaneously with the Federal criminal activity. And in those cases, nobody's had a chance to even think about initiating an investigation, and so -­ but those initial communications are vital to protecting the Federal interest and protecting the integrity of Federal investigations.",
  "Right. And if I -- I would like to try to separate. There is the question of what is the element of the crime, how -- how do we define it, then what -- what is the evidence you would introduce to satisfy that element. In this case, certainly the government could have introduced evidence that -- that local law enforcement officers report all evidence of bank robberies to the FBI. That would have been enough. They didn't introduce that evidence. What they introduced instead was that when local law enforcement officers later got the information through other sources, they then shared the information with Federal officers. If they hadn't proven that, our contention is it wouldn't -- the evidence would not have been sufficient to sustain the conviction.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think it would be insufficiently protective of the Federal interests to say that you could only -- that you would look at what the defendant had in mind about what the chain of communication might be if he didn't murder the person who was witnessing the crime. Most defendants don't think, wow, you know, if Officer Horner is going to call the dispatch, the dispatch is going to call, you know, the other person in the Haines City police department, they're going to call the sheriff, they're going to call the Federal law enforcement officers, most defendants wouldn't have -- wouldn't be thinking down that -- sort of down the chain of communication that way. But the statute criminalizes killing someone to prevent the communication, not a communication, not a particular communication, but the communication by any person of information relating to the commission of a Federal crime.",
  "I mean, many of these things are not -- in many of these cases, this is not an element that's difficult to prove. If, as you say, it's a witness in a particular investigation or is going to testify in a particular trial who has been murdered, then it's easy to prove that the Federal officer nexus has been satisfied. But Congress was also trying to protect information that would cause Federal investigations to be initiated. Those are important communications. If you allow murders of people who witness crimes in order to prevent them from reporting that information to law enforcement officers, where the reporting of that information would have caused a Federal investigation to be initiated, then you're insufficiently protecting the Federal interest in prosecuting Federal crimes.",
  "Not unless the custodian of the cemetery was on his cell phone saying I'm calling 911. So, if we -- what's important -­",
  "Well, in terms of whether the evidence that was presented in this case was sufficient, it was sufficient because the jury knew two things. They knew, first, that Officer Horner definitely would have communicated the information that's relevant in the case to local law enforcement officers; and second, they knew that when local law enforcement officers later acquired that information from other sources, they shared it with Federal officers. So if you didn't know the first step, if you didn't know that definitely the person who was killed would have communicated to local law enforcement officers, then there wouldn't be a reason -- first of all, you might not have -- have the correct specific intent to prevent communication with a law enforcement officer which is required.",
  "Yes. Go ahead.",
  "Yes.",
  "I guess in our view it's less important which words you pick -­",
  "Than it is what they mean. And, so, if by realistic -- realistic probability or realistic likelihood -­",
  "Right. And it's not -- it doesn't perfectly map on to the problem in this case, of course, because there is subsection (g)(2), which specifically says you take intent out of the equation. And, so, I'll concede it's an awkwardly constructed statutory provision. But I think the important -­",
  "I would agree with that, so what we would like -­",
  "Well, we -- again, it depends what it -- what you mean by realistic possibility or likelihood. If you mean more likely than not, then we would say that's too high a burden on the government. We want to include odd possibilities but not outlandish possibilities.",
  "Well, I mean, we -- we attach the word reasonably to possible to sort of to wall off cases that are theoretically possible, right? So again, we would like to cover odd occurrences but not outlandish occurrences, so it's not just anything that's possible. It's -- the jury has to have a reason to think it might have happened in this case.",
  "With respect, Your Honor, we don't -- we don't think that's correct. I think there needs to be a reason for the jury to think that if this communication had not been prevented, the information eventually would have gone to Federal officers. The reason -­",
  "Because, the reality is that not information -- that all local law enforcement officers share every piece of information about Federal offenses with -­",
  "There's a possibility, but I think -­",
  "And again that's -- if that's how the Court wanted to go, that's something the government could live with. But -­",
  "Well, there's a 10-month lapse between when Gamble went to the local law enforcement officers and when Gamble testified before the Federal grand jury. So presumably the Federal -­ the AUSA was brought in sometime in that 10-month period. So, it wasn't that long a lapse.",
  "I don't know the difference. I mean, Gamble when he was -- hew was indicted eventually for 14 Federal offenses to which he pled guilty and was sentenced initially to life plus 107 years. Some of the -- some of the crimes for which he was indicted could not have been prosecuted in State court; but presumably he could have gotten a life sentence for murdering a police officer if he had been prosecuted in State court as well.",
  "No, we would say it is satisfied if everything else was the same.",
  "Because it -- it's still information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense, we still know that Officer Horner definitely would have transmitted that information to local law enforcement officers, and we still know that when local law enforcement officers later got the information, they would -- they transmitted it to Federal -­",
  "It's true. And just to be clear, we're not saying that that communication that happened in 2002 is the communication that was prevented or intended to be prevented. What we're saying is that the fact when local cops got the information in 2002, they shared it with Federal officers, that that's a reason for the jury to infer that they would have done the same thing if they had gotten the information -­",
  "Well, I think -­",
  "Well, of course, we don't know what would have happened, because Officer Horner was murdered to prevent any of this from happening, but in fact, the evidence before the jury suggested that it wasn't the murder that motivated them to share the information with Federal officers; it was one of the underlying robberies. It was the robbery of the Holiday Inn, which was a Federal offense. The statute of limitations had run on that in State court, and so they wanted to -- but they wanted to maximize the amount of charges they could bring against Chris Gamble. And so they decided to share that information with Federal officers. So it wasn't the murder that made the difference; it was one of the underlying Federal offenses that was charged against -- as one of the predicate crimes against Petitioner here.",
  "It could, but Justice Scalia, I want to point out that subsections (A) and (B) of (a)(1), those are the provisions that talk about official proceedings. Subsection (a)(1)(C), which is the provision that's at issue here, does not talk about official proceedings. It talks about transferring information to Federal -- to law enforcement officers or to judges. And so there doesn't -- I think by -- just by reading, sort of a plain reading of those provisions together means that for subsection (C), you don't need to have an official proceeding that was in anyone's mind or that was underway at the time.",
  "It could, yes, and again, I think if the defendant has a Federal officer specific intent in mind when he commits the murder, that's enough.",
  "No, there is -- there is violation, if there's a reasonable possibility -­",
  "I'm not -- I don't mean to give that -- this is a case where there's not a specific Federal officer intent. I may have misunderstood the question as it was put to me. If there's no specific Federal officer intent, but you can prove that there's a reasonable possibility that one of the communications prevented by the murder would have been with a Federal officer -­",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think it's helpful in this case to try to separate out the field pre-emption issues from the conflict pre-emption issues. In the Government's view, the only issue properly presented in this case is whether Petitioners' tort claims fall within the field pre-empted by the LIA, and our view is that they do not because they arise from injuries that occurred when the locomotive was not in use. Now, Respondent would have the Court expand the field that's pre-empted by the LIA to include any claim that has anything to do with locomotive equipment, regardless of whether the equipment or the locomotive was in use at the time injury occurred. But it doesn't make sense to - -",
  "Absolutely.",
  "I completely agree with what you're saying. And -- and I'm sorry if you missed -- if we didn't state our position clearly in our brief. Our view is that those kinds of requirements - - requirements that go to the design, construction, or materials on a locomotive that will be used, if those requirements are directed at the repair shop, then they would be conflict pre-empted. But they wouldn't fall within the field that's governed by LIA because the LIA's substantive standard of care only applies to locomotives that are in use.",
  "No, I'm sorry. And let me clarify. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify. In our view, what the conflict is, is not a conflict with a Federal rule saying you have to use this piece of equipment and you can't use that piece of equipment. The conflict is with one of the purposes of the LIA, which is that the Federal Government be the only regulator of equipment that will be used on a locomotive. And so, what that means is if -- if the Federal Government hasn't spoken as to whether piece of equipment A can be used on a locomotive, that means that it can be, that the manufacturers know that it's okay. And if you have a State rule that would have the effect of dictating the equipment that can be used on a locomotive, that would conflict with the single regulator objective of the LIA.",
  "Well, I think it depends on what the warning claim is.",
  "Well, under the -- under the Respondents' -- under the Respondents' view of the field that's pre-empted, a State could not regulate the disposal of equipment that's removed from a locomotive during their repair process, even though - -",
  "No. But also - -",
  "Also, in Respondents' view a State could not regulate workplace hazards, such as by requiring that workers wear goggles or masks.",
  "Yes, but when you're - -",
  "No. I think you could - - I'm sorry. I think you could imagine a world where a State says when a locomotive comes into a repair shop, the railroad or the repair shop has to attach a certain kind of clamp on the wheels, a certain kind of brake, that makes sure that the locomotive won't move while it's in the repair shop. And when you're done repairing the locomotive, you take them off, and the locomotive goes back - -",
  "Well, I think in this case the claims that we say would not be conflict pre-empted or within the field are claims -- are the failure-to-warn claims. Now, how a manufacturer actually issues the warning that would be required I think is a question that could be worked out as the case proceeds.",
  "Well, again, I think it depends how the warning is issued. You could require that the manufacturer tell the purchaser of the products to pass the warning along, to post warnings in a repair shop. You know, there - -",
  "They could require it contractually through the sale of the products. I think those sorts of detailed issues would be things that would be worked out on remand in this case. Again, in our view, the only question squarely presented in this case is the field pre-emption question. And - -",
  "No. The LIA -- the standard of care under the LIA only goes to whether a locomotive is safe for use, and that is also the limit of the FRA's regulatory authority. This Court, in the United States v. B&O, addressed that issue. The ICC at the time had issued a regulation requiring a certain kind of reverse gear instead of a different kind of reverse gear.",
  "Because the statute says safe for use on -- safe for use on the line. It's safe for use on lines of interstate commerce.",
  "Well, again the LIA only applies to the locomotives. So, if the thing that's broken that you could fix while it's in use would not make the locomotive unsafe to use, then it would not be a violation of the statute to use it while - -",
  "The line is in use versus not in use. And that tends to match - -",
  "Well, if it's -- if the fact that it's broken makes the locomotive unsafe to use, then the railroad cannot use it, cannot repair it while it's in use.",
  "That's right. But here the injuries occur when the locomotive is not in use because it's in the repair shop. And in those situations, the LIA's substantive heightened duty of care doesn't even apply. And so, it doesn't make sense to think of those claims as being within the field that's pre-empted by the LIA because they're not governed by the LIA. Now, those claims might bump up against the LIA in a different way by conflicting again with the - -",
  "Well, we agree that they might be barred. I think, you know, this case comes to the Court without any real development of the plaintiffs' claim. All we have is what they stated in their complaint. Their complaint incorporates a master complaint which applies to all sorts of different kinds of plaintiffs. And so, I think it's really hard to understand exactly what their claims are, what the effect of their claims would be with respect to the design defect claims. And so, in our view, they would -- the design defect claims would be pre-empted if they would have the effect of dictating the character of equipment that could be on a locomotive while it was in use.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "It is a big case for the government. As you suggest, the government is in the position of -- that actually many secured creditors are in these days, which is that we have constraints on our ability to cash bid at the sale of our collateral through a bankruptcy. And the detailed cramdown provisions of Chapter 11 are designed to protect the rights of secured creditors. The essence of being a secured creditor, of course, as the Court has suggested, is that the secured creditor has bargained for the right either to get its money back or to get the thing that secures its loan, to get its collateral. And the type of sale that is contemplated in clause (ii) of Section 1129(b)(2)(A) is precisely designed to guarantee that the creditor will get the benefit of its bargain.",
  "Well, in most Chapter 11 cases, the U.S. trustee doesn't play a role because it's a debtor in possession. And so the trustee is not in charge of the property of the estate. The debtor --",
  "Where the -- where the United States is a creditor. That -- that's true. But if there's --",
  "The trustee is there. But, if the debtor proposes a plan that wouldn't allow the United States to credit bid at an auction that is selling its collateral, then the United States is usually out of luck because the Antideficiency Act prevents us from bidding cash. Now, I would like to respond to one -- one sort of assumption that has seemed to permeate the conversation here, which is that a secured creditor will always have an incentive to bid the full amount of its claim at an auction of its assets, where the auction is supposed to be free of liens. That is actually not true. As my friend Ms. Maynard suggested, unless a bank is trying to get into the business of running a hotel or running whatever business is the collateral, the creditor will only want to take the property if it thinks it can make a profit by then turning around and selling the property. So if there is an auction, where there is a cash bid, and the creditor thinks that the value of -- the amount of the cash bid is actually a fair valuation of the property, the creditor has no incentive to bid higher than that in credit because it has no expectation of getting more money than that when it then takes the property and turns around and sells it. So allowing the credit bidding won't have the effect of serving as a veto on what would be a fair sale price by a cash bidder. The -- the secured creditor's incentive is only to bid up to what it -- up to what it views as the value of the property and not a penny more because it's not trying to take the property just for the property's sake. In most cases, it wants to take the property and then sell the property.",
  "I mean, it has more flexibility because it has already put up its money. But every bidder has that incentive that you suggest, which is to try to make sure that it's -- to sort of game the system a little bit and -- and -- and make everybody put their money where their mouth is. But Congress gave secured creditors a right to have a role, where they get to put their money where their mouth is, any time there is --",
  "Absolutely. And -- and Petitioner is certainly correct, that the phrase \"indubitable equivalence,\" an unusual phrase in the statute, that that phrase is broad enough to cover any type of disposition of a secured creditor's claim, including the sale of property free of liens. But Congress also enacted two much more specific provisions right next to clause (iii). And, in those provisions, number (i), which governs -- governs the retention of liens on -- on collateral, and number (ii), which governs the sale of -- the sale of collateral free of liens, there are very specific protections written into clauses (i) and clause (ii). And this Court's interpretive canon that a specific provision will trump a more general provision, where both could apply, would seem clearly to apply here. If a plan proposes a disposition of a claim that is addressed by a clause (i) or a clause (ii), it doesn't make any sense to allow them to strip out protections that are provided in those clauses by purporting to go under the more general standard of indubitable equivalence. That is especially true because the type of judicial valuation of the property that would take place under Petitioners' type of scheme is not guaranteed to make sure that the creditor gets what it bargained for, which is either its money or its property, but that is exactly what clause (ii), that type of auction, is guaranteed to do.",
  "Well, the type of sale contemplated in clause (ii) is, essentially, a liquidation of the secured creditor's lien on a property. And so you -- the sale would, essentially, liquidate the lien. And then clause (ii) provides that -- that there would need to be a replacement lien on the proceeds of the sale. That replacement lien would then have to be treated under clause (i) or clause (iii). I think it's fair to say, in most situations, what happens is that the proceeds of the sale are handed over to the secured creditor, which is essentially a clause (iii) treatment of the lien on the proceeds, in the sense that, if the lien on the proceeds is a lien on the pile of cash, if you hand over the pile of cash, you're surrendering the collateral that is securing that lien, which is the classic example of indubitable equivalence. That is one of the examples cited in the legislative history and in Judge Hand's opinion in In re Murel. I think one of the assumptions that permeates the Petitioners' brief is that valuation -- that the value of collateral is something we can all know and agree upon. But valuation is an inherently difficult undertaking. And this Court has recognized that, when Congress enacted the code in 1978, it shifted the preference to move from judicial valuation towards market valuations. And, here, Congress, in clause (ii), expressed its view that -- that the type of market that would value this property would include one of the most interested market participants, who is -- which is the secured creditor who has an interest in the property.",
  "They -- they definitely do. But I think, here, Congress provided that this would be a situation where the secured creditor would have a role in valuing the property, and even under -- as Justice Kagan pointed out, even -- I think it was Justice Kagan -- under clause (i), the judge has a role in valuing the property because we have to determine the present day value of the cash stream that the creditor would be owed. But as judge -- as my friend -- as Ms. Maynard pointed out -- maybe you will be a judge some day --",
  "The creditor in that situation has a role in -- in protecting itself against undervaluation because it can make the 1111(b) election, retain the full amount of its claim if it wants, and -- and protect itself going forward. I think one way that's important is that it protects -- it prevents debtors from cashing out creditors at a low value, at a point where the -- in the market where the value of the property is low because they retain the lien for the full amount. The same thing is true here. If this is a particularly low point in the market and the creditor is trying to sell the property at auction -- I'm sorry -- the debtor is trying to sell the property at auction, the creditor can come in and take the property and realize any -- any upside down the road. If there are no further questions?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to start if I could with Justice Scalia's -- I'm sorry.",
  "That's always been our position, Justice Sotomayor. Our position has consistently been that the only decisions of the MSPB that can get review in a district court are decisions on the issue of discrimination.",
  "No, Your Honor.",
  "Again, we don't think any of them should and --",
  "I agree that there is no basis for the distinction and part of that is because, as my friend Mr. Schnapper pointed out, there is an EEOC regulation providing that when the board dismisses a case on jurisdictional grounds the case can go back to the agency, the agency can essentially reissue its final decision, and then the plaintiff goes in to district court. So if the whole point is to find a way for an employee to get into district court on her discrimination claim, we've already had that taken care of in jurisdictional dismissal cases. So the action really here is with procedural dismissals. And if -- I would like to start with Justice Scalia's line of questions about whether there has been a repeal of the right to go to district court on discrimination claims. And I think our starting point is in the Federal Courts Improvement Act which is 28 USC 1295(a)(9), which provides that review of MSPB decisions is exclusively in the Federal circuit. This court is recently -- most recently in Elgin, but in various cases over of the last 25 years has seen that that is an exclusive grant of judicial review of jurisdiction in the Federal circuit over MSPB final decisions, and as the Court pointed out in Elgin the only exception to that is for the subset of final board decisions that are covered in 7703(b)(2). And if you look at 7703(b)(2) the only reference to a final board decision is at the top of page 17(a) of the Government's brief is to judicially reviewable actions under section 7702. Now we put a lot of emphasis on the phrase judicially reviewable action and the reason we do that is because throughout the entire U.S. Code that phrase is only ever used either in or in reference to section 7702.",
  "It means that it's not a judicially reviewable action under 7702.",
  "Well, in our view, again, because it uses the phrase \"judicially reviewable action\" under 7702 and that phrase \"judicially reviewable action\" in the whole U.S. Code is only ever used when you are talking about 7702, that -- in our view that's the signal that that's a term of art in this context. So although dismissal on procedural grounds is a board action subject to judicial review, in our view it's not a judicially reviewable action under 7702. And so you need to look at 7702 to see how --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. A procedural dismissal by the board is a final board action that's subject to judicial review in the Federal Circuit.",
  "Yes.",
  "But it does not fall within the term of art \"judicially reviewable action\" under 7702.",
  "Say it again? I'm sorry?",
  "This is going to happen a lot.",
  "That's right. It does not fall within --",
  "-- the exception to exclusive --",
  "-- review. It's a tough statute. In our view, our argument is the best reading of the overall statute. And again, because we think \"judicially reviewable action\" under 7702 is sort of the linchpin phrase in 7703(b)(2), we want to look to 7702 to how the phrase \"judicially reviewable action\" is used by Congress in that statute, and the relevant pages here are page 8a and 9a in the statutory appendix to the Government's brief.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I have two answers. The first is that in the last 25 years in all the cases where this Court has looked as section 7703, in Lindahl and Fausto and most recently in Elgin, the Court has interpreted the statute as it exists today, which as it exists today directs review of board decisions to the Federal Circuit. But the second answer is, even for that brief window after the CSRA was enacted before the Federal Circuit was created, Congress still had taken away jurisdiction from district courts over board decisions and had directed them to the courts of appeals. And this Court recognized in Fausto that that -- Congress specifically had that intent when it enacted the CSRA. It was tired of this concurrent jurisdiction in all the district courts throughout the country over Federal employment actions and it wanted to reduce a layer of review and direct them to fewer courts. Now --",
  "I disagree, Your Honor. I mean -- and there is nothing in 7702 or 7703 that would indicate that Congress wanted, even in 1978 to have MSPB final decisions reviewed in district court. And again, we don't need to assume that the Federal Circuit doesn't exist today because it does, and that's how this Court has construed the statute for the last 25 years, ever since the --",
  "Well, you look at 7702, and let me just say, even if you disagree with us that it's a term of art, it's hard to disagree with the fact that it has to be a judicially reviewable action under 7702. That's in the text of 7703(b)(2).",
  "But --",
  "Yes. Can I just take you back one sentence to say, the point is not just that the board is done, the point is that the board is done under 7702; that it has issued a decision under 7702, and so then, as you suggest, we look at 7702 and in that provision Congress specifies various points at which a final board decision under 7702 becomes a judicially reviewable action. The one that's relevant in this case is in subsection (a)(3), which is on page 9a in the middle of the page there. It says: \"Any decision of the board under paragraph (1)\" -- so that's 7702(a)(1) -- \"of this subsection shall be a judicially reviewable action, either when it's issued if the employee doesn't seek EEOC review or when the EEOC declines to hear the case.\" So in our view there are two indications in (a)(3) that tell you that it has to be a decision on the issue of discrimination in order to be a judicially reviewable action -- action under section 7702.",
  "No. I'm glad you asked that question. The directive in section -- that you're referring to is at the bottom of page 8a. The directive is that the board shall decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the board's appellate procedures. In this case the board complied with that directive by not deciding the issue of discrimination because the appeal was untimely. And I know that sounds a little strange when I first say it, so let me give you an analogous example. Imagine a State law that directed the DMV to issue a driver's license to any applicant in accordance -- in accordance with the procedures governing such applications. If the DMV required that driver's license applicants either pay a fee or submit to an eye exam, you wouldn't expect that they would have to issue a license to someone who refused to comply with those requirements. In that case the DMV would comply with the directive that it issue a license in accordance with its procedures by not issuing a license at all. And it's the same thing here. Here the board complied with the directive that it decide the issue of discrimination in accordance with its appellate procedures by not deciding the issue of discrimination and therefore not issuing a decision under 7703.",
  "But I think normally when a court dismisses a case based on timeliness you don't think of it as deciding the issue.",
  "That would certainly be simpler. And if it were up to us to make up the rules, maybe that's what we would decide.",
  "But what we're trying to do is figure out how much of an exception Congress wanted to create to the exclusive -- to the Federal circuit's exclusive jurisdiction to review MSPB decisions. In our view, its choice of the word issue is important, because it's not just deciding the case that alleges discrimination. It's the issue of discrimination.",
  "I'm sorry. Go ahead. There's another hint in paragraph (a)(3), and let me know if you want to jump in, but not just the direction to look at (a)(1), but paragraph (a)(3), another hint that Congress was really talking about cases where the board decides the issue of discrimination. In paragraph (a)(3), again, on (9)(a), Congress provides that a judicially reviewable action becomes -- becomes a judicially reviewable action when the employee decides not to seek review from the EEOC or when the EEOC decides not to take the case. Now, the only types of decisions from the board that the EEOC can review are decisions that reach an issue of discrimination. And so it would be strange to be talking about decisions under (a)(1) that the EEOC could review if you're talking about decisions that don't involve the issue of discrimination.",
  "I mean, the plaintiffs could then file a suit in district court and seek equitable tolling for having missed the deadline to file from the date of the final agency decision. And, in fact, that was one of the alternative bases for jurisdiction that was asserted in the district court below in this case.",
  "It depends on the case. In this case, we argued against equitable tolling because, in our view, she had missed the deadlines through her own fault. But if there was some reason to think that it wasn't really her fault for missing the deadlines for appealing and -- so that even though her appeal to the MSPB was, in fact, untimely, it wasn't really her fault, then we might not resist equitable tolling.",
  "I don't think that's correct. I didn't hear him say that; but, if he said that, I don't think -- I mean, I know it's not correct that the EEOC and MSPB disagree with --",
  "That was our position, you know, I think it was 30 years ago now. And since the Ballentine decision, the Government has had the other -- has had the position that we're asserting today, which is that the only --",
  "Yes. Yes. Our brief is filed on behalf of all the agencies in the United States that are affected by this.",
  "Yes. Excellent.",
  "Well, but some --",
  "But it's in a provision that's describing the exception to the general rule that's set out in 7703. So the general rule in 7703 is that when you're talking about final board decisions, judicial review of those decisions is in the Federal circuit. And this is at 16(a) and 17(a) in the Government's brief. It says, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2). So when you're looking to (b)(2), you're wondering -- you're asking what subset of final board actions -- that's -- final order or decision -- that's their language used in (a)(1) -- what subset of final orders or decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board fall within (b)(2). Now, in (b)(2), the only types of final orders that are described there is at the end of the section, judicially reviewable action under section 7702.",
  "Under --",
  "So even if you throw out the term of art --",
  "-- part of our argument, and all you look at is the last two words of that sentence, which is Section 7702, you still have to look at 7702 and figure out when Congress told you that a final board decision could be subject to judicial review. And the relevant place for this case where it did that is in section (a)(3), which is on page 9a. And there again, it points at (a)(1), which directs that the Board decide the issue of discrimination. So it says a decision under (a)(1) is -- is judicially reviewable. If a decision does not reach the issue of discrimination, it is not --",
  "Right. But again -- but the two time triggers would only come into play if a decision reached an issue of discrimination, because the EEOC can't review issues -- can't review dismissals on jurisdictional or procedural grounds. It can only -- the EEOC's review of the board's -- of a board decision is limited to its review of the board's interpretation of an anti-discrimination law or its application of those laws to a particular case.",
  "I mean, I'm not going to resist the idea that the CSRA is very complicated. I mean, every case this Court has had about the CSRA, they have remarked about how it is a complex statutory scheme. But I think Congress did accomplish in a pretty simple way what you suggest, which is directing that procedural rules should be reviewed in the Federal circuit, and it did that by making that the background rule. In 7703(a) and (b)(1), it says, final decisions of the board are reviewed in the Federal circuit, full stop only, except as provided in (b)(2). And then the question is, well, which of those decisions fall within (b)(2). In our view, you should not read that exception more broadly than necessary to accommodate employees' rights to have their discrimination claims determined de novo in district court. Here, the board decision, it decided two things. First, was Petitioner's appeal to the board timely; and, second, was there good cause to excuse her untimeliness. There is no reason to think that Congress would have wanted that Board decision to be reviewed anywhere other than the Federal circuit. The whole point of having the Federal circuit is to have a unified body of law governing certain things in the country that Congress really thought should be directed to one place, and that included board decisions.",
  "Right, but you would have had more uniformity than you would have had if the cases had continued to go to the district court, which is what -- which is what was happening before the CSRA, and Congress specifically wanted to stop that process.",
  "Yes.",
  "We don't quarrel with it.",
  "No --",
  "It is -- it is true that a small range of procedural issues governing the board's procedures might be heard in district court, but it is truly a very small universe of issues bordering on non-existent, and let me explain why. As suggested here, the only reason -- the only way it would come up is as part of an affirmative defense by the agency, a defense of exhaustion. But then generally speaking it would have to be a procedural issue that the Government, that the agency raised before the board and the board rejected. Now, the board's own regulations allow the board to waive any of its -- any of its regulatory requirements, including timeliness, for good cause. And so the Government would have to argue in the district court that essentially the board abused its discretion by not waiving a procedural objection, and that's a very high hurdle and I think it's really hard to imagine very many cases in which that's going to come up, where the Government's going to make that kind of argument. So although there's -- there's potential, there's a potential for a tiny bit of erosion of uniformity under our view, it is really a small universe of issues that could go to district court.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "I mean, I think Congress made the determination.",
  "But I think you can resolve the ambiguity in the use of the word \"issue\" by looking at the rest of (a)(3), which again ties the decision under (a)(1) to reviewability by the EEOC. I don't think there is any dispute that the EEOC can only review board decisions that involve an issue of discrimination, either an interpretation of an antidiscrimination law or an application of such a law to the facts of the case.",
  "But not because --",
  "Well, so just to be clear, we think the phrase \"judicially reviewable action\" should be given the same meaning in section (e) that it is given elsewhere in 7702.",
  "Our view is --",
  "So --",
  "Exactly. If the -- if the appeal is still pending before the board, that's when the escape hatch of (e) comes in, because it's just intended to prevent employees from being held hostage by board inaction.",
  "No, it only becomes nonsensical if you think it should apply to cases that are no longer pending before the board under section 7702. In our view, once the board issued a decision -- the decision in this case, it issued a decision under section 7701 which is the general provision governing board decisions, and then the case was no longer pending under section 7702. And so it wouldn't make sense to apply the escape hatch to cases in that situation.",
  "It is true that our commonsense gloss on the statute is not found in the text of the statute. But I think once the -- once the case has been decided under section 7701 on procedural grounds, it's no longer a 7702 case before the board. And so there is just no reason to think that subsection (e) would apply in the -- in that situation.",
  "Well, we raised that exhaustion argument as an alternative ground before the district court. The district court construed this case as seeking review of the board's decision, not seeking review of the agency's decision. Petitioner did not challenge that district court holding before the eighth circuit in her opening brief. She didn't flag that as issue in the cert petition papers, and so I think, although now she's suggested in the merits briefing that this case -- this Court maybe should really just decide whether she's seeking review of the agency decision instead of the board decision, in our view that's not really a question that is presented in -- in the case any longer. In our view she is seeking review over the board decision, the board decision decided that her appeal was untimely, that there wasn't good cause to excuse the untimeliness. There is no indication anywhere in the statute that Congress would have wanted that kind of board decision to be reviewed anywhere other than the Federal Circuit. And so in our view it does not fall within -- in the exception to exclusive Federal Circuit jurisdiction provided in (b)(2) because it does not decide the issue of discrimination. If there are no further questions?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Due Process Clause does not require the government to disprove withdrawal outside the limitations period because lack of withdrawal is not an element of the crime of conspiracy. This Court has been clear that the Winship burden attaches only to things that are elements in the constitutional sense. And when something is an element in the constitutional sense, then at least four consequences follow. As the Court has suggested, first, the government has to allege in the indictment in every case. Second, the -- the government has to prove it in every case. Third, the jury has to be instructed on it in every case. And fourth, a defendant can't waive the requirement that it be proved in his case by failing to raise it. But none of those things apply as to a statute of limitations - -",
  "Correct.",
  "So I guess I have two responses. The first is that it is a statute of limitations question, in the sense that the government proved -- and there is no dispute about this -- that the conspiracy that was charged did exist within the limitations period. And so the question is just did this particular member of the conspiracy - -",
  "He does, and there's no - -",
  "And an -- but when Petitioner talks about the membership or participation element, what he is really talking about is the agreement element. The government has to prove that each defendant who is charged with a conspiracy intentionally agreed to join the conspiracy. And there is no dispute that the government proved that with respect to Petitioner in this case - -",
  "But, again, the element is agreement, right? So we prove that he agreed to join the conspiracy, and we proved that each defendant agreed to join the conspiracy. We don't have to prove that that agreement happened in the limitations period, as long as we prove that the conspiracy continues to - -",
  "Well, we know it's not an element for the reasons I explained because it doesn't have to be charged in the indictment, it doesn't have to be proved in every case, the defendant can waive it. So it's not an element in the constitutional sense, for all of those reasons. We can also tell that, in the specific conspiracy context, it's not an element because this Court's decision in Hyde from 1912. In that case, the defendant, Mr. Schneider, who had raised the statute of limitations defense, had not done anything to participate in the charged conspiracy within what was then a three-year statute of limitations period. The jury was charged, he didn't do anything, the court said he didn't do anything. The court said, it's fine, he's still a member of the conspiracy because he has not taken an affirmative act to withdraw from the conspiracy. So that's how we know that some sort of active membership isn't an element of the crime, as long as the government has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that -- that the defendant joined the crime at some point and that the -- joined the conspiracy -- excuse me -- at some point, and that the conspiracy continued to exist in the - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "It did not have to do that, but there's no dispute - -",
  "Right. And, to be clear, I'm not sure it specifically used that phrase, but it charged -- it charged overt acts that were part of the conspiracy that happened within the five-year period.",
  "I'm not sure what -- I'm not sure exactly the language that is used in the indictment, but it - -",
  "This Court -- this Court has held since the Cook case that the -- the government does not have to charge that -- the satisfaction of the limitations period in the indictment.",
  "It's up to the defendant - -",
  "-- to raise it, right.",
  "But I think this Court has been clear, that it doesn't cause it to be an element of the crime. I mean, back as far as the Cook case, the Court said that it doesn't have to be -- timing is not an element -- is not of the essence of these crimes. And so it doesn't have to be charged in the indictment. And, again - -",
  "But what if it is? Of - -",
  "Then that doesn't -- that doesn't cause it to be an element of the crime. I think, again, there is no dispute in this case that the government proved that the conspiracy did exist within the limitations period. I don't think Petitioner is contesting that. What he is saying is that he wasn't a part of that conspiracy within the limitations period.",
  "That's true, but once the -- it's true that that's his argument. But once the government has proved that he willingly joined the conspiracy, which it did in this case, then the law presumes that every person who has willingly joined the conspiracy remains a member of an ongoing conspiracy, unless or until he takes some affirmative action to withdraw from the conspiracy.",
  "But it can't - -",
  "I mean, I think it can't be an element of the crime because, if the defendant doesn't raise it, the government doesn't have to prove it or disprove it, depending on how you look at it. So - -",
  "Well, you have to prove membership - -",
  "But withdrawal does not negate membership because, again, membership is really just the agreement. And, in fact, a withdrawal defense tends to confirm that a particular defendant agreed to join a conspiracy because there is nothing to withdraw from if he didn't join - -",
  "It's true, but the government has to prove that the defendant joined the conspiracy and the conspiracy continued to exist. And to bring you back to the Hyde - -",
  "This Court stated, in Grunewald, that the government bears the burden.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "We don't have to prove that he -- that the agreement happened in the limitations period or that any particular defendant did something to sort of re-agree within the limitations period. And that, again, is clear from this Court's decision in Hyde, where, in that case, the defendant raising the limitations defense had not done anything related to the conspiracy within the limitations period.",
  "Well, what the statute - -",
  "It -- that is the simplified version of his argument. I think, if you look at - -",
  "Okay. Well, if you look at Section -- if you look at Section 3282, which is the statute of limitations, it says that the crime - -",
  "What we have to prove is that the crime was committed within the limitations period. We proved that the crime was committed within the limitations period because the conspiracy existed in the limitations period. By operation of law, anyone who has willingly joined the conspiracy at some point remains a member of the conspiracy, unless or until he takes an affirmative step to withdraw.",
  "Absolutely. The way the statute of limitations defense operates within the conspiracy context is it asks the question whether and when a conspiracy was complete. But -- but the affirmative defense of withdrawal is actually an affirmative defense, even within that affirmative defense, because it asks the question whether a conspiracy was complete as to a particular defendant. And to take advantage of that affirmative - - affirmative defense within an affirmative defense, the defendant has to take some affirmative act. And it makes sense to require him to prove that he took those acts.",
  "It's very long.",
  "It was charged as an ongoing conspiracy. It started before the beginning of the limitations period.",
  "That's right. That's why - -",
  "Definitely a rabbit.",
  "Insanity is another.",
  "Yes.",
  "Extreme emotional disturbance. Just a constitutional matter, this Court held in Patterson that the government didn't need to disprove that.",
  "The view established by this Court is that the crime of conspiracy continues, and once a person joins the conspiracy, he or she is liable for all the acts of his co-conspirators that were reasonably foreseeable in furtherance of the conspiracy. And that's true, even if that person, once he joins the conspiracy, doesn't ever do anything else - -",
  "That's right. And the Petitioners' view is grounded in due process concerns. Our view is that it is not a matter of due process because lack of withdrawal is not an element of the crime of conspiracy. So once you take due process out of the equation, then you have to ask what -- where would Congress have understood the burden -- the allocation of burdens to be, when it enacted these conspiracy statutes in 1970? And as a matter of logic, as a matter of history, as a matter of policy, there is no reason to think Congress would have thought the burden of persuasion to be anywhere other than on the defendant.",
  "No, this Court has said the opposite. It has said that -- you know, people can come and go in a conspiracy and - -",
  "That's right. And, again, there's no dispute in this case that the conspiracy was ongoing.",
  "Because once - -",
  "Well, again, if we can take the due process part off the table -- because we think it's not an element of lack of withdrawal, then you ask sort of, you know, what -- how would Congress have understood the state of the law to be when it enacted these crimes, that's how the Court approached this question as to duress in Dixon. I think, as a matter of logic, because the government can prove that someone is liable for a conspiracy by proving that he joined a conspiracy at some point and that the conspiracy existed in the limitations period, it wouldn't make sense to require the government to disprove withdrawal, once it's asserted - -",
  "I think that's kind of a remarkable assertion. If what he's saying is we have to be disprove withdrawal, once the defendant asserts it beyond a reasonable doubt, it's hard to imagine why the government would ever -- once a defendant makes a prima facie case of withdrawal, when the government would ever just say, oh, well, we'll sort of rest on our laurels and rest on the -- the evidence we have proving that he joined the conspiracy outside the limitations period.",
  "Your cases don't say anything about that. Our view is that the burden would be - -",
  "Your cases don't say anything about that question, so our view would be that the -- the burden stays on the defendant to prove that he withdrew from a conspiracy in that context. The Pinkerton liability isn't at issue here, so you don't need to -- to wrap that up into this case, but our - - our view would be the same.",
  "No, we -- we do rely on that. That's mentioned in our brief -- at the back end of the brief where we talk - -",
  "No, I think it is dispositive. And that was the reason we gave for the Court to deny the petition for Writ of Certiorari because there is plenty of evidence in this case that this defendant was in fact a member of the conspiracy. There's evidence that the leaders of the conspiracy gave him drugs and money. First of all, there's evidence that the reason he went to prison was to help out the leader of the conspiracy. There was evidence he was paid back because they gave him drugs and money while he was in prison.",
  "Yes, certainly. I mean, under -- under both views -- you know, it all -- all the evidence goes to whether -- you know, he had joined the conspiracy and whether he proved withdrawal.",
  "Not.",
  "It's never an element. It is true that the government -- if a defendant raises a statute of limitations defense, the government has the burden of proving that the crime was committed within the limitations period. This Court said that in Grunewald. It did not offer any explanation for that, but we have accepted that as our burden.",
  "I think, just because it is an -- it is a burden that is placed on the government by Congress in Section 3282. I think -- I think a reason one could think that it makes sense is that the government already has to prove all the things that it needs to prove, to prove that the crime actually happened. And generally, in proving that a crime actually happened beyond a reasonable doubt, you also prove when the crime actually happened. And so it doesn't really add very much to what the government's burden already is in proving the crime. But that sort of leads me into sort of the policy reasons for not allocating a burden of persuasion to the government as to the issue of withdrawal. And there are sort of four big reasons why Congress wouldn't have understood the burden to be -- for policy reasons -- wouldn't have understood the burden to be on a defendant as to the issue of withdrawal. The first is that the defendant will almost always be in a better position to have the information about whether he withdrew, except in cases where he withdraws by making a clean rest with the government, in which case, it's hard to imagine he's going to be indicted for -- for the indictment past that period, except in those cases, he will know what he said in secret to his co-conspirators. Second, the government will often be prevented from bringing up evidence to rebut an assertion of withdrawal because it can't make a defendant testify, and it often won't be able to make his co-conspirators testify. Third, a defendant doesn't have to give any advanced notice of his intention to rely on a withdrawal defense, and so often, he can scuttle the defendant's - - the government's ability to procure any other evidence it may be able to procure relevant to the issue of -- of withdrawal. And, fourth, Petitioner's role would encourage spurious assertions of withdrawal because it has -- it could have the effect of essentially making the government prove something extra. It already has to prove that he joined the conspiracy willingly, that the conspiracy existed in the limitations period. But under the government's -- under the Petitioner's role -- excuse me -- the government would also have to prove that the defendant essentially took some other act to show his membership or somehow re-agreed to the conspiracy - -",
  "But in cases where -- such as this, where a defendant goes through a period of inaction with respect to the conspiracy, which this Court said in Hyde is not enough to withdraw, then there would be an incentive to raise a spurious assertion of withdrawal because it would require the government to sort of -- to rebut that by proving that the defendant had done something within that period, which it doesn't have to prove in order to establish liability.",
  "He certainly can. I think there's a good deal of risk in that for a defendant.",
  "That - -",
  "It's true. And the theory of defense in this case was, in fact, that there were many separate conspiracies, not that any particular person had withdrawn, and it only came up, as my friend pointed out, because the jury asked a question about it. If I can just sort of wrap up on a -- on a broader note? A defendant does not become liable for a criminal conspiracy casually. As the jury was charged in this case, the government has to prove that every defendant was aware of the existence of the conspiracy, that every defendant understood that it had an illegal objective, and that every defendant willingly agreed to participate in the conspiracy with the aim -- aim of advancing that illegal objective.",
  "That every defendant willingly joined the conspiracy, yes, with the understanding that they were advancing some illegal objective, the objective of the conspiracy. Now, that's a high evidentiary - -",
  "No, no, no. No. I'm sorry.",
  "To prove liability for each person, you have to prove that that person - -",
  "-- satisfied all these things. I'm sorry - -",
  "That's what I meant, yes, yes.",
  "Right. But that is -- this is high evidentiary burden that the government has to bear to prove that each defendant took some affirmative action to get into the conspiracy. And once the -- once the government proves that a defendant was a member of the conspiracy, then it's on the defendant to prove - - to take some affirmative action to get himself out of the conspiracy. And it only makes sense to require him to prove that he took that act, instead of requiring the government to prove negative that he didn't take that act in every case. If there are no further questions?",
  "I mean, it would not have made a difference in this case, for the reasons you suggest, we had good evidence that he had active participation within the limitations period. It can make a difference in some other cases -- you know, I think, as a practical matter, most criminal conspiracies that are charged in the Federal system involve activity that was more recent than some of the activity that was involved in this case. But it certainly can come up, and -- you know, if we didn't have the type of evidence that we did about this particular defendant's behavior in prison, then it would have been hard to rebut his assertion of withdrawal caused by his incarceration. So it definitely can come up.",
  "Oh, it certainly could have, right. It could have decided against us on the whole thing, but - -",
  "Okay. I -- yeah. I didn't mean to be brazen about it. We think we had good evidence that the Petitioner continued in the conspiracy in this case.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start, if I could, where Justice Kennedy began and ended, which is asking whether there would have been extortion if the jury had found here that what -- that the property that was obtained was the commissions at the end of the day after the investment. My friend Mr. Clement says no, no, no, McNally says no. But what McNally actually said was the case would have come out differently if the property that had been alleged to be deprived was either money or property, but it also said it would have come out differently if the Commonwealth had been deprived of control over how its money was spent. And that's the type of property that's at issue here, control over a property right. Now --",
  "Well, he was charged with attempting to obtain the commitment, which in most cases ends up being the investment itself. That's not what the jury found was the property that was obtained, so it's not the verdict that we are here defending today.",
  "No, that's what I'm saying. What he's saying is that the obstacle is you'd have to prove that the State was out more money than it would have been if it had invested in the company it wanted to invest in. What I'm saying is no, McNally said the result would have been different if the State had been deprived of control, of the ability to control its money, and that's the property that would have been obtained in that kind of a case. Because property and control of property are just -- are just different aspects of the same property. This Court has said repeatedly that exclusive control of property is one vital aspect of private property. And that's the -- that's the type of property that was charged, that was -- that was obtained in this case.",
  "But Justice --",
  "Well, I guess I would have two points. The first is that this is not about honest services because the victim here is not the State of New York, it wasn't the citizenry of New York. That's the kind of --",
  "Whatever --",
  "Well, I want to separate again the question of what is property and when property is obtained. Under the Hobbs Act -- the Hobbs Act absorbed the New York State extortion law. And in that -- in the -- in the cases construing that law, they had construed the word \"property\" to include the running of a business, the engagement of a person in their occupation, and the doing of a job. People have property interests in doing those things because those are the source of economic wealth for those people. They generate a stream of revenue for people to live their lives on. Now, it's a different question -- not every time you interfere with someone's doing of their job are you obtaining that property. Here, what Petitioner was trying to do was not keep the general counsel from making a recommendation, he was attempting to dictate the substance of what the recommendation was.",
  "Yes.",
  "The ground is the general particularized meaning that the word \"property\" has obtained in the law, and including in New York cases construing the very law on which the Hobbs Act was based. A person has a property interest in running their business. They also have a property interest in doing their job. When -- when someone comes along and uses threats of harm or threats of force or violence to try to get them to do their job in a different way, what they are doing is they are taking control of that property interest that the person has.",
  "Well, you can convey your labor to your employer in that sense. When you enter an employment contract, you are selling your labor to your employer. And the -- the extent of your right to do that job is then defined by the parameters of your job.",
  "But that is your labor.",
  "But in this case what Petitioner was trying to take was the fruits of the general counsel -- counsel's labor. His job was to give his recommendation to his client about what was in keeping with the client's --",
  "I can't because at common law the person --",
  "Yes, but it was a different crime at common law because it only involved public officials taking money or other thing of value in exchange for doing something --",
  "I don't have an example of that, but what I do have are examples from the New York cases which were construing the New York State extortion law, and this Court has noted again and again that that's the basis that the -- for the Hobbs Act. Congress was explicitly trying to evoke that law.",
  "So I think there are two cases. The Barondess case and the Short case are the best cases. And in the Barondess case, which is from 1893, I think, the -- the Court said that the running of a business was property. And in the Short case the Court said that, just the same way that the running of a business is property, a person's doing their job is property, and that that can be damaged --",
  "Well, in those cases the property wasn't taken. Under the New York extortion law, the law used \"property\" in two different places, and this is noted in our brief. First, it was something that could be taken, that could be obtained through extortion. And second, it was -- one of the means of committing extortion was doing violence to property, it was harming property. And the court was construing property -- in those cases, it was -- it was in the latter sense of what qualified as harm to property. But the court said in the Short case, which is from 1911 -- the court noted that property is used in -- in both provisions, Section 850 and Section 851, and said it was construing it as it was used in both of those sections. And in that -- that was the case that said doing a person's job, the person has a property interest in doing their job.",
  "We -- that's absolutely what we are saying, in the same way that we said that if the target of the -- if the -- if the protesters, excuse me, had been trying to get the clinics, if they had been trying to take over the clinics and get them to provide a different type of service, to get them to be a restaurant or to provide a different type of medical service, then they would have been obtaining the right of the -- of the clinic the right to run -- to operate their business.",
  "Yes, because Scheidler came out the way it did not because there wasn't property at issue, but because there wasn't an obtaining. And I do think it's important to try to keep those two things separate.",
  "But you are dictating the substance of what they are doing, and so you are obtaining their right to exercise their property right.",
  "It's true, but the New York courses -- the New York cases said that they were construing the word \"property\" to mean the same thing as used -- used in both places in the statute. And there is no reason to -- to define the word \"property\" to include the concept of being obtainable because the statute already separately requires that property be obtained before there is extortion. Just, if I can just note that --",
  "They might not be, but they are both -- but property is property. That's our position, that there is a legal meaning of property, it includes the right to run a business, the right to -- to engage in an occupation. In a particular instance that property may not be obtainable and then there won't be a Hobbs Act violation. But you don't have to read the obtainability into the definition of \"property.\" It's the same thing. The Hobbs Act also says that you can commit a violation by committing physical violence against property. Now, in their opening brief, Petitioner said, well, if something can't be physically harmed, it can't be property. We are happy to see in the reply brief they sort of gave that up by saying, \"Okay, yeah. Well, business secrets are property. A patent is property. Those things can't be physically harmed. But there is no reason to read \"property\" means different things. If something can't be physically harmed, it won't be the basis for liability under that provision of the Hobbs Act.",
  "No, that's exactly what I'm saying.",
  "That's exactly --",
  "Right. But that doesn't mean that property means something different. It just means if it's property that can't be harmed, then it -- it won't be a basis for liability under that provision. I'm just saying you don't want to give a different definition to the same word used different times in the same statute, when the concept is -- is -- where the work is carried by other words in the statute. I think if I could point to --",
  "What you are doing is -- what happened in this case is Petitioner was attempting to obtain control over the fruits of the general counsel's labor.",
  "Right, so what --",
  "Well, this Court has repeatedly said that property and exclusive control of property are just different aspects of the same thing. They're different sticks in the bundle that make up the property. Here, what Petitioner was trying to do was he was trying to dictate the substance of the recommendation, and in doing so, he was trying to exorcise the General Counsel's right to make the recommendation, his right to do his job, and that was his property. He wasn't just trying to keep him from going to work, he was trying to literally dictate what the recommendation was. And that's how it was charged in the indictment, that's what the jury found. That was where the obtaining came in. The -- the concept of property and control of property is well illustrated by this Court's decision in Carpenter. There the property -- one of the pieces of property at issue was confidential business information, which was taken from The Wall Street Journal. But it wasn't -- it wasn't really taken from The Wall Street Journal because The Wall Street Journal still had the information at the end of the day. What the Court found was taken from The Wall Street Journal was the ability to control, to have the exclusive control over the information.",
  "Well, I mean, you might have an obtaining question if it's only 2 percent of the time.",
  "Well, you should --",
  "Well, I guess -- I mean, it's sort of two -- two different kinds of responses. One is that when you're asking if something is property, you want to look at it sort of on a class-wide or aggregate basis. If you have one, single unauthorized download of a copyrighted song, that's not necessarily going to cause harm to the record company --",
  "No, I understand.",
  "But I'm just saying you want to look at something in the aggregate on a class-wide basis, and persons doing their job on a class-wide basis is something that is economically valuable to them. And therefore, it's property. I lost track of what my second response was going to be. So anyway, the -- the Hobbs Act clearly was targeted -- was trying to get at racketeering activity. It was trying to get at organized crime families. And Congress knew that one of the main means that organized crime families use was taking control of businesses. Now, those cases might seem easier because taking control of a brick and mortar business may seem more obviously like property than taking control of a person's occupation or their job. But a person's right to labor is economically valuable to them and is property to them in the same way that the running of a business is. Now, Petitioner's view would -- if it -- I mean, his real view is that he'd want to wipe out the heartland of Hobbs Act organized crime prosecutions, but I think his fallback position is that he would want to wipe out any extortion of a business that provides services instead of providing a tangible good. But that doesn't make sense either. If Petitioner had threatened harm to a plumber if the plumber didn't come and -- and fix his leaky faucet, he would have been extorting that plumber's labor, and the same thing for a gardener, if he tried to get a gardener to come and mow his lawn. Now, he wouldn't end up with anything tangible at -- at the back end, but what he would have taken from those laborers would be their right to labor, their right to --",
  "But he wouldn't --",
  "It's the same kind of obtaining here because he wouldn't take the mowed lawn from the -- from the gardener, he wouldn't take a lack of leaking from the plumber. What he's taking from them is their services in order to get a particular result. It's the same thing here, he's trying to take from the General Counsel his service of making a recommendation that's in his client's best interest and he's trying to dictate the substance of the recommendation to try to get him to give a particular recommendation, a positive recommendation.",
  "Well, that's why I'm saying --",
  "It has economic value because the lawyer's job is to give his advice in keeping with his client's best interest. It's the same thing as the record company. A single unauthorized download --",
  "It is. If Petitioner had tried to blackmail the General Counsel every week to give a different recommendation than what he wanted, the result would have been the General Counsel would have lost his job. He would have lost his stream of revenue. He might have been disbarred.",
  "That's economically valuable to him. It's the same thing as a single download of a -- of a record that might not cause economic harm to a record company, but it's still taking property because in the aggregate, the rights of that copyright or trademark have -- the property right has value to the record company. It's important to keep in mind the factual scenario here. Here, Petitioner was trying to use blackmail to coerce a State agent into doing something that was against his -- his will in order to get a $35 million investment from the State. Now, again, this might seem like a harder case than if he was trying to coopt the running of a brick and mortar business, but what he was trying to do is coopt an individual's doing of his job. He's trying to dictate the substance of the recommendation. In doing that, he's obtaining property from the victim.",
  "Well, it was charged on several different theories, and one of the theories was that he was trying to gain the commitment to the investment. Now, the jury was given choices. The jury circled the lawyer's positive recommendation as the property that was obtained. I assume that's because the evidence in the case, the e-mails from Petitioner to General Counsel talked about the recommendation and so that was a tangible thing in the jury's mind. It was sort of that there was a really direct connection between what Petitioner was saying, what he was trying to do, and the recommendation.",
  "I don't think -- I think it could have been charged that he was trying to get the money here.",
  "That he was trying to get the commitment, that was one of the choices. What they circled was the recommendation. Now, who knows why a jury does anything. I assume, like I said, it's because that was what the e-mails were about, they were about the recommendation.",
  "No, they circled -- it says the General Counsel's recommendation -- this is on the JA 142. That's where it starts --",
  "JA 142. What they circled was the General Counsel's recommendation to approve the commitment. And I think that wording is very helpful to us because it's not just that he's trying to obtain a recommendation from the General Counsel. He's trying to obtain a particular recommendation, the recommendation to approve the commitment. I think that encapsulates both the property and the obtaining that is the theory of our case. The General Counsel's job was to give his legal advice. The Petitioner was trying to dictate the substance of that legal advice. His property interest was in doing his job. The General Counsel -- the Petitioner was trying to take control of the doing of the job, and therefore trying to take the General Counsel's property.",
  "It was always the official who was doing the extorting.",
  "No. At common law, it was only limited to acts by an official. There was no -- and -- and the Court has recognized that when Congress enacted the Hobbs Act, it expanded the -- the reach of extortion in that sense, in the same way that New York did when it enacted the State extortion law. And I do think it's important to keep in mind that the -- the Hobbs Act is based on the New York law and we don't want to just ignore the New York cases that construe the word \"property\" to mean the running of a business and the doing of a job.",
  "But it wasn't -- I mean, it's true there weren't cases --",
  "I concede that point. I concede that point. But it was -- it was defining the word \"property\" and that property is used twice. And so again, it's a separate question here whether the property was obtained. We think it's clear that there was property. We think it's clear the property was obtained as well, but those are two separate questions.",
  "That's true -- I mean, it was a separate crime of coercion. There was a separate crime of coercion under New York law. I think, you know, the Congress conceived of the Hobbs Act as a property -- as a crime of -- against property, and so it didn't want to include coercion. It included extortion and robbery. Of course, every extortion crime --",
  "In this case. Well, I think it's important to note, and Petitioner doesn't mention this, that the attempted extortion charge he was initially charged with was a misdemeanor and the attempted coercion charge he ultimately ended up being charged with in State law was a felony. So I think that explains what was going on there. And it's a good example -- it's a good illustration of why it's hard to judge ex-post what happened, you know, what was motivating different charging decisions.",
  "So anything that doesn't involve property. So if you're trying to coerce --",
  "So trying to coerce someone to marry someone they don't want. I think, in the Scheidler case --",
  "Because it's -- I think it's more properly viewed as a liberty interest. It's not a source of economic value in the sort of traditional sense. I think if you take the Scheidler case --",
  "It's true. I walked into that one. I think -- so let's take the Scheidler case for an example. There were different types of property that were initially alleged in that case. One of them was the right of women to access the services of the clinics. This Court -- this Court distinguished that from the other alleged property interests, which were the running of the business that was the clinic. And the Court said that the right of women to access the services of the clinics was really more of a liberty interest and the running of a business was really more of -- it didn't say it was property because it didn't have to decide that, but it said that's really more in the nature of property. That was the property right alleged.",
  "I think it's both. And so someone -- the general counsel could have been coerced in this case if he had been prevented from going to jobs, to his job. But here what Petitioner was trying to do again was to -- to take the substance of the job, where he was trying to take the fruits of the labor of the general counsel by trying to dictate the substance of the recommendation.",
  "Not on the basis of property, but on the basis of obtaining. The former is -- there's no obtaining and in the latter there's obtaining because what you're doing is you are exercising the person's right to do their job. And the Court has said again and again that exclusive control of property is an essential element of all personal property, of all private property.",
  "Well, we did use it, and he was -- I mean, there are five convictions under 875. What happened is in this case we conceded that Section 875 uses the word \"extort.\" We conceded in the court of appeals that \"extort\" has the same meaning as \"extortion\" under the Hobbs Act. And so if there wasn't extortion under the Hobbs Act, there wouldn't be - -",
  "That's --",
  "That's true. In this case, again, we have treated them as the same. But I think you would want to reserve for another case the question whether Section 875 --",
  "I think \"thing of value\" is a broader term than \"property.\"",
  "Right. So we haven't made an argument about 875 here. We've conceded that whatever the result is as to the Hobbs Act would control as to 875. But I do think that's a question for another case if we don't prevail in this case.",
  "Well, again, I don't think we are going too far --",
  "But, Justice Scalia, you have already defined it this broadly in cases dealing with Section 20 of the Clayton Act, the Due Process Clause, the scope of a court's equity jurisdiction. The Court has said that the running of a business is property. The Court has also said that pursuit of an occupation is property.",
  "I hear what you're saying. But what I am saying is that property is property. And it's true that in extortion the property has to be obtained for there to be a crime. That work is done by the word \"obtained.\"",
  "But this Federal crime of extortion brings with -- brings with it the baggage of the New York State extortion law, and the New York cases said in that law the word \"property\" includes the running of a business and doing a job. It's true that that wasn't the property being extorted in those cases, but that's what they said property means. And if you are worried that those things can't be obtained, you don't need to worry -- you don't need to have a special definition of property to take care of that because the Hobbs Act already requires that property be obtained before there is extortion, so there is no need to have a redundancy built in for that. Again, I can understand how -- how the main Hobbs Act, sort of heartland cases which involve the co-opting of a brick and mortar business, seem like easier cases. And you might want to draw a line between the running of a business and the doing of labor. But a person has a -- has a property interest in doing their job the same way that they have a property interest in running a business. The fact that they work for someone else shouldn't mean that they have less of an interest in doing their job than if they run their own business. Doing a job is a source of economic value to a person and the Court should construe it as property, and the right to exercise control over doing their job is also property. If the Court has no questions?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start, if I could, by taking a little bit of a step back to note that outside of the bankruptcy system, an individual who runs up more debts than they can satisfy with their collective assets has no right to wipe out those debts while retaining some of their property in the face of unpaid assets. That right only comes from the Bankruptcy Code itself. But you only get that right if you follow the rules of bankruptcy. The Petitioner asked this Court to myopically focus on certain provisions of the Code and only provisions of the Code that actually benefit the debtor. But you have to look at any provision of the Code in the context of the whole Code itself because all the provisions are intended to work together. In this case, the surcharge order was necessary and appropriate to enforce provisions such as Section 521 and Section 704 of the Code. Section 521 imposes duties on debtors. Those duties include the duty to honestly disclose assets and liabilities, the duty to turn over property to the estate, to the trustee, and the duty to cooperate with the trustee throughout the case. Now, Mr. Law flouted all of those obligations, making it impossible to carry out the provisions of those parts of the Code without surcharging him in some way. Section 704 imposes duties on the trustee. Those duties include the duty to investigate the financial affairs of a debtor and the duty to collect the property of the debtor, reduce it to money and give that money to creditors. And the trustee doggedly pursued his duties under Section 704, but because of Mr. Law's bad faith litigation behavior, he imposed a great cost on the exercise of those duties. And so the Bankruptcy Court exercised its discretion to try to offset some of those costs by imposing a surcharge on what would have otherwise been exempt property of the debtor.",
  "What we're asking to do is look at all the provisions of the Code together. And certainly, Section 522(k) expresses Congress's policy judgment that generally honest debtors should not have their exempt property used to pay administrative expenses. But as I've said, 521 and 704 express Congress's policy judgments about what debtors are supposed to do and what trustees are supposed to do. And Section 105 give ­­ gives Bankruptcy Courts authority to address very unusual circumstances that involve bad faith litigation conduct. So that's bad conduct in the litigation. I think that is an implicit exception to most of the general rules that are laid out in the Bankruptcy Code. In this case, it's really impossible for the Court to have carried out all of the provisions of the Code, but that's directly because of the debtor's behavior in this case, Petitioner's behavior. And so here in this extraordinary circumstance, the Bankruptcy Court addressed that bad faith litigation behavior by exempting what otherwise would have been ­­ by ­­ excuse me ­­ surcharging what otherwise would have been exempt property.",
  "I mean, if it's a negligent ­­ negligent failure to list the asset, then I don't think ­­",
  "I think if they do it in such a way that then they spend the assets ­­ so the way this issue usually comes up, the way it's come up in most of the courts of appeals is that a debtor tries to hide a nonexempt asset and then wastes the asset in some way, usually by spending it, and then when it's discovered, this is how it came up in the Malley case in the First Circuit, then the Bankruptcy Court surcharges the exempt property to sort of compensate the estate for the wasted nonexempt property. And so I think that ­­ that's certainly, in our view, an appropriate exercise of authority under Section 105, because there, the debtor is trying to ­­ he doesn't necessarily exit the bankruptcy with more money than he would be entitled to, but he has more money during the bankruptcy and he spends that money ­­",
  "I don't think it happens terribly often, and when it does happen it isn't very often that the debtor spends the money that he's concealing. He's usually trying to keep the money. And so if it's discovered that he has hidden an asset that he should have turned over, then the Bankruptcy Court can merely order him to turn over the money, to turn over whatever the asset was. It only ­­ it is only necessary to surcharge what would otherwise be exempt property if that nonexempt asset no longer exists. Here, of course, it's a little bit of a different situation. This Petitioner imposed enormous costs on the estate, radically depleted the value of the estate by requiring the trustee to run up huge attorneys' fees in order to effectuate his duties under the code.",
  "None that I am aware of. And our view of the case is not so much that the exemption was denied in this case, but that the ­­",
  "Well, the majority of the cases, it's not so much that there's been an objection to the exemption, so much as the exemption has been disallowed at the end of the case or surcharged. But I'm glad ­­ you know, in the hypothetical you posited, it's the creditor who is expending effort and potentially incurring attorneys' fees in order to expose a debtor's fraud. And in that case, those would not be administrative expenses, and you would think that, at least under the Court's inherent authority ­­ under ­­",
  "Right. And, again, that's not our view. Our view is that the exemption was disallowed, that the debtor is not allowed the benefit of the exemption. But if the creditor had been the one who ran up the attorneys' fees, he could certainly be paid under the court's inherent authority, as in Chambers v. NASCO, and it would be strange to think that the trustee is the only person who couldn't be paid in this sort of circumstance just for doing what the code tells him he has to do.",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg, I think ­­ I think the distinction we were trying to make was more what I was discussing with the Chief Justice, which is when a debtor wastes nonexempt assets and can't turn them over, nonexempt property, can't turn it over to the estate, and so then is forced to turn over exempt property so that the surcharge doesn't pay attorneys' fees; it just compensates the estate, and by extension the creditors, for property that should have been turned over. Our suggestion was that this case, you could decide the case on a narrow grounds and it wouldn't necessarily resolve the issue in those other cases, because in this case the sanction was to pay attorneys' fees, which under a court's traditional inherent authority, a court can order one party to pay another party's attorneys' fees when it's in response to extraordinary bad faith litigation conduct. Now, even in Chambers v. NASCO, it's true that the Court was divided in that case, but it was mostly divided about whether the bad faith in that case was in the litigation or before the litigation. Here, there is really no doubt that all of the bad faith conduct in this case is in the litigation. And that's really a very traditional exercise of the court's inherent authority to sanction that type of behavior through attorneys' fees. I think it's important to note also in this case that the available remedies really are insufficient to deal with this debtor's misconduct. He suggests dismissal, discharge, and Rule 11 sanctions. Of course, dismissal wouldn't do anything to punish him because his creditors have been paid and he would just exit the bankruptcy with all of the exempt property he would have gotten if he had been honest. The same thing with discharge. He was denied a discharge of his debts, but then after that the trustee sold his house, and it sold for $300,000 more than he had represented it was worth. And so all the creditors were paid. And so that really had no practical effect in this case. It's also not clear that Rule 11 would be sufficient to fully compensate the Trustee for the expenses that have been incurred, because Rule 11 sanctions generally aren't available for matters on appeal. And as the record reveals, much of the expenses that were incurred in this place ­­ in this case resulted from the debtor's more than a dozen appeals to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and to the court of appeals.",
  "So our view is that he could have ­­ the court could have imposed a sanction, and that would not have been a prepetition debt, so it wouldn't have been discharged. And if the court had ordered the debtor to pay the money on pain of contempt, he could have enforced that order notwithstanding any State law provision that would have exempted the property after the bankruptcy.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with what I think at least is some common ground between the Government and Mr. Robers. And that is that if a defendant fraudulently deprives a victim of a car and then gives the victim a crate of pineapples or tomatoes or an elephant, he's not entitled to an offset, because what the victim lost was a car and the car is not the same as pineapples or an elephant. We think that's exactly what happened here. What the victims lost in this case was money. What they got back was houses, which is not the same. Now, Petitioner says it is the same.",
  "Well, then that would ­­ that would bring in the principles of proximate cause under the MVRA. So if I can just say ­­",
  "They ­­",
  "Well, so, in that case, Justice Sotomayor, no part of the property that was lost by the lenders would have been returned to the lenders. And so instead there would be some other property that was returned, which is the houses, and then they would have made an independent choice, which is not the choice that the vast, vast majority of banks make, to do something other ­­ to do something with the house other than to sell it. And so in that case, the district court would have to use its discretion to value what had come back to the lenders. And ­­ and probably the best way to do it would be to value it at the time that they disposed of it.",
  "But that's not ­­",
  "But ­­",
  "Right.",
  "But I think it's very important to note that that situation would not fall under 3663A(b)(1)(B)(ii).",
  "Right. That's a different thing, because no part of the property that was lost in that situation was returned.",
  "Right. But what we're talking about here is that ­­ is a situation in which some part of the property that was lost was returned to the victim. And the question is: Well, what was the property that was returned to the victim? We say it was part of the money that they lost. Mr. Robers says it was the house. But the victims didn't ever own the houses. They never intended to own the houses. They ­­ they had ­­ they had no interest in having the houses. And so when they got the houses back, no part of the property was returned to them. No part of the property was returned to ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Because Mr. Robers doesn't have the money that he took from the victim, and so ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "So our view is that 3663A governs the calculation of the loss to the victims, and 3664 governs how the defendant pays back a restitution award. And so in your hypothetical, what would happen is that the court would order the defendant to return the part of the property he took that he still has, the $50,000, and then under 3664A, he would put him on a payment schedule to pay back the rest.",
  "I do think it's under B, yes. I don't mean to ­­",
  "Yes. And you would get an offset for the amount of the money that you returned to the lender.",
  "It ­­ well, it does make sense if you ­­ if you remember that 3663A is about the calculation of the loss at the time of sentencing. And so it's not about, you know, how ­­ how much of a loss you are going to have once the restitution order has been paid off, because at that point, the victim will have no loss. They will have been paid. What you are trying to calculate is what was the loss that we're ­­ that we're going to order the restitution for. And so if victim ­­ excuse me. If the defendant ­­ defendant still has part of the property that he took, then the court says: Give it back and then we calculate the net loss that the victim has,",
  "But unless it's ­­",
  "Right. But ­­ but B says return the property.",
  "But if the property is a bat, you return the bat. If you don't have the bat, you can't return the bat. If the property is 100,000 ­­",
  "I know. No, but ­­",
  "You brought it up.",
  "But it ­­",
  "No, I ­­",
  "What I'm saying is that the property that was lost is the property that was lost. If the property that was lost is a crate of tomatoes and you don't have it, and you can't give it back, something else has to happen.",
  "I don't see an offset under A. A just says return the property. If you have the property, you return the property. If I could just give the second half of what I was going to say to Justice Breyer ­­",
  "What I'm saying is if you ­­ if you have the bat, you give the bat back. If you ­­ if you took $100,000 and you don't have $100,000, you can't return the property. It doesn't matter that ­­ once under 3664, the district court structures the way you pay a restitution order, that ultimately you will be paying $100 a month for 182 years, which is what this guy is going to be doing, which is to say that money is never going to get back to the lenders.",
  "The defendant is entitled. If the ­­ if the defendant pays back the full amount of the cash that it took and the lenders have taken title to the house, then the lenders have no loss because the full amount of the property has been returned to the defendant. Under our view ­­ and let me just say, this situation really never arises.",
  "So, no, I think the way that would ­­ I think it would come in under 3664. And under 3664, district courts have discretion to fashion a restitution order that fits the circumstances of the case.",
  "Well, B ­­",
  "No, I don't think it is. And A actually does not govern situations in which return of the property is not possible. That's all under B. And we really think that that is this case.",
  "He didn't have the money ­­",
  "I don't ­­ I don't ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, he would ­­",
  "Yes, but you would value the bat or the house as a replacement of property under Subsection 3664(f)(4), not as a return of the property that was lost.",
  "Right, because it's not the property ­­",
  "Right, but ­­",
  "But under Section 3664, you are allowed to make an in­kind payment with return of property or replacement of property. Return of property is return of the property that was lost; replacement is giving some other kind of property different from what was lost. But under Section ­­",
  "It's easy when they sell the house because they've gotten back the money ­­",
  "­­ which is part of the property they lost.",
  "So the next thing ­­",
  "But ­­",
  "The victim should not.",
  "The MVRA ­­",
  "It's ­­ right, but that's because that's when they got back part of the property they lost, because the property they lost was money. When they got the house, no part of the property that they lost was returned to them until they got the money back.",
  "So then ­­",
  "No, because that's a case ­­ I mean, yes, in the sense that they should be made whole for the part of the loss that's attributable to the actions of the defendant. But that's a situation where part of the victim's net losses would be attributable to independent decisions that are commercially unreasonable made by the victim; and so that's where proximate cause come in. That's not this case. In this case, there's no indication that the lenders held on to the houses for longer than was reasonable.",
  "Yes. But it ­­ so, in this case, one of the houses it took 33 months to sell, as the Petitioner's counsel pointed out. But that was a house where at the sheriff's sale, there were a total of zero bidders on the house, and so nobody wanted to buy the house. And so if you were going to value the house at the point of foreclosure, maybe you would value it at zero, which really wouldn't be good for anybody. It certainly wouldn't be good for the defendant.",
  "There certainly was not.",
  "They were ordered to pay a much larger amount of restitution because they were involved in the fraudulent acquisition of ­­ of many, many more houses than these two houses.",
  "They were. And the district court held Mr. Robers and his co­conspirators jointly and severally liable for the losses from these two houses. Now, the Section 3664(h) allows a district court to apportion losses if it wants to. It was ­­ Mr. Robers asked the court to do that; the court decided not to do that; he hasn't appealed that part of the decision to this Court, and so that's sort of dropped out of the case. But that is an option under the MVRA.",
  "Right.",
  "You've gotten that right.",
  "And I just want to add the element that the reason that you do that is when the house goes back to the victim, no part of the property they lost has been returned to them. And I think it's important to recognize that in almost all of these mortgage fraud cases, the bank forecloses on the property long before sentencing. In this case ­­",
  "When they get ­­",
  "They've gotten different property.",
  "But under Section 3663, it uses the phrase \"the property\" after it has declared that the property is the property that was lost. And so when you get a house back and you've lost money, no part of the property you've lost has been returned. And, again, if I can just say that in these mortgage fraud cases, the banks have foreclosed and sold the houses generally long before sentencing; in this case, even before the defendant was charged with any crime. And banks ­­ so banks aren't thinking about restitution when they're taking title to the houses and selling them. What they're thinking is, we want to turn these houses into money, because that's what we lost, and we want to maximize our return on the houses. And they're not thinking of restitution as some sort of insurance against their needing to be responsible in selling the houses, because as in this case, most defendants don't have the resources to pay a restitution award.",
  "Absolutely. Under our view, the defendant gets the benefit of that, and the victim would not be overcompensated. Under his view, he wouldn't get any benefit of that and the victim would get double recovery.",
  "Well, again, usually the house has sold long before sentencing. And so if the value of the property has gone up between the time of foreclosure and the time of the subsequent sale, then the offset amount is, again, the amount that the bank gets when they sell the house. And so that's ­­ that's an amount larger than the value of the house at the foreclosure and the defendant gets a larger offset.",
  "If it's over the total amount lost, then the victim's loss is zero as a result of the defendant's fraud, and so he doesn't have to pay any restitution award. Now, the victim would get to keep the extra amount of the money in the same way that happens in any foreclosure proceeding when there's no fraud involved. If a bank forecloses ­­",
  "Yes. And in our view, that's a proximate cause question, because then the victim's net losses wouldn't be caused by the defendant's fraud.",
  "It depends what sort of dramatic development you mean.",
  "The bank got it.",
  "Well, it's not our view ­­ you know, the house is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it in an arm's­length transaction. And so if there's something about the house that you just didn't know when the bank got the house, then that really wouldn't be the value of the house. The value of the house is what you can sell it for, and if there's something that's ­­",
  "I think in that case, it would probably be whatever the money that the bank can get for the house. But if there's some other type of ­­ of event, like if ­­ you know, if there's an earthquake in the middle of the country that destroys the house, then I think that would be ­­ that would be sort of a classic example of something that would break the chain of proximate cause. And so what would happen in that case usually is the bank would get paid by its insurance company, compensated for the loss of the house, and you would sort of value the house at the time that it was ­­ it was destroyed after the bank acquired it. And then the insurance company in that case wouldn't be entitled to any restitution from the defendant, because it wouldn't be the defendant's actions that caused the destruction of the house. What he's saying is that just the fact that the ­­ that the housing market went down is an intervening nonforeseeable event that breaks the chain of causation. Under our view, that's absolutely not correct. The very nature of the defendant's scheme injected the health of the housing market into the ultimate determination of the victim's net losses. He ­­ his design was that he would take money from the banks and promise to pay it back. He had no intention to pay it back, in fact never made a single payment. That necessarily and foreseeably triggered the foreclosure, which caused the banks to own the houses and then caused them to put them on the market and sell. It's absolutely foreseeable that it takes banks a certain amount of time to sell the houses, absolutely foreseeable that the value of the houses will fluctuate over time. No one has to be able to predict what the houses would have been worth on a particular date in the future to be able to say that it was foreseeable that the value would change. And the MVRA allocates any risk from a change in property to a defendant, not to the victim. And that's consistent with our view. If there are no further questions, I can rest ­­ I guess I would just like to end by reiterating our main point, which is that the text of the statute is very clear in this case, and what it focuses on is how much of the property that was lost has been returned to the victim before sentencing. When the property that was lost was a car, you don't get an offset for returning pineapples. When the property that was lost was money, you don't get an offset for returning the house. But in this case, as in almost all mortgage fraud cases, the banks were able to get back some of the property they lost when they sold the houses, and so there's no valuation question here. It's not a question of how much of the property that was lost did the banks get back. The district court knew 100 percent for sure because the houses were sold before Mr. Robers was even charged with a crime.",
  "I mean, as long as what the bank ­­ what the bank did was commercially reasonable. If the bank ­­",
  "I mean, it's hard to know. You know, you wouldn't want to ­­ we wouldn't want to judge that with 100 percent perfect hindsight, right? You'd want to say ­­ if you were in the bank's shoes at the time it made the decision, was that a commercially reasonable decision, and you know, that's a decision that would have to be made in those kind of cases.",
  "No, what I'm saying is ­­",
  "So if there really ­­ if there really is evidence that the bank is sort of really rolling the dice, then that might be a harder question. Generally, what the bank wants is to turn the house into money because the bank is not in the business of owning houses. It's in the business of having money. And again, the banks don't have in their mind that they're going to get a restitution payment when they take the houses. What they have in mind is that they're going to take a loss. If they've had to foreclose on a house, it's a bad mortgage, generally they are going to get back less for the house than what they got for the mortgage, and if that happens they consider it a loss, and I think any business person would consider that a loss. And it's perfectly foreseeable that it's going to take the bank a certain amount of time to turn the house into cash. But when that's happened before sentencing, it's really an easy case to apply Section 3663A because you absolutely know for sure how much of the lost property has been returned to the victim and it's the amount of the money they got for the sale, or for the property.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Because the other parts of the statute require ­­ have a proximate cause requirement, and so you are only ­­ the victim is only entitled to get restitution for the amount of its losses that are attributable to the defendant's criminal conduct. And so if part of the bank's losses, i.e., the smaller amount of the return it gets for selling the houses, is because of the bank's independent action, then that part of the loss is not attributable to the defendant.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, we're saying it's relevant when the bank sells the house because then part of the property is returned.",
  "They have the house until they sell it and then they have cash.",
  "And so it's the cash they get when they sell the house ­­",
  "Right. Which happens in most every case. Not every case, but ­­",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "It wouldn't be considered an offset under Section 3663A(b)(1)(B)(ii).",
  "Some part of the property.",
  "Yes.",
  "It will because ­­",
  "Sometimes it goes down, but other times it goes up. And the trend over time is that the housing market goes up, and so more often than not in the larger picture, it will inure to the benefit of the defendant.",
  "Well, I think in those unusual circumstances, it would be as you suggested earlier, which is that you would value it as of the date it would have been reasonable to dispose of the property in a fair market, arm's­length transaction.",
  "­­ and that's usually not ­­",
  "I think generally that's fine. I think in the ­­ really, in the mine run of cases, the lion's share of cases, you are going to be sort of overly complicating the district court's inquiry, because in almost all of the cases, the houses have been sold, and so you know you can look at the dollar figure that the banks got, and that's the amount you can use. And it ­­ and that fits into what you described, but just sort of describes it in a more complicated way, I think, in more ­­",
  "I think that would be available to the defendant.",
  "I think ­­",
  "Yes, and I think there is a presumption that banks are going to act in a commercially reasonable way because they have no expectation of getting any money back through the restitution process.",
  "So as Justice Breyer suggested, under our view, the court ­­ the district court's first resort would be to say ­­ to push off the determination of the restitution amount for 90 days under 3664(d)(5), and give the ­­ give the bank a little more time to sell the house, because in that case, a determination ­­ you wouldn't be able to ascertain the net losses of the victim. If ­­ if a bank still couldn't sell the house, then I think under this Court's decision in Dolan, what the court could do is say: Yes, I'm going to order restitution; the restitution will be for the full amount of the mortgages, the money that was lost minus whatever amount of money the banks get back when they sell the houses. And if the bank has not been able to sell the house at that point, it's really to everyone's benefit to give them the chance to do it, because if no one wants to buy the house and you force the district court to value the house at that point, it's going to give it a really low value and that doesn't help the defendant, it doesn't really help the bank ­­",
  "Then you ­­",
  "So then I think the district court would have retained jurisdiction to fill in an amount related, blank, for the amount of money the bank got back, and there could be proceedings about what that amount should be.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, the Eleventh Circuit unambiguously held that a district court always abuses its discretion when it denies a summons opponent's request to examine IRS officials based on an unsupported allegation of improper purpose. That holding was wrong for at least three reasons, and even Respondents don't defend it at this point. The three reasons are: First, the Eleventh Circuit's rule ignores Congress's intent that IRS summons enforcement proceedings be summary in nature. Second, the automatic examination rule is inconsistent with this Court's treatment of analogous, administrative, and grand jury subpoenas in other contexts. And the third, the rule fails to respect the district courts' core discretion to govern its own proceedings, including governing when and how evidence should be developed.",
  "I'm happy to. The Respondent suggests two what we think of as unworkable limitations or potential limitations on the rule. The first is that there be a requirement that the allegation be plausible, though, totally unsupported by evidence. And in our view, any plausibility requirement that is untethered to a requirement that a summons opponent actually point to some evidence that would substantiate the allegation is really not a limitation at all.",
  "Well, in our view, no. I mean, I think that's the question that you might want to direct to Respondents. They seem to suggest that ­­",
  "And if that's true, then we invite the Court to reverse the Eleventh Circuit. I mean, the rule we want ­­",
  "What we would like is that there ­­ that before a district court is actually required to allow examination of IRS officials, a summons opponent has to put in enough evidence to at least raise an inference of ­­",
  "Circumstantial evidence is enough. And ­­ and, again, what we're asking for is really a modest rule. A district court, in our view, has discretion to allow examination of an IRS official.",
  "Well, so I think there ­­ there are sort of two threshold questions that the district court would consider. The first is whether those would actually be improper purposes. And the second is whether if they would be, they were actually the motivating purposes in this case. The district court ­­ the court of appeals in this case only considered the statute of limitations question, and it found that ­­ that issuing a summonses after a taxpayer declined to extend a statute of limitations would be an improper purpose. We disagree with that legal holding, but that's not the question on which we sought this Court's review ­­",
  "Well, I would just say ­­ so there's a case we cited in our reply brief called Ash v. Commissioner, which is a tax court case, which says that in the tax's court view, there's no problem with enforcing a summons that was issued before tax court proceedings were initiated, as was the case here, that there's no problem ­­ there's no interference with the tax court discovery rule when we need to do that.",
  "Well, it may or may not be. And, again, if this Court corrects the ­­ the Eleventh Circuit didn't consider that because in the Eleventh Circuit's view, there didn't need to be any evidence. And so the Eleventh Circuit did not examine the sufficiency of the evidence that the Respondents presented. And so if this Court corrects that legal rule, Respondents can make these arguments on remand to the Eleventh Circuit. But I would just point out with respect to that ­­ that proposed improper purpose that the ­­ the validity of a summons is judged at the time that the summons was issued. And in this case, the summonses were issued before there was any tax court litigation. There's always the possibility, when a summons is issued, that there's going to be tax court litigation down the road after the IRS makes its determination of the ­­",
  "Absolutely.",
  "I'm not saying the district court can't look at the circumstances at the time of enforcement. There may be circumstances where ­­",
  "Well, we think they're sort of wrong, wrong, wrong, and wrong.",
  "Because so ­­ just to take a step back. The courts have upheld that the inquiry is whether the summonses were issued for a proper purpose. This Court said in Couch that the legal parties ­­ the parties' legal duties are fixed at the time that the summons was issued. So if you adopt the type of approach that they're asking for, what you're going to do is give taxpayers an incentive not to comply with the legal duty that's imposed on them by operation of law, which is to disclose information related to their tax liabilities, and then to comply with summonses that are validly issued. You give them incentive to drag things out until the statute of limitations is about to run and they file a tax court ­­",
  "We want the information because the IRS wants to make a determination of their tax liability.",
  "Okay. So that's ­­",
  "That is ­­ I mean, yes. So ­­",
  "Well, that's a ­­ that's one possibility.",
  "It could be.",
  "We want the right answer. And if the right answer is that we were wrong in the FPAA, then we would revise the FPAA.",
  "Yes.",
  "No.",
  "Yes.",
  "So I guess ­­ so the premise of your question assumes that there is already a Tax Court proceeding underway?",
  "And so that may ­­ that might not be a proper purpose because the IRS has said you need extraordinary circumstances ­­ the internal IRS guidelines say you need extraordinary circumstances to issue a summons after Tax Court proceedings are underway. And the Tax Court has similarly said you can only use evidence obtained through those summons in extraordinary circumstances. But in almost every case, a summons is issued long before or at least somewhat before a Tax Court proceeding is initiated because it's ­­ the IRS is trying to get information to make a determination about the taxpayer's liability.",
  "I think that would be a question that would need to be decided in a particular case. The reason I'm hesitating to give you a straight answer is because I ­­ that's just not the way the IRS works. The IRS is trying to get the right answer. And believe it or not, sometimes when the IRS gets more information, it will actually give money back to a taxpayer. It might ­­ if it gets information that might exonerate the IRS's finding of improper liability or it might actually bring to light to the IRS the fact that the taxpayer has overpaid. And there are some case ­­",
  "Right.",
  "So it's more like summary judgment than Iqbal. You know, I don't think summons enforcement standards exactly map onto any other civil standard like this. I'll tell you why we think the Iqbal standard does not apply. There's a couple reasons. First, the Iqbal­Twombly standard is a pleading standard, it’s not about what kind of evidence. It's ­­ it's not about production of evidence to support your pleadings. And so in this case what we're saying is it doesn't matter how artfully you plead that there is an improper purpose; you need to be able to point to some kind of evidence to support that to raise an inference of improper purpose.",
  "It certainly ­­",
  "But you can't just allege things ­­",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay.",
  "And absolutely, we would say you would have discretion to do that as the district court. We ­­ we're not looking to constrain the district court's discretion here. And I think it's important to keep in mind, another reason that the Iqbal standard really doesn't work here is that by the time you're getting to this question about whether there's an improper purpose, as our opponent has alleged, the government has already made a substantial showing of good faith. The government has filed the Powell affidavit, a district court has satisfied itself that the government has established a proper purpose. And then the presumption is that the government's acting in good faith and for a proper purpose. And so when you're ­­ in the Iqbal context, the person who files a complaint is entitled to the presumption that what they say is true. It's the opposite here.",
  "That's what we're saying. That's exactly the standard that we think should have been applied. And if it ­­ and as long as an opponent, a summons opponent, can do that, can point to facts that raise an inference of improper purpose, then a district court needs to allow examination of IRS ­­",
  "Well, with respect, Your Honor, that ­­ that's the rule that's applied in the 11 other courts of appeals that have jurisdiction over these matters and it really has not been a problem in the district courts in those courts of appeals. It's only the Eleventh Circuit that has held you don't have to point to any evidence, you don't have to raise an inference, a district court has no discretions ­­",
  "I can't point to any study, but I have to think that if there were serious problems, you would see a lot more litigation about this issue.",
  "But none of them is applying the rule that the Eleven Circuit applies, which is you don't have to have ­­ you can just have an unsupported allegation.",
  "Okay. Great.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, if I can separate the two allegations. On the ­­ on the statute of limitations issue ­­",
  "Well, I'm sorry. There are different allegations, but they're sort of two reasons.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "I'm with you. So the two purposes, improper purposes that they discussed before this Court, are: First, retaliation for refusing to extend the statute of limitations; and second, circumvention of Tax Court discovery rules. So as to the first, again, I think you need to step back and ask: Well, would it be an improper purpose for the IRS to issue a summons after a taxpayer declines to extend the statute of limitations.",
  "I can't give you statistics, but my understanding is that the IRS does everything it can to get the information voluntarily and in a cooperative way from taxpayers before it has to resort to a summons. And so that often involves asking for extensions of the statute of limitations.",
  "To be honest, I don't know how often that happens either. I don't think it's infrequent. But I think you have to understand it within the context of the tax system. This isn't a system where the obligation is on the IRS to figure out how much each of us owes and to come after us for that amount. The obligation ­­ Congress has put it on the taxpayer to determine. Everyone has to do their own taxes, figure out how much they owe, and to give documentary evidence supporting their determination of how much they owe. And Congress has also told the IRS, we want you to go out and inquire into the liabilities of taxpayers with respect to any tax and figure out if people are doing this correctly.",
  "That's right. But if the ­­ if the IRS goes to taxpayers, they don't ­­ they don't just go to a taxpayer and issue a summons right off the bat. They go to a taxpayer, in this case the partnership. They made two deductions, questionable interest deductions totaling $34 million. The IRS said we're not sure about this. They asked for information that would allow the IRS to determine whether the deductions were correct. Now keep in mind­­",
  "No. We're not offering a line that a district court would not ­­",
  "Yes. I mean, we think almost any time a district court thinks there's a reason to hold the hearing, that it would allow examination by IRS officials ­­",
  "Well, I mean, I think any time you're talking about the district court's exercise of its discretion, you're going to have a range of situations in which the district court could do A or it could do the opposite of A, and it wouldn't be an abuse of discretion either way. That's the nature of discretion. In our view, in this case, if a district court sees a reason to hold the hearing and allow examination, it should do that, and the IRS, the government may argue ­­",
  "I don't have statistics. It's really hard to get numbers on all of these sort of numbers­based questions and I apologize for that. But my sense is it doesn't happen very often. But sometimes ­­",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's not quite right that ­­ first of all, we offered testimony just in that case. I don't think we offered that as a rule to govern all cases. But also, it wasn't just about any allegation of improper purpose. It was about a particular type of purpose that was ­­ that was relevant then, which is that an allegation that the IRS had a criminal investigation only purpose. And when Congress enacted TEFRA in 1982, it took that allegation of improper purpose off the table by sort of drawing ­­ making irrelevant whether the IRS ­­ whatever its internal motivation was, whether it was looking at criminal or civil liability, it took that off the table. And so all the courts of appeals from the '70s and '80s that allowed examination of IRS officials, as a matter of course or more frequently, all of those courts of appeals except the Eleventh Circuit changed their rule after TEFRA was enacted because all of those holdings were really just about whether the IRS had a solely criminal investigation purpose.",
  "I think it happens sometimes. It doesn't happen very often. And again, I think that's because before you even get to the question, the IRS has already made a significant showing through the Powell affidavit. It has established that it has a proper purpose. And the IRS doesn't just say, we have a proper purpose. They have to identify the purpose. And if you look on pages 24 and 25 of the Joint Appendix, you will see the purpose that's alleged in this case, which is looking into these questionable interest deductions.",
  "Well, the problem is that the IRS seeks the information when it issues the summons and that happens before the FPAA was issued. It happened before there's tax court proceedings. And so if you write an opinion that says, well, if you ­­ you know, if the ­­ if the summonses don't get enforced until after the FPAA is issued and at that point, the taxpayer is entitled to examine IRS officials, then you're giving taxpayers an incentive not to comply with summonses that are validly issued. Now, the order to show cause was issued by the district ­­ excuse me ­­ that was issued afterwards. But the taxpayer has an obligation even before the summonses are issued to provide information to the IRS to support its tax liability. Once the summonses are issued, it certainly has an even stronger obligation, and just because that hasn't yet been enforced through the district court, just because the Respondents refuse to comply with their obligation ­­",
  "Yes. That's exactly what I was ­­",
  "If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you. If I just ­­ I'd like to start by clarifying the finality of the FPAA issue. I tried to be very careful in my answer to Justice Breyer, and if I misspoke I apologize. What I intended to say or what I wanted to say was that the ongoing issue for the IRS is ­­ it might amend its final determination of liability for the taxpayer. Once you're in the Tax Court, that happens in the Tax Court, not by amending the FPAA, and I didn't mean to suggest otherwise. But ­­ so thinking about the Tax Court ­­ Tax Court, once you have the proceedings going there, the Tax Court itself has said that if you have a summons that was issued before the FPAA, it can be helpful to have that summons enforced because the information that would be acquired through enforcing that summons would be relevant to the ultimate question in the Tax Court.",
  "Well, that is the reason for enforcing the summons. That was not the reason for issuing the summons.",
  "And Powell has pointed to the ­­",
  "And the Tax Court has said that issuing a summons in that circumstance doesn't offend anything that's happening in the Tax Court. As Justice Ginsburg said ­­",
  "And they can go, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, they can go to the tax ­­",
  "Well, they can go to the Tax Court and say: Look, we don't think this information should be included. That's what happens in the grand jury cases they cite. They don't try ­­ you don't go and quash a grand jury subpoena. What you do is you go in your criminal case in the district court and say: You shouldn't use that information because it was obtained pursuant to a subpoena that was improperly issued. Now, the taxpayer ­­ it's the taxpayer's duty to establish that the deductions it's taking are justified. And in this case, the IRS didn't have enough information to make its own determination about that. And so what it decided was the taxpayer hadn't met its burden, and it issued the FPAA. And the IRS is entitled to take that protective step if the ­­ if the taxpayer is refusing to turn over information. Now, Respondents sort of pointed to several questions that they might want to ask the IRS agent who issued the summons. Those questions are clearly not relevant to the purpose for issuing the summons. Again, they just go to the purpose for enforcing the summons. And just one last point on Iqbal. We really don't think Iqbal applies here, because in this ­­ in this instance, what you are talking about is you already have a showing by the IRS that it has a proper purpose. And a district court is not going to issue an order to show cause unless the district court is satisfied that the IRS has established a proper purpose. And so the presumptions shift, are the opposite of Iqbal in that context. In that context, there's a presumption that the IRS has a proper purpose. And this Court said in the LaSalle National Bank case that then the duty is on the summons opponent to disprove a proper purpose. And so the opponent isn't entitled to a presumption that what they say is correct.",
  "Well, so this Court identified in Powell two potential improper purposes: One would be harassment and one is an attempt to kind of leverage a settlement in a collateral matter. And I think to take the second one, if the IRS were really trying to pressure a taxpayer into settling a collateral matter, the IRS would have some evidence of that; otherwise, it would be a pretty ineffective attempt to leverage a settlement. So they're going to have some communications from the IRS or something like that, and the taxpayer can submit affidavits or any kind of documentary evidence that's in the taxpayer's possession or the summons recipient's position to the district court and then the district court has discretion if it wants to hear more from the IRS, to ask for that more information in whatever way it deems appropriate. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is not whether Section 5 can compel deviations from a perfect population standard. The question is whether de minimis deviations are permitted by the Constitution. This Court has made very clear that when State districting plans are within the 10 percent deviation, total deviation from a perfect population equality standard, those plans are presumed to be constitutional. Now, that presumption is a substantive rule that serves three important principles. Just if I can briefly tick them off, the first is that such de minimis deviations do not by themselves violate equal protection. The second is that giving States a 10 percent leeway actually enhances citizens' fair and equal representation by allowing States to pursue other important districting principles. And the third is that limiting Federal court intervention in de minimis deviation cases protects State's sovereign right to draw districts for their own legislature.",
  "Well, I certainly don't mean to be misleading about this term that this Court has used ­­",
  "I would never accuse the Court of being misleading. I mean, I think the point that the Court has made is that these sort of, you know, 10 percent deviations from perfect population equality don't have enough of a dilutive effect to really affect any citizen's right to fair and equal ­­",
  "That's true. And our view, Justice Scalia, is that the case should begin and end at the prima facie case requirement. Our view is that the plaintiffs did not make a prima facie case of invidious discrimination in this case, and so the district court's factual findings about the Commission's actual motives actually aren't relevant at this point.",
  "Well, if you haven't made the prima facie case, it means that the State doesn't have to justify its reasons for the deviations. And so in this context, in order to make ­­ in really any context, to make a prima facie case, what you have to do is put in enough evidence from which an inference of invidious discrimination can be made. What that generally requires is that the challenger has to put in enough in evidence to rebut the presumed reasons for the challenged action. In this case the Arizona ­­ Arizona constitution sets forth the redistricting criteria that the Commission is to use in drawing district lines, and so at a minimum the plaintiffs should have come in and demonstrated that the ­­ that the deviations that they observed were not explainable as in service of the ­­",
  "Well, first, just a point of clarification. Part of the opinion that you read was just talking about District 8, and so it wasn't defining that partisanship played any role with respect to the rest of the map. And if you read on in the paragraph from which you were quoting, the district court said that the amount of deviation that was attributable to the attempts to make the district more competitive was less than 1 percent. I think it was .7 percent. And so it's really a small, very small ­­",
  "The district court found ­­",
  "The district court found that with respect to one district, two of the five commissioners were motivated in part by ­­ by partisanship motives. But, again, our ­­ our first position is that this Court doesn't need to get to what the actual findings were as to the motives because what the plaintiffs needed to do was come in and demonstrate at the front end that the lines on the map couldn't be explained as an effort to comply with legitimate districting criteria.",
  "We haven't taken a position on that that ­­",
  "Well, the United States has never participated in the political gerrymandering cases. It certainly ­­ you know, there are lessons that can be drawn from this Court's cases. In Gaffney, the Court indicated that certainly consideration of politics and partisanship does not necessarily make a plan unconstitutional. But, again, in this case, I think in order ­­ before you even get to the question of what the State's actual motives were, there has to be some demonstration that the motives were not the announced motives that are in the Arizona Constitution.",
  "Well, I think this Court's decision in Gaffney indicates that it can be permissible. The districting body in Gaffney was driven by a desire to equalize partisanship ­­",
  "That ­­",
  "I think that was the district court's conclusion. Our position ­­",
  "Well, again, we haven't taken a position on how one would analyze a partisanship ­­ if there was a finding that you get there, about a partisanship ­­ partisanship motive.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, no. Let me make the pitch one more time for the ­­ for having a robust prima facie case. So the ­­ what the Plaintiff needed to do was come into this ­­ come into court and say, here is a map; it can't be explained by the criteria that are identified in the Constitution that the Commission is supposed to go by. The very first criterion listed in the Constitution is complying ­­ includes compliance with the Voting Rights Act. If you look at the map and you look at which ­­ which districts were under­populated and which are the ability­to­elect districts, there's almost a perfect correlation. And I think ­­ I think that was a perfectly legitimate explanation for why there are deviations in the case.",
  "Well, again, I think, you know, we don't have a position on how one would analyze that ­­",
  "Well, this Court ­­",
  "I'm sorry to interrupt. This Court has repeatedly said that politics is always going to be a part of redistricting. And so I think it's ­­",
  "­­ you can't ­­ you can't ­­",
  "Okay. But ­­",
  "Well, I can ­­",
  "Well, I think this Court's decisions have told us that it's ­­ that it's fine to have partisanship play some role in redistricting. That's the ­­ that's the lesson of Gaffney.",
  "Can you give me the page, please?",
  "They say that on 79a, which is where you were reading from earlier ­­",
  "­­ I think it's clear that what they're talking about, that partisan ­­ that partisanship played a role only with respect to District 8. But let me just say, if ­­ if this Court allows the plaintiffs to come in and just point to ­­ to deviations in districts ­­",
  "Yes. That's my reading of the opinion. I think ­­ I haven't heard the other side disagree with that, but you can ask them. You know, if this Court makes it too easy for plaintiffs to come in and point to deviations and partisan correlations, then it's going to totally wipe away the 10­percent leeway, which itself serves important districting principles.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court of Appeals erred in holding that Section 523(a)(2)(A) always requires proof of an intentional misrepresentation in order to prove actual fraud. There are three main reasons why Petitioner and the government are right about our interpretation of Section 523(a)(2)(A). The first is that this Court has said many times that when Congress uses a term that has an established common­law meaning, courts should give it that meaning when it's used in a statute. For centuries, the term \"actual fraud\" has been used at common law to refer to schemes that are in ­­ that ­­ that where property is transferred with the ­­ with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. There is no reason to give that text any different meaning than in Section 523(a)(2)(a). The second is that our view is the only thing that ­­ the only interpretation that gives any meaning to the 1978 amendment. And the third is that our view is consistent with Congress's overarching purpose and the Bankruptcy Code, that ­­ that dishonors creditors ­­ excuse me ­­ dishonors debtors, not be permitted to use the Code to get rid of their debts. Now, Respondent offers a competing textual interpretation of the term ­­ of the phrase \"or actual fraud.\" I think Petitioner has explained well why that interpretation doesn't make any sense as an ­­ as a grammatical matter. It also wouldn't give any effect to the 1978 amendment. Petitioner also relies on the ­­ on the word \"obtained,\" which Justice Breyer was referring to as well. Excuse me. Respondent does ­­ Respondent suggests that our interpretation doesn't give any meaning to the word \"obtained,\" if obtained doesn't mean that a false representation was directed at a creditor. But under our view, the word \"obtained\" actually does two things: The first thing it does is the work that this Court described it as doing in Cohen v. de la Cruz, which is it requires a causal connection between the fraudulent act and the debtor's acquisition of ­­ or possession of the property or money. But the second thing it does, in the fraudulent transfer context, specifically, is it sort of screens out the innocent recipient of a fraudulent transfer. And so if Congress had instead used the phrase \"obtained as a result of actual fraud,\" then argue ­­ arguably, that could have brought in an innocent recipient of a fraudulent transfer, because as a result, I would suggest that you focus on the transaction that caused the transfer of property. But \"obtained by\" really focuses on the action of the recipient. And so it really just gets at the recipient's mental state and ­­ and fraudulent activity.",
  "Well, see, there are all kinds of debts that ­­ that do survive a bankruptcy, including the debt for the transferor.",
  "Well ­­ so I think it is important to realize there are two distinct debts: There's the original debtor ­­ there's original debt from the creditor to debtor one. Debtor one transfers his property to a friend. If the friend ­­ with the intent to defraud his creditor. If the friend shares that intent, then the State law or some Federal law gives the creditor a cause of action to go after the recipient, to go after the friend. If that ­­ if that is successful, then there's a new debt that's created from ­­ to the creditor from the ­­ from the friend. And that's the debt we're talking about here. With respect to why that wouldn't be dischargeable, when ­­ if you're outside the time limits that are covered by 548 or 727, the transferors wouldn't ­­ it's because the transferee, the recipient, is the person who ends up with the money or the property, right? So the second overarching purpose of the Bankruptcy Code is to let creditors get their money back when they can. And so it makes sense that Congress would have wanted to give maybe a stronger remedy ­­",
  "­­ against the person who actually has the stuff at the end of the day. And so I think that's why our ­­ our reading is consistent with the purpose of the ­­ of the Code in general.",
  "Well, you know, Mr. Dvorestzky suggested that it's ­­ with ­­ with respect to the recipients, recipient corporations, I think that there ­­ there are many questions about the State law cause of action that would need to be resolved on remand if the Court were to reverse. And I would just point out, on ­­ on the final page of our brief, we have the text of the veil piercing ­­ the Texas veil piercing, such that in ­­ in order ­­ in order to prevail under that section, the Petitioner is going to have to prove it says an actual fraud for the direct personal benefit of the holder. And so they're basically going to have to prove that Mr. Ritz obtained money or property by actual fraud, in order to prevail under the State law cause of action.",
  "There's ­­ so what happens is there's an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy ­­ in the larger bankruptcy proceeding itself. And so instead of having parallel litigation in State court, that action was stayed when the bankruptcy petition was filed. And basically, all the action is transferred to the bankruptcy court.",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "And the bankruptcy court held that it ­­ it wasn't satisfied in this case, because the bankruptcy court viewed those Texas laws as requiring a misrepresentation, and also as 523(a)(2)(a) is requiring misrepresentation. And so I think there ­­ there are a lot of things that would need to be sorted out about the State law cause of action on remand. I just want to say one last thing on redundancy, if I could. There's a couple of specific provisions in 523 that the Respondent suggests are redundant. One of them is 523(a)(4), and Respondent suggests that ­­ and that's the ­­ that covers fraud in a fiduciary capacity, such that if we're correct that anything that would be covered by (a)(4) would ­­ would also be covered by 523(a)(2)(A). But that's not correct, because 523(a)(4) is not ­­ is not limited to situations in which money or property was obtained by fraud. And so it could cover a fraud where a fiduciary caused one of your properties to go to a third party. And ­­ and so that would be covered by (a)(4) and wouldn't be covered by (a)(2)(a). And just in general, one last thing on redundancy, I think Congress is trying to be comprehensive in preventing dishonest debtors from discharging their debts in bankruptcy. And so Congress used broad words like \"fraud,\" and instead of sitting down and thinking ­­ trying to think up every different fraudulent scheme that people might come up with, Congress just wanted to be comprehensive and say \"fraud,\" and it uses the same word \"fraud\" in multiple places. That's going to create overlap. But that's a feature of the system, and not a flaw in the system. Thank you."
