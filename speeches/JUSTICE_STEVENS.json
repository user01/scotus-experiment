  "Thank you, Ms. Birnbaum.",
  "I think we've got your position. The case is submitted.",
  "May I ask you if in exercising prudential judgment on whether to accord prudential standing, because I guess there's article III standing here, is it appropriate to take into consideration as one fact that it's already been argued in this case and it's now ripe for decision, or should we just totally ignore that aspect of the case?",
  "No, but in that case there was a conflict between the interests of the third party and the interests of the litigant or a potential client. Here there's no conflict between the lawyers and the clients.",
  "But -- but why isn't the Younger abstention problem just like the mootness problem in Craig against Boren? It took one class of litigants unavailable but then allowed the third party to have standing. Why -- why aren't -- aren't your opponents here just like the bartenders in Craig against Boren?",
  "No, but they have the same interest that the bartenders had because they won't make some -- sell their services and the bartenders wouldn't sell the booze. I don't see the difference.",
  "Well, is it correct as a factual matter that these particular lawyers do have clients that they could be representing -­",
  "-- on direct appeal?",
  "Well, it just would seem to me that the lawyers who are advancing this claim may or may not be representing individuals who want to make the same claim, but there -- there must be some lawyers who want to make these claims who don't have any clients, and the question is whether they have standing. And are they to be defeated standing because there are a lot of other lawyers who might also sue?",
  "Then what case holds that there must be an impediment for the third party? I keep coming back to Craig against Boren. They could have filed another class action and say that they filed a class action and had standing. Would we have suddenly decided we won't decide the merits even though it's been argued and both sides have had their day in court?",
  "What is the source of the requirement there must be an impediment to the third party suit?",
  "That -- where they granted standing.",
  "Have they ever denied standing on the ground that there was no impediment to the third party suit? I don't think we have.",
  "It doesn't have to be idle to be dicta, though, does it?",
  "Do you fully concede there must be an impediment even though the Court has never so held?",
  "That just proves they don't listen to me as much as they should.",
  "Or he makes a mistake in finding.",
  "He finds a gun when there really wasn't one.",
  "Mr. Clement, following up on Justice Kennedy's thought, if we adhere to the strict language in Apprendi itself, as quoted below, any - solely on the fact reflected in the jury verdict or the plea of the plea bargain, that's - that establishes the maximum. What percent of the total number of sentences that are imposed in the, by the Federal system today would violate that rule?",
  "Well, let's look at the future and assume that in 97 percent of the cases which are plea bargains, you could agree on what the relevant facts are. That certainly could be done. And in the 3 percent that are trialed, it is my impression that a very small number of those actually involve violations of the Apprendi rule. Is that correct?",
  "See, it's relevant because underlying all this is a question do the guidelines fail in toto, or do they only fail with respect to those relatively small number of cases in which there's a violation of the Apprendi rule?",
  "In raising the issue, it depends on what - the issue you describe. A lot of people describe it as an issue when you just use the guidelines at all. Do they raise an issue, involve it in a sentence over and above the amount that would be authorized by either the jury verdict or the plea bargain?",
  "They all, of course, involve a potential upward adjustment. But do they all involve actual sentences above the amount that the jury verdict would have authorized?",
  "The thing that -- I'm sorry, but I really, it's important to me. Raising an issue, the issue is always raised when there's a possibility of a higher sentence, but I don't think it's fair to assume that that 65 percent of the sentences of tried cases actually resulted in sentences higher than what the jury verdict would have authorized.",
  "It's potentially that every case does. But if in fact, most sentences come within the maximum anyway, it's of course a serious problem in those cases, but system-wide, it's not nearly the problem that the figures you've mentioned suggest.",
  "Just consider the word court to mean jury. Jury or a judge.",
  "It just means that if a different procedure is followed, you'll reach precisely the same sentences the guidelines reached.",
  "You think judges reach different results on factual issues than juries do? Is that part of your submission?",
  "But keep it simple because we're assuming that in most cases, there aren't a host of factors but usually just two or three, such as the drug quantity and did he find a gun. Now in those where there's a fairly simple fact to identify, would it make any difference in the ultimate sentence that's imposed whether the jury finds it or the judge finds it?",
  "Keep to that example I've given you. The gun and the drug quantity. Why would it make a difference?",
  "Wouldn't it make any difference?",
  "And there's a difference in sentence depending on the amount of money that the fraud involved.",
  "In that case -- let's take them one at a time. In that case, would it make any difference whether the jury made the finding or the judge made the finding?",
  "Okay. Then what",
  "Now can you give me a case in which it would make a difference?",
  "You don't think a very large fraud such as you've described could be proved through two or three witnesses?",
  "They used the Internet and they had all said -- I am not persuaded.",
  "Mr. Clement can I -- you don't have an awful lot of time left, and I want to ask you one rather important question, to me. There's been a lot of talk about severability of the statute, and I can understand the concept that we'll only apply it in certain categories of cases. But normally when I consider severability, I'm thinking of the text of a written statute. Is there a particular provision of the sentencing guidelines that you think can be severed from the rest of the statute?",
  "Just sticking to the statute, take out 3553(b) in its entirety, you just -­",
  "I'm just not sure what's left of the whole statute if you take that provision out entirely.",
  "He sets the sentence within the range authorized by the jury's verdict. That's the question.",
  "I'm not sure that I understand why you wouldn't have the same alternatives under your view. Because is it not correct that if the, if the sentence -- the change under consideration is a decrease, those findings could be made by a judge. Whereas, if it's an increase, you'd say they have to be found by a jury. So why don't you have the same possibility of a two-track system under your view?",
  "So you would say -- you would say your proposal is closer to what Congress really wanted, because it would leave in place all of the sentences that would be commanded by the guidelines, but just require a different fact finder in some of the cases.",
  "Could I interrupt for that?",
  "There's one thing that's running through my mind. What if the defendant gets on the stand and testifies to a version of the events that the jury must have disbelieved in order to convict? Could not the judge -- in effect, he would be making the finding -- he would say, \"The jury has really found this fact, and, therefore, I can rely on it.\"",
  "Did the trial judge give any indication of what sentence he would have imposed if he were not constrained by the guidelines?",
  "How can you do that? The statute that makes the guidelines mandatory applies to both upwards and downwards departures, so I have always had trouble knowing what provision of the statute anybody severs. I can understand your saying that there's a bunch of unconstitutional applications of the statute, and you have to set aside the sentences in those particular cases, but I simply don't understand severing a single provision that covers both upward and downward departures. How do you sever it?",
  "But that's the same, that's the same provision that allows departures for the same -- by the same procedure.",
  "It seems to me you're not severing a piece of a statute, you're just severing a bunch of applications of the statute you think are invalid.",
  "Correct. I understand.",
  "And may I add this thought, that it seems to me, I don't know whether this is true; Mr. Clement and I had a dialogue that was inconclusive; I had been under the impression, perhaps erroneous, that in fact the number of unconstitutional departures if one follows Apprendi as being the constitutional rule, is actually a small percentage of the total, and if it should follow that only three, four, five, six percent of the sentences that have heretofore been imposed or will be imposed in the future would be unconstitutional, that's a pretty weak reason for saying the whole statute is unconstitutional on its face, or even in one provision of the statute. It seems to me you just say, \"Oh, okay, you can't impose those sentences in those three percent of the cases.\" I don't know why that's a departure from our prior practice.",
  "No, my suggestion is everybody is going to be sentenced under the Guidelines; the only difference is that in three or four percent of the cases you may have to bring a jury in to get an enhanced sentence.",
  "Have you read Justice Thomas's opinion in Apprendi? He's got a lot of prior law that's in there that maybe would be of interest to you.",
  "May I ask just one, one last question? Do you agree that within the guidelines ranges, which sometimes are fairly large, the judge does have the discretion to impose any sentences he wants to based on the conduct of the defendant, whether or not it's proved by the jury?",
  "You get to the range by the jury finding, the judge still retains substantial discretion within the, within the range.",
  "Mr. Draper, correct me if I'm wrong. I -- I looked at these papers a while ago. I thought they did it on a 10-year basis and they just moved it up each year, using a different 10 years to calculate the -- the relevant amounts in the 10th year.",
  "So they do use 10 years of figures to determine what the relevant year's water would be.",
  "Mr. Draper, could I ask you what is a matter of procedure? What is your understanding of -- of how one would go about challenging the river master's decision if one disagreed with it? Do you go to the special master? Do you come direct to this Court?",
  "Directly.",
  "May I ask you a question, because you may not bother to talk about it otherwise, about punitive damages? Your opponent didn't seem to think it very important, but I have this question. Is it your view that the other State waived its claim to the punitive damages from 1985 back either by not arguing it today or by submitting the different set of figures at the time the -- the issue was before the master the last time around?",
  "Did he -- did he make that suggestion or did the other -- did Kansas make that suggestion?",
  "In this time around or in the preceding -­",
  "Well, the master's methodology really wasn't at issue.",
  "The only issue before us, as I remember it, was the date from which the prejudgment interest would run.",
  "That's -- that's all that was argued. And it seemed to me that if it had been a fixed sum rather than an -- a changing amount as years went by, that clearly we would have -- the interest would have run on the existing liability. But it's an unusual case because the damages are changing as time goes by.",
  "No, but did we -- your -- your view is that we entirely eliminated any interest on that past damage.",
  "Pre-1985.",
  "Well, but our opinion didn't say it was just post-'85 damages. Our -- our opinion didn't -- didn't answer the question, and -- and the reason, of course, is we didn't actually think about it because nobody even -- nobody argued it at that time.",
  "So in a way you really are arguing waiver I think.",
  "Which is consistent with his failure to argue it today.",
  "So you're arguing they've waived the -- your argument is they waived the objection basically.",
  "I don't think you used the word waiver in your brief, and I don't think that Colorado did either. But I guess that's the essence of your argument.",
  "Would you not agree that if it was a one-shot injury, not an ongoing injury, that the normal reading would be the injury -- the interest should run on the laws?",
  "And it involves continuing, ongoing -­",
  "May I ask you -­",
  "What does the term \"micro color\" describe?",
  "Does it have a meaning in any context other than describing the -- one party's product in this case?",
  "No, but do they use the apple as clearly a descriptive term with secondary meaning, that's what gives it protection. But if you have an arbitrary term, as Justice Scalia says, how could that be, how could the defense have any relevance to a fanciful or arbitrary term. And I thought the defense only was relevant when you -- everybody agrees you're talking about descriptive terms?",
  "May I ask, may I just interrupt, but when would one ever be able to use the defense if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, prima facie case, I assume, includes the burden of establishing likelihood of confusion. So, is there any room for the defense at all?",
  "So the answer is no.",
  "It's allowed without the affirmative defense.",
  "But are you suggesting, I want to be sure I follow your thinking, are you saying that in, back in those days, somebody with an incontestable mark did not have to prove likelihood of confusion?",
  "Because otherwise, wouldn't that defeat the defense, too, then?",
  "Your customers are pretty sophisticated people, I guess, they're specialists in an unusual trade, so they're not just like a person walking off the street that doesn't know what it is, they probably know this market pretty well.",
  "Just out of curiosity, it has nothing to do with the case, do they market this product with color charts, just like paint companies do?",
  "But of course, the death penalty was not a deterrent for any of the crimes described in the Alabama brief because those are all -­ crimes all occurred in States which execute people under 18.",
  "May I ask this question, Mr. Layton? This case kind of raises a question about the basic State interests that are involved here, and the State interests that justify the death penalty include deterrence and also retribution.",
  "Which, if either, of those do you think is the primary State interest you seek to vindicate today?",
  "May I just ask one further?",
  "Is there any evidence that the death penalty for those under 18 or even above has, in fact, had any deterrent value?",
  "Of course, one -- one of the objections in -- in Atkins was we needed a bright line test. We'd have difficulty determining which ones are mentally retarded. Here we don't have that problem at all. I guess everybody knows whether or not the defendant is over or under 18.",
  "But the -- but the purpose of a bright line test is to avoid litigation over the borderline cases, and you just have completely avoided that in this category.",
  "But it's an equally arbitrary line if it's 16, 17, or 15.",
  "May I ask one -- have you read the brief of the former U.S. diplomats in the case?",
  "Do you think we should give any credence whatsoever to the arguments they make?",
  "The respect of other countries for our country is something we should totally ignore.",
  "We should leave it up to the legislature of the State of Missouri to resolve those questions.",
  "But, Mr. Kneedler, recognizing that distinction, is that a distinction drawn by the statute that's before us?",
  "May I ask you about -­",
  "Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a question, forgetting the statutes for a moment -- I -­ which we've already covered at some length? Just going to your constitutional position, it's clear that a person who's not been admitted and has been paroled could be excluded forthwith, summarily, and so forth because he's never been admitted. But does that person have any protection under the Constitution? Could we shoot him?",
  "Then what is the protection under the Constitution that deals -- is it the Due Process Clause?",
  "Is he -- is he a person within the meaning -­",
  "And is he a person who has a right to liberty, entitled to some protection, very, very, very minimal, but there is some protection to that -- that individual.",
  "Well, the context is he got off a boat. We couldn't -- but Cuba won't take him back or -- or whatever -- wherever he came from. They can't. And the only thing we can do to keep him out of the country is to keep him in jail.",
  "He -- he doesn't have a right to be released. But -- but you do not contend that we could kill him.",
  "He does have some -- some minimal protection under the Constitution.",
  "May I ask if you believe the supervision after the 90-day period covered in subparagraph 3 -- is there -- can that continue indefinitely in your view?",
  "Well, I don't think it really said they -- they found there was a security risk. They -- they held the Government did not have to explain because the man had no right to come in.",
  "Mr. Kaplan, you may proceed.",
  "Yes, but you haven't told us whether you think it was a vessel or not.",
  "Was -- was it a vessel?",
  "The scow was.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kaplan. Thank you. Your time is up.",
  "Ms. Blatt.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Mr. Connelly.",
  "You're not contending that anything that happens in a harbor is not exposed to the perils of the sea, are you?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Connelly. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue -- Internal Revenue against Banks and the Commissioner against Banaitis. Mr. Salmons.",
  "Mr. Jones.",
  "Would you have a different result if they were related? Supposing the lawyer is a cousin of the client.",
  "Or a good friend.",
  "Well, it's not a sham transaction. You just happen to be related.",
  "And I'm just wondering if that -­",
  "Yes, but what if you had the same result but -- in terms of the sharing of the expense and the recovery, but it was computed on an hourly basis rather than a percentage basis? Would that produce a different result?",
  "No, but he could have made -- I'm saying he could have said to the lawyer, I'll pay you 30 -- a -- a third of the recovery or I'll pay you $100 an hour.",
  "And they come out exactly the same result, but you -- but do you treat them differently or the same?",
  "Well, may I ask one --",
  "May I ask one other hypothetical? Supposing that the agreement on the contingency is postponed until the middle of the preparation, not made at the outset, but along the line, they say we'll figure out what a fair percentage will be, and when the recovery comes in, they then decide, okay, you take a third. What -- what result do you do in that case?",
  "But I'm sure it arises fairly often.",
  "Well, I did very often.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Jones. Mr. Carty.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Carty.",
  "Mr. Salmons, you have a little over 2 minutes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Salmons.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument in Johnson against California. Mr. Deixler.",
  "Mr. Deixler, do you think you lose if we apply Turner?",
  "Well, why isn't that the right approach to the case then if that's the -- we don't have to meddle with the rules governing the -- the conduct of prisons, if you can prevail under that theory?",
  "Mr. Clement.",
  "Mr. Clement, will you tell us how the Government would come out applying the Turner analysis in this case?",
  "You're concerned about evaluating prison race policies. Are there any other prison policies in the country that adopt a racial test like that?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement.",
  "Mr. -- Ms. Grunder.",
  "Is there any evidence in the record that the initial placing of two inmates in the same cell has ever had -- has ever produced a racial incident?",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Yes.",
  "You've never tried it.",
  "But it applies in the reception center area for someone who has been transferred as well as the -- an initial incarceration.",
  "May I ask what's probably a stupid question? We're concerned, I suppose, about say, a black prisoner who's just coming into prison for the first time and you hope he won't join one of the black gangs. So wouldn't the safest thing to do for the first 20 days is to put him with a cellmate who's not black?",
  "Between the gangs. But I'm assuming a new prisoner who you have no information about. Do you presume he's a member of a gang or presume he's somebody who may not be a member of a gang?",
  "Well, if he's not a member of the gang, isn't the danger that he'll become affiliated with the gang increased by insisting on putting him with the same race as -- as he is?",
  "Of course, you -- you have never -- no evidence that that's ever happened because you've never tried it.",
  "But it still seems to me that a new inmate is more likely to be subjected to that pressure with the -- his cellmates than with somebody out in the yard.",
  "And it seems to me insurance against him joining a racial gang is cell -- cell him with somebody who's not of the same race.",
  "May I ask just one other question about the -- the purpose you're trying to achieve? Is it to protect the two inmates who are first celled together from fighting with one another, or is it to avoid the danger that one of them will somehow start a riot later on in -- in the general prison population?",
  "It's what?",
  "May I ask -- excuse me. Go ahead. I want to ask one other question. You -- you mentioned the Texas system and you discussed it in your brief. Is that correct? I didn't find it in your discussion as to the Texas case.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Grunder. Mr. Deixler, you have about three and a half minutes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Deixler. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll now hear argument in Florida against Nixon. Mr. Lemieux.",
  "May I ask --",
  "May I ask if -- do you think his representation would have been inadequate if he had not discussed the strategy with the client but everything else was exactly the same?",
  "Well, why would it be -- why would it make any difference under Strickland whether he talked to the client or not if the same -- if the same considerations are in play? In other words, he just knew it was the -- the wiser strategy to try and save him from the death penalty?",
  "It seems to me rather difficult to -- to draw that line. If -- if consent is necessary, why shouldn't it be express? I'm not saying consent is necessary, but normally if you're going to have something this important and consent is necessary, it seems to me it ought to be clear on the record. You certainly wouldn't accept this for a guilty plea, what you have here.",
  "That's right, and that's why I'm suggesting if it really is a question of strategy, you don't even need implicit consent.",
  "And I'm not sure there's a -­",
  "-- three-part rule, as Justice Scalia says. There's just a two-part rule.",
  "Yes, but these -- let me just understand. These colloquies are not, in your view, commanded by the Florida Supreme Court's holding.",
  "But only -- is it -- it's not just when there's the equivalent of the guilty plea, but any major trial strategy -­",
  "Is this -- I want to know if the Florida Supreme Court's holding is limited to cases that are the functional equivalent of -- of a guilty plea, and -- and it's only there that they're requiring the colloquy.",
  "Well, but of course what the lower courts are doing may or may not be right as a matter of Florida law, but that's not before us really.",
  "Mr. Gornstein.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Tillinghast.",
  "Mr. Tillinghast, can I ask you if you are familiar with the Loeb/Leopold trial many, many years ago that was conducted by Clarence Darrow? If you're not, I won't push you on it.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Tillinghast. Mr. Lemieux, you have about 4 minutes left.",
  "Why should -- why should they put in Strickland evidence if they've won under Cronic?",
  "I thought it was remanded for an issue -- for a hearing on the consent issue after -­",
  "I see.",
  "Thank you. The case is submitted.",
  "Argument in Smith against the City of Jackson. Mr. Goldstein.",
  "Mr. Goldstein, let me just interrupt a minute. You say if it lacks the -- the business justification. But is it not a part of -- that is not a part of the plaintiffs' primary submission, is it, that it does not show? That's an affirmative defense.",
  "May I ask a question at this point going really back to the question I asked you at the outset of the argument? If I thought seniority or years of service was a reasonable factor other than age and if I thought this particular compensation program was based on years of service rather than age, can I look at the reasonable factor other than age in deciding whether your complaint states a cause of action?",
  "And if I do look at it and if I do come to the conclusion I've suggested, would I not have to dismiss your complaint?",
  "The hypothetical -- and I think it may be the case -- that you have a compensation program which uses years of service as a basis for classifying employees which has a disparate impact on older workers, but it does -- also it relies squarely on a reasonable factor other than age if you will call years of service such a factor.",
  "I understand that to be this case.",
  "No, but the basis for differentiation was years of service, was it not?",
  "Well, I'm just asking in the abstract. Why wouldn't that always be a -- a reasonable factor other than age?",
  "But the factor -- if I understand it, it wasn't because they were line officers, it was rather because they had lesser years of service than the more senior officers.",
  "No.",
  "I don't think the statement of purpose tells me what the -- what the criterion for the different treatment was. I still think it was years of service.",
  "What was the criterion?",
  "So in other words, the criterion was the kind of rank they had before.",
  "Why isn't that a reasonable factor other than age?",
  "In other words, you say the -­ the question isn't whether they used a reasonable factor other than age. Your question is whether the use of those factors was overall reasonable.",
  "That's a rewriting of the statute.",
  "Title VII doesn't have this language in it.",
  "Mr. Nager.",
  "In that -- in that case, we were construing the word age and age definitely has a different meaning from sex or -- or race.",
  "Mr. Nager, I'm lost. What -­ what part of 56a are you referring to? (d)?",
  "Does it say what you just said?",
  "Mr. Nager, at the end of his report, Secretary Wirtz said the -- a purpose, to eliminate discrimination in the employment of older workers, it would necessary not only to deal with overt acts of discrimination, but also to adjust those present employment practices which quite unintentionally lead to age limits in hiring. And your point, as I understand it, yes, that was one of his purposes, but he meant that one to be accomplished with ERISA and other things like that.",
  "The quote -- the reference to employment practices which quite unintentionally lead to age limits in hiring. I see what you're saying.",
  "But in your view, is based on reasonable factors other than age strictly an affirmative defense?",
  "Well, did you challenge the sufficiency of this complaint on the ground that it did not allege that the -- the program was not based on -- was based on factors that were unreasonable?",
  "What I'm trying to think through is whether that issue is one that can be resolved on the pleadings, or does it always require a trial.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Nager. I think you've answered the question. Mr. Goldstein, you have 4 minutes, and let's make it 4 and a half.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Goldstein. The case is submitted.",
  "Mr. Boas, the Court will hear argument in Small against the United States.",
  "Mr. Boas, I think you make a strong argument that Congress probably didn't think of this particular problem. Do you suppose if at the hearings before the committee, the process of the legislation, some witness came in and said, do you realize this language is so broad it will cover the person who is convicted of a felony in Japan, as well as person who's convicted of a felony in Illinois, do you think they would have modified the statute?",
  "Well, there would have been a need to under your view now.",
  "But I suppose somebody on the committee might have said, well, we don't want this kind of person to have a gun, and the fact he's convicted in Japan rather than in Brooklyn really doesn't make any difference with regard to the purpose of the statute.",
  "Well, but this person -­",
  "But the defendant in this case was convicted in Japan and he somehow got to the United States.",
  "Well --",
  "Maybe you can think -­",
  "Maybe you can think of a unanimous case.",
  "I'm sorry. You've exhausted your time.",
  "Ms. Millett.",
  "Yes, but --",
  "-- but let me just interrupt on your -- your best case suggestion. I don't think the test is when has the word any been used in different ways, but has the word any court ever been used by Congress to include foreign courts.",
  "No. I'm asking about just the words, any court. What's your best case for the proposition that that would normally be construed by Congress to include foreign courts?",
  "You don't have a case.",
  "And do they ever refer to foreign courts? That's the question.",
  "But the reason you often need qualification is there's -- there's sort of a basic question, does this include State courts as well as -- as well as Federal, and it's often necessary to spell it out one way or the other. But I don't -- I'm not aware of any precedent for trying to decide whether it also embraces foreign courts.",
  "May -- may I interrupt this -­",
  "-- this colloquy to raise another question, if I may? Would you concede that there are some tribunals in the world that are comparable to what you might call a kangaroo court that Congress would not have intended to include within the term court?",
  "And how are we to decide whether such tribunal should be treated as a court within the meaning of the statute when there is no statutory definition of the term court?",
  "But if you concede that there are some tribunals that are not courts within the meaning of the statute, are you not conceding that the word court is inherently ambiguous?",
  "But it's something less than the all-inclusive term, any court, in a literal sense.",
  "Do you know any cases in which we've construed a statute narrowly on the ground that we're confident the prosecutor won't bring any such cases?",
  "But it's -- it's been on the books for so long with very, very few prosecutions. So it's one -- it's not exactly an urgent question. But it does seem to me if this -- this problem had been brought to the attention of Congress, they would have defined the term court, and I don't -- they haven't done that but probably because they didn't think of the problem. And you can argue, well, they surely would have wanted to have this particular person prosecuted, but would they have wanted everyone with every foreign court all over the world. That's the question.",
  "You know, this is a very interesting case because there are three ways to answer the question of what is a court. You can leave it up to us to do it, and that would be judicial legislation to fill in a hole in the statute. You can have the executive do it, decide what case -- what cases to prosecute, or if we should knock out this -- interpret the statute in the -- in a different way than you urge, Congress would then do it. Now, which of the three is the better lawmaker on deciding which is the -- what should the meaning of the word court be? The executive, the legislature, or the judiciary?",
  "No, but it is pretty clear that Congress didn't really think about this problem.",
  "And it is also clear on your side that they would like to prevent this guy from having a gun.",
  "So there are two competing considerations, both of which are very powerful.",
  "Thank you. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument in No. 03­ 710, Devenpeck against Alford. Ms. Hart.",
  "You mean he could be held until a charge is filed without being told why he's being held?",
  "So that could be a week or 2.",
  "And how soon is he entitled to appear before the magistrate?",
  "How soon after his physical arrest does he have a right to appear before the magistrate?",
  "So for 72 hours, he could be held incommunicado without knowing why he was arrested.",
  "Mr. Comey.",
  "But, of course, even in those examples, there could be a difference in what the police officer had actually observed. He might not have seen the safety sticker or the taillight or whatever it is. So you do have some inquiry into the mental processes of the officer in every case.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Comey. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Yes, but did you object to the instructions in the trial court?",
  "One of the problems I have with the case, very frankly, is that the jury has already ruled against your client on the qualified immunity issue carrying out instructions given by the judge that were not objected to by your client.",
  "But whose fault is that?",
  "May I ask one other question about the proceedings in the trial court?",
  "Was there a motion for summary judgment by the defendants claiming, as a matter of law, they should be entitled to qualified -­",
  "And that was overruled.",
  "And then there was a jury trial and the jury disagreed with it and, in effect, said there -- there was basis for qualified immunity.",
  "What is your understanding of the reason for the jury's verdict on this issue?",
  "May I ask one other question then too?",
  "In -- in your view is the closely related doctrine a -- a matter of closely related as a matter of law between two different offenses or is it a matter of -- are the facts relevant? For example, could one argue that these offenses were factually related pretty closely because they grew out of the same central group of facts?",
  "Yes, but Mr. Phillips, let me go back first principles. You are complaining about an arrest which you admit was valid. Do you not -- do -- do you not that the arrest was supported by probable cause and therefore was a valid arrest?",
  "Yes.",
  "Oh, I misunderstood. I thought we were just talking about qualified immunity. But you challenge the arrest itself even though you admit there was probable cause for the arrest?",
  "And -- and there's no need for the Ninth Circuit's rule unless there was probable cause because if there was no probable cause, you win on that ground. You don't have to get into this closely related offense doctrine. Is that correct?",
  "No. If there was no probable cause.",
  "Then you win without this fancy doctrine.",
  "This -- this doctrine only comes into play and is only required in cases involving a valid arrest and a -- a mistake by the officer in identifying the wrong cause for the arrest. So it's an extension of the qualified -- it's a -- it's a -- an application of the qualified immunity doctrine to say you are not protected even though you acted lawfully.",
  "No, but if you say the arrest was valid, he did act lawfully although we didn't realize the reason why he did.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Ms. Hart, you have 5 -- 5 minutes.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Hart. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument in Shepard against the United States. Ms. Thompson.",
  "May I ask you a question? Assume the case had been tried and you could not tell from either the indictment or the instructions to the jury whether it was a generic burglary or a nongeneric burglary. Would the -- our decision permit us to look at the transcript of the trial to answer that question?",
  "So your argument is that this is comparable to using the transcript of the trial.",
  "So this is even farther removed.",
  "Ms. Thompson, you know your white light is on. So if you want to save time, you should perhaps do so right now.",
  "Mr. Elwood.",
  "May I ask this question? Suppose the police report had been ambiguous and referred to both a boat and a house. What would -- could -- would it be -- what would you do in that case?",
  "But why -- why couldn't you use it in the other case? Couldn't you ask the police officer what he -- who conducted the investigation what the facts really were?",
  "And you'd start out with the premise that 90 percent of these cases are really houses anyway, so there's a strong presumption in favor of the Government?",
  "So the -- the question in this case is whether a police report is extrinsic evidence, isn't it?",
  "Well, suppose that it was an assault and battery, for example, and you're trying to decide whether it was violent or not, and the police report was somewhat ambiguous. Could you -- you couldn't look at it then.",
  "There's a distinction between violent assaults and -­",
  "-- nonviolent assaults.",
  "And you might want to find out which one it was and -- and as here, it seems pretty easy. Everybody knows most burglaries are -- are of houses. But I'm just wondering if we're not trying to find out what the categorical rule is that -- that is at stake here.",
  "Well, you say it provided the basis for the conviction. Was it presented to the court in each of these cases?",
  "But couldn't the judge in that colloquy have said to him, did you break into a building, a car, or a boat? And he would have said yes, and wouldn't that have satisfied the element of the crime?",
  "May I -­",
  "But if we don't get to the outer reaches, the next case I suppose will involve a -­ an application for a search warrant or an arrest warrant which describes facts and pretty well tells you what really happened. Could you rely on that?",
  "Well, the police report wasn't made on that date. The police report was prepared earlier, I assume.",
  "But if it's that -- if it's that explicit, I don't think you need the police report.",
  "It seems to me we're dealing with a case in which the court documents are sufficiently ambiguous that you have to look to something else. Then the question is what other things may you look to, and you say we can look to police reports. I say why not look at warrant applications or maybe the prosecutor's notes, or there could be other equally reliable documents available, it would seem to me, that would -- which establish the facts.",
  "I thought the police reports were not present in the court -­",
  "Mr. Elwood, can I tell you what's troubling me about that? Maybe the whole categorical approach is unwise. It may have been more strict than it should be. But it -- I'm puzzled by the notion that in a case that's been tried to verdict, you can only look at the indictment and the instructions, as I understand Justice Blackmun's opinion. You could not look at the testimony in the record, even though there are nine witnesses who described what happened. It seems to me that might be much more reliable than a police report. And I'm just wondering am I correct, do you think, on saying you cannot look at the testimony in the tried case? And if so, how do you -- how do you say that police reports are better than sworn witnesses?",
  "It's a for example thing.",
  "The thing I'm just questioning is whether this rule that you -- you're advocating is really more administrable than one that just says it seems crazy in this particular case. But -- but in the interest of having a categorical administrative rule, we'll simply say whatever the public record shows and the proceedings themselves.",
  "Yes, but aren't the vast majority of guilty pleas unambiguous? This is a rather rare case.",
  "Yes, whenever straddle crimes, but -- but they're the exception rather than the rule.",
  "But even burglary I think in most States would be clear.",

As I understand, you're saying 98 percent of the appropriation have been allocated to programs, projects, activities, and so forth that can't be reduced. Now, is there anything in the statute that would have prevented the Secretary from allocating only 96 percent of the budget to those funds?",
  "But his budget that he actually worked out with the 98 percent was not mandated by the statute, as I understand.",
  "In part but not in whole.",
  "Well, that's the point.",
  "Is the -- is the nub of what you're trying to tell me is that the 98 percent was, in fact, mandated by a statute?",
  "Principal part, but -­",
  "Does that mean that there was not enough?",
  "They could have made it 97 percent --",
  "-- and had enough money -­",
  "-- to pay these contract obligations.",
  "See, the thing that troubles me is it seems to me your reading of the statute makes the contractual problem -- provision illusory because they can always allocate funds to all these other projects and say, well, we've already used up the money.",
  "Are you telling me that the committee reports are -- are binding law?",
  "It seems to me you can interpret those comments as saying we don't -- they did not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.",
  "Yes. It seems to me that you can interpret what you're saying as the -- as the -- the Government adopting a budget in which there's not enough room for all the programs it wants to support in the current year and continuing to honor the obligations under the existing contracts.",

Supposing the Canadian revenue agent got inside of New York and one of your clients beat him up, would we have -- solely because he was mad at him for trying to interfere with his attempt to smuggle into Canada -- would we have to say that you can't do that, we have no jurisdiction over the assault and battery?",
  "The only purpose would be just what the purpose is here, they're trying to facilitate the smuggling operation.",
  "Is to interfere with Canadian's collection of their taxes. That's the only reason for it.",
  "Why is that any more attenuated than a conspiracy carried out down here in Maryland using American assets to do the evil deed in Canada?",
  "Ms. Brill, in the Court of Appeals, they treated the argument that this was not property as entirely separate from the revenue rule question. And I thought your petition for cert was confined to the first question.",

  "Before you were asked a brief question.",
  "But may I ask this question? I think you have conceded, in a footnote -- and maybe you're -- almost conceded -- that if this were a RICO case, a civil RICO case, that the Congress enacted the RICO statute against this background rule and that perhaps the RICO case could not go forward. What if it were a federal RICO case and -- the same facts -- would the RICO statute be qualified by the revenue rule?",

  "Do you also concede he did so deliberately? Do you concede there was prosecutorial misconduct is what I'm really asking.",
  "That -- that statement went to whether the jury was apt to accept it, not to the question of whether the prosecutor acted improperly.",
  "But Ms. Cortina, the -- the red brief -- maybe it's not accurate. They say the instruction was all the evidence received during any part of the trial in this case, except as you may hereafter be instructed, and then that followed what -- the factor (k) discussion came after that. So would it not have been possible that the jury would have thought except for the following things? Or is there something more that I missed?",
  "So if they misunderstood the factor (k) instruction, they would have thought they could not consider all the evidence.",
  "Well, if they believed the prosecutor, they would have thought they couldn't.",
  "But all -- all I'm directing my inquiry to is to the significance of the instruction to consider all the evidence. I think it's they could consider all the evidence, except that which may not be admissible, as I now -- or may not be relevant as I shall hereafter instruct you.",
  "No, but the prosecutor said that if you interpret the last instruction properly, you shall not do so.",

  "What if the dogs get a little more sophisticated in the future and can also smell a certain kind of perfume, something like that? Would then the whole analysis change?",
  "How would you know whether the -- the dog -- I don't think the dog alerts, as I'm alerting, for one reason or another. He just alerts.",
  "I just learned this morning that some very well trained dogs that are trained to alert for explosives will also alert for certain kinds of rubber in a tire. They didn't realize that. And I think it's entirely possible that dogs would -- there will be false alerts by -- by dogs because it's triggered by something that -- that is not really anticipated.",
  "So you would agree the analysis would be different if there could be an innocent cause of the alert as well as the contraband being the cause of the alert.",
  "Well, but you would argue that the same rationale should apply if, instead of using dogs, you had some sophisticated device that would buzz or ring a bell or something whenever the odor of -- of narcotics was present, wouldn't you?",
  "There's nothing magical about the fact that it's an animal rather than a sophisticated device. It has better detection capacity than a human being does. That's the only difference.",
  "Yes, you may save your time.",
  "Mr. Wray.",

  "We will now hear argument in Gonzales, et al. against Raich. General Clement.",
  "Well, General Clement, what if we were to assume -- I'm not saying this is -- that the District Court could find that there is a narrow segment of the market in which they could prevent diversions, and they had -- say they made such findings. Would we have to disregard them, or say they were irrelevant?",
  "But then why do you need to rely on the possibility of diversion?",
  "Yeah, but in my hypothesis, it's a nonexistent reality.",
  "But you're applying it to the opposite kind of regulatory -- you're applying it to a regulatory regime in which the government wants to prohibit this subject -- substance from being sold or - - in interstate commerce. And if you just follow the litter -- letter of this law, this marijuana won't get into interstate commerce. In fact, it would reduce the demand for marijuana, because it would supply these local users and they wouldn't have to go into the interstate market.",
  "But to the extent that this statute has any impact, it will reduce the purchase in the interstate market and confine these to locally grown marijuana.",
  "Then I'm assuming -- my hypothetical is that California could pass a law that would prevent diversions from occurring.",
  "But just - -",
  "Well, I think - -",
  "Doesn't it depend on how you define the \"relevant class of activities\"? Is it the entire class that Congress ought to regulate, or is it a narrower class, in which the Plaintiffs contend that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to a particular very narrowly defined class? And is it ever permissible to define the class narrowly to escape a -- the broad argument that you make?",
  "So you're saying that this statute could never have an unconstitutional application.",
  "In other words, the statute is -- it trumps the independent judgement of the physicians who prescribe it for the patients at issue in this case.",
  "Right.",
  "Do you think there could be any state of facts on which a judicial tribunal could disagree with the finding of Congress that there's no acceptable medical use? Say they had a -- say there was a judicial hearing on which they made a contrary finding. Would we have to ignore that? Would we have to follow the congressional finding or the judicial finding if that happened?",
  "Mr. Barnett.",
  "Could I ask this question. What is your view with respect to the impact of the activities concerned in this case on the interstate market for marijuana? Is it your view that it will have no impact, that it will increase the interstate demand, or decrease the interstate demand? So there are three alternatives. Which is the one we should follow?",
  "No, but if it -- \"trivial impact,\" is it a trivial impact that enhances the price of marijuana or decreases the price of marijuana, in your view?",
  "Well, that would reduce demand and increase price, it seems to me. It's the other way around.",
  "If you reduce demand, you reduce prices? Are you sure?",
  "Oh, you're right. You're right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.",

  "We'll hear argument in Howell against Mississippi. Mr. Mitchell.",
  "May I ask you this question, Mr. Mitchell? Supposing the -- there are alternative lesser-included offenses that might be urged by the defendant as to -- to get an instruction on, and he asks for the wrong one. In other words, the question -- there is a question here about exactly what is the lesser- included offense. It seems to me that if he tried to kill -- if he killed the driver of the vehicle, there may well have been some kind of crime. But maybe you ask for a lesser-included offense of, say, simple murder and the facts don't fit simple murder, but they might fit manslaughter or something else. Would your request for - - for a simple murder, lesser-included offense instruction be sufficient if you should really have asked for a different lesser-included offense instruction?",
  "You may. General Hood.",
  "May I interrupt with a question there, General Cox?",
  "In this case, if the man approached the victim in the car and shot him and killed him, as I understand it, and the theory was an attempted robbery and therefore the -- the capital offense. Now, are you telling me that if they failed to prove there was an attempted robbery, it was not an offense at all?",
  "Then why wasn't he entitled to an instruction on whatever offense it was?",
  "But his theory was if there was a failure of proof on the attempted robbery, that all was left was a -- a killing for some other reason. And if there was a killing -- if there was a failure of proof on attempted robbery, would he not then have been entitled to a -- a lesser offense instruction?",
  "So what your theory is then - -",
  "-- if I understand it correctly, is the proof that there was an attempted robbery is so convincing that no other theory was available.",
  "General Scott, I suggest you try to answer her question.",
  "The question is that's -- one witness is all you had. Would there be a crime against the law of Mississippi and if so, what would it be?",
  "And under your view of the facts, as I understand it, he would have been entitled to a manslaughter instruction.",
  "Well, surely -- surely, if one walks up to a car and shoots the driver dead, that's must be a crime.",
  "And the question is we don't know exactly which of your several statutory provisions it violated, but if it violated one of them, I don't understand. And if he's correct -- maybe he misrepresents the law. He tells us, as a matter of State law, if he asked for the wrong lesser-included instruction, but there is a correct one, the judge has a duty to give the correct instruction. That's what -- what the counsel has told us. And if that's right, I don't understand why he wasn't entitled to some lesser-included offense instruction.",
  "So it's -- it's your view he must ask for the correct lesser-included offense instruction.",
  "But is sudden provocation or heat of passion part of the prosecution's burden or a part of his -- one of the -- is it a matter of defense?",
  "May I ask this question just to help me sort of -- what are the -- as a matter of State law, what are the elements of the offense for which he was convicted?",
  "Those are the two elements. And so that if you take out with -- in the commission of another crime and just left the -- the other part of it, would that also be an offense?",
  "In other words, you say -- you say the offenses are killing somebody with or without the intent to do so - -",
  "-- and in the course of an attempted felony. Say you failed to prove the attempted felony and you proved the remainder of the -- the other elements. Is he guilty of anything in -- under Mississippi - -",
  "And if he is, why isn't it a lesser-included offense is my next question.",
  "It seems to me that then there are two lesser-included offenses, and either one would have -- he should have gotten an instruction on both.",
  "And I don't understand why not.",
  "Well, but -- but it is true that -- that there's a difference between becoming eligible for the death penalty, on the one hand, and not being eligible on the other. And conceivably the Beck concern is triggered when the failure to give a lesser- included offense gives the jury the option of -- no other option other than convicting of a capital offense.",
  "-- an offense for which the death penalty is the punishment.",
  "No, but if the jurors' concern is that you either have to acquit them or -- we want to make sure he never walks out of prison again, and the only way to do that is to convict him of a capital offense so the judge can impose the death penalty. I don't know why that Beck wouldn't be triggered on those facts.",

  "No, but their reading of the statute was that the word discrimination included a retaliation claim. That's the kind of regulations they drafted on the basis of their understanding of what Congress intended by using the word -- the words in this statute.",
  "You cannot use the regulation that goes beyond the meaning of the statute. That's what that holds. But a regulation interpreting what the statute itself provides is in a different ball park. And that's what I understand these regulations to have done, to say what the agencies thought the statute itself meant.",

  "-- as they do --",
  "But why would they state it in the alternative if -- why would they state it in the alternative if the overt act were always required? That's the --",
  "If you look at this statute as a whole, you don't find the overt act requirement in it anywhere, do you?",
  "And the fact that you described it as a long, detailed statute it seems to me cuts against you.",
  "And they were making it unnecessary to rely on the general conspiracy statute in 18-371 or whatever it was.",
  "Yes, but there's nothing in the text of the statute that's ambiguous, is there?",

  "In the text of the statute?",
  "Reading the whole text.",
  "None of which mentions an overt act.",

  "Now, what if there were a 50 percent penalty?",
  "And what is it that makes it a prohibition? Is it -- is it because the purpose is to deter withdrawals, or it is that it becomes economically unacceptable? What -- what is the reason for drawing the line somewhere above 10 percent?",
  "But what is the purpose of imposing any penalty at all?",
  "But 50 percent would not be a prohibition and neither would 90 percent.",
  "So it's a matter of degree rather than a difference in kind.",
  "It seems to me the easiest black letter rule is no tax or some tax. I mean, if it was totally free like an ordinary bank account, then you'd be dead right. But the fact that for a -- an important purpose there is a 10 percent penalty put in seems to me puts it into the category of things that are -- you're not supposed to have an absolute right to get.",
  "The right to receive 100 percent is -- is dependent on a factor, isn't it?",
  "Yes. At least as to the 10 percent that would be penalty, there's no right to get that money unless you have a certain age.",
  "The words, on account of, in this -- this statute are sort of unusual, no matter how you construe them, because really the payment is on account of the years of service or it's on account of a lot of things. You may become eligible at a certain time. It would be better if it said a payment for which you became eligible for one of these reasons because the payment isn't really on account of all of these things.

  "We'll hear argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts. Mr. Nathanson.",
  "But isn't it also important to know, though, whether the defendant has to put on a case or not? So he can't just reserve judgment. I'll tell you after the trial is over whether you should put a case on or not.",
  "Yes. Ms. Neaves.",
  "What if in the case - -",
  "-- we have before us the State allowed an interlocutory appeal on behalf of the prosecution right after the judge's ruling?",
  "Yes.",
  "Conceivably they could allow an interlocutory appeal from a judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution's case.",
  "Yes, but - -",
  "May I ask this?",
  "Is it not true that in this - -",
  "-- in this case the judge did not reconsider until the end of the defense case?",
  "But, during that period, did the defense lawyer have the right to rely on the acquittal in deciding whether or not to put in defensive evidence on the count from which he thought his client had been acquitted?",
  "Of course, if the Double Jeopardy Clause did apply, if it were treated as a true acquittal, he could just say, well, we can forget about that, send your witnesses home, we won't have to worry about it. I understand under your view they could send the witnesses home, and a week -- a week later the judge could say, well, we haven't submitted it to the jury, I've decided to change my mind. You could bring all those witnesses back. That's the way you think it should work.",
  "I understand you correctly to say that if the defendant is acquitted, the remedy is a retrial?",
  "Your position would be the same if the -- if the Massachusetts law provided that the motions at the end of the prosecution's case shall not be ruled on unless -- after they're written briefs filed by both sides and they have 3 days of argument. You'd still have the same position.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Neaves.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "May I ask you the same question I asked your -- your colleague? Supposing we're not in Massachusetts, but we're in another State that provided for an interlocutory appeal immediately after the judge's ruling in this case. Would -- would you have the same appraisal of the case on those facts?",
  "Yes. Would you still say it was not final, even though it was sufficiently final for appellate purposes?",
  "But my question is assuming a State procedure in which the interlocutory appeal was permissible, you -- you would say Double Jeopardy Clause would bar that appeal.",
  "All these cases -- we've had several, not too many over the -- the whole line of cases -- and the trial judge has always committed a rather plain error. And we all have the case where if you just try to decide whether it's a just result, you'd always say no. A case just like this. The judge made a mistake, but we've always said that's not something we -- we look at.",
  "I say as a typical matter these double jeopardy claims arise in cases in which the judge made a rather plain error, and when you look at it later, you say, gee, he goofed. And so I'm not sure we should consider the plainness of the error or the fact that they -- they do mistakes because they do.",
  "The value of finality is what is really at stake here.",
  "But here it was not a matter of minutes.",
  "Here it was - -",
  "Thank you. Mr. Nathanson, you have about 3 minutes left.",
  "Mr. Nathanson, thank you. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll now hear argument in Wilkinson against Dotson. Solicitor Cole.",
  "Yes, but does that mean the - - the judgment -- the order denying release on parole is invalid? There are really two parts to it. One, you - - we're not going to release you. Secondly, your next hearing will be at a later date than you want. Insofar as you challenge the date of the hearing -- the date of the next hearing, does that necessarily imply the invalidity of the entire order denying parole?",
  "But they're not entitled to parole.",
  "So that it doesn't totally invalidate the order that is at issue.",
  "Well, it doesn't entirely come down. It just -- half of it comes down.",
  "But not for release.",
  "But -- but isn't it true that one aspect of your order that's under attack is they had refused to grant them parole?",
  "And that remains.",
  "I thought the only relief they were seeking was a more prompt next hearing.",
  "You may do so. Mr. Lewis.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Lewis.",
  "Mr. Untereiner, is it?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cole, you have about 4 and a half minutes left.",

  "Thank you, Mr. Cole. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke. Mr. Waxman.",
  "May I - -",
  "May I ask on the minimum punishment ploy? Did that ever work in this case or did any of -- of the trial judges ever grant a -- a challenge for cause on the basis of the use of the minimum punishment ploy?",
  "But you -- you haven't really answered my question yet.",
  "Does any -- did any Texas trial judge, to your knowledge, ever fall for this ploy, ever grant him a -- a challenge for cause based on answers to the minimum punishment harangue?",
  "I didn't see any in this case.",
  "Yes, by all means.",
  "Ms. Bunn.",
  "I hate to say this - -",
  "-- to my colleagues, but I'm very much interested in hearing what Ms. Bunn has to say.",
  "May I ask you this? There are two questions just generally. One, I'm curious about the answer to my question to -- to Mr. Waxman. Did the minimum punishment ploy ever work? Did it ever succeed in getting a challenge for cause granted?",
  "But have -- and the challenges were granted?",
  "Of course, none of them were granted in this case. Is that right?",
  "So it -- it was true that this was -- was a ploy adopted for the purpose of trying to make it unnecessary to use a -- a peremptory challenge.",
  "And do you defend that practice?",
  "If you -- if you can get the venire person to make a mistake in his answer, then you - - you get -- get him off easy.",
  "Yes, but you don't know what the questionnaire showed as to most of the white venire persons, do you?",
  "And how many white venire persons were there?",
  "48. And how many were given this questioning? Two?",
  "Yes.",
  "And so are we to assume that all 46 of the other white venire persons were as tough on the death penalty as you'd like everybody to be?",
  "We just don't know about those other 46, do we?",
  "But is it not a reasonable inference that some of them might have expressed doubt about the death penalty?",
  "Is it not a fair inference that each of the cues noted on the cards was something that the prosecutors thought relevant to whether or not to challenge the juror? And if so, is it not -- does -- is that not uncontradicted evidence that the race of the venire person was a factor in the decision?",
  "Well, why else would it be noted?",
  "That may be, but is it not - - is it not clear that this is one of the factors that was used to decide whether or not to exercise a challenge, just as the beard and the other things that are mentioned in the -- in the manual were?",
  "And Batson hadn't been decided yet.",
  "Thank you, Ms. -- Ms. Bunn. Mr. Waxman, you have about 3 minutes left.",

Thank you very much.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Sullivan. Mr. Casey. ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1116 and 03-1120 Mr. Casey: Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: For more than 70 years, the Twenty-First Amendment has permitted states to restrict the importation and delivery of alcohol by out-of-state vendors. There are substantial differences between licensed in-state vendors of alcohol and out-of-state vendors that are not subject to the full extent of state regulatory and taxing powers. Because of those differences, Michigan requires that sales, including direct shipment of alcohol, be performed only by licensed, strictly regulated, in-state vendors. This importation regulation is a power expressly conferred by the text of the Twenty-First Amendment. It's consistent with the entire history of alcohol regulation in this country, and it's consistent with this Court's jurisprudence interpreting the Twenty-First Amendment -­",

I remember Judge Fromm's opinion turned on the credibility of oral testimony, and in one case, Judge Fromm found the -- the judge here made an erroneous ruling on credibility on one issue, if I remember correctly. And it seems to me that's a case in which it would be particularly relevant to know the reasons pro and con on why credibility determinations were made by the person who heard the witnesses.",
  "Has been convinced that he was wrong.",
  "And the question is, well, what was his -- what was the basis for his original position when you're evaluating whether you've got a valid argument to make on appeal?",
  "No, no, no.",
  "Only if he is required by a rule to make certain findings and to deliver a completed report to someone else.",
  "It doesn't forbid it. You're right. It doesn't forbid it in so many words. But I just wonder, does it comport with your normal notions of a fair way to conduct a fair hearing, letting the parties know what the basis for decision was and who thought what about the witnesses and so forth?",
  "I don't think there's any - - any question they can change the report, but the one - - the one -- I'd like to ask you a question as a matter of information. The first sentence of 183(c) refers to the possibility that the judge to whom the case is assigned may direct the filing of additional briefs to receive further evidence and oral argument. Does it ever happen that before the judge to whom it's assigned decides whether or not to go along with the recommended findings, that he will direct oral argument? Does that ever happen?",
  "Because if he did, it would seem almost necessary for him to disclose to the parties what the report they're arguing about would say.",
  "But it certainly seems to contemplate deliberation by the judge to whom the case is assigned about whether or not to accept the report and deliberation which might be informed from input -- input from the parties. That's a fair reading of the rule, I think.",

  "I wonder why the judge gave this instruction then.",

  "But -- but may I just ask a sort of very basic question? One of the instructions reads, a detention may be unreasonable if it -- if it is unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or if it involves an undue invasion of privacy. Now, are you telling us that you think the answer to that question is a question of law that the judge should provide rather than the jury?",
  "Well, it was correct.",
  "All right.",
  "Then it's not a question of law. The answer to whether it was unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or involved undue invasion of privacy, is that a question of law or a question of fact to the jury?",
  "It's a mixed question?",
  "Well, I understand the historical fact, but I'm -- I'm questioning you about the conclusions that you draw from the unreasonableness, degrading, and so forth. Is that partly to be decided by the jury or entirely by the judge?",

  "Why isn't that an answer to the misbranding? You change the product not necessarily the label.",

  "So that the -- the hypothetical of the prisoner waiting 10 years to challenge the State conviction can only arise in a few States. Is that right?",
  "You may. Thank you. Mr. Himmelfarb.",
  "But do you agree with your opponent that most States have their own limitations period that will reduce the number of cases in which there can be inordinate delay?",
  "But he says some of them have doctrines of laches that would kick in.",
  "It -- it does seem to me that the State has a greater interest than the Federal Government does in the finality of its own convictions, and so the State would be the primary guardian of preventing dilatory tactics, it would seem to me.",
  "May -- may I ask you sort of a general background question? As I understand your basic position, if the defendant lets things sit for too long, he loses the right to challenge the State conviction. On the -- and -- and what's -- what's at stake is an enhancement based on the -- on the prior conviction. Is there ever a time when the Federal Government loses the right to use a very old conviction for enhancement purposes?",

  "May I ask sort of a broad question? Am I correct in assuming that this really isn't the most important case we ever heard because it only affects a handful of enhancements that don't really affect the basic conviction or sentence; and secondly, that it's clear that the -- from both the text of the statute and whatever we know about the legislative history, that it's a problem Congress never even thought about?",

I don't know if it's really a legal question exactly, but I have the impression that most of the plaintiffs in this type of litigation are well-financed, large companies rather than the typical 1983 plaintiff. And therefore, you don't need the attorney's fee incentive to be sure these rights are protected. Is that a correct impression or is it incorrect?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Waxman.",
  "Mr. Lamken, you have about 4 minutes left.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Lamken. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll now hear argument in Clingman against Beaver. Mr. Poe, as soon as you're ready, we'll hear from you.",
  "Mr. Poe, may I just focus in on exactly what the injury is? Is the injury that they vote with the Libertarians or that they don't vote with their own party?",
  "But wouldn't it be precisely the same injury if they just didn't like the Republican candidate in that particular election, decided to stay home?",
  "How -- how are they hurt by the fact that rather than staying home, they decide to cast a vote for a minority party candidate?",
  "Well, it's very unlikely if it's a party that is -- gets the small vote that this party gets. But you -- no matter how small the vote is, you still find the injury to the major parties because they voted for the Libertarians or because they didn't vote at all?",
  "Is there any evidence on the question whether the -- the support for the major party candidate is any smaller than it would have been if there had been no Libertarian Party at all?",
  "That's fine. Mr. Schaerr.",
  "And that's not permitted in Oklahoma, is it? That kind of behavior is not permitted in Oklahoma.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, neither of the major parties has done that in Oklahoma, has it?",
  "But the question is whether when a minor party like the Libertarians do it, is -- is it going to have that effect.",
  "But the cost of that deal would -- they'd also run the risk the Democrats would -­ would migrate also if they made that deal.",
  "I apologize for taking your time with a question, but I'm afraid your time is up.",
  "Yes. Mr. Linger.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Linger. Mr. Poe, you have about 3 minutes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Poe. The case is submitted.",
  "We will now hear argument in Orff against the United States. Mr. Smiland.",
  "Mr. Smiland, can I ask this question? If Justice Breyer is -- the thrust of his question is right, I -- I think the district itself could not have brought the suit under his reading of the sovereign immunity. And I'm just wondering, has the United States ever taken the position that the district could not have initiated this litigation?",
  "But yes, isn't it arguable, though, that in this case the Government probably thought that it would be efficient to have the district represent all the farmers for whatever their -- to the extent their interests were shared with one another, rather than having every individual have the same right to bring -- bring a lawsuit?",
  "Except for the fact that the district is the party to the contract, though.",
  "You may, indeed, Mr. Smiland. Mr. Minear, I think you're up next.",
  "Mr. Minear, do you think it does waive sovereign immunity for suits brought by the district?",
  "Did this suit begin as a suit by a water user against the district and then you were joined later? Is that --",
  "Well, in this suit, did not the district bring it against the United States?",
  "And was that a -- was that jurisdiction proper at that time?",
  "But was it properly brought is what I'm asking you.",
  "Okay.",
  "Yes, but if contractual rights include a right to be paid for something, why wouldn't you get a money judgment in a case like that? That first sentence certainly covers the possibility of a contractual right to be paid something.",
  "That's pretty clear language.",
  "Certainly if it were not a -­ a United States and were a private individual, it would include money damages.",
  "And -- and the next sentence, as Justice Scalia points out, says the United States shall be treated just like a private party.",
  "Well, I think you've got a very strong argument when you talk about an incidental third party beneficiary not being a contracting party, but now you're asking for a much broader holding than really necessary to dispose of this case, it seems to me.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Minear. Mr. Somach, will you tell us what the district's views on this whole matter are?",
  "I don't really understand why that's any greater burden than the fact they can sue you in State court anyway. They -- they can always bring litigation.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Somach. Mr. Smiland, you have 9 minutes remaining, but you do not have to use it all.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Smiland. The case is taken under advisement.",
  "We will now hear argument in Exxon Mobil against Saudi Basic Industries. Mr. Coleman, I trust you will soon tell us why the case is not moot or whether you think it's moot, and if -- if not, why not.",
  "What relief could it give you?",
  "What relief? If you're paid in full, what -- what relief are you entitled to?",
  "But what issues would -- would the district court resolve?",
  "Mr. Coleman, can I interrupt with a question?",
  "Is it your position that what should have been done in this case, not in the hypothetical case, is the trial court should have just stayed the action pending the outcome of the Delaware case?",
  "And that's what -- he did -­ that was correct.",
  "And then when the Delaware case was over, then what should he have done?",
  "And -- and he has given you all the relief your entitled to. Therefore, you go ahead and dismiss the case.",
  "And therefore, my next question is why shouldn't we do exactly that now.",
  "Well, maybe we could vacate the judgment of the court of appeals, say that was wrong, but still, order it dismissed after we vacate the judgment.",
  "But if you don't tell us what issue remains, I don't know why we shouldn't just direct the suit to be dismissed.",
  "You may do so. Mr. Castanias. I hope you'll tell us also whether you think the case is moot before you're through.",
  "Of course, that's the language that was used in both Rooker and Feldman too I think.",
  "And that's the only fact pattern any of our cases have dealt with.",
  "May I ask you? It's perhaps an unfair question. The Chief Justice generally likes to confine our attention to cases of this Court rather than the courts of appeals for our primary guidance, and most of the Rooker-Feldman law is court of appeals law, as we -- we both know. Going back just to Rooker and to Feldman, those two cases, and putting aside ASARCO for a minute, which of those two cases do you think provides you the stronger support, if indeed any support, between Rooker and Feldman?",
  "And that is the case in which the court of appeals was itself a party to the litigation.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Castanias. Mr. Coleman, you have 8 and a half minutes left.",
  "Mr. Coleman, I don't mean to take your time, but in the ASARCO case, was the State court judgment final at the time in dispute?",
  "Because if the judgment were final, then that would fit right into your -- your analysis, if the judgment of the State court were final.",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Coleman. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll now hear argument in Spector against the Norwegian Cruise Line. Mr. Goldstein.",
  "Yes, but I -- if I understand you correctly, your case really isn't limited to cruise ships. It's limited to ships that come into -- passenger ships, which would include the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, all the rest of them. Wouldn't it?",
  "And the fact that it's based in Miami or it had mostly American customers really is not relevant to the legal issue. Is it?",
  "But, of course, they would have been aware of those that are also less American in their patronage and so forth.",
  "No, but we're not necessarily thinking of a cruise ship, just the transatlantic liner that goes from Liverpool to Miami or something. That would be covered.",
  "But, Mr. Goldstein, there's another aspect that troubles me. Your view, as I understand, only applies while the ship is in American waters so that if, for example, you complain about the training for a safety drill, if they conducted those after they'd gone out 20 miles to sea, there would be -- there would be no violation of the -- the statue. Would there?",
  "In other words, I'm trying to understand. You don't know what your position is - -",
  "-- with respect to what would otherwise be violations of the statute that occur on the high seas.",
  "Yes, but I think we should - - the cruise ships are entitled to know whether they may freely discriminate against people in the casinos and so forth when they're on the high seas.",
  "You don't know the answer to that.",
  "So your view is not limited to what happens in the territorial waters.",
  "Mr. Salmons, may I ask before you begin whether the United States agrees that the statute would apply to the activities of these ships when they're on the high seas?",
  "Well, then if you --",
  "But if you're on a round trip ticket from Liverpool to Miami and back, it would depend on where you bought the ticket.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Salmons. Mr. Frederick.",
  "Mr. Frederick, that brings up a question I've been meaning to ask you. To what extent was this whole problem of the application of this statute to the foreign vessels discussed in the legislative history of these statutes?",
  "Mr. -- may I ask this question to you? What about a -- an American-flagged ship? Does the statute apply or not?",
  "What is your view?",
  "What is your view? Not what arguments can be made. What is your view?",
  "It does not apply.",
  "So really, we're not concerned with the fact this is a foreign-flagged ship. You're concerned with the fact it's a ship.",
  "But doesn't it -- on the other -- on the other side of the coin, apart from the structural problem -- and I understand the arguments on both sides there. With respect to things like safety drills and access to gambling tables and all that, it seems to me that your answer to that would be, well, we'll just do that once we're on the high seas so there's no conflict with the statute when we're out there.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Garre.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Goldstein, you have about 40 seconds.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Goldstein. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument in Pace against the -- the warden. Mr. Wycoff.",
  "You may.",
  "Mr. Eisenberg.",
  "May I ask how you would handle a case that is a successive petition, a late -- a recently found claim, and the -- filed beyond the statute of limitations but the State has three exceptions to the statute, but it does not require that the -- the petitioner identify the exception in the petition? It just allows it for the judge to decide. Would there be tolling during the period in which the judge decided whether or not the petition was timely in your view?",
  "And even if it takes a year or so to make that decision, you'd say no tolling.",
  "And in all of those questions, you'd say there would be no tolling in order to find out whether it was timely or not.",
  "But what about the reasoning in Artuz that the application was -- if it turns out later it was timely, it would have been properly filed?",
  "No, but if I understand you correctly, you're saying that even if it takes the judge 6 months to decide whether it was timely, if he ends up with the conclusion that it was not timely, there would be no tolling for that 6-month period.",
  "Just as a matter of curiosity, is the transcript of the plea colloquy still available?",
  "And was there the constitutional violation he alleges?",
  "The irony of this whole proceeding is it seems to me it would be a lot easier to decide the merits of that claim if the transcript is available than to get into all these issues - -",
  "-- we have today.",
  "Of course, he's a 17-year-old without any learning in the law. He probably didn't realize there's any requirement that these things have to appear in the transcript. I mean, that's understandable.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Eisenberg.",
  "Mr. Wycoff, you have about 4 minutes left.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Wycoff. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument in Deck against the State of Missouri. Ms. Percival.",
  "Are you aware of any cases in which prosecutors have objected to shackling?",
  "So Justice Scalia would have, I suppose, but he's unusual as a prosecutor I think.",
  "Yes, you may, Ms. Percival. Ms. Nield.",
  "Yes, but your position would be precisely the same if the record made it perfectly clear that the jury could see everything, I think.",
  "Yes.",
  "So this is an alternative argument that you're making.",
  "Is the fact of conviction critical for your point of view because it doesn't really matter if there's prejudice or that because there's no -­ no danger of prejudice?",
  "Well, do you concede that even though he had been convicted, it would, nevertheless, be prejudicial in the eyes of the jury to see a man shackled when one of the issues they'll have to decide is whether his future dangerousness might -- might justify his execution? Do you think there is prejudice there, or do you share Justice Scalia's view that it would be a good thing for the defendant?",
  "And if it depends, why would it not be appropriate to have a rule that the trial judge should be required to explain the basis for his decision?",
  "Yes, but would you not agree that it's always of relevance to a jury in deciding whether the -- the man should be executed, is how dangerous is this guy?",
  "It seems to me your argument is much like arguing on the merits of the -- at the original trial that his defense was alibi or something like that, therefore you don't have to worry about the prejudice that arises from the restraints.",
  "Yes, but the bottom line from the other point of view is that shackles are always prejudicial, and you try to have the scales evenly balanced when you're deciding whether the man should die or not.",
  "And what were the facts of the aiding escape? Was he trying to get away or was he helping somebody?",
  "Which really has very little probative value on this issue. I mean, the fact that he tried to saw his way out of a cell hardly speaks to the risk of fleeing from the courtroom while the proceedings are going on.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Nield. Ms. Percival, you have about 4 and a half minutes left.",
  "May I ask one quick question?",
  "Does the record tell us how big he was?",
  "Okay. The case is submitted. (Whereupon, at 1:56 p.m., the case in the above­",
  "We will now hear argument in two different cases: Exxon Mobil against Allapattah and Ortega against Star-Kist Foods. Mr. Phillips.",
  "But why can't it make an adjustment in this case, Mr. Phillips.",
  "Why can't it make an adjustment in this case?",
  "But why is that the minimum? Wouldn't the minimum be just to dismiss those parties who don't have the aggregate -- the necessary jurisdictional amount?",
  "Well, but you do have cases where a complaint is filed seeking to be a class action and then the district judge does not certify the class and the case, nevertheless, goes forward. Now, why couldn't you do that here?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, maybe. Why isn't it permissible just to dismiss those parties who don't have the requisite jurisdictional amount? That's what I -­ where I stumble with this.",
  "Mr. Long. Mr. Long, you represent the respondent in the second case. Is that right?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Long. Mr. Stearns, we'll hear from you.",
  "I thought the --",
  "-- I thought the committee report said we do not intend to overrule Zahn.",
  "Did not the House committee report say we do not intend to overrule Zahn?",
  "Did it? Am I correct or incorrect?",
  "Am I correct or -­",
  "Right, and that was also the same report that was filed in the Senate proceedings as well.",
  "Right.",
  "I think -- I think you're overstating what they say in the article.",
  "Are you sure he said that?",
  "Where did he say that?",
  "In a footnote to what?",
  "That's in an opinion written after the statute was adopted. Right?",
  "That's not a direct quote of the House report, I might find out.",
  "I say that's not a direct quote of the House report.",
  "Do you think they were being intellectually honest in their Law Review or do you think -- accuse them of something other than honesty in what they said?",
  "But do you agree that if they're right on the interpretation of 1367, the judgment has to be reversed?",
  "Let me modify the question. Do you agree that if they're correct, the entire action has to be dismissed?",
  "Your answer is no, I gather.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stearns. Mr. Ayer, we'll hear from you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Ayer. Mr. Phillips, you have another 4 minutes, and I see that will be adjournment time, I will let everyone else know.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. This -- these cases are submitted.",
  "We'll now hear argument in Van Orden against Perry. Mr. Chemerinsky.",
  "May I ask you this question. Supposing -- I recently read a case from the Seventh Circuit on what they did in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. And as we all know, this organization has donated Ten Commandments monuments all over the country. And what they did there is they sold the parcel back to the Eagles, their name, and put up a sign which read, this property is not owned or maintained by the City of Lacrosse, nor does the city Now, my question to you is, if there were a similar disclaimer on this monument, would that be an adequate remedy, in your view?",
  "But if the test is whether the reasonable observer would think that the government is endorsing the religious message, wouldn't the disclaimer make it clear to the reasonable observer the government was not endorsing the message?",
  "Yes, you may save your time.",
  "General Abbott, we'll hear for you, please.",
  "May I ask you this question? Under your analysis of the reason this is justifiable, would it equally be permissible to have a crucifix of the same size in the same location on the Capitol grounds?",
  "That's not my question. Do you think it would be permissible -- it seems to me your reasoning that you've given us would support I'm wondering what your view is.",
  "But do we know which version of the Ten Commandments it stands for? There are three different versions at least.",
  "General Abbott, would had on it the kind of disclaimer that the city in Wisconsin put on its monument?",
  "It reads this way. What they did is they sold the parcel of land that had the Eagles' donation on it back to the Eagles and then they put a fence around it and then they put this sign up, \"This property is not owned or maintained by the City of Lacrosse, nor does the City endorse the religious expression thereon.\" Maybe as long as it's still on the property, it couldn't be the same. But suppose you had a comparable disclaimer. Would that defeat any of the purposes on which you relied to justify having the statue there?",
  "And would it undermine the message that you legitimately seek to convey?",
  "General Abbott, I want to thank you for your argument and also for demonstrating that it's not necessary to stand at the lectern in order to a fine job. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Clement.",
  "Mr. Clement, can I ask you to address one thing that troubles me about the case? As I understand it, it's the Protestant version basically of the Ten Commandments we have before us, which has significant differences from the Catholic version and And I understand it was the result of consultation and so forth. But I noticed in your brief, you list the States in which the Ten Commandments displays are listed, there is none for Rhode Island, which I often think of as primarily a Catholic state, and the only one from Massachusetts is a frieze on the north wall of the public library which apparently didn't have the text of the commandments in it. Is there any significance to the fact that this kind of display may be more popular in areas of the country where the Protestant religion is dominant as opposed to other versions of Christian religions?",
  "Of course, the other thing that was notable about your listing is most of the examples are examples of displays of the event itself rather than the text. And there is an argument made I think by Professor Laycock that when you display the entire text, it's kind of a different sort of symbol than when you just have a symbolic presentation.",
  "You think just a symbolic display is less objectionable than quoting the text as this monument does?",
  "Well, except the four Commandments and Moses would avoid the differences between the three different versions of the Ten Commandments, whereas when you quote one, you must",
  "Most of them don't.",
  "What would your comment be on requiring a disclaimer of some kind?",
  "It is kind of ambiguous.",
  "Mr. Chemerinsky, you have four minutes left.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky. The case is submitted. (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the",
  "And we will now hear argument in McCreary County against the ACLU. Mr. Staver?",
  "You're not abandoning the position that you have a right to make this kind of religious display, are you?",
  "Okay.",
  "But is there -- I guess -- I don't want to tie you up too long but I mean given the history, isn't it still the case that there is no serious reason to believe that there is any object here other than the display of the Ten Commandments including the overtly theistic text and the rest of this is basically enabling context which does not affect the objective, the objective being the Ten Commandments and the religious text?",
  "Well, not forever but for now. This isn't a case in which they came up with the Ten Commandments display, it got enjoined and 10 years later somebody comes along and says, let's have a display of important documents in the history of law. This in fact is a continuous process and it is a continuous process within the context of litigation about the constitutionality of the display. It's not a -- the implication is not that you can never have a different display but that there is no reason to believe that the intent of this display has changed as the context has changed. What is your response to that?",
  "So just that first display, what was the purpose of that first one?",
  "The original one?",
  "Was there anything there that said we're interested in history and what we're not interested in is having this on the wall as -- to encourage people to study the Bible and to encourage them to study religion and to understand that in their lives, religion should be important and this very solemn secular setting. Nonetheless, religion is important. Is there anything like that on the document itself?",
  "Justice Souter, it would in fact be somewhat comparable because if you're teaching general biblical text, you wouldn't have all the versions lined out.",
  "Yes, you may do so. Mr. Clement, you're welcome to stand up for a second time.",
  "Basically, and I think I understand you, you're saying, and I think you said it earlier, drop the intent clause and basically have a -- try to move toward an objective criterion saying there are some ways you can display religious things and some ways perhaps that you can't and try to develop that kind of objective jurisprudence as distinct from an intent jurisprudence. That's your point, isn't it?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Friedman?",
  "Does that mean forever? What I'm thinking -- let me spell it out. The key words in Stone would be that this was posted, the Ten Commandments, because it would lead to, in the circumstances, the students remeditate, venerate, perhaps, and obey. In other words, their reaction to it would likely be a religious reaction. Now, here if you saw it just by itself, perhaps one would be concerned with the intent or the effect of calling to the viewer's mind the sacred character of the law, which is fine for religious people to do but not necessarily fine for the State to do; and that leads them to venerate, perhaps to meditate, perhaps to consider the relationship in a religious way. If that's the problem, that would exist here only because of the history or most likely because of the history. And if that is the problem, that would dissipate over time because it is the smallness of the audience and their familiarity with the history that would likely produce the similar religious reaction to the display. Now, what's your reaction?",
  "Is all of that in the record?",
  "Then I don't think we should talk about it.",
  "Mr. Friedman, can you tell me where in the joint appendix the resolution appears?",
  "It's not printed?",
  "The other question I have is assuming you didn't have any of this history and they started off with plan 3, would that have violated the establishment clause?",
  "I don't understand the difference. I mean it seems to me it would violate the establishment clause, it would equally do so if you said it's a major part of or even a part of. Now, maybe it makes it wrong to say it's the exclusive one. It may make it more wrong but we're not grading papers here. It seems to me that whether it violates the establishment clause depends upon whether you're endorsing -- whether you're proselytizing religion.",
  "What does primacy have to do with it?",
  "But your real position is they wouldn't have to have done that as long as they had the Ten Commandments in the display, that would be enough?",
  "Exactly what we've got in Exhibit 3 or whatever it is, that we don't have the statement of purposes, we don't have them saying it's the sole source of the primacy. They say it's a source. Does that still violate the establishment clause?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Friedman. Mr. Staver, you have about three minutes left.",
  "But is it correct that it was not amended when the third display was created?",
  "It is the last expression of the governing body's intent?",
  "Thank you. The case is submitted. CLERK OF Court: The honorable Court is",
  "But, Mr. Clement, it seems to me the Spending Clause aspect cuts in the other direction, if we're just focusing on the Establishment Clause. The fact that Federal money is involved, why does that make your burden any less in defending the -- the statute under the Establishment Clause?",
  "Do you -- do you think the Establishment Clause issue in this case would be the same as the Establishment Clause issue in City of Boerne if we -- if the Court had reached the Establishment Clause issue in that case?",
  "May I ask this question, Mr. Cole? I am troubled also, as you point out, about the least restrictive language in the statute. But as I try and apply it to this particular case, weren't most of the allegations that the petitioners made is that they were treated differently from other mainstream religions and that the accommodation would have been, well, treat them the same, which would have been the least restrictive alternative? It wouldn't have created all the problems you describe. And they say they don't -- can't have group meetings. They -- if they were treated exactly the same, would that -- that would satisfy the least restrictive alternative part of the statute, wouldn't it? And why would that be such a burden?",
  "Don't mainstream religion adherents have certain objects they'd like to keep in their cell?",
  "The mainstream person, if there's a potential for harm, they wouldn't let them keep it in the -- in the cell, would they?",
  "And in other words, is it really -- although the language in the statute seems to go farther, is there anything really at stake here beyond saying treat us the same as you treat mainstream -­ members of mainstream religions?",
  "And what is the best example of that?",
  "It would seem to me that would be a compelling interest to say you can't do that.",
  "Mr. Eastman, would you comment on the extent of deference that we should give to the court of appeals' interpretation of Colorado while in view of what we said in Bishop against Wood?",
  "But the Colorado statute is the one that's controlling in this case and normally, at least according to Bishop against Wood, we defer to the interpretation of the court of appeals as the issue of state law.",
  "Of course, that's the issue, whether Colorado intended to create it.",
  "The reading in Bishop against Wood was really counterintuitive also, as the dissenters pointed out, as you would agree, I think.",
  "Well, isn't that what we squarely held in Bishop?",
  "Then your answer is no, we would not have jurisdiction in that event.",
  "We could say that they had misconstrued Colorado law? I don't think you really mean that.",
  "But I think you might -­",
  "You can do that, but you won't find any cases making that point.",
  "But you have cases saying the contrary. That's the problem.",
  "Do the police have any duty at all, in your view?",
  "Could the police just issue an order saying ignore all orders of this kind?",
  "Do you agree that if this case stands with the state system, we would have to accept their holding on the property right issue?",
  "No, let's -- I'm assuming the Supreme Court has said, this is what the statute means and so forth and so on, wouldn't that be binding on this?",
  "Or whether the question of property right -- the property right issue is not a question of federal law, it is a question of state law.",
  "But is it not true that the Colorado legislature could create such a right if it did it with sufficient specificity?",
  "Wouldn't the better analogy be to assume she made a contract with a private detective agency to protect her from these events. And if something arises, to go get the police and act on it? That would be a property right if she had a private contract with a private detective agency to do exactly what the police were supposed to do here.",
  "But it seems to me a contract for protection would be a familiar kind of property, is what I'm suggesting.",
  "If I understand your position correctly, I know what the allegations are here, but if the evidence should show later on that in response to one of these telephone calls, the desk sergeant said, send a squad car out and see if you can locate the kids, you would lose?",
  "Because that would have been a good faith response by somebody to try and find out whether there was probable cause.",
  "May I ask you whether you would favor or disfavor our certifying the question whether there is a property right here to the Colorado Supreme Court?",
  "May I ask you the same question I asked your opponent? Would you favor or disfavor our certifying the property law issue to the Colorado Supreme Court?",
  "May I ask this -- may I ask this question? Supposing the only thing he did was to carry a sign that said Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief, and the trial judge finds that is false, and he's carrying it in a sign, could the trial judge enjoin him from carrying that sign in front of Johnnie Cochran's office?",
  "What's the best authority you have for that proposition?",
  "But what is your authority for that proposition?",
  "Have we ever set aside an injunction that did that?",
  "Have we done it either way?",
  "But nothing in the injunction refers to prior conduct.",
  "The injunction just speaks for itself. It doesn't say what -- doing what you used to do or anything like that.",
  "You cannot picket Cochran or Cochran's law firm. Period.",
  "Well, maybe there are different grades of specificity. Maybe it doesn't meet precisely the same words, but I think there are other ways to draft it that say no picketing. Period.",
  "All I'm suggesting is just draft it -- just excising (ii) and (iii) from paragraph 2 would not necessarily solve the problem completely. Because subparagraph (i) says picketing Cochran or Cochran's law firm, which is a pretty broad prohibition.",
  "You're sort of saying the opposite of what your opponent said. If we take it away, has it ever been there?",
  "What are we taking away?",
  "May I ask this question? The words, made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, don't have a modifier such as telling us by whom it's made retroactive. Has any court considered what seems to me a fairly normal reading that the -- the words, by the Supreme Court, should apply to that phrase as well as the preceding language?",
  "It seems to me that cuts in the other direction, that when Congress thought about the entity that makes it retroactive, they thought about us. And that's why -- and that's the only language that seems to fit. I mean, the by the Supreme Court seems to fit that concept.",
  "But I guess nobody has come up with this suggestion other than this question.",
  "But that fits the language, the date on which the right was initially recognized by the Supreme Court if and only if it's been made retroactively by the Supreme Court. It seems to me a very normal reading of the language. But nobody else agrees with it.",
  "It is noticeably missing because it -- it has a blank there and the words, by the Supreme Court, are the only time limitation in that whole provision after the word if.",
  "Yes, it could because you could say what the Congress intended to say. If the right had X, Y, and Z, it shall in that event run from that date.",
  "That's implicit in it.",
  "Just like the words, by the Supreme Court --",
  "-- would be implicit.",
  "Is there anything in any of these statutes or legislative history or any -- anyplace else where Congress ever thought of the possibility that some other court might make a new rule retroactive?",
  "I think the other reading is -- the assumption was -- and I think it's incorrect -­ that we would simultaneously identify the new right and decide it is or is not retroactive. That was the assumption I think.",
  "No. I realize it's wrong, but I think that's probably the assumption Congress made. That's what I'm suggesting.",
  "See, the only thing about your reading of the statute that troubles me is you're -- you're reading the word only. If it's a 1-year statute, but only if Congress -- the Supreme Court has already done the next two things. 1 year is the maximum.",
  "There's an only -­",
  "It's not an if, but if that happens, then it shall be -­",
  "See, it really -­",
  "-- would accomplish your objective if you just struck the whole clause after the word if. You don't really need that.",
  "May I ask you -­",
  "May I ask you this question? Isn't it true that under some of the other references they refer to a constitutional right?",
  "Whereas this just refers to a right and it includes statutory rights. And, of course, the odd thing about that is that normally when we construe a statute, we say it always meant that. It's not -- it's not a new right in the sense as a right as of the date of enactment.",
  "So the difference between the Constitution and statutes sometimes is rather significant.",
  "May I interrupt? Because I'm just not following one part of your argument. Are you saying that the Pennsylvania analysis, the ad hoc analysis, was not made in the State court?",
  "Why -- now, why should that not be binding on you if your allegations were, in fact, insufficient under Penn Central?",
  "Well, I can understand how you should be free to argue that in fact the two rules are not congruent, that there's broader recovery under the Federal system. But if we decided that the two -- if we agreed with them that they were congruent, then why should not issue preclusion apply?",
  "Yes, but -- but it's just a conclusion from issues that have -- have been resolved on which normally we would defer to the State court. Now, why -- why shouldn't we defer here again?",
  "Right.",
  "That doesn't make sense.",
  "Mr. Waxman, can I ask you this question? Supposing the California court had decided the Federal -- the Federal Fifth Amendment question or in the -- the England case supposing the Louisiana State court had decided the Fourteenth Amendment question, would there be issue preclusion on that issue in -- in that -- in that sequence?",
  "Either one.",
  "Yes, but is it not true that it's entirely possible that the Texas proceeding would make this issue moot -­",
  "-- and, therefore, avoid the necessity for deciding a lot of very difficult questions?",
  "But, Mr. Cruz, let me just make a suggestion. Assume you lose -- I'm not suggesting you will, but assume you do -- the net result of the proceeding, in your adversary's favor, would be that they would get a hearing in the state court, which is what -- the President's order says, \"Let them have that right away.\" So the whole purpose of having a lot of federal litigation to decide what you can address right away by honoring the President's request, at least litigating it in the state court right away, we may be engaged in a lot of useless activity.",
  "Well, so could the President's order, the same thing.",
  "May I just interrupt for the one -- you said \"the only significant use.\" There's a footnote in the red brief that says the figure is some 2.6 billion legitimate uses.",
  "Is that correct, or incorrect?",
  "Now, was there a finding of 90 percent?",
  "It goes to the - -",
  "-- accuracy of your statement that there is no other significant legitimate use.",
  "Mr. Taranto - -",
  "-- can I ask -- I'm still a little puzzled about the posture of the case.",
  "Because I read the District Court opinion. I think he said -- the judge said that both parties agreed that there were no disputed issues of fact that would preclude the entry of summary judgment in either way, no disputed issues relative to whether to grant relief. And I -- it's on page 24a of the cert petition. And I understand you to be saying that leaving everything alone, affirming would allow the case to go forward with your adversaries seeking damages on an active-inducement theory. Am I correct?",
  "But it says, \"Both parties believe there are no disputed issues of fact material to Defendant's liability.\"",
  "So then your answer to my question is that, yes, if we affirm, as a possibility, they could continue to seek damages on an active- inducement theory.",
  "And then one other - -",
  "-- question I had. Does the record contain their proposed form of injunction that they requested?",
  "What if he were moved from level 1 to level 5?",
  "But why isn't the comparison the entire prison population rather than just 5 versus 4?",
  "Well, is it -- is it your view that we should consider it the normal practice in the Ohio system to keep people in solitary for 23 hours a day?",
  "Well, then isn't that the standard of reference that we should use?",
  "So we're -- we're dealing with a small number of inmates out of a very large population, but isn't the frame of reference for telling whether it's a liberty interest a comparison to the large population?",
  "May I ask this --",
  "May I -­",
  "May I ask you this question?",
  "I'm just -- is the procedure you're describing the procedure that was reviewed by the district court?",
  "So the evidence in the record before the district court describes exactly what you're describing.",
  "And the form -- and the form is in the record, I take it.",
  "Where?",
  "Ms. Maynard, before you start, maybe you could answer the question I tried to ask at the end of his argument. Where in the record is the report?",
  "May I ask this question, Mr. Lobel? Putting aside for a second which policy we look at and so forth, were there findings that particular inmates were improperly sent to this facility?",
  "All right, and was there any -- any order saying that inmate should get out and go to a different facility?",
  "And so the State then came back and said we're putting in this new policy, we will give them new hearings under the new policy?",
  "So that even though -- if I understand it correctly, even though there had findings that some inmates have been improperly -- had had inadequate procedure as a predicate to going into the new facility, they can just stay there until the litigation is over.",
  "Mr. - -",
  "But the way you stated the rule, if I heard you correctly, you're contending that Merrell Dow was incorrectly decided.",
  "And yes, but one of the things, it seems to me, you're all overlooking is that if it's as obvious as they're all blind, those would be challenges for cause.",
  "We're talking about challenges where there are no -- no obvious basis for it.",
  "I must confess I'm a little puzzled about the discussion of the trial strategy because is it not correct that whenever the judge thinks step one has been met, the prosecutor always answers the question?",
  "Well -- well, whatever it is, he -- generally they are not silent when the judge says I think step one has been met. I want to be sure understand California's position on one point. Is it your view in -- in California that the judge must decide himself that it is more likely than not that -- that discrimination is present before you proceed to step two?",
  "Now, that is not the test in an ordinary tort case in California, is it?",
  "In an ordinary tort case - -",
  "-- if the judge, at the end of the plaintiff's case, says I'm not sure what the answer is, but there is enough evidence here to submit to the jury, so I'm going to overrule the motion for judgment - - judgment at the end of the case. Now, that's a different test than you say is appropriate under Batson, is it not?",
  "So you -- so you have two - - in California you have two definitions of a prima facie case, one for Batson and one for all normal tort litigation.",
  "And is it not true that the definition that your opponent asks for is the same definition that would apply in tort litigation in California and in most States of the country?",
  "So you're asking for a special rule for California's application of Batson.",
  "Yes, but it would be the same rule if it was a bench trial. The judge could say to him -- say, I think you may have enough but I'm not 100 percent sure yet. I'd like to hear the defense -- hear the rest of the case. He doesn't -- it does not really - - the -- the definition of a prima facie case does not depend on whether it's a jury trial or a bench trial.",
  "Of course, in avoiding that chill, you're in effect saying the prosecutor is entitled to one or two free discriminatory challenges.",
  "Mr. Chan, can I ask you a question, based on your experience? I'm sure you've had a lot of experience in this area. This particular claim was about six months beyond the statute of limitations when he asked to relate back. It would seem to me that that would normally be the case, something about that amount of time would be an issue, because it takes time to process these, and they had to get counsel appointed. And counsel comes in and wants to amend the petition, usually, I suppose, in a pro se petition. Is it -- would I be correct in assuming that normally in cases of this kind we're talking about a delay of only a few months?",
  "Well, no, normally -- the issue of whether or not there should be -- the petition may have the benefit of the relation back normally is - - involves a delay of not more than, say, five or six months, in a normal case.",
  "You still lose the benefit of the statute. You lose an important right. But I'm just wondering about how serious a problem it is.",
  "It seems to me that the reason for the -- for defining the relation back the way the rule does is interest in fairness to the Defendant you don't want to let him be surprised; whereas, your claim, as I understand, is really based entirely on the interest in finality and repose.",
  "No, but the definition - -",
  "-- in the rule is really to protect the interest in fairness, because interest in repose is always the same.",
  "Well, the interest in repose is always there. You'd always like to preserve the defense, whenever you can. That's really what's at stake here.",
  "Even if they all come in just two or three months after the statute's run.",
  "It's really not a big deal.",
  "The injury - -",
  "-- I suppose, in the -- in the Miranda violation, is introducing the evidence at the time of trial.",
  "That's the point. You don't look two and a half years back just to -- you decide what happened at the trial.",
  "But, General Cole, isn't there a distinction between eligibility for the death penalty and actually making the decision to impose the death penalty? And it's perfectly clear -- you're dead right, of course. He's eligible under either theory. But is it not likely that the sentencer would be more likely to sentence the defendant to death if the sentencer thought he had been the actual shooter?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, and the original sentencer might -- might not have done the same thing. We don't really know that.",
  "Yes, but the State's position was that the jailhouse informant had told the truth, wasn't it?",
  "At the trial.",
  "He at least put in the evidence.",
  "Normally you don't put in evidence unless you think it will support a proposition that you -- that you're in favor of.",
  "The jury simply decided they didn't want to sentence two people to death for the same offense.",
  "In fact, that paragraph refers to effectiveness, as I read it.",
  "They used the word \"effectiveness,\" which is pretty close.",
  "Well, I -- I don't mean to interrupt, but it is true that this is a civil action that's brought under 3730(h), is it not?",
  "So it is literally within the plain language of the statute.",
  "That's true, but is it also not true that some of the people who get retaliated against may be the same people who bring the qui tam action?",
  "So if they don't get the - - recover as being the victim of retaliation, they may still get a very handsome reward for what happened to them.",
  "May I ask -- may I ask you a question about the alternative? If we don't follow this statute, you -- you refer to State law for the correct cause -- statute of limitations I guess.",
  "And I imagine because there are different forms of retaliation -- sometimes it's a discharge, sometimes it might be slander by defaming the person for his next employer, it might be a tort, they beat him up or something, there could be a lot of different kinds of retaliation -- each of which would give rise to a different statute of limitations under State law. Does that seem reasonable?",
  "We had to make up a rule to fill a gap.",
  "But what about Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and -- and Florida? Maybe they all have different statutes and they have different kinds of causes of action that may be relevant in the retaliation case.",
  "No, but in our construction of the statute, we have to think about its application throughout the United States, not just in North -- North Carolina.",
  "Well, it seems to me that if -- if there's no violation, then there's no triggering event to start the statute of limitations running.",
  "May I just understand one point that Justice Scalia's question raises for me? In your view, is the provision of counsel for the indigent for appellate purposes purely a matter of grace, or was there some underlying obligation to provide counsel?",
  "Do you agree with your opponent that for AEDPA purposes, they treat the intermediate decision as a decision on the merits?",
  "So your opponent has misrepresented Michigan law.",
  "But he says there are dozens of cases at the district court level that apply AEDPA in the way he described. Is that wrong?",
  "No, he didn't, but do you think he's wrong?",
  "Do you think he's wrong?",
  "I thought at page 36 of your brief that you agreed that he made a correct -- that there was an error in -- of application.",
  "So there were at least two errors. How they balance out I guess is your view they didn't hurt him at all.",
  "Is that correct? There were two errors in the --",
  "-- at least.",
  "And he contends there were two more, and that hasn't been resolved.",
  "So at -- at least we have to assume that it was not an error-free sentencing proceeding.",
  "May I ask another question? Am I correct in assuming from the order entered on page 43 of the joint appendix that even though there were lots of errors there, the fact that they were not raised until after December 11th would have precluded review at the trial court level?",
  "But if the counsel happens to be incompetent, that's the end of the ball game.",
  "But, of course, if he had had paid counsel, he would not have had these handicaps.",
  "Are you saying -- I just want to be clear -- that even if this defendant had had paid counsel, he would not have had any right to appeal to the intermediate court?",
  "Of course, the question is whether the words, of right, were essential to that statement.",
  "Because then it wouldn't have needed to include the word first.",
  "But then the word first was redundant, not the words, of right.",
  "May -- may I ask you a question that may be a little bit collateral? There was disagreement on the court of appeals, as I remember it, as to whether or not a COA requirement applies to a denial of a 60(b) motion. What is your view on that issue?",
  "But have we seen it in the - - there are other circuits who do adopt that rule, aren't there? And have we seen the abuse you're describing?",
  "Well, it was not the applicable law at the time. The decision related back to before that hearing.",
  "No. Sometimes there are law- changing decisions, but this was not a law-changing decision. It's a decision interpreting what the law was from the date of its enactment.",
  "But is it correct that they address the same subject matter? Isn't 60(b) directed at the integrity of the habeas proceeding, whereas AEDPA is directed at the integrity of the original conviction?",
  "Is that a statement of when it's not available? I want to be sure I -- are you stating it positively or negatively?",
  "It is not available in the circumstance you described. Right?",
  "Now, would you state -- tell us when it is available?",
  "But may I ask this question? Suppose you have an interstate carrier that does 100,000 miles of business in Michigan and you have an intrastate carrier that does a 100,000 miles of business in Michigan. They both say the -- pay the same tax, don't they?",
  "Yes.",
  "They would both pay the same tax, both the intra and the interstate. Now, that doesn't sound to me like discrimination against either one.",
  "No, but I'm just saying if the intrastate and interstate carriers both have the same intrastate mileage, they both pay the same tax.",
  "Yes, but you might have an intrastate carrier that does a smaller amount of mileage, only 50,000 miles, and an interstate carrier that pays - - does 100,000 miles. They both pay the same tax too. And everybody is treated alike on their intrastate business.",
  "And the tax only operates on intrastate business.",
  "May I ask this question? Supposing the -- Michigan changed its system and said we're going to charge you $90 for -- as a plating fee. We're only talking about vehicles that are plated in Michigan. We're going to charge you $90 for a plating fee and now we're going to take 10 -- what used to part of the $100 and another $10 registration fee. Would that be permissible?",
  "May I ask this question? Is the fee payable before the -- a carrier may engage in business or is it after the carrier has paid? Is it -- is it like a tax that's paid after the year is out?",
  "If you had to pay it before, there would be no way to calculate it ahead of time because nobody would have had any mileage. Isn't that correct?",
  "If you have to pay it before the year begins and before you're allowed to engage in the business, you would have no way of measuring the number of miles you're going to travel during the -- the ensuing year.",
  "Mr. Boynton, may I just -- may I just ask this question? Is part of your position that the Federal statute does not prevent Michigan from waiving the $10 fee on -- for this particular purpose?",
  "Right. So that -- but you're saying to Justice Breyer then is they have waived the $10 and they do it to a narrow class, those vehicles who are plated in Michigan because they've already charged them $100, a very heavy charge for the privilege of being plated.",
  "May I ask this question? Because I know your time is short. Supposing Michigan imposed a new $10 fee per -- and it identified it precisely as in order to comply with that statute and then reduced its present plating fee from $100 to $90, would that be permissible?",
  "I'm not saying -- they reduced to $90 the plating fee, but then they enacted a new $10 fee specifically designed to comply with the statute.",
  "Could they do that?",
  "The $90 is for plating. It said only -- only Michigan-plated vehicles pay the $90. Everybody else -- everybody -- and everybody also pays the $10.",
  "Does that reading of the rule require that a decision to extend the time be set forth in any particular form of order or any written document?",
  "Maybe they internally did affirmatively decide to extend the time, but they just didn't enter an order. Would that count?",
  "What if they called counsel and said, we've decided to delay extending the time? Would that -- but we're -- we're going to extend the time, but we're not going to bother to enter an order. Would that constitute an extension?",
  "It requires a written document - -",
  "-- saying for how long it's going to be extended?",
  "Well, they apparently did decide to extend the time for whatever time it took them necessary to review the files that this particular judge became aware of during this period. They did, in fact, extend the time because they didn't issue it.",
  "No, but the opinion of Judge Suhrheinrich -- I forget his name -- explains in great detail why he thought they needed more time before the mandate issued. I don't know why that isn't explaining why he extended the mandate.",
  "Didn't she interview the - - the petitioner herself? Did she not interview the -- the defendant himself?",
  "Yes.",
  "Do you disagree with the factual point that I think one of the opinions made, that this study was not, in fact, known to exist by the members of the court of appeals panel who decided the merits of the case before the petition for cert was filed?",
  "As to how serious it was. I understand. But do you -- do you disagree with what I understood to be a representation of Judge Suhrheinrich that he did not know about this study, did not know -- it had not gotten into the record, and neither did anybody else on the panel, even though, it seems to me, sort of strange that nobody did know it? I have to confess that. But do you dispute the factual predicate or the fact that -- that they did not know that this study was available?",
  "But let me ask you this. Why should not the proper standard of being -- deciding -- the court of appeals panel has decided a case. They -- they learn something that would have caused them to come to a different conclusion had they not -- had they known it in time. Should not that be a sufficient reason to extend the 7-day period?",
  "Why not?",
  "Why does it have to be miscarriage of justice? They just say we goofed for an inexcusable reason. We now realize there's something very important we failed to -- failed to find out. We now know it, and we would decide the case differently had we known it a week ago. Is that not a sufficient reason to say let's postpone the 7 days?",
  "I understand that.",
  "I'm just asking whether if you were on the -- on the court of appeals, wouldn't you think that would be a sufficient reason to say, hey, don't issue the mandate? Hold it for a week so we can look at this. You don't think that would be permissible for an appellate judge to do that?",
  "Of course, isn't it also true that in Calderon the Court didn't merely hold that it was an abuse of discretion, they held it was a grave abuse of discretion, but even -- even more serious in that case?",
  "I know that's your position, but has any judge so ruled in this case?",
  "You may be right. In this case did any -- either the court of appeals or the district court terminate the stay?",
  "But, Mr. Olson, would it make any difference if all of the driving was inside the reservation? Would it -­",
  "-- make any difference?",
  "Yes, but, again, that would still be true if the incidence -- the tax was on the retailer rather than the wholesaler.",
  "Which the statute contemplates will be collected when the gas is sold to the -- by the retailer.",
  "Does that mean, Mr. Olson, that the tax that the -- the fuel, rather, that's sold to the United States Government, later, out-of-State, when is the credit for the sales out-of-State made? Is that made at the time of the initial delivery, or is -- do they ask for a refund a month later?",
  "I couldn't tell from the -­",
  "It seems to me that might be a way of identifying whether the term \"legal incidence\" really has any significance.",
  "I, sort of, take \"legal incidence\" to mean the duty to pay the tax. And I'm just wondering whether -- when fuel is sold to a distributor that the -- I mean, the distributor knows the fuel is going to be resold to the United States -- does he have an exemption from the tax, because he knows what's going to happen to it, or does he have to pay the tax, or accept the obligation to pay the tax, and then -­",
  "-- subtract, later on?",
  "I couldn't either.",
  "May I ask -- excuse me.",
  "May I ask you what the -­",
  "-- may I ask you a question about the Federal exemption? In your view, is that made available at the time of the initial purchase by the distributor, or does he have to, in effect, claim a credit later on?",
  "So that he -- his obligation to sell the gas is -- arises at the same time as his purchase.",
  "And it shows both what they resell to the United States and what they acquired.",
  "And let me ask you this question, too, on that subject. Do you think that the exemption that the State allows for resales to the United States is constitutionally compelled?",
  "And it's no under our -­",
  "-- our precedent, I think, isn't it?",
  "It's no, under our precedent.",
  "But is it -­",
  "-- constitutionally compelled to do so?",
  "But your -­",
  "-- your claim wouldn't disappear if they decided to tax all these other sovereigns.",
  "Your claim, as a tribe, would not disappear if they decided to become nondiscriminatory and tax all of the sales.",
  "Well, it would matter.",
  "It would seem to me exempting distributor-to-distributor taxes just means that only one distributor has to pay.",
  "No, but that's because there was a tax on the first sale to the first distributor. And may I ask this? Supposing -­",
  "But if the fuel -­",
  "-- were destroyed by flood or lightning or something like -- before it was resold to the retailer, there would be no tax -­",
  "Are there any incidents in which the distributor would pay the tax if he was not able to resell it to somebody else?",
  "May I ask, what Federal law does it violate?",
  "General Clement -­",
  "General Clement, before you go there, I want to question you about your distinction between Dr. Kevorkian and a doctor who uses controlled substances. Why could not the Attorney General treat Dr. Kevorkian's conduct as conduct that may threaten the public health and safety, and seek his -- cancellation of his license?",
  "Well, he -­",
  "-- he can rely -­",
  "-- on things like prior convictions, other things unrelated to a specific transaction. And if he thinks that assisted suicide is contrary conduct that threatens the public interest, health and safety, I don't know why that wouldn't apply to Dr. Kevorkian, as well as somebody using controlled substances.",
  "But the Attorney General's directive, if I remember it, does not identify any particular controlled substance. It just identified a particular kind of conduct by the doctor.",
  "Neither one. Neither one is identifying which schedule 2 or schedule 3 substance may not be used.",
  "General, then may I just ask this question? We're focusing on whether congress really authorized this action by the Attorney General. And in the Raich case, which, of course, was a close case -­ there were three dissents in the case -- the -- there was great attention on the fact Congress had considered the interstate market for the product involved, an impact on the market if it was allowed to be sold in -- or grown and so forth in California. But is there any evidence at all that Congress thought that any of these -- schedule 2 or 3 substances that are used in assisted-suicide situations -­ that Congress focused on the impact of that use on the interstate market for those drugs?",
  "But are they -­",

  "May ask this question concerning the -- Justice Scalia's suggestion that you're insisting the States would have the authority to act independently of a congressional prohibition against the use of a substance to make people happy and so forth. Isn't your point in this case that Congress hasn't really spoken to the issue to which the Attorney General has spoken?",
  "Which is the opposite of the case that Justice Scalia point, where the Congress has spoken to the issue.",
  "May I ask you this question? If the Attorney General determined that acupuncture was conduct that threatened the public health and safety, could he de-license, or revoke, the license of doctors who engaged in acupuncture?",
  "We will now hear argument in Schaffer against Weast. Mr. Hurd, you may proceed.",

And wouldn't the county be in the best position to explain what has been done and, sort of, get the -- get the hearing started, and so forth?",

  "Am I correct, though, this entity we're talking about is not a party to the case?",
  "So --",
  "Mr. Joseph, can I ask you to go back to the beginning for a second?",
  "They filed a reply brief. There are a lot of disputes about the facts. Do you concede that the Lincoln Property Company that you sued is a Texas corporation?",
  "Do you acknowledge that the corporation that you sued, Lincoln Property Company, is a Texas corporation?",

  "And may I ask you a question about the California statute, if I may, please? In subsection (a) of 190.3, it says that the trier of fact \"shall\" take into account any of the following factors, if relevant. And one of those is the existence of any special circumstance found to be true, pursuant to 190.1. And under 190.1, one of the special circumstances is number 14, \"heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\" Does that mean the statute required in the weighing process -- that the jury take into account that factor? And is it not true that factor was held invalid?",
  "So, they were -- they were directed to take into -- they \"shall\" take into account an invalid factor.",
  "No, but the -- number 14 clearly is not mitigating.",
  "All of the evidence --",
  "Would you agree, though, that, if you had a separate sentencing jury, one that did not have all the evidence, and that jury was instructed that at the guilt phase a determination has been -- that has -- it has been found that the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, and so forth, that that finding might tip the scales in favor of imposing the death penalty?",
  "Because the underlying facts are already before the jury, and they can make their own judgment about them.",
  "See, one of the -- one of the things that concerns me about this case -- unlike Zant, most of the cases in which we have found the label of aggravating -- immaterial -- or findings like prior criminal histories -- robbery, or something like -- but whenever a pejorative factor of this kind has been found, we've generally found it did tilt the scales a little bit on the -- on the -- in favor of death. Clemons and the other were cases of this kind of aggravating --",

  "-- cases in which we have held a fact of -- a finding of the fact of this kind was irrelevant, was harmless? I think the cases are all the other --",
  "May I ask you one quick question, but you can comment on it –- the statute expressly says, \"They shall impose a sentence of death if the trier of fact concludes that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances.\" How do you respond to that? Why is it not a \"weighing\" State when it says that?",
  "And the term \"concluding that it does outweigh\" is something different from \"weighing.\"",
  "But in -- would you clarify something? Is it the correct interpretation of the California law that the -- the California court held, in effect, that you may not consider the fact that the crime was heinous and atrocious for purposes of deciding whether he's eligible for the death penalty, but you may consider that fact for the purpose of deciding whether to impose the death penalty?",
  "But is that what the California court would say?",
  "But you don't - -",
  "-- contend that, do you?",
  "Do you contend - -",
  "-- that his statement was false? Do you contend the speech was false?",
  "Yes, but the disposition by the -- I mean, his grievance by the hearing examiner was that there was no retaliation. He assumed that the speech was proper and there was no inefficiency or misconduct on the part of the speaker.",

  "-- that you can't just make a Federal -- implied Federal cause of action under the Federal standards, from what we know. But then I was wondering, What if the Arizona statute said that's what the private firm should do?",
  "No, I'm assuming they just did it independently. They said, \"We want a regulation on the private mine inspectors, and let's just adopt the -- a standard that shall, in all respects, be the same as the Federal standard.\"",
  "In your view -- even though the Federal standard would not be controlling, in your view, if you applied a general reasonable-person test, would the Federal standards be admissible so that the plaintiff could argue that there was a failure here which is evidence of negligence?",

  "Right.",
  "But, may I ask, how do you -- how do you reach the conclusion that you're bound by the automatic stay and the discharge? Why aren't those also an infringement of State sovereignty?",
  "Wouldn't it at least be theoretically possible to differentiate between setting aside a preference, on the one hand, and just bringing a suit for a tort or a breach of contact, on the other? One could treat the assets that are -- were transferred prematurely -- or hastily, whatever you call it -- as part of the estate. At least it's conceptually possible.",
  "Except Congress -­",
  "-- has drawn that very distinction hadn't it?",
  "I said Congress has drawn the distinction that -- between the preferential claim and the contract claim.",
  "But the theory of the second is that you're not augmenting the estate, you're merely preserving the estate, isn't it?",
  "Of course, if Congress had thought it had successfully abrogated, there would be no reason to provide for a waiver, I don't suppose.",
  "May I ask a question on another subject, just talking for a minute about your in rem theory of the case? And I understand you would contend that assets have been subject to a fraudulent transfer or a preference should be deemed to be part of the estate. But is it not true that this case also involves a claim on the accounts receivable? And do you contend they also should be treated as part of the estate?",
  "Is that because you concede, in effect, that they would not be part of the estate if we adopted an in rem theory that included the preferential transfers?",
  "Okay.",
  "Now, that doesn't fit into your in rem theory, but why wouldn't you have been able to recover that on a waiver theory? If you -- and I understand your waiver argument is, you can defend the judgment on the ground not -­ you know, any ground to uphold the judgment is okay for the Respondent. But why wouldn't you have tried to defend that part of your case on the waiver theory?",
  "May I ask if you think, within the text of the question presented, we could decide whether the sovereign immunity was abrogated by the convention itself, not by Congress? There is that argument out there, you know.",
  "Abrogated.",
  "But may I not ask, Isn't it true that each of the parties here, over a long period of time, was a purchaser? I mean, the -- Reeder was a purchaser, was he not? They were a dealer.",

  "Well, it depends on how -- whether you regard the purchase as on a single -- each single transaction as a separate purchase or if you look at a course of dealing and say that, over a period of years, the favored dealer is one purchaser and the disfavored dealer is the other purchaser. Why can't you look at the pattern of dealing by automobile dealers over a period of time?",
  "It would be consistent with the literal language, wouldn't it? If you treat it, the purchaser, as a -- as -- look not at just individual transactions, but what they do over a period of years, just like any other -- any ordinary automobile dealer. Two dealers in this market, one in Arlington and one in Bethesda, are both purchasers, even though they may not compete on the same transactions, aren't they?",

Would that not create a prima facie case? And if not, how much more would they have to prove?",

  "Supposing you did have a contract, such as Justice Scalia suggests, in which the manufacturer agreed that, at any given point of time, you will get just as favorable a concession as any other Volvo dealer could get at the same time.

  "And it's also not disputed now that these were goods of like grade and quality.",

  "I know they -­",
  "-- need both, but which is your principal argument?",
  "Your principal argument, that there was no injury to competition.",
  "Okay. Thank you.",
  "But Justice Scalia's point is, no matter what the legal theory, the evidence, historical evidence, seems to indicate that the sky didn't fall.

Would that be diversion, or would it be diversion -- diverting it to some people who are not members of the religion?",

  "May I interrupt -­",
  "-- you with a -- with a question?",
  "You seem to have taken the position that the State cannot cure an Edwards violation, which seems to me quite different from the trial court's ruling, because the trial court made a number of factual statements that seem to me to be saying, \"Had these things been done, the violation might have been a -- cured.\" She referred to the fact he was still undressed, still in a cold cell, that his parent -- there was no parent present. He was scared, and -- he was scared and thought he was facing death. Now, it seems to me the logical inference from the trial judge's statement is, \"Had each of those things been different, I might have found a cure.\"",
  "And, otherwise, why should -- why would she go through these ventures?",
  "So, that -­",
  "-- it doesn't seem to me -- for you to prevail, you have to take the extreme position that there can never be a cure.",

  "-- you could -- you could surely cure it in some fairness.",
  "May I ask one question before you sit down, if you're through? Is it your understanding that the trial judge held that an Edward violation may not be cured, or that she held that, on the facts here, it was not cured?",
  "So that, your -- the answer to your -- the question presented in your cert petition really is answered. We all agree, it can be cured.",
  "Because the question you asked is whether it can be cured.",
  "But you do agree -­",
  "-- that the trial judge did assume it could be cured.",
  "And so, there could have been a cure.",
  "Yes.",
  "Do any of those circuits allow an exception for plain error?",
  "Yes.",
  "Would you refresh my recollection? In the cases you cited at the outset of your argument, where the judgments were reversed, am I wrong in thinking, in those cases, there was, in fact, a new trial afterwards?",
  "But the judgment of this Court was simply reverse, wasn't it?",
  "There were -­",
  "Yes.",
  "No, but the trial court could do that, pursuant to Rule 59(d), couldn't it?",
  "I say, the trial court could have done that pursuant to Rule 59(d) without a motion being filed.",
  "But, Mr. Stewart, just let me clear up one thing of confusion. Is it not true that if the District judge denies the motion before submitting the case to the jury, within 10 days after the jury verdict, if no further motion is made, he would still -- the judge would still have authority to change his mind and grant the motion?",
  "So, you're saying that if the judge wants to do what I -- what I hypothesized, the judge should say to the losing party, \"Renew your motion, and I'll grant it.\"",
  "Yes, but the -- the antitrust standing issue is not the same as the relevant market issue that was decided, is it?",
  "Yes, but --",
  "-- may I ask this question? That's a very -- that's a very interesting statutory construction case, I must say, by the way. But the -- in 1996, when they made the offset available against Social Security payments, they didn't enact a 10-year statute of limitations; they changed subsection, I think, (b) to (d) and said the 10-year provision is retained. And when the 10-year provision was first put in -- I mean, when the exception for student loans was made, in 1991, you had a statute that had a 10-year period for everything except student loan recovery. And it seems to me that if you look at the 1996 statute as saying, \"We're going to allow offsets against Social Security,\" under the same scheme that was enacted in 1991, because we had just amended the 10-year provision to preserve it -- they preserved the 10­ year provision -- that they seem to me to be preserving it in a statute that made this distinction between student loans and all other offsets. Is --",
  "It isn't as though they enacted, for the first time, an authority to offset Social Security and, in that statute, said, \"And -- but, by the way, there's a 10-year period of limitations here.\"",
  "Rather, they amended the 1991 Act.",
  "But it also had the exception for student loans. It's -- it was --",

  "But it was in the 1991 statute.",
  "If you say that -- let me just throw this thought out, so you can comment on it.",
  "It seems to me that there is a reasonable basis for assuming Congress might have thought that student loans should not have a 10-year bar if you're going to collect from Social Security, because most Social Security payments won't accrue until many, many years -- much more than 10 years after the student-loan default.",
  "No, but there is a --",
  "Retirement benefits are a pretty big part --",
  "-- of the whole package.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, I understand that.",
  "But, Mr. --",
  "-- Wolfman, couldn't you say the question could be phrased in this way? Do we view the notwithstanding language in 1091(a) as enacted in 1091 and governing the future, or do we view the 1996 amendment as, in effect, an amendment to that stat which -- which reenacted the provisions that were already there? And if it's a reenactment in 1996, then it's just an exception from the 10-year bar.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "I understand.",
  "But it didn't include Social Security payments when it was enacted.",
  "Or 1991. Either one.",
  "But it is -- it is true that the 1996 statute, which is the first time the express reference appears, does contain the 10-year statute by the indirect reference, and does not expressly refer to the -- cite the 1091(a).",
  "Ms. Blatt, can I ask -- there's no discussion -- legislative history in the briefs that I -- because I -- that I recall. Is it true that the people voting on the bill in 1996 had nothing but the amendment before them? Did they have a committee report on it explaining that it still applied to the -- that the -- that the \"notwithstanding\" clause in 1091(a) would still be in effect?",
  "Because it seems to me that, conceivably, a legislator looking at the bill all by itself, not getting out the earlier provisions of the code, might well think, \"Well, this includes a 10-year limit.\"",
  "Yes.",
  "Ms. Blatt, it -- was this statute -- I'm just really kind of curious that something this important, we're first putting this burden on Social Security -- it's a fairly important change. Was this part of one of these omnibus bills that covered 99 different subjects at once?",
  "That --",
  "Yes.",
  "And they did not have a separate committee proceeding on each separate part of that monster bill --",
  "-- as I remember.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Wouldn't the term \"negligent transmission\" probably cover late deliveries?",
  "Or incorrect deliveries in --",
  "-- to the wrong address, something like that.",
  "Yes.",
  "But it --",
  "But isn't your response to Justice Scalia -- you could make the same argument. If there's an accident, and the truck caught on fire, and the mail was destroyed, you couldn't recover for the lost mail in the truck, but you could -- but you could recover for personal injury resulting from the accident. It would be precisely the same conduct.",
  "Mr. Radmore, I don't think you're quite correct when you say, with regard to an automobile accident, it's just like a private entity delivering mail -- or delivering packages. If a private delivery service had an automobile accident that resulted in the destroy -- destruction of a package, a private party could sue for the contents of the package. But that's not true with regard to the Postal Service.",
  "But isn't it true that it falls squarely within the word \"transmission,\" just exactly as an automobile accident arising out of carrying -- transmitting mail does?",
  "They are both equally within the plain language.",
  "Which is happening in the -- in the truck when it has an accident.",
  "But the key word in the statute is \"transmission,\" not \"the transmission of letters or postal matter.\"",
  "But --",
  "But if that's true, why do you need the words \"miscarried\" -- why do you need the word \"miscarriage\" in the statute?",
  "But you -- but so would the word \"transmission\" if you -- under your reading, you don't need the word \"miscarriage.\"",
  "But can I just --",
  "-- this question? The case is a little bit on the border, because it's a slip-and-fall, and it does -- there may not have been negligence. We -- but we're assuming, via the allegations, they're true. But your position would apply to an intentional tort, as well as a negligent tort, I think, wouldn't it?",
  "I see.",
  "Okay.",
  "May I ask --",
  "May I ask two questions? Seems to me you're -- if we're using social analogies in what happens, I imagine that it would make a difference if the person who wants to -- who was invited in by the wife, is larger or smaller than the husband.",
  "And I think he probably would not go in if he thought he was a -- could not do so --",
  "-- in his physical encounter. And the problem with your case here is, the police officer is always larger than the homeowner, and he always has the power to override any physical objection. So, I think that the -- the actual social situation will vary tremendously from different facts as to the fair -- and yet, we're looking for a rule that applies equally across the board --",
  "-- in this case.",
  "And the second question I want you to address at the same time is, What if this was a suitcase that they both owned? They stopped in the airport. The wife says, \"I don't want you to open it,\" and her husband says, \"Go ahead and open it,\" or vice versa.",
  "Matlock is the reasonable police -- well, go ahead. I shouldn't interrupt.",
  "The \"different way,\" of course, would be to get a warrant.",
  "It would?",
  "May I ask a question? I never had one of these problems when I was in practice, so it's all new to me. But, \"an order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred as a result of the removal,\" does that mean that if, after the removal there are substantial proceedings in the trial court, in an appeal, and so on, and then you suddenly discover that the -- there was a mistake and you remand -- you can get fees for all the litigation work that took place in the interim? It could be a very large sum of money, couldn't it? It's not just fees incident to the fight over whether removal was proper.",
  "And that --",
  "And that would --",
  "-- conceivably, could include all sorts of discovery and arguments on motions and so forth that might actually save time in the subsequent proceeding, if it goes back to the State court.",
  "So, the judge's discretion includes both whether or not to include any fees, and he also has quite a bit of discretion on what to include in the fee award, I suppose.",
  "Why isn't Fogerty an example. Isn't the -- what is the standard that Fogerty announces? It rejects the British rule, and that it rejects the one favoring -- one party over the other? What is the standard you get out of Fogerty, other than pure discretion of the district court?",
  "May I return to Fogerty for a minute? As I read the footnote at the end of the opinion, which you - because say referred to the Third Circuit rule, it talks about, \"nonexclusive factors are permissible.\" It doesn't say the factors used by the Third Circuit are the -- you know, set any particular standard. As I read it, it leaves the discretion entirely up to the district court to apply whatever reasonable and appropriate factors seem correct in the particular case.",
  "But you're --",
  "-- but you're --",
  "-- the part of the decision on which you rely is the footnote at the end of the opinion, is that right?",
  "Yes.",
  "I wonder if that's a correct statement. It seems to me there are a lot of cases in State courts. In 1983, cases are subject to State court jurisdiction, where the plaintiffs are trying to enforce a Federal right.",
  "Oh, I just thought you said the State court would never be enforcing a Federal ­ - I may --",
  "-- I may have misunderstood your point --",
  "-- I'm sorry.",
  "In other words, it was an improperly removed case.",
  "Well, it --",
  "-- the whole basis for the constitutionality of the statute, I think, is the Enforcement Clause of the fourteenth amendment.",
  "That's true of Title II, as well as Title I?",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "So, what I'm suggesting is that it is not merely a matter of damages that's at issue here, but the entire validity of Title II.",
  "May I ask you this? The notion of our reviewing the adequacy of the evidence before Congress is something that's always seemed, sort of, puzzling to me. Do you know what -- what is -- what standard do you suggest that we should apply in determining whether the evidence before Congress was sufficient?",
  "Yes, I understand your view is that, whatever the standard is, you win. I'm just curious, do you have a --",
  "-- do you have a formulation of what the proper standard should be?",
  "Do you think --",
  "-- the level of scrutiny applied in Cleburne was precisely the same rational- basis level that is applied in a lot of other rational- basis cases?",
  "May I just --",
  "-- be sure I understand this point?",
  "Are you, in fact, arguing that the statute might be -- I know you don't agree with it -- might be proportionate and congruent with respect to all of its prohibitions, but, to the extent it provides for a damage remedy, then it crosses the line?",
  "But --",
  "But is that -- it -- because it has a damage remedy, or would it be equally noncongruent without the damage remedy? That's what I'm trying --",
  "I'm following up on Justice Kennedy's question to your colleague.",
  "Can I ask a rather probably sort of stupid question? But I gather there are a large number of these cases disposed of by a postcard. Would there be anything wrong if the California Supreme Court said, \"We're going to have two postcards. One says that 'the delay was unreasonable, denied'; and the other said, 'there's nothing to the merits, denied'\" -- you use two postcards -- wouldn't that solve all the problems?",
  "But they could adopt a 60­ day rule, or a 90-day rule, and then just, when they decided to not follow the rule, they'd put a check on ­ - say, \"Well, we did look at the merits in this case.\"",
  "-- I must say, I don't quite follow the -- why couldn't they simply say it's untimely? Wouldn't that -- that it -- there was -- it was not pending during this period, because it -- 3 years elapsed, and that's unreasonable. Wouldn't that end the case?",
  "No, I understand --",
  "-- but whether --",
  "-- it was a reasonable time to file is a State-law question.",
  "Well, isn't the --",
  "Doesn't the --",
  "-- California Supreme Court sometimes decide that the time between the intermediate court's decision and the filing in the California Supreme Court -- don't they ask whether that was reasonable?",
  "Or they only relate it back to the day of the conviction?",
  "May I ask that, if you had a case in which the Attorney General raised the -- say, this case, and yet -- and say California Supreme Court wrote an opinion in which it said, \"Now, 3 years has gone by, but the prisoner has given us a very elaborate explanation,\" as Justice Ginsburg suggested, \"and we find that explanation sufficient; therefore, we conclude that, even though it was 3 years, it was a reasonable time; and, therefore, we're going to address the merits. And we now address the merits and say you lose.\" Now, in that case, would it be pending, for our purposes?",
  "May I ask this question? I think our opinion the last time around suggested that possibility would certify into the California --",
  "-- Supreme Court, and that was not done. Was any other effort made that you can tell us about? Maybe you should, off the record, but to try and get the guidance of the California Supreme Court on the -- on the State-law problem here? Has anybody suggested to the court they might adopt a rule or a different practice or anything like that?",
  "Thank you.",
  "May I just interrupt? I want to be sure that I get one thing straight. The 90­ day presumption in capital cases, that is that if it's within 90 days, it's reasonable. Does it also presume that it's a -- more than 90 days, it's unreasonable?",
  "Right.",
  "No, I understand. But do they adopt the converse? If it's more than 90 days, is it presumed to be untimely?",
  "Well, I could see how they could overcome a presumption that way, but there's not even a presumption that over 90 days is unreasonable.",
  "May I ask this -- two questions about California? Is the problem we're discussing, with these long delays, primarily in the application the third range, the application of the California Supreme Court, as opposed to lower courts?",
  "But is the condition, that there is the long delay, that primarily occurs in the ­ - in the application of State Supreme Court? Is it --",
  "Then my second question is, Have we decided, or is it a matter of common practice in California, that the application to the California Supreme Court is necessary in order to complete the exhaustion?",
  "We've held it --",
  "-- in cases where there's direct review, but this is a different sort of animal that you have in California.",
  "I think it is --",
  "-- required.",
  "If a national bank changes its main office, it must get the approval of the Comptroller to do so?",
  "What sort of circumstance?",
  "Does it say -- just to take the Chief Justice's example, say they decided they want to open a branch in -- just a -- just a one-window branch in Wyoming and make that the main office. Would there have been any reason why they couldn't do it?",
  "So in other words, the -- the Comptroller would automatically approve such a change.",
  "Does the term, main office, have any significance for -- for any purpose other than this jurisdictional issue in this case?",
  "May I ask you another question that is really a follow-up on the Chief Justice's earlier -- for a private corporation, it's located both where it's incorporated and where it has its principal place of business. Is it your view that a national bank may have two parallel locations or just one?",
  "It could -- it could have a -- it could be a citizen of the State where its -- its papers say its main office is and also the State where, in fact, its main office is.",
  "Well, I should use a different word. Where its principal place of business --",
  "-- they have a big operation in New York and a -- and a Delaware headquarters in -- in Dover.",
  "May I ask you -- call your attention to another word in the statute that seems persuasive to me? It's the word respectively. The statute says all national banking associations shall be, for the purposes of all other actions by or against them, be deemed citizens of the State in which they are respectively located, which I would read as saying in which each of them is located. Isn't that --",
  "They're talking about a plural banking associations, not just plural branches of one association. And it's in which each -- in which they are respectively located, which strikes me as saying in -- in which each of those national banking association is located, which seems to me to read as though there's only one location for each bank.",
  "That's what it does say: the States in which they are respectively located.",
  "And of course, it refers to more than one State because it referred to even more than one national bank association. It's a plural associations, and then it says, each of them shall be deemed a citizen of the State in which -- it says in the plural -- in which they are respectively located.",
  "Correct. That's exactly right.",
  "May I go -- may I go back to the textual argument that Justice Scalia was suggesting a little while ago? If we presume that normally a citizen is a citizen of only one place -- there are multiple -- there are other situations where you have a dual citizen -- and that you would normally assume they're only a citizen in one place, then Congress, in order to solve the problem of corporate headquarters in the private commercial world, corporate headquarters, a main piece of business, went out of its way to say corporations shall be deemed to be a citizen of two places -- they made a special statute when they could be a citizen of two places, which overcomes the presumption that it's a citizen of only one place. But there's nothing to overcome the presumption that in 1348 they're assuming each citizen has only one place of citizenship because that statute just used the word respectively. It talks about many banks but in -- respectively citizens of -- of different States. But I think that's fully consistent with the notion, sort of the basic background notion, that one person has one -- one citizenship; one corporation has only one place of citizenship.",
  "Well, this -- I'm -- I'm relying strictly on the statutory language in making this argument.",
  "Yes, because it doesn't say anything about anybody being a -- capable of being a citizen of two different places, whereas 1332 does, which is the unusual situation.",
  "Respectively.",
  "See, but it's clearly unusual to say you can be a citizen of two places. And to do that, you had a special statute in 1332. To say you can be a citizen of 40 or 50 States simultaneously, there really is no precedent for that.",
  "Counsel, can I ask you sort of a basic question that I don't really think is adequately addressed in the briefs? You contend, as I understand it, that the exception in 2680(c) covers this case.",
  "And 2680 -- the introductory language of 2680 is the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to such cases. And is it not true that 2676 is in this chapter, and does it not, therefore, follow that 2676 does not apply to this case?",
  "But my first question is how does 2676 apply if it's in the chapter that 2680 says shall not apply to -- to things in the exception?",
  "But they held that the -- the action simply didn't apply in -- in that case. There was no -- there was no recovery under the -- basically it held the foreign -- foreign country exception precluded the statute from applying --",
  "-- which is what also happens here.",
  "No. It only says it shall not apply if it comes within the exception.",
  "I'd like to pursue the question I asked you earlier because I really didn't fully understand your answer. It seems to me, as I read 2680, it simply says that if one of the exceptions applies, there's no waiver of sovereign immunity, basically. That's what -- what the scope of it is. And therefore, none of the other provisions of -- of this chapter apply, and if none of the provisions of this chapter apply, clearly the judgment bar provision is one of those.",
  "That's correct.",
  "It follows that 2679(b) does not apply, but you're just have -- working on a blank slate with no provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act affecting a waiver of sovereign immunity or imposing any kind of judgment bar.",
  "Correct.",
  "The main holding in Smith was that the foreign country exception applied. That's all they held in Smith, wasn't it?",
  "And the -- and the -- I don't see how that is at all inconsistent with what I'm suggesting here. I really don't.",
  "Well, looking at it very broadly, it doesn't seem to me that if the United States did not waive sovereign immunity for a particular category of tort case, that a dismissal of such a tort case should bar an -- an action by an individual against an individual defendant, just looking at it in -- in a global sense. And that's what the plain language of the statute also says. So I don't really see any tension. I -- maybe I'm missing something obvious here.",
  "And plaintiffs, generally, like to sue -- sue solvent defendants too I think.",
  "If the case was one in which the merits issue you claim is basically the same as the legality issue under the contract -- but would your argument be as strong if it were different, if you had a different reason for claiming that the contract was void or voidable?",
  "What about the possibility that you always want a neutral decision-maker in cases like this? The arbitrator always has an interest in finding that the contract is valid and arbitrable because that’s his source of business is arbitrating disputes.",
  "No. I’m just talking about as a general matter if we’re trying to decide the issue not just on these facts, but what is the better rule --",
  "Mr. Bland, I’m curious to know if you agree with your opponent that whoever decides it, an arbitrator or a judge, it’s really going to be decided by the Florida Supreme Court in the next couple of months.",
  "Do you think there's a distinction -- do you think there's a distinction between components in cases where there's a one-on-one relationship between the tied product and the tying product and cases like this which involve metering? Do you think there's a different possible approach between the two?",
  "But your earlier point was we know that a whole lot of patents are not all that important. But is it not fair to assume that when a patent can generate metering in this particular kind of situation, that it -- that it's a likelihood that it has more power than the average patent?",
  "But if it's -- if it is true, as your opponent says -- and I don't know if it is or not -- that you're able to get twice the price for the ink than you otherwise would get, does that -- is that any evidence of market power?",
  "Well, if it were what the record reflected.",
  "But isn't it also true that some -- some economists disagree? And I'm just wondering if there's disagreement among economists, should we take one view over the other?",
  "Can I ask you --",
  "Can I ask you how far your position extends? I think there's a good argument that if a patent is really a good patent, it doesn't really matter whether the patentee charges a very high royalty or gets a -- reduces the royalty and gets profits out of the tied -- tied product. In your view, is the rule sound that if it is a monopoly in the tied product, that there is an antitrust problem?",
  "In -- in the tying product. Excuse me. In the tying product.",
  "I know that's all you're asking for --",
  "-- but I'm just wondering if it isn't -- if it isn't the logical conclusion of your position that it really doesn't matter, even if there is a monopoly in the tying product.",
  "No, but I'm -- I'm asking sort of an economic question rather than a legal question.",
  "If your position is all the economists say this is a lot of nonsense, I think maybe it's a lot of nonsense even if there's a monopoly in the tying product is what I'm suggesting.",
  "Well, it wouldn't be a new one. It would be just following the old IBM case and all those cases.",
  "No, but that's the example they're saying it would be following. It's not a brand new idea.",
  "But your -- your answer to Justice O'Connor is there should be no distinction even if there is evidence that there's a long-term relationship, a requirements relationship, and an increase in price.",
  "But isn't that also true even if there's monopoly power? That's what -- I really think it's a very interesting question as to whether it makes any difference whether the monopolist who happened to have a patent just charges high prices for product A or decides to charge a little less for product A and make hay out of product B.",
  "No. I understand it's not. I'm just kind of curious about where we're going down -- we're going down a new road in this whole area. I'm just wondering how -- what our destination is.",
  "We're talking about components, for example. It doesn't seem to me it makes any difference whether General Motors has a monopoly or not when it wants to sell, you know, two components as part of the same package. Anyway, I've gone astray too much.",
  "I have to interrupt to say --",
  "-- I think your opponent would say the district court made a finding to the contrary.",
  "Okay.",
  "I'm kind of curious what your answer is to the Chief Justice's question.",
  "No, but the question is does the presumption make any sense at all outside of the requirements context.",
  "As I remember the text of section 3, it applies to other products patented or unpatented.",
  "Of course, one of the interesting aspects of this kind of discrimination is the victim of the discrimination is the more powerful buyer in these cases.",
  "I suppose you can do that under modern computer technology. You couldn't have done it 20 years ago.",
  "General, may I just point this -- suppose the lawyer or the doctor are aware of the legislative history and say, well, generally that's true. But when you have a legislative history that suggests that the legislature considered this very defense and rejected it in the statute, would then that then give them some concern?",
  "But if they discussed the issue on the floor of the legislature, why wouldn't they have drafted the precise protection they thought appropriate?",
  "Why isn't that this case? I don't understand.",
  "You mean he has to bring the as-applied challenge when he has the patient in his office? He has to wait until he has the patient in the office, is that what you mean?",
  "But in Justice Scalia's case, would not the reason for that relief have to be a finding that the statute is unconstitutional? You can't just grant the relief because you think it's a good idea.",
  "May I ask this historical information? Since the decision of the district court and the decision of the court of appeals, has the legislature considered enacting a different statute that would solve the problems?",
  "It seems to be that it wouldn't have been all that hard to do. I don't know.",
  "Was there any argument on the merits as to those four counts?",
  "Yes. Yes. Is it conceivable that we overlooked that point?",
  "But if I just -- do you think it's conceivable that we just didn't realize those four points were at issue?",
  "And do you think we resolved the statutory construction issue that you're now arguing very carefully at this time?",
  "They may assume it --",
  "-- but there's nothing in the opinion to give any --",
  "Of course, the reason they said it was plausible is that -- and you may well be right, on the bottom line, and the Government agrees with you, but there are -- there's a redundancy in the statute. There's a phrase in there that could be taken out, and the statute would have exactly the same meaning, if you're correct.",
  "It seems to me those words -- I forget what the -- \"commit threats of physical violence.\" So, take those words. The statute will have the same meaning.",
  "Oh, really?",
  "What function do they perform? What case would it cover that would not otherwise be covered?",
  "That do not rise to an obtaining?",
  "Oh, I see what you're saying.",
  "You're -- I understand.",
  "But, of course, at the time they did that, the Clayton Act had already been passed.",
  "Would you not --",
  "Ms. Blatt --",
  "-- can I identify a concern? I'd like you to help me out on it. I -- that language, if you construe it the way the other side does, it would cover certain violent conspiracies that would merely obstruct interstate commerce that we could all be concerned about today. Are there other criminal statutes on the book that fill that gap?",
  "So that you're saying, in substance, that you don't need to read the Hobbs Act the way they do in order to protect the public from the kind of harms that the -- they would read the statute as covering.",
  "Regardless of whether we knew what we were doing, we said it.",
  "Only when it's perfectly clear that we didn't know it.",
  "You don't think there's even an arguable basis for saying we resolved the statutory question that's presented now, do you?",
  "But it's not mentioned in the opinion.",
  "Well, I don't think we would actually enter judgment. We'd -- we might reverse with instructions to have the lower court enter judgment, but we wouldn't enter the judgment ourselves.",
  "The mandate, in this case, remanded, is that what you --",
  "So further proceedings --",
  "-- consistent with the opinion.",
  "We also actually entered a mandate, too.",
  "Do you think it becomes unconstitutional when -- when you have one more test? What did it become unconstitutional? The first test was not unconstitutional.",
  "How many tests did he have?",
  "Over what period of time?",
  "So it’s maybe three -- three a year? Is that what it was?",
  "And that’s",
  "I have to interrupt you. What is the Fourth Amendment violation?",
  "As I understand, the allegations are that there was random procedure in effect, and he thinks maybe he’s been tested more frequently than some other people. That’s all.",
  "Well, but as I understand it, the -- the system as a whole is not challenged as violating the Fourth Amendment.",
  "By having him take more tests than would be produced by a purely random selection.",
  "Have we ever said that’s a Fourth Amendment violation? can’t conduct a random --",
  "If the computer malfunctions, that’s a Fourth Amendment violation?",
  "But the relief that he requested was to do a little more testing to see whether he was being tested more than the average person, as I understand it.",
  "Which is not -- did not seem to me to be alleging a violation of the Fourth Amendment.",
  "Mr. Stewart, can I just ask one question? Because I didn’t quite follow it. I thought you were describing a major personnel action in -- in your description of the administrative review. But if this is a minor or whatever, a lesser review, would there have been an avenue through the administrative agency?",
  "Through the collective bargaining --",
  "But then supposing the then what happens?",
  "And it would be in the district court.",
  "Mr. Stewart, if you assume the APA is the remedy -- we’re talking about a district court procedure -- how would you describe the final agency action that would be challenged in that lawsuit?",
  "Let’s assume that the -- he seeks a grievance, and the union refuses to grieve. And then he then goes into -- into district court under the APA. What would the final agency action be in your view? little bit hard to define. It would in some sense be --",
  "So what would his relief be? He can untake it.",
  "Because he can’t damages under the APA.",
  "But that’s not a final agency action. The threat of another test isn’t a final agency action, is it?",
  "Mr. Stewart, let me just be sure I understand. In the Government’s view, is it a personnel action or is it not?",
  "May I ask this question, General?",
  "There are really two kinds of Batson problems as I see it. There are some cases where the prosecutor is -- just is deliberately keeping African Americans off the jury, and there -- there’s no question there’s a violation there. But I’m wondering if there isn’t another category where persons are unconscious of their own subconscious bias and not realizing that they themselves have an unconscious fear that perhaps an African American might not be a sympathetic juror. Would that kind of failure to really identify the problem within the prosecutor’s own conception of the case -- would that be a Batson violation in your view?",
  "If, for example, the judge saw that over a period of time, a particular prosecutor had hunches about jurors over and over again and they just happened to be black most of the time. That would not justify a -- a Batson challenge.",
  "But -- but she’s totally convinced of the good faith of the prosecutor. And I’m not suggesting bad faith.",
  "But just realizes this person has an unconscious bias that shows up in the -- in the pattern of challenges. Would that be a justified challenge?",
  "Right.",
  "And if the trial judge determined --",
  "-- based -- based on the history of several trials and so forth, that this prosecutor unconsciously had this hunch with respect to black jurors but not others, that would be a sufficient basis for a challenge.",
  "Except in this very case, one gets the impression that the prosecutor was pretty confused, but maybe she was acting in good faith.",
  "May I ask just a -- kind of a background question? I noticed the judge pointed out after ruling that he was under -- he -- I can’t remember if it was a he or a she, but was under an obligation to report its reasons for granting Wheeler motion to the State bar.",
  "Does that -- did that requirement apply after the Ninth Circuit decision? Is there a requirement that the -- the lawyer be investigated for possible discipline?",
  "Do you, by any means -- you don’t contend, though, the fact that she did rely, in part, on an unconstitutional reason is a sufficient reason for sustaining a Batson type challenge?",
  "But you have not argued that that would be a sufficient reason for setting aside the verdict.",
  "Do you think it would have had merit if you had made that argument?",
  "But, you’re coming up with still more reasons than the prosecutor came up with.",
  "May I interrupt with one --",
  "-- brief question? Would that be true if the university didn't allow any access whatsoever to any employer?",
  "No --",
  "-- not the regulatory matter. The statute.",
  "But --",
  "Let me ask you --",
  "-- this question, to follow up on Justice O'Connor's thought. Can -- are you saying that the school can engage in speech expressing its views about the military policies, can it engage in symbolic speech by affording access, which is equal in all functional requirements, but yet sends a message that they are really disagreeing with what's going on by, say -- let a law school say, \"Well, for -- most employers will let you use the regular law-school placement facilities, but, for the military, we will require you use the college facilities to send a message that we disapprove, if the college facility is equally of -- good, as a matter of functioning\"?",
  "But is it not equal because of the message it sends or because it denies the opportunity to recruit as effectively?",
  "What if I had an example where they were equal -- equally effective as recruitment avenues. Could they -- could they make the military take one that was equally effective, but it sent a message, \"Well, we really don't like what you're doing\"?",
  "Yes.",
  "So, the --",
  "-- the point I'm trying to make is, Does your agreement, that you can engage in speech by posting banners or handing a note, apply to symbolic speech --",
  "-- the kind of conduct that is symbolic speech?",
  "No, that's a functional --",
  "That's a functional difference.",
  "May I just be sure I have one thing straight? The content of the compelled speech, as I understand it, is you're aiding in the recruitment of the Armed Forces, right?",
  "And so, it --",
  "-- would still have been compelled speech if, 25 years ago, Congress passed a statute saying, \"University, you must allow our people on campus to recruit,\" and they some -- for some reason, didn't want to help. But that would have been a violation of the first amendment of the school if there were no other debate, just they didn't want the Army on because they had to provide facilities that would aid recruitment.",
  "So that it would have violated the first amendment during World War II when the -- whenever they are trying to raise an army, if they had compelled an unwilling university to provide recruitment facilities to the military.",
  "Well, that be compelled speech, though, in your view. That's the kind of speech we're talking about, anything that helps the military raise an army.",
  "You agree that it is violated.",
  "When you --",
  "-- were talking about --",
  "-- the government's message, the message is, \"Join the Army.\" Is that right?",
  "And that's a viewpoint- discriminatory message.",
  "The single message is, \"Join the Army.\"",
  "The single message is, \"Join the Army.\"",
  "May I ask you --",
  "-- this question, with that very point in mind? Does it necessarily follow, if there are occasional applications of this statute that might be invalid, that the whole Solomon Amendment needs to be struck down?",
  "May I ask just -- did the individual plaintiff assert the 1981 claim at any time before the settlement of the corporate claim?",
  "I would have assumed --",
  "-- there wouldn't have been a settlement first without taking care of the second, if they had known both were on the table. But you say the first had been -- both of them had been --",
  "Ms. Mahoney, may -- may I ask you one brief question that I should have asked on direct? I hope you have time for it. But supposing a fact situation in which a wholly owned -- a -- a corporation wholly owned by an African American starts to negotiate with your client, and your client says, we have a policy of not dealing with companies owned by African Americans. Would the corporation or the individual have a lawsuit under section 1981?",
  "You think the corporation would.",
  "But not under 1981.",
  "But -- but in your view, to the extent that racial discrimination might have affected negotiations, that would be an element of the corporation's claim under 1981 rather than an individual claim.",
  "Yes.",
  "Of course, that means they comply with Lockett. I want to ask you one question that goes back to your colloquy with Justice Souter and Justice Scalia. Justice Scalia pointed out that the State has made a moral judgment on a certain state of facts, the death penalty shall be imposed and which you agreed with. And that was true in the cases back in 1975 and 6. There were some State statutes that mandated death based on the moral judgment of the State in certain circumstances. I think one was a North Carolina statute. Do you ask us to reexamine those cases?",
  "It -- it does not rely on the proposition that there's a situation in which there's a mandated death penalty which is perfectly okay.",
  "Yes, but of course, the aggravators -- it would be permissible for a State to include the aggravators necessary to narrow the category in the definition of the crime itself.",
  "But you would say that if the State met that burden and there was no mitigating or no substantial mitigating evidence, it would be permissible to -- for the State to mandate the death penalty.",
  "The answer is yes.",
  "And you think that's fully consistent with the North Carolina case.",
  "Well, it -- that's the way Justice Blackmun interpreted the majority, but the majority didn't quite say that because it said the burden on the defendant was to prove sufficient mitigation to justify something other than the death penalty. And conceivably one could have met that burden with substantial mitigating evidence that came out even.",
  "Under the majority's opinion -- now, you're dead right about what Justice Blackmun said, but --",
  "But you would agree that it would be consistent with the -- the text of the majority opinion to say it really meant they have to prove enough mitigating evidence to make death the inappropriate sentence, which could be less than -- even a 50/50 balance?",
  "Well, that wouldn't be true if you amended the statute though, would it? If you -- if they amended the statute to take the 50/50 problem out of it, which wouldn't seem to me all that difficult, you could still impose the death penalty on these other 12 people who haven't been tried.",
  "Because of an ameliorating amendment to the death penalty statute?",
  "I doubt if you'd take that position if they did it.",
  "Ms. Woodman, you said that they didn't make such an argument in this case and in some other case, but you did not include the argument in the joint appendix, did you?",
  "Well, the Kansas Supreme Court thought that --",
  "I might point out -- I just looked at the question presented. It does assume -- and I guess is drafted by the Kansas Attorney General. The question is what happens when mitigating and aggravating evidence is in equipoise. So the assumption on which we took the case is that there will be cases in which there's equipoise.",

But there ­ - as a realistic matter, do you think it's possible to prevent a juror from deciding, \"I thought it was really a closer case than beyond a reasonable doubt; and so, I'm a little hesitant about the death penalty\"? There's no way to prevent that --",
  "-- from happening.",
  "Yes.",
  "I have two questions, if I may. One -- of course, that wouldn't -- the alibi evidence would already have been rejected, whether there was deliberateness or not, so that would not support putting in the alibi evidence. But the second question I have -- I wanted to be sure we're clear on ­ - do you intend, on the future hearing, to introduce anything other than the transcript of the prior proceeding? Do you intend to introduce live witnesses under -- as you may, perhaps, be able to, under Oregon law?",

  "Yes.",
  "But even if it was unlawful, it was not unconstitutional.",

  "No.",
  "No --",
  "-- that's not the question. The actually -- actual entry was lawful, yes?",
  "Oh, okay.",

Are there cases in which courts have held that there was a knock-and-announce violation, and there is a general remedy of exclusion, unless -- except when there's a causal connection; but, in fact, the evidence was admitted because it was not causally connected to the entry?",

  "But, Mr. Kneedler, I understand your argument to be they should be treated just like a malicious prosecution claim, which is no distinction between a constitutional basis and a common -- and just that he hated his brother-in-law. I think you're saying they're the same. That's what I understand Justice Scalia to be asking you.",

  "But that's a disputed issue, and we don't have to decide the probable cause issue. Is that not correct?",
  "But because the other side is arguing that even if there is probable cause, the burden shifts when they prove the retaliatory motive, and you have to prove that you would never -- you made -- you would have brought the prosecution even if there had been no retaliatory motive. That's what we're arguing --",
  "And the question I would ask is why should this be different from a wrongful discharge case in which there's ample cause to discharge and the issue boils down to whether or not he would have been discharged anyway. Why isn't it the same -- same situation?",
  "Wouldn't -- wouldn't all those considerations justify a rule that makes the burden of proving the retaliatory motive very high, say, maybe it has to be by clear and convincing evidence or something like that?

  "I'm not either.",
  "May I ask this question? Maybe I should ask Mr. Kneedler. But am I correct in assuming that even if you should lose on the issue that we're faced with today, the case would, nevertheless, go forward because you would still seek to prove an absence of probable cause?",

  "Yes, but the SEC could relitigate it, I would think. It wouldn't be bound by the judgment in a private suit.",
  "It's surprising that the holder claims didn't respond to Blue Chip. I think your argument would suggest they should have responded to Blue Chip by bringing a whole host of holder claims in the State court.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, does that mean that the executing officer must be the same officer who got the warrant?",
  "I don't know why he's going to give a warrant to his -- some just call in a police officer and say I want you to execute this warrant. He doesn't know anything about the probable cause. He just says he's mandated to carry out the warrant.",
  "The affidavit itself says there is now concealed a certain person or property. He checked the wrong the box --",
  "If you read the whole affidavit, you know it doesn't mean what it says there.",
  "May I ask you this question? With a warrant to conduct a wiretap, does the warrant just merely specify the telephone number and the time at which the -- the officer may listen, or does it have anything to do with what -- what -- the content of the -- of the conversation?",
  "No, but I mean in describing the authority of the investigating officer to execute the warrant, does it describe it just in terms of a physical number that can be listened, or one or more numbers, plus a time period, or does -- does it say you may listen only when he's talking about foreign affairs or --",
  "It's a minimization as to what they will transcribe, isn't it?",
  "But that probability does not support the truth of the statement that the person or property so described is now concealed at the place for the issuance of the warrant.",
  "Of course, if the -- if the stuff was already there that supports the warrant and the search, we don't even reach the question of a -- of the anticipatory warrant.",
  "I should say I -- I've approached the case on the assumption that the only thing we're worried about is whether -- whether the anticipatory part is okay.",
  "But it doesn't seem to me to be a fair response to say, well, we had other grounds for --",
  "But -- but you would defend the warrant even if the only thing they were looking for was the stuff delivered at the -- at the time.",
  "And as to that aspect of it, the warrant is incorrect.",
  "The warrant itself.",
  "Well, it's not really a box. I am satisfied, et cetera, the property so described is now concealed on the premises.",
  "I'm not sure the Framers used controlled deliveries either.",
  "But, of course, if you take that view, why did they bother to put the words, anticipatory search warrant, on the document? That's what we're fighting about. If we decide it on your ground, we never should have taken cert.",
  "May I ask --",
  "-- may I ask you this question? The warrant now says it is now -- the warrant says the contraband and so forth is now concealed on the person or in the house. And if I understand your position correctly, your first argument is it should have said, will be concealed upon the happening of the anticipatory event. That would have -- and describe the event properly. That would have satisfied the Ninth Circuit's objection.",
  "Now, why would that not also have satisfied the objection of the warrant -- the argument you make in this Court? Because it would have made it clear that there is now probable cause to believe it will be there at the time of the execution. Why isn't that sufficient to make the warrant valid?",
  "Will it also satisfy the text of the Constitution that says no warrant shall issue except upon probable cause? And I'm asking you why is it not adequate probable cause to say we believe that will probably happen when the anticipatory event occurs?",
  "Well, he has made a determination of the facts that will establish probable cause.",
  "But that -- that puzzles me a little. The -- the affidavit says execution will not take place until the event. But the authority to search, which is in the last paragraph, is not limited to the time after the anticipatory event.",
  "I mean, not even -- it is not only the warrant, but the affidavit itself doesn't say we merely request permission to search after the -- after the event. It's a general request for authority to search.",
  "No. I'm drawing your attention to paragraphs 61 and 64 of the affidavit.",
  "Yes, but the authority is broader than the authority to search for those items.",
  "But it takes a step of reasoning beyond merely saying we incorporate the -- the affidavit into the warrant.",
  "Am I correct --",
  "May I just ask one clarifying question? Was it found that there was no connection, or was it not found that there was a connection?",
  "It was. I didn't read it that way.",
  "I'm sorry. I want to be sure I follow you. You say that somewhere on page 82 there is a finding that there was no hydrological connection?",
  "They don't find a --",
  "I agree with that. I'm asking you if they found there was no hydrological connection.",
  "But not on page 82.",
  "What page are you on?",
  "But I'm still puzzled --",
  "-- by your answer to Justice --",
  "-- Justice Kennedy. What if there's no hydrological connection today, but there would be after you -- after you built your project?",
  "But it -- would it be a sufficient reason to deny a permit based on the judgment that after the project is completed, there will be a -- a hydrological connection?",
  "No. It seems to me you could answer that yes or no.",
  "Perhaps you don't want to but --",
  "But isn't it sort of foolish to say that we're concerned about pollution, but only if you -- only if you catch it in advance? That doesn't make sense because if the problem would arise when you did what you're seeking a permit to do, why shouldn't you be denied the permit?",
  "No, but my hypothesis is that we know it would happen, or they -- they would find it would happen after the project is completed. And it seems to me that -- that that's what you should focus on rather than what's -- you know, rather than what happens before.",
  "Of course, when we're talking about the scope of -- of Federal power, we're not merely concerned with dumping refuse in the creek, but also deliberate attempts to poison the water system.",

  "Thank you.",

  "General Rowe, may I ask this question? In the Miccosukee case, we sent the case back, as you remember, to decide whether or not there were one body of water or two bodies of water. In your view, are there one or two bodies of water -- would it be five bodies of water -- in this case?",
  "So, you --",
  "-- concede that.",
  "Okay.",
  "Yes.",
  "May I ask you this question?",
  "Supposing -- I've written a fair number of opinions involving criminal cases where I've had to say that we take all the inferences favorable to the prosecution, and based on that rule, we find there's sufficient evidence to justify the jury's verdict. How we would have decided it is not before us. We accept the jury's verdict. What if the -- on the merits of the underlying crimes, the South Carolina Supreme Court had written that kind of an opinion rather than there's overwhelming evidence of guilt? Do you think they would have held the third party evidence admissible or inadmissible?",
  "But it's odd that they didn't say that. Their -- the reasons they gave were that the evidence of guilt was overwhelming.",

  "-- be permissible?",

  "No, just the very fact that there's -- they're an ex-felon. And let the person know, at the time of his discharge from prison, that this is one of the things that the State is going to exact from you as a punishment for your crime.",
  "No, I'm saying --",
  "-- he's not on parole.",
  "But I'm hypothesizing a case in which the law will destroy the expectation of privacy, because it will provide that all ex-felons are subject to search. So, they would know, the same as a parolee now knows, he's subject to search. Would that be valid?",
  "But -- so you don't --",
  "-- rely on --",
  "-- the fact that --",
  "But then we're not relying on the elimination of the expectation of privacy, because, under my hypothetical statute, the ex-felon would know he's subject to it. So, it has to be something other than the absence of an expectation of privacy. Is that correct?",
  "But following --",
  "-- up on Justice --",
  "-- Alito's thought, supposing there were no restrictions whatsoever, but this particular search didn't seem very offensive. Would you still defend it?",
  "And it --",
  "-- it was assumed California --",
  "-- didn't say if they had protection against harassment and so forth. Suppose they just said, \"Cart blanche, you can search any parolee at any time, any place.\" And then you'd ask whether this search was reasonable.",
  "So, it would uphold this.",
  "There's --",
  "-- no matter now unreasonable the California statute might be in other applications.",
  "I suppose it might be an abuse of discretion if you'd already had a hearing and took -- and decided that there was merit to the plaintiff's claim, and then decided, \"Well, now I'm going to just throw it out on limitations,\" might be an abuse of discretion.",
  "Is there a conflict on the Circuits on that point? I don't know.",
  "Yes.",
  "But if Arkansas was a party to the case, it didn't get notice of the dismissal?",
  "I wonder if you have a claim for incompetent counsel representing you.",
  "I'm wondering you -- if you have a claim against counsel for being incompetent in letting a settlement be made without notice to the -- to you. It seems to me hard to -- hard to understand how this could happen.",
  "But could she -- after that assignment, could she bring a suit in her own right to do that, to recover the medical costs?",
  "Even though she's assigned the cause of action to the State?",
  "May I ask this clarifying question? If it's 50/50 because of a jury verdict of comparative negligence, then you only get half the money. If it's 50/50 because of a settlement, believing they only have a 50 percent chance of recovery, what -- what is your answer?",
  "You're saying the State should sue here.",
  "You're saying here the State should therefore sue, if I understand you.",
  "But here it's stipulated I thought.",
  "No. It's a compromise. Just as my other example of a 50/50 chance of winning the lawsuit, you compromise for 50 percent. I don't see the difference.",
  "Is there a contention that the medical was under-valued in the settlement or -- I thought it was understood that it was the same proportion of the settlement. I mean, if you discounted everything by 50 percent, medical was discounted by the same percentage as everything else. Is that correct?",
  "Because there's some -- I -- I wasn't clear on whether the State had stipulated that this is what you agreed with the other side or that this is a fair calculation of the settlement.",
  "With respect to the text of the statute and whether the anti-lien provision applies, I'd be interested in your view, as a matter of Arkansas law, as to who owned the chose in action first and, secondly, who owned the proceeds of the settlement recovery after the assignment had taken place.",
  "May ask you this question, Mr. Bopp? This -- in -- following up on Justice Ginsburg's inquiry, is it your view that there is no set of facts, no matter how scandalous and so forth and so on, Watergate and all the rest of it, could ever justify an expenditure limit?",
  "Well, if that's the case, then why -- why would it be inappropriate to have further hearings in this case to see whether they're -- they could be justified?",
  "No, I understand. I'm just curious to know what sort of -- what sort of evidence could ever support an -- an expenditure limit in your view, if -- if any.",
  "Ms. Maynard, it's my understanding that a lot of this law developed out of the dicta in the Markham case. Do you think the dicta in the Markham case was an accurate description of the prior history?",
  "You know there are a lot of scholars who think that Markham is the source of most of the confusion, and so that's why I was asking whether you think we should -- to clear up, which you're suggesting we should do, we should reexamine some of that dicta or we should just stick to the holding.",
  "Well, is it -- is it correct -- I just want to be sure I follow you -- that they determined that the estate plan was invalid?",
  "Mr. Brunstad --",
  "May I ask you two questions? First, if there were no such animal as the probate exception, would there have been bankruptcy court jurisdiction over your claim?",
  "So your -- you would prevail even if there were no probate exception in your view.",
  "And my -- my second question is I noticed you quoted from a Minnesota Law Review about 250 cases, and the -- your opponent pointed out that the -- the next sentence of the article said the holdings don't support the generalization. And I would just like to ask you, apart from the Markham case, what is the case -- what holding of a case lends the greatest support to your probate exception argument.",
  "I'm not asking you to rank them. I don't want a list of cases that have a lot of dicta because some of these cases went off on laches, some went off a lot of different grounds than purely -- than -- some of them don't even mention probate.",
  "But -- but there is a textual basis for drawing a distinction between admiralty and law and equity. The Eleventh Amendment doesn't extend to -- to admiralty.",
  "Alden tells us what the understanding of the Founders was. Of course, it's the understanding of some of the Founders. It did not include those who were in the majority in Chisholm.",
  "May I ask you this? Supposing a State passed a statute that said that the following counties shall hereby be designated arms of the State and be entitled to immunity, period. Would that provide an adequate defense, do you think?",
  "May I ask this? Are you suggesting that a county could be an arm of the State for some purposes but not for others?",
  "Mr. Hart, may I ask this question? In the -- I noticed the opinion is a per curiam opinion of the Eleventh Circuit. Was the case argued orally in the Eleventh Circuit or was it submitted?",
  "It was submitted.",
  "May I ask this question? Would the case be any different if, instead of a tax credit, they offered a cash subsidy?",
  "May I ask you the same question I asked your adversary? Suppose, instead of a tax credit, they said, \"We'll pay for the construction cost of a building, or we'll give you a piece of real estate, in order to get you to come in. Part of big redevelopment progress\" --",
  "-- \"program, we would give you this parcel of real estate.\" Would that also be subject to the same analysis?",
  "No, they wouldn't be acting -- other than the one transaction, \"We'll give you one particular benefit in this new development progress -- project, with no further participation as a market participant or anything like that,\" that would -- it seems to me that would fit right into your analysis.",
  "But in terms of discrimination and economic impact, they really are the same?",
  "May I ask? I'm a little puzzled by the -- the questioning. Doesn't everyone agree that the predominant motive in all the districts was political? You agree to that, don't you?",
  "And you don't agree that that necessarily makes it valid, that that's necessarily a defense to section 2.",
  "And -- and the problem with section -- with district 23, under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, is not the motivation. It's the results that have changed. Isn't that correct?",
  "And the question under the district court's opinion is whether the political motive was an adequate defense to what would otherwise be a violation of section 2. Is that correct?",
  "Before you do that, may I just ask one short question?",
  "You've mainly attacked the plan as a whole in your briefs. And I'm wondering. I often look at particular districts, as you may know. Are there residents of districts 23, district 24 that are plaintiffs?",
  "But they're not identified easily --",
  "May I interrupt you just with one -- one question on district 23? Regardless of what the intent of the parties was, I'm just wondering why is the district court's finding on intent relevant to the section 2 issue when the test under section 2 is results?",
  "So that even if the intent was primarily political, it would still violate section 2.",
  "But may I ask, General Cruz, are you talking about replacing the court-ordered map or the preceding Democrat gerrymandered map?",
  "Yes, but you don't think it really perpetuated the same degree of gerrymandering that was present in the earlier map, do you?",
  "I'm asking you.",
  "Do you think it did? Do you think --",
  "-- the court-ordered map is just as bad as the Democratic map?",
  "But is your opponent correct in saying that in six of those districts, the Democrat won even though the district was majority Republican?",
  "Does that sound like a gerrymander?",
  "May I ask you this question? Assume you're correct that as a whole the plan is well-justified and makes gains and so forth. Does that necessarily mean that every district within the -- the plan is immune from constitutional attack?",
  "I understand.",
  "And the -- the next question I wanted to ask you is that if it is possible there can be a single-district challenge, what is the justification for the -- the cracking of district 24, which was a majority Democratic district before, into five different districts, none of which would elect a Democrat.",
  "But is it -- is it defended by anything other than political motivation?",
  "I mean in district 24.",
  "General Cruz, could I ask you another district-specific question? Because I want to get it on the table and let you explain it to me. Focusing on district 23 for a moment, assuming for the moment -- and I -- I know you probably disagree with this but -- that the results of the redrawing of district 23 violated section 2, would you say that it would be a defense to that violation that the motivation was actually non-racial but purely political?",
  "Not a defense. And the second question for me is that if there were a violation in district 23 of section 2, could it be cured by creating a district -- the district farther to the east. I forget the number. 25 I guess it was. Would that be a cure in your -- in your judgment?",
  "Given what the Court said in Shaw II.",
  "Right.",
  "Except for the fact the district court really didn't find a violation in section 2. They didn't quite, as I'm suggesting, say, well, given a violation on section 2, can we cure it and have a defense by what we do in -- in district 25. And I don't think De Grandy is an answer to that, and I'm not quite sure whether you said yes or no on my question.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "So the argument -- the question then would be whether district 25 is a wholly different area from district 23.",
  "But isn't that somewhat inconsistent with the decision to reshape the district? Why did they do it then?",
  "General Cruz, if you've finished your answer -- I didn't want to interrupt you, but that makes -- reminds me of a question I wanted to answer you because -- ask you, rather, because you make a very persuasive argument in your brief, which I found very helpful, that the -- a State should be able to correct a prior gerrymander by -- for -- with political motivations. I would like you to comment on this suggestion. Supposing we said they have an absolute right to do that with one caveat, that any new district has to be more compact -- no more -- no less compact than its predecessor, wouldn't that avoid all sorts of problems?",
  "We have -- we have quite a history, as you just identified in your response to Justice Kennedy, of being concerned about particularly grotesque shapes, and that's why they developed these tests of compactness for use in this very litigation. And the fact that the lawyers have come up with this approach to it makes me think maybe it does have some relevance to the whole problem we're trying to confront.",
  "When I -- when I was thinking about this problem, I looked at district 24. The thing that was interesting to me is that most of the neutral justifications that you describe -- and they're certainly in the -- in the five new districts that replaced it, but in the key part of the population that was moved, it becomes much less compact than it was before.",
  "Which it seems to me quite significant.",
  "And its particularly -- particular reference to the targeted group that was moved out of the district.",
  "I'm suggesting the challenge to 24 should be a political gerrymandering challenge.",
  "And that's the standard I'm suggesting. Right. That's exactly the point.",
  "Yes.",
  "No. I was suggesting that would be a safe harbor, and -- and it would just --",
  "General Cruz, why wouldn't it be a -- at least a helpful guide to what is reasonably compact to compare with the preceding district? Now, that fits 24 but not necessarily 25 I understand. Wouldn't that make -- make sense if the reasonable compactness is -- is one of the tests?",
  "I suppose if you have a plaintiff suing, it would be the one he lives in.",
  "May I ask you if you agree with General Cruz, that if the results of the 20 -- section -- district 23 violated section 2, it would not be a defense that was politically motivated?",
  "And would you also agree with the second question I asked as to whether if it were a violation -- I understand you don't think it was -- it would not be a defense that they were able to create a district -- a Hispanic district in another part of the State.",
  "Is that based on the premise that section -- that district 25 and district 23 are in the same part of the State?",
  "May I ask this question? I -- I guess in an awful lot of these cases there's a mixed motive: protection and enforcement. Is it your view that whenever there's a mixed motive, it becomes inadmissible?",
  "What do you have to say about the failure to inquire about Mike?",
  "I have one last question. How do you think Professor Wigmore would have decided this case?",
  "May I ask this, Mr. Fisher? What is your answer to Justice Scalia's hypothetical, an entirely volunteered affidavit by the accuser? Is that admissible or not?",
  "So that would be prohibited by the Confrontation Clause. Yet, that was clearly not an example that would fall within the Marian practice.",
  "I mean, it doesn't resemble it is what I'm saying.",
  "Mr. Fisher, let me again be sure I understand your position. Would the unsworn letter that Justice Scalia describes be admissible or inadmissible under your view?",
  "So then you don't rely on the affidavit point.",
  "I think the problem with the examples is that none of these are abuses. As I see it, the examples of the tape recording mailed in and the volunteer statement, I don't see how you can call those abuses.",
  "May I ask, under your view, was the affidavit admissible?",
  "Why not?",
  "I would suggest the reason it was not admissible is it's very clear that the affidavit is the testimonial statement by a witness that the defendant had a right to confront. The constitutional right is the right to confront the witnesses against him.",
  "Oh.",
  "But you say if the officer independently repeats what is said in the affidavit, then he's the witness against rather than the --",
  "Mr. Gornstein?",
  "Mr. Gornstein, is this a fair summary of your position, if I may? We're really asking who's the witness that's being testified against, and when it's the affidavit, it's clearly the woman that's a witness there where it's inadmissible. But your view, as I understand you, is when it's the officer who is the witness, he's subject to cross examination, and as long as the emergency continues and he's describing what happened during the emergency, he's still the witness. That's what you're saying, I think.",
  "He's still the witness we're concerned about.",
  "Therefore, he's subject to cross examination.",
  "And so during the emergency period, he can repeat what she said.",
  "I understand what you're saying.",
  "That we focus not on whether it's testimony but whether he's the witness at the critical time or whether she's the witness.",
  "But under your test, the whole question is whether the emergency continued at the time the witness' words are being repeated.",
  "No, I'm not arguing that. I'm trying to figure out -- I think I have a little different angle on it than you actually said in your brief or actually in the text of Crawford. Of course, Crawford wasn't confronting this problem. It described everything as testimonial, but the real question is who's the witness under the text of the Constitution.",
  "And I think your argument is --",
  "I think I'm trying to help you.",
  "I know it didn't start out that way, but it seems to me I'm helping your side of it. Yes.",
  "No, but you would agree that the officer could testify to some of the things that happened during the emergency, and he's a witness to that extent.",
  "And the question is whether he can cover this as well.",
  "But does the Givhan case fall within that?",
  "And you're suggesting --",
  "-- that a remark made internally could not provide the basis for discipline, but saying exactly the same thing publicly could. I mean -- or vice versa.",
  "Well, I'm assuming --",
  "-- a case in which it would be constitutionally protected. But you're saying if he -- but if he said the same thing to his boss directly internally, no protection. it's part of his job duties. And I would think --",
  "Which is a --",
  "-- rule that would sort of encourage people to go public rather than --",
  "-- exhaust their internal remedies.",
  "We'll hear argument in number 04-607, Laboratory Corporation of America against Metabolite Laboratories. Mr. Franklin, whenever you're ready, you may proceed.",
  "You're saying this patent, you really mean just claim 13, don't you?",
  "You may, Mr. Franklin. I think Mr. Hungar is next, Mr. Estrada.",
  "Mr. Hungar.",
  "What do you think about its validity under 101?",
  "I understand, but I didn't ask you what you said in your brief.",
  "To you read the the patent as -- talking about step 1, you can use any assay method you want. It doesn't have to be patented. But the correlation, step 2, that any time you ask a doctor to tell us what you think the results of the test mean, that that's an infringement?",
  "And is it possible that that can be patentable, in your view?",
  "If you just go to the doctor and ask for advice and he says, yes, I've looked at the results; you've got a vitamin B deficiency or whatever it is - -",
  "-- he's committed infringement under this patent as I understand it.",
  "It would raise the -- just do you think that that patent is valid? That's what I'm trying to ask you.",
  "I know all that. I'm just really interested in your view of the patent. That's what I'm trying to get to.",
  "Do you think there is a 101 problem too?",
  "So we do have a fairly long discussion by the lower court on the infringement issue. In order to find infringement, they had to construe correlation.",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hungar. Mr. Estrada, it's your turn now.",
  "No, but let me just interrupt. The -- as I understand it, the alleged infringers don't use the same novel process that you use in your assay, in other words, step 1. They do not use the step 1 in claim 13, is that correct?",
  "Well, assume it's not Abbott. Just say I come up with a novel method that's not covered by the patent that I can get the assay results. And say a doctor says, would you test the blood under your unpatented, novel method and tell me what the results are?",
  "And now if I do that and then the doctor looks at it and says I think you've got a vitamin B deficiency, has he infringed your patent?",
  "It was ordered for the purpose of letting the doctor know exactly what the assay would be. Yes.",
  "He hasn't - -",
  "Yes, a doctor asked me to perform under my -- my own method, step 1, which I do it and I give him the results and then he tells the patient, I think you've got a vitamin B deficiency, in that case, he has infringed, if I understand your argument.",
  "But you do agree, do you not, that step 2 by itself would not be patentable?",
  "Your point is that even though step 2 is performed as the second step of step 1 which is also not patentable, you get together for the patent?",
  "Would the case be different if they quoted section 101 in their appendix?",
  "And Wainwright against Sykes was even decided before AEDPA was passed, too.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Estrada. Mr. Franklin, I think you have about four and a half minutes left.",
  "Weren't 112 and 101 combined at that time?",
  "Do you disagree with that?",
  "I don't want to take up your time on rebuttal but I have to ask you, do you have an explanation for not quoting section 101 in your papers?",
  "Thank you. The case is submitted.",
  "May I ask this question, Mr. Verrilli?",
  "Can I -- can I ask you -- it goes back to the first point your opponent made. What is the purpose of granting the priority? It seems to me the purpose of the priority is to increase the likelihood that the wage claims will be paid. And if you -- if you win, it won't affect it one way or another, as you acknowledge in your brief. But it seems to me the priority should serve the purpose of increasing the likelihood that the benefits would actually flow to the employee benefit plan.",
  "Well, it talks about contributions to an employee benefit plan which one would not normally think of as paying insurance premiums.",
  "But if the payment of the premiums doesn't increase the likelihood that the employees will get the benefits, why should you get priority?",
  "To follow up on the earlier question of the Chief Justice, by whom do you understand the services have to be rendered within the meaning of the act?",
  "Does it refer to the -- the bankrupt's employees or your employees?",
  "You think it could be either.",
  "May I ask this --",
  "May I ask --",
  "-- this elementary --",
  "-- an elementary question, just to be sure we all agree on this? You do agree, do you not, that if, in 1997, Congress passed a statute that said you should get an extra $50 penalty for having come in, back in 1981, that would not be permissible?",
  "And --",
  "And there's sort of an irony in the fact that the actual consequence here is a great deal more serious.",
  "Yes.",
  "Which is constitutionally prohibited. But the consequences here are permitted. I understand the analysis. It's like just saying we take away one ground for staying that we didn't have before. But looking at it in kind of a basic sense, that seems -- it's a fairly serious thing --",
  "-- that happens, and it effects an awful lot of people, doesn't it?",
  "So, you would treat a State with a 2-day statute of limitations just like your State, with a 15-day statute.",
  "It was --",
  "-- available for 2 days, so that satisfies -- so, I suppose it would be okay for 6 hours, too.",
  "Would that apply to a prisoner who claimed he'd been raped by a guard or something, but was afraid to bring the proceeding, for 2 or 3 weeks, until the guard was transferred to another facility? And he alleged those facts, and then he was denied relief because it was over 15 days. Would that be --",
  "Well, those are --",
  "-- his allegations. These are just his allegations. And when that -- and they then said, \"No, it's -- you're out of time.\" Could a Federal Court take that case?",
  "No, he -- first he files a prisoner complaint, 17 days late, but makes the allegations I describe, and he's just denied because he's too late. Could a Federal Court take that case, under your view?",
  "And then he'd have to file a second -- subsequently file a 1983 case.",
  "So even --",
  "-- if it was seven --",
  "-- even after the 17th day, the Federal Court could hear a -- have a factual hearing.",
  "He's just alleged it isn't -- in -- and the only -- the only response from the State is, \"You're 2 days late.\" That's all -- that's all the State has said.",
  "Let me be sure --",
  "-- I understand one thing about your position. You do agree, do you not, that in order to exhaust, even if the time has run the 15-day period, there is an obligation to go to the State and ask them to hear the case, even though it's untimely?",
  "So that you do say that you at least will give the State the opportunity to decide whether it wants to try and remedy it in an informal or hasty manner.",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Rovelli, I -- I forget. How big a class of -- of prisoners are we talking about?",
  "Less than 40? And does the record tell us how long they have been in level 2?",
  "But is there any average or any -- is there -- does the record tell us how -- how long most of them have been there?",
  "Does that mean that 75 percent had not?",
  "And how long -- do we know what the average period of incarceration in level 2 is? Is it a matter of weeks, or is it a matter of years?",
  "I'm trying to understand whether typically they're there for a long period of time on the one hand, or are they there sort of on probation and are periodically reviewed and moved into another system?",
  "I see.",
  "Mr. Marcus, I was kind of interested in your calling this an incentive program. Is there any -- there are no intermediate stages. It's an all-or-nothing incentive, isn't it?",
  "No, I mean, with respect to the prisoners in this population.",
  "Well, I didn't understand that the -- the prisoners in this particular part of the prison had any intermediate incentive. They either get out after a year or 2 or they don't. Isn't that right? I mean, they either get to a different classification.",
  "There's no scoring. You've got 25 points now, so you're pretty close to your goal or anything like -- it's not --",
  "-- not like most incentive programs I've heard about.",
  "And -- and does the review correlate it in any way with these particular deprivations? I mean, what is the review -- how does the review correlate with their inability to get reading materials?",
  "Is there any evidence at all that the amount of reading that they do has any correlation to their opportunity for getting better assignments?",
  "Yes. That there's any correlation whatsoever between how much these people -- these prisoners read and when they get into the next level of the prison.",
  "So the legal issues would be precisely the same if the State denied totally any reading material to the prisoners. We'd have the same issue.",
  "Why would it be more difficult?",
  "I understood your argument to, in effect, contend that the behavior modification rationale will justify the program no matter what the balancing process is.",
  "May I ask you --",
  "May I ask you this question?",
  "You said that the prison grapevine really doesn't tell the prisoners about this particular lack of access to public materials. Does the prison grapevine let them know that they're going to be in the cell for 23 hours a day and only be out 1 hour a day?",
  "If that is generally known, it would seem to me that that itself would be sufficient incentive to try and avoid this program, whether or not you're going to be able to read the Christian Science Monitor or the New York Times. It seems to me that the -- the -- what we're fighting about is trivial compared to the very obvious deterrent value of 23 hours in the same cell 7 days a week, 30 days a month, 365 days a year. I don't think I'd care about this other stuff.",
  "Just let me just ask one -- one thing I am curious about. The argument -- it seems to me that there's kind of a flow of these. Some of them get out of this system and some stay a long time. What does the record tell us about how often, if they conform to the regular rules without any violation for 40 days or a year, do they -- do they get out of this -- this situation?",
  "I'm not posing what the rules say. Does the record tell us whether -- you know, whether this system is just something we're talking about or whether it really has an effect on people moving from this classification to another classification.",
  "Well, but this is a little more focused than that, I think. There's only one competitor here, isn't there?",
  "But do you think it's fair held that every competitor of anybody who cheats on his taxes has a RICO claim? was that if the plaintiff pleads that they were a direct target -- and here, other competitors in the market like Colonial, Alimar, Friedel, and Easton Steel, could plead exactly the same thing that they, in fact, were the direct target. And under the Second Circuit's test, that would be sufficient to override a motion to dismiss and proceed the parties into protracted discovery. And what the Court in Associated General Contracting and in Holmes made clear was that the courts were not designed to be the forums for this kind of long, arduous fact-finding mission in order to determine whether or not indirect injuries should be compensable with treble damages under the RICO statute.",
  "May I ask this? I assume you would agree that if the defendant had -- had hired competitor would have a cause of action.",
  "And what if they -- what if they somehow or other fraudulently persuaded the revenue agents of the State to impose higher taxes and penalties on the competitor?",
  "So you think there would be recovery in that scenario.",
  "Of course, you are claiming a different amount of damages, entirely different.",
  "But I'd like to ask you supposing there were two competitors in the market instead of just the one --",
  "-- and they did it just to get at -- at the competitor A and didn't care about B, but B suffered exactly the same harm, would B have a cause of action?",
  "Well, he has exactly the same causation as A, but he just didn't happen to be a target in the -- in the mind of the defendant. Would he -- would be yes. Where I believe --",
  "And it'd be true if there",
  "Why?",
  "I imagine the damages would be less, but why would it be any different analytically?",
  "And then change it one other way. Say, instead of defrauding New York, they defrauded the landlord and -- and got a rent-free office space, and that cut down their costs. Would the competitors have a cause of action then?",
  "Yes, it did.",
  "They're sending out thugs to beat them up or something like that. would be yes. And if you look at -- if you look at the competitor cases, what I call the competitor cases, there's a very discrete body of law we're talking about. They're cited in our brief. There's fewer than a dozen cases around the country from the circuit and district courts. And what they show is that there's only three ways you -- there's only several ways you can do this. You can -- you can make a misrepresentation to a regulator or to a customer. We have those cases. You can bribe a customer or a regulator, or you can engage in violence directed at a -- at a regulator or at a customer. There's only three variations.",
  "We'll hear argument in number 05-184, Hamdan against Rumsfeld. Mr. Katyal, you may proceed.",
  "Mr. Katyal, will you help me? Where is the conspiracy charge in the papers?",
  "Okay, thank you very much.",
  "May I ask this question about the charge? The charge is not just conspiracy in the abstract, it's conspiracy to do specific things, one of which is attacking civilians and civilian objects. And is it clear that the commission would not have -- a military commission would not have jurisdiction to try a conspiracy to armed civilians in a war zone, for example?",
  "May I ask --",
  "-- this question? Supposing the charge had been slightly amended. Instead of saying, \"The criminal purpose, and conspired and agreed with Osama bin Laden to commit the following offenses,\" it said, \"It and Osama bin Laden attempted to -- aided and abetted in committing the following offenses.\" Would it then be -- violate the laws of war?",
  "Well, the specific offenses are attacking civilians and attacking civilian objects.",
  "And then --",
  "-- what if the trial judge who looked at the indictment or ruling on a motion to dismiss the indictment, or its equivalent at this time -- said, \"Well, I'm going to construe these words 'conspired or agreed' as the substantial equivalent of 'aiding and abetting.'\" Would that let the charge stand?",
  "But the language is \"conspired and agreed with.\" And \"agreed with\" is pretty close to \"tried to do it himself.\"",
  "Yes, you certainly may. General Clement.",
  "But let me just ask this question, Mr. Clement. What sources of law have the commissions generally enforced over the years, beginning with George Washington and so forth? Just Army regulations or American law or foreign law? What are the basic sources of law that they can enforce?",
  "And what we have here is enforcement of the laws of war.",
  "If -- just one hypothetical. Assume that the laws of war do not prohibit conspiracy. Just assume -- I know you disagree with that. Could the President, by his action, add conspiracy as a triable offense by a commission?",
  "Well, if --",
  "It's easy if it is a war crime. I'm trying to wrestle with the question of, if we concluded that it were not, and just -- and I'm asking -- can the question add an additional crime that the commission could try?",
  "You think he could.",
  "So, the basic position you're asserting is that we have -- that the -- this commission intends to try a violation of the laws of war. And do the laws of war then have any application to the procedures that they have to follow?",
  "But, Mr. Clement --",
  "-- if you assume that the laws of war apply, and perhaps the treaty applies, isn't the issue whether this is a \"group of people,\" on the one hand, or a \"regularly constituted court,\" on the other?",
  "Well, they argue very strenuously that this is really just a \"group of people\" --",
  "-- because it's not a \"regularly constituted court\" within the meaning of the treaty.",
  "Yes.",
  "May I ask --",
  "May I just ask this, just to clarify? When they do take away some jurisdiction of some habeas corpus claims, do you defend that, in part, as a permissible exercise of the power to suspend the writ, or do you say it is not a suspension of the writ?",
  "It can't be both.",
  "Well, that --",
  "-- that's your position, they did not suspend the writ. You're not arguing that it's a justifiable suspension of the writ.",
  "Okay.",
  "And there was a footnote dicta.",
  "But I don't --",
  "-- think, Mr. Clement, the 200 years have approved of his adding additional crimes under the law of war. I mean, he has never -- I don't think we have ever held that the President can make something a crime which was not already a crime under the law of war.",
  "Yes.",
  "And one --",
  "-- of the issues is whether he's done that here --",
  "-- I think.",
  "If you're right on that, you're right on the ultimate question, too.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Katyal.",
  "I don't want to --",
  "I don't want to take up from your time, but have you read the footnote that the -- Mr. Clement relies on very heavily?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted. [Whereupon, at 12:31 p.m., the case in the",
  "Well, are you -- do you contend it's always applied first to the medical damages? In other words, supposing there was -- instead of the $750,000 settlement, it had been $100,000 here. $75,000 was medical, and they had a lot of substantial other claims, pain, suffering, loss of earnings, and so forth. Would you always get your full amount if -- if the amount of the settlement is over the amount of the medical expense?",
  "You think that's the equitable rule.",
  "That's equitable in your view? What?",
  "You think that's the equitable rule.",
  "And some do, but some do not I think.",
  "Well, it does obligate immediate notification to the defendant, doesn't it?",
  "Well, but there are two different without delay points: one, when you tell the -- the defendant; and secondly, whether or not he wants the consulate notified, and there's the second delay.",
  "A little while ago you were asked about the judge asking whether or not to ask the defendant if the advice was given him. And the suggestion was made there's no duty on the State judge to enforce a Federal treaty, but if it's a matter of Federal law, why wouldn't it be a duty to -- on the judge to obey Federal law if -- if it is part of our Federal requirement?",
  "You know, one thing I find difficulty understanding in this case is I just can't understand how a lawyer thought it would be to his client's advantage not to consul -- not to tell the consul because the facts are quite persuasive that he really was severely prejudiced by the fact he didn't get all the help he could have gotten.",
  "How -- how could he make such a judgment? I just don't understand it. You know --",
  "Because the prejudice is just stark in -- in this case. It just stands out and -- and you just wonder what was going on here.",
  "Of course, that might be likely if there had been a history of these claims being successful, but none has ever prevailed. So I doubt if that would be very -- very good to figure you can, you know, save your -- your key argument that has no precedent of winning.",
  "But it denies the right subject to being a damage remedy that's available.",
  "Is it always -- is it always going to be irreparable injury if the patentee always gets fairly compensated?",
  "So if there are some cases when he gets fairly compensated and some he does not, why should you say it's always irreparable injury?",
  "Is that usually will be",
  "Mr. Waxman, could you help me with something I just realized I have no conception of here? What kind of -- what do these injunctions say? Do they just say don't infringe patent '265 anymore, or do they give a list of things you cannot do and a list of articles you cannot make and so forth?",
  "May I ask this?",
  "One -- one short question. Is the draft of the injunction that you want in the record?",
  "May I ask you this hypothetical? Supposing people like to work the forklift, but nobody had a -- a right to do it, but they traded every day or something like that, and the company put out a notice that said anybody who -- who files a claim will not be eligible to ride on the forklift ever again.",
  "That would be a violation?",
  "So anytime there's an advance notice that you will -- there will be some kind of action in response to a -- a claim, that would be retaliation.",
  "Even though it was not an adverse job action.",
  "Even though it did not amount to -- did not have any economic effect on the employee.",
  "So a quid pro quo violation does not have to be an adverse employment action.",
  "It seems to me that -- that interpretation requires you to interpret 703 and 704 differently.",
  "Could you -- could you clarify one thing for me? I just want to be sure I have it in mind correctly. Is it correct that the firearm has to be an operable firearm?",
  "But is -- just again, I'm not trying to find out the answer to what happened here, but just as a matter of what the law provides. Is it conceivable that a -- a gun which was not operable could nevertheless be a deadly weapon because it can be used as a club?",
  "It could be.",
  "Ms. Millett, can I ask you this one question? Would there ever be a case where it was not harmless error when the judge makes the finding? Isn't it -- wouldn't it be reasonable for the appellate court to assume, well, if the judge made the finding, it's probably supported by the evidence and presumably the jury would have come out the same way?",
  "But there might be a rare case, but in about 95 percent of the cases, wouldn't it be true that the fact the judge made the finding is pretty good evidence that the jury would have made the same finding?",
  "Mr. Link, will you just -- maybe I -- I should know this, but the information charges an assault in the second degree using the deadly weapon. If they had charged use of a firearm rather than a deadly weapon, what would the crime have been? Would that also have been assault in the second degree?",
  "The firearm enhancement itself would not covert it from second degree to first degree.",
  "May I just clarify one other thing? Capacity to fire doesn't mean it had to be loaded, though.",
  "An unloaded gun could be a firearm.",
  "But then we'd have Justice Scalia's case if this information left out the words, to wit, a handgun.",
  "How do you reconcile your position with the right to self-representation, if somebody doesn't want a lawyer at all? And I guess if the judge insists on him taking a lawyer, that could be reversible error.",
  "Is even a greater right than the right to pick your own lawyer.",
  "Why doesn't the choice of counsel protect autonomy too?",
  "You have a lawyer. After 30 years, you trust him completely. You want him to represent you. Isn't that a -- an element of autonomy?",
  "Yes, but isn't it almost essential, in one of these inquiries, to -- to invade the attorney-client privilege over and over again to find out what they might have done with a different lawyer?",
  "But, Mr. Dreeben, I think you're underestimating the importance of the autonomy interest because going through a criminal trial for a defendant is a very traumatic experience, not just what happens in the courtroom, but during the entire process. He has a lawyer of his own choice who's going to advise him on what he should do and how he should react to possible changes in his own condition and everything else. The -- the autonomy interest is powerful in that situation.",
  "Totally independently of the trial strategy --",
  "That's right.",
  "Well, Mr. Dreeben, do you agree with his characterization that all the courts of appeals go the other way?",
  "Do you think the right includes any costs other than statutory costs, any expenses?",
  "How do you explain the reference to expenses on page 4 of the red brief which quotes from the -- a section of the statute authorizing a report to be made, a report authorized under? They shall include data about the specific amount of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses. Why do you suppose they put the word expenses in?",
  "Right.",
  "So the expenses must be something other than attorneys' fees or costs.",
  "Right.",
  "Isn't it true that the provision I referred to refers to the specific amount of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party? So it's definitely referring to expenses incurred by the -- by the plaintiff. Isn't that true?",
  "Yes.",
  "So you're saying the word expenses should refer only to expenses incurred by counsel, which of course would be normally reimbursable.",
  "There's no doubt that the best evidence is the text of the statute, but at least the people who drafted this, even if they were not the conferees themselves but were just staff members, they apparently thought the language was subject to that reading.",
  "Which would mean it would be ambiguous, wouldn't it?",
  "The rule that you refer to that you cannot look at legislative history -- of course, we always start with the plain language. That's clear. But the rule that you cannot look at legislative history didn't really get any emphasis till after 1987, and this statute was enacted in 1986.",
  "I thought it was a joint explanatory statement.",
  "How do you explain the title, Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of the Conference? Doesn't that speak for both the House and the Senate?",
  "Can you cite an example of a conference report that was voted on by the Congress?",
  "Language in the statute but not in the conference report.",
  "Was there a conference report in --",
  "And would you agree, if the statute is ambiguous, you can look at the conference report?",
  "Would you answer my question?",
  "And why is it not ambiguous if the author of the conference report read it that way?",
  "But isn't it true that at the time they did that, it was well settled in cases of this kind that the Court would look at the conference report to ascertain the meaning of the statute? At that time, in 1986.",
  "Was there any case that said you can't look at the conference report at that time?",
  "-- later.",
  "Is the best evidence, but not the sole evidence.",
  "Counsel, I'm puzzled about one thing. I just -- maybe it's just my stupidity. But assume he thought it was a Martian, and assume he thought -- does he have to think it was wrong to kill Martians? Or supposing he thinks it is not wrong to kill Martians, then what do you do? Does it matter whether he thinks it's right or wrong to kill Martians, in other words?",
  "I'm not sure I understand the answer. I -- that -- is it -- does he -- let me put it this way, and maybe you can answer yes or no.",
  "Does he have to think it's wrong to kill Martians?",
  "The thing that troubles me, just to -- and then you can comment on it -- I'm assuming it's possible they thought he didn't know whether it was a Martian or not, and that he thought he had a mission in life to kill Martians, that they're enemies, they're bad to come, and he wants to kill 'em. If that was the -- what the trial court found, could he be put to death for that killing?",
  "Or could he just be found guilty of murder, or whatever, on those facts?",
  "No, but there's a --",
  "-- difference in the burden of proof. He has the burden of proof to get the affirmative defense or to get the -- in that category.",
  "And I'm just wondering if he's -- just raises a doubt as -- so there's not proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew the person he was killing was either a human being or an -- a kind of individual that it would be wrong to kill.",
  "If there's just a reasonable doubt on the issue --",
  "-- would he be guilty, or not?",
  "But, as you say, it's -- in a way, it's -- in a sense, it comes in through the back door, as you say, but, even coming in through the back door, if it raises a reasonable doubt as to his intent to kill a -- make a wrongful killing, why shouldn't it be admissible?",
  "May I ask --",
  "-- this question? Supposing the evidence is equally divided on the question of whether he thought it was a Martian who he had a right to kill. Could he be convicted of murder, constitutionally?",
  "Because then --",
  "-- there would be --",
  "-- not proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew he was killing a human being, and it was wrong to do so.",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't -- I'm just wondering, as a constitutional matter, forgetting all the -- as a constitutional matter, can a man be convicted of murder if the evidence is equally balanced on the question of whether he knew it -- he did anything wrong and -- or knew that he was killing a human being?",
  "Mr. Frederick, can I ask you a question?",
  "Let me ask you one preliminary question just to be sure I understand the case. Is it your view -- when the petition for removal was filed, did the district -- Federal district court have jurisdiction to decide the preemption issue in your view?",
  "All right.",
  "So the -- there -- there was jurisdiction in the Federal court to entertain the removed case.",
  "Then -- then why -- then how can you say the -- the remand was based on a lack of -- of jurisdiction?",
  "Well, but they -- they had held it acting on an interpretation of SLUSA before our decision in Dabit.",
  "And isn't it at least possible that they would -- would have decided that issue had they reviewed --",
  "Could we just -- can I ask you suppose they didn't waive it? Would their -- would their position have any merit?",
  "Let me put the question just a little differently. Suppose the -- in Dabit, we decided that the distinction between the purchaser- seller rule and the scope of 10b-5 did not prevent SLUSA from preempting. But does SLUSA preempt a claim that is beyond the scope of rule 10b-5?",
  "May I ask this question? Because I hadn't, frankly, realized the importance you attach to the Missouri Pacific case. And the way you describe it as saying that the -- the State court cannot be held to have decided against a Federal right -- well, anyway, the -- the point is there are two things that are decided by the Federal court when it remands a case. One, there was no preemption, and two, therefore, there shall be a removal. Now, as I understood the principle underlying that case, the -- the correctness of the remand could not be reviewed. That's litigated. But could not the correctness of the reason given for the remand, namely there was no preemption, be removed by us on certiorari?",
  "Under their theory, but it seems to me very strange to say that we could not, when we do get the case on a petition for certiorari -- couldn't review whether it was -- whether it was in fact preemption.",
  "May I ask you one question, Mr. Frederick? Because it's important to me. Would you agree that a complaint that alleged that the defendant negligently used or employed manipulative devices and so forth would be covered by SLUSA -- would preempt it?",
  "So the mere fact that it's negligently caused would not preclude preclusion.",
  "But I'm a little puzzled. If the noise is the cause of their being there and if the noise is so loud at 3:00 in the morning that it's still continuing and nobody can hear the knock on the door -- they knock on the door several times and shout -- would they not have the right to go in then to quell the noise?",
  "So if you're going to rely on the safety and the -- safety and the danger of harm, how serious does the harm have to be? And I use the word harm as defining the -- the threshold for this kind of entry. What if a father was spanking his child, for example?",
  "Let me just ask this one question, if I may, if you have -- did the other side preserve the right to challenge this entry under the Utah constitution?",
  "Well, why? What if they're just so loud that it's perfectly obvious they're keeping -- getting -- the neighbors are awake and disturbed by it. Does it have to be a threat of violence?",
  "So then it doesn't matter what's being said.",
  "It may determine what is necessary to prevent harm, but what if it's not necessary to prevent harm, just necessary to prevent noise?",
  "It seems to me the harm inquiry in this case is, you know, sort of superfluous. We don't even have to look at that.",
  "Yes, but we've got a case in which knocking on the -- the noise is so loud nobody can hear the knock.",
  "And they did knock on the door, yes.",
  "May I ask? I don't think the charges are in the record. At least I missed them. They were charged with -- what are the charges and how -- what were the penalty for what the defendants were exposed to? There's been no trial. They -- they suppressed the evidence. I suppose the proceedings were dismissed, were they?",
  "What are the penalties for those charges?",
  "That's the major matter we're resolving today.",
  "Yes, but among the evidence they did have were the two -- two teenagers are drinking beer in the backyard. So they pretty clearly had the alcohol -- they could have gotten that in evidence.",
  "This wasn't kind of constructed as a test case, by any chance, was it?",
  "Don't you think the evidence that was available without going in the house would have supported all those charges?",
  "But two teenagers in the backyard were intoxicated.",
  "Oh, they charge that the adults were intoxicated.",
  "Well, that's a serious crime in Utah I guess.",
  "And what's your response?",
  "May I just ask --",
  "-- this question and kind of cut through -- is it a correct interpretation of the instructions, as a whole, to say, in effect, \"If you find the aggravating and mitigating circumstances are equally balanced, you shall impose the death sentence\"?",
  "General Kline, can I ask you this question? Supposing the law was that you're supposed to be instructed that, \"Unless the mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors, the sentence shall be death.\" Would that be permissible?",
  "Well, what about my hypothetical?",
  "Would it --",
  "Would it be constitutional or unconstitutional?",
  "In your view.",
  "I know it approaches the problem. I'm wondering if it gets there.",
  "May I ask you --",
  "-- this question?",
  "Suppose the jurors are deadlocked, six to six, and you're not -- you don't know, maybe some are a little stronger there, but there's a deadlock. And what if the judge told them, \"Well, in the event of a deadlock, you resolve it by flipping a coin.\" Would that be constitutional?",
  "You mentioned the --",
  "-- Kansas Legislature. Has there been any suggestion the statute ought to be amended to get rid of this silly little problem?",
  "I don't mean to call it --",
  "-- silly little problem, but --",
  "-- the very narrow --",
  "Do you think there's any constitutional difficulty with the preemption provision in this statute?",
  "You can make a contract preempt State law. Is there any precedent for that?",
  "You don't have Boyle for that.",
  "I didn't think Boyle went that far.",
  "May -- may I ask this? Because I think your example overlooks the fact that at least your opponent claims that the Blue Cross contract provision would preempt the New York law that denies your client recovery for health benefits.",
  "I think that would be their answer to your example.",
  "Well, if we -- if we think Congress can provide that a contract provision would preempt a State law, it seems to me the example you've given is the precise example that that statute was intended to cover.",
  "But if -- if it does, it would eliminate the lack of uniformity on which you rely.",
  "No, but it affects the amount that your client can recover. And they would say that they -- because it assumes an absence of -- it assumes a payment by the carrier, and under -- I -- I think they would take the position that they have, in fact, the -- they have not, in fact, paid that insurance cost.",
  "I'm not stating it very well, but I --",
  "No. But the defendant would say, we don't have to pay those damages because they're covered by insurance. And the response would be, well, they're not -- they -- they are only covered by insurance if they can be reimbursed. I don't want to take up too much of your time on this.",
  "Yes, but this is a claim for $150,000 out of a settlement of $3 million or $4 million.",
  "What was your defense on the merits?",
  "Yes.",
  "May I ask, if -- if you know, whether Congress has ever been asked to address this precise issue that we're debating today?",
  "How does self-defense fit into this equation?",
  "Why is the number of decisions -- number of States that have gone one way or -- or the other on the issue relevant? If it's not an Eighth Amendment question - -",
  "Well, why not? Isn't it realistic to assume that Congress looked at the state of the law at the time it's passing a statute and presumably adopted what was the prevailing view?",
  "Well, a consensus view. It would still be the time of the enactment of the statute is what would be relevant, I would think.",
  "Mr. Gornstein, there are some old cases that draw a distinction between justifications and excuses. And you carefully use the words excuse to describe that defense. Did you do so having in mind that distinction or just as a loose description of the -- of the defense?",
  "Can I just clarify one thing for myself? Do I correctly understand that the Federal district court -- I'm not talking about the State court -- did not rule on the merits of your claim, but merely held that 1983 is not the proper method of pursuing the claim?",
  "So that there hasn't been a decision by a Federal judge on whether or not there's merit to your case.",
  "It's just a question of which -- whether you do it by way of habeas corpus or by 1983.",
  "And I suppose it's entirely possible that if the judge then decided it is really -- if we said it should have been a 1983 action, the judge could say, well, okay, even under 1983 the State has the defense of laches and you still lose. I mean, you -- we don't know what's going to happen if we find out -- if we agree with what your argument in this Court is. Is that right?",
  "But isn't there evidence in -- I noticed the brief filed by some veterinarians call our attention to the statute that prohibits the euthanasia of dogs and cats unless they follow a certain procedure. So there must have been a legislative feeling that unless that procedure were followed, there's a risk of undue pain to the dogs and cats. Why isn't there a similar basis for believing that if you don't follow a similar procedure that such a risk might be present for human beings?",
  "And what's your response to it?",
  "But your procedure, if I understand it, would be prohibited to be applied to dogs or cats.",
  "Well, at least it was sufficiently convincing to get the Florida legislature to pass a statute.",
  "Except -- let me just interrupt. Supposing he did identify, say you can only use pentobarbital on me, the same way they do it for a veterinarian. And the -- and the judge says, well, I don't think that's required. But he would then be satisfied the 1983 requirement?",
  "Of saying no.",
  "But do you agree if he had said I propose alternative X, even though it's highly unlikely the State will accept it, that would make it a 1983 action?",
  "Even though there's no functional difference in terms of future litigation between that case and this.",
  "Well, is that correct? I thought in most States, there had to be a statute that authorizes a non-knock warrant.",
  "And that most States do have such statutes. And we had this case because Michigan chooses to go on -- on a separate path.",
  "May I ask this question? As I understand it, the prosecutor conceded a violation of the knock and announce rule.",
  "And I'm just wondering. In Michigan, since there's no adverse effect to it, do the prosecutors routinely concede that there's a violation because there's no point in litigating it I suppose?",
  "So that if the issue arises, you can assume the prosecutor will always say, yes, we'll assume there was a violation. There would be no reason not to assume that.",
  "So you'll never really litigate in Michigan how far they can go before they violate the rule.",
  "But, nevertheless, was not there a finding that there was probable cause that there was a gun there?",
  "All right.",
  "May I ask this?",
  "May I ask this question about the practice in Michigan? Since People against Stevens and People against Vasquez have been decided, are there any cases, other than this one, in which a prosecutor has raised the knock and announce argument that got litigated all the way to the appellate court?",
  "So but there really is no incentive for the prosecutor to fight -- argue about this anymore in Michigan, is there?",
  "Well, it concedes there's a violation.",
  "So there's no point in litigating it.",
  "So it's a functional equivalent of conceding a violation in every case because there's simply no effective remedy.",
  "No effective remedy in the litigation itself.",
  "Of course, there's always the possibility that the officer will be disciplined by his very zealous superior, I guess.",
  "But why would you bother making the argument? The evidence can't be suppressed. I don't understand why -- why would there ever be any litigation over this issue in a criminal case?",
  "And can you cite me any other example of a -- a violation of the Fourth Amendment? Maybe we shouldn't have held it's a violation. I understand that argument. Is there any other area of Fourth Amendment law in which the violation of the Fourth Amendment is not followed by a suppression ruling?",
  "It seems to me that your example it's -- stomping up the stairs is like failing to knock and announce.",
  "And so there should be a deterrent for the stomping up the stairs, and you've got no deterrent for the knock and announce.",
  "Mr. Salmons, may I ask you this -- this question? If you'd been the prosecutor in this case and you had -- knew that the evidence would be suppressed if there were a constitutional violation, would you have conceded that there was a constitutional violation in this case?",
  "Yes or no.",
  "So you would not have conceded.",
  "But you would not have conceded. If you -- if you thought there was a reasonable argument, you would not have conceded that there was a violation, would you?",
  "Mr. Johnson, would you comment on the footnote on the -- on the -- drawing the distinction with regard to the dance contest that the defendant won in that case, between -- it's over here; I'm asking the question -- between facts that occurred before the crime and facts that might have occurred after.",
  "May I ask you about that? This case is unusual, because it has that separate instruction that, \"The mitigating circumstances are merely examples, and you should pay careful attention to those, but you may -- but you may rely on other mitigating circumstances.\" May I ask you, would it have been constitutional if the judge had added a sentence at the end of that instruction which said, \"However, you may not consider anything mitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of the crime\"?",
  "I'm not sure you've answered my question. Would it have been a constitutional addition to that instruction to say, \"But I want to -- you to clearly understand that it is not to be considered mitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of the crime\"? Would that have been permissible?",
  "Because that would have foreclosed consideration of the Skipper-type evidence, right?",
  "So, then the question in this case is whether the jury might have understood factor (k) to limit them to the consideration of factors that extenuate the gravity of the crime.",
  "General Johnson, I don't mean to interrupt you, but I want to be sure you answered your -- you stick to your answer on -- to my question, earlier, --",
  "-- because you -- I think you changed your answer after Justice -- the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia suggested you might have made a mistake. Are you -- is it your position that it would be constitutional to instruct the jury that, \"You may not consider any evidence mitigating, unless it extenuates the gravity of the crime\"?",
  "Is - -",
  "-- that answer consistent with the position of defense counsel, who said he would not insult the intelligence of the jury by suggesting to them that the religious conversion of the defendant did not extenuate the gravity of the crime?",
  "That's right.",
  "If that were true would that have extenuated the gravity of the crime, if he could get along in prison?",
  "And you think juries would clearly understand that what he did in the future in prison would extenuate the gravity of the crime.",
  "It's on 166 of the joint appendix.",
  "But you - -",
  "-- make the concession, as I understand it, because it's a Federal felony, not because it's a State felony - -",
  "-- isn't that right? Yes.",
  "But are you saying it would also include State trafficking offense, because it's described in the word \"trafficking\"?",
  "May I - -",
  "-- ask this question? It's - - presuming -- supposing we say it's not moot, and you prevail. Could he be resentenced without being present in court?",
  "Yes. We have a case in which we're assuming, for our purposes, we just have possession. I mean, I understand the facts of this case. And I wanted to ask -- I have two questions, Mr. Kneedler. One of them -- the second one, I'd ask that -- you were going to mention three different points, one about conviction; you had two other points you didn't get to. I want to learn what those were. But, before that, it seems to me that, when you put the whole statute -- all the -- all the different statutory provisions together, you really boil down and focus on 924(c)(2) and the words \"for purpose of this subsection, the term 'drug-trafficking crime' means any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\" And if the word \"Federal\" had been inserted before the word \"felony\" in the statute, would that not make the statute perfectly clear?",
  "It was a question of - -",
  "-- whether the change was intended to be --",
  "-- substantive - -",
  "-- or merely - -",
  "-- stylistic.",
  "Just again, Mr. Kneedler - - focusing again on that specific language, you're saying, in effect, that that phrase means any State or Federal felony punishable under the Federal statutes.",
  "And is it ever true that a State felony is punishable under a Federal statute?",
  "Yes, I know, but - -",

  "But you do agree - -",
  "-- that the key to the case is how we read that one sentence.",
  "But is - -",
  "-- that a reasonable -- let's say the statute's ambiguous, and you've convinced us there's no constitutional requirement of uniformity. But is it reasonable to assume that Congress would want the different consequences to depend on the State of conviction?",
  "Is there anything in the legislative history suggesting that?",
  "Mr. Kester, may I ask you this question? Is it your view that Gen-Probe represented a change in the law?",
  "Were there -- before Gen-Probe was decided, were there any cases, like this case, that were decided?",

  "-- force?",
  "Ms. Mahoney, can I ask this question? Supposing at the time they negotiate the license agreement there's some uncertainty about whether the patent is valid or not. So, at the end of the license agreement -- they agree on the royalties, the term, and the -- everything it covers, but they put in a provision and say, \"We're not entirely sure the patent is valid, so we reserve the right to bring an action challenging the validity of the patent. We will pay royalties in the meantime, and the -- you will accept these royalties as sufficient for the use of the patent, that, if we win, you don't have to pay royals, if we lose, you do.\" Would that be a valid provision?",

  "Ms. Mahoney, can I ask you one question before your light goes off? I know it's not - - goes to the \"case or controversy\" issue, but, in your view, was the bringing of this action a material breach of an implied condition of the contract that would justify a termination of a license?",

  "There would be some in dispute.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Joseffer. Mr. Lamken, as I understand it, you have about 11 minutes left. You don't have to use them all.",
  "Mr. Lamken, have you had any second thoughts about your position that it's the order, rather than the issue letter, that we should look at?",
  "May I suggest - -",

  "Mr. Fisher, may I ask you this question? In your view, did the regulations create a legally enforceable obligation?",
  "And where may that obligation be enforced?",
  "By means of a private action before the FCC?",
  "Where the carrier -- where they would file a complaint saying you owe us X dollars, and the agency could order them to pay X dollars.",
  "And is the obligation enforceable in State court?",
  "I understand that. I'm curious to know what your view is.",
  "Mr. Fisher, can I go back to the first question I asked you? Would the FCC have had authority to create an administrative remedy that had a fee shifting provision in it?",
  "It could certainly impose penalties of some kind.",
  "Let me just be sure I understand your argument on 208. You're saying that 208, like the earlier provision of the statute, requires a violation of the statute, not just regulations, in order for there to be an administrative remedy.",
  "So the same statutory requirement for the remedy that your opponent challenges is the one he acknowledges is available.",
  "Let me just ask this. Is it the same with respect to fee-shifting?",
  "Is your position -- I want to be sure I understand you. Your position on the two different questions that the Chief asked you is, they get deference on question one. And with respect to question two, it follows from the plain text of the statute.",
  "What -- sorry, go ahead.",
  "Mr. Phillips, may I ask you this question. Assuming you're right on the doctrine of equivalence and you're wrong on proximate cause, for the moment. Now, you said earlier in your argument, it is perfectly clear there was no harmless error here.",
  "It seemed to me that a possible interpretation of the record -- and I'd like you to comment of the record -- is that the jury either believed the one -- one truck driver or the other. And that the direct causation thing really didn't have an impact on the calculation of damages. And I was going to ask you to comment on that and to tell me whether during the argument of the case before the jury, did the plaintiff's lawyer argue, in effect, that he had -- the railroad has a much heavier burden of proving a causation than we do?",
  "Let me ask you this question, if I may. Perhaps I should have asked Mr. Phillips. Is there such an animal as the doctrine of equivalence? I understand the restatement describes what the plaintiff's burden is on proving causation, and then it says the same rules apply to defendant's contributory negligence. But that doesn't sound to me like any overriding doctrine of equivalence. It just says when they wrote the restatement, the rules were the same. Is there such a thing as the doctrine of equivalence?",
  "Beyond that, if the plaintiff's negligence was in whole the cause of the action, then the -- there was no reason to get to comparative negligence or contributory negligence, because by hypothesis, there would have been no negligence by the defendant.",
  "I suppose employees have been under the rule for a long time.",
  "Let me ask this one very brief question, Mr. Chief Justice. In your view, would the doctrine of equivalence be satisfied if we simply directed that the word directly be omitted from the instruction 13?",
  "We've done it before, there's no doubt about it. But the better practice usually is to have a case in which the issue really presents the hard question. And you're asking us to make a ruling in this case that would govern failure to allege an aggravating circumstance in a death case, for example, which has a different atmosphere to the whole case when you're facing that kind of an issue.",
  "A judge's reaction to a case is often affected by just exactly what's involved. And here it's just hard to see how anyone could claim any particular prejudice out of the error in this particular case or, really, it's arguable that there's no defect in the indictment at all because it was adequate notice to the defendant of what he's charged with. This is much like a case in the State systems where you have notice pleading. It doesn't seem very prejudicial. But you put it in a different context, you might have a different reaction to the case.",
  "May I ask this question. Should the test for the missing element be different for the test for the wrong element? In other words, suppose the indictment alleged he walked up to the border and the evidence showed he rode a bicycle. There's a variance. Would that present a different legal issue than if they just leave the overt act entirely out?",
  "Why should the test for judging the two be different?",
  "Between a variance and an omission?",
  "Well, it's clearly different. He rode a bicycle instead of walking.",
  "So here you've got notice he made an attempt, but you didn't tell us whether he rode the bicycle or he walked.",
  "See, the problem I'm trying to think through is why should there be a different rule between those two situations. It seems to me they're equally likely to produce prejudice or lack of notice and a failure to comply with the letter of the Constitution.",
  "Mr. Gold, I know you take that position on the facts of this case, but is it not true that there could be cases in which the verdict of the jury would establish certain facts that would justify going beyond the middle term? For example, the Black case itself, as the justice who dissented in this case thought the sentence was permissible in that case.",
  "May I clarify one thing? You mean that a rash of crimes committed by people other than the defendant could be an aggravating factor?",
  "But there's nothing in California law suggesting that that would be upheld, is there?",
  "Yes.",
  "That's true unless the California legislature does what most states have done in response to Booker, which is not that route at all. They did maintain their determinate sentencing, but they just required the jury finding. That's what I think seven out of nine states have done.",
  "But the difference is, in the Federal system, the judge can go above and it can be reasonable based on facts that were found by the jury. But in California, to go beyond the middle range up to the upper range, it must be a fact not found by the jury.",
  "Is that not correct?",
  "Correct. But whatever the reason, it is correct.",
  "On one hand, in one case, the unreasonableness depends on a finding of fact not made by the jury. But in the Federal system, it does not require that finding by a jury.",
  "On that question, may I ask -- on that subject, may I ask you this question: Have you read the brief filed by the National Association -- the amicus brief by the National Association of Defense Lawyers, which has a long discussion of the practical consequences in other states and in California?",
  "And which I find, to be honest to you, rather persuasive on the fact it's not such a big deal as we thought it might be. And I'd like you to have an opportunity to tell me whether there's something in that brief that is not accurate.",
  "They say, if I remember it correctly, that if the impact in a four day trial would normally be an extra hour for the jury, that that's about the burden on the system. And of course, 90 some percent of your cases are pleaded out by guilty, so it's not the major thing that we originally thought it might be. Do you think, just across the board, are they fairly accurate in their description of what happens in other states as far as you're advised?",
  "You are actually saying the answer to the Chief Justice's question is that you would then review it de novo. But on de novo review, you would sustain the conviction if it came to the right result.",
  "You would not affirm -- you would not sustain the conviction relying on AEDPA. You would say AEDPA authorizes review, but on review, we conclude the conviction was correct. That's what I understand the AEDPA to be.",
  "Correct.",
  "May I ask this question? Supposing we all thought that this practice in this particular case deprived the defendant of a fair trial, but we also agreed with you that AEDPA prevents us from announcing such a judgment. What if we wrote an opinion saying it is perfectly clear there was a constitutional violation here, but Congress has taken away our power to reverse it. Then a year from now, the same case arises. Could we follow -- could the district court follow our dicta or could it -- would it be constrained to say we don't know what the Supreme Court might do?",
  "That's at sentencing after conviction.",
  "These are in the joint appendix.",
  "Counsel, I'm not sure you're right that nobody was concerned about -- everybody thought the factors were wrong. I don't think the trial judge did. The trial judge said he saw no possibility of prejudice.",
  "But Mr. Grant, I'm a little puzzled. Why is the discovery in the Federal system any less valuable in the State system?",
  "Isn't that only summary for the purpose of deciding whether the removal was proper?",
  "Let me go back to the Chief Justice's hypo a little earlier. Could the district judge at that point dismiss the case without prejudice to refiling in the State court?",
  "It would be consistent with the court having jurisdiction to dispose of the case.",
  "Why is that draconian?",
  "Does he have to file a new filing fee?",
  "May I ask you, what is a typical administrative record that is developed in these proceedings? There's never a transcript, is there?",
  "Is there normally a statement of reasons for the denial of relief or are they just denied in many cases?",
  "Are the opinions a page or two or just a sentence or two? What is typical?",
  "I'm just wondering how, how much help that will give the judge later on in processing the case.",
  "How many of the 13,000 are of that variety?",
  "I see. And the other question: Of the 13,000 grievances, how many did result in litigation?",
  "200 out of 13,000?",
  "Can you explain what the disincentive or other reasons for there being just 200 lawsuits out of the 13,000?",
  "I see.",
  "May I ask you about, there's another question you haven't really touched on yet, the requirement that the prisoner name every defendant that he intends to sue in the exhausting, in the internal procedure. I'd just like a little help on just exactly what happens. The prisoner doesn't get the kind of medical care he thinks he's entitled to, and he only knows it because either the low level person says no, the doctors said you can't have it. And he brings a proceeding, an informal administrative proceeding, and they deny relief. And then later on when he wants to sue, his lawyer happens to find out the name of the doctor who was involved, and there are several levels of authority making the decision. Does he have to start all over again to name those people, or what does he do?",
  "And what if he does talk to the prison guard and the guard says I don't know, I don't know who's responsible for that decision, that's in the warden's office, or something like that. What is the prisoner supposed to do?",
  "What if he doesn't? One of his grievances is nobody told me. Is he out of luck there? And I think there may well be situations in which prisoners don't have complete access to all the facts that go into a decision denying them medical care, for example, or say a prisoner has a religious problem and can't get the diet he wants, or something like that. But before he can sue, under your view if I understand it, he has to find out so he can name the people in his administrative complaint.",
  "Now you say the primary purpose is to relieve the courts of the burden rather than determine whether there is merits to the grievances?",
  "Was to reduce the volume of litigation, period?",
  "Wasn't there any interest in determining whether the complaints have merit? I mean, I think you must be interested in getting rid of 11,000 complaints and reducing them down to 200. I would think that's more important than saving the court some time. There must be, you must have some interest in determining whether the complaints have merit.",
  "But these rules that are challenged here are primarily to benefit the courts, not the profits-- the process.",
  "But, Mr. Frey, let me ask you a question. Suppose this was a criminal case and the defendant was being punished for crime A and the judge in working out the sentence realizes he also committed crimes B, C, D, and E. He could take those into account in determining the extent of the sentence given for crime A. Why isn't that similar?",
  "And if there was a second -- the same defendant got convicted again for crime X. At that sentencing the judge could again take into account the harm to defendants B, C, and D.",
  "That's not the same harm if it's a different defendant or a different plaintiff in the second case. You're punishing him for the harm to be this time, and you can -- just as in a criminal case, why can't you in both cases take into account that, the harm to the class, to the public at large?",
  "Isn't there a distinction between actual harm to others and the risk of harm? Supposing a defendant fired a machine gun into a crowd of people.",
  "And he killed one, at least one. And that one sued and said: I want extra punitive damages because all these other people were subjected to the same risk. Wouldn't that be a proper consideration?",
  "Would it be a proper consideration even if a second person brought the same action?",
  "But you're not asking to recover for the actual harm to the others. You're saying there was a general risk of harm to many, many people, which is similar to what we have here. We don't know whether they're harmed or not, but that can be taken into account in fixing the ultimate verdict.",
  "Isn't the time to determine what to do with the second lawsuit is when the second lawsuit is brought?",
  "But can't I punish for the risk of harm to B, C, and D?",
  "May I ask this question? Assuming there's a distinction, and the instruction does, between taking into account the extent of harm to others on the one hand and punishing for the extent of harm on the other. As I understand what you recited about the five parts of the instructions, none of them really authorized punishment for harm to others.",
  "And is it also true that the part the Chief Justice quoted from 199(a), it seems to me that could be an argument that you should take into account the extent of harm to others, but it does not seem to me to be an argument that you can punish on. And the question I want to ask, are there other parts of the closing argument in which plaintiff's counsel argued that you should take into account, that you should punish for harm to others?",
  "Let me ask on that, Ms. Bonner, what typically in Florida is the time elapsed between the conclusion of the criminal proceeding and the conclusion of the state collateral relief?",
  "But it's more than six months, I assume.",
  "Two, three, four, five years.",
  "And all that time, the statute has been tolled?",
  "The question is whether there may be another six months added on to that five or six-year period.",
  "Mr. Kise, can I ask you what your view in this matter would be if the Court grants certiorari, would the application be pending during the period that the case is under advisement in this Court?",
  "Either way.",
  "Let me ask a second question. Suppose it were reversed, we send it back for further proceedings in the state trial court, would you say that it's still not pending during the further proceedings?",
  "So it started pending again after an interruption, is that the way it would be?",
  "Forget about equitable principles, statutory principles. Is there a lack of continuity, where you could have it pending for a period of a couple years and then an interruption, and then it can resume pending after the interruption?",
  "Well, period when it's not pending followed by a period when it begins to pend.",
  "But there would be no statutory right in your view, it would depend on the equitable considerations?",
  "But they would correct it if we told them to.",
  "And when it got back in the state supreme court, they would still be working on the application that had been pending until the end of the proceedings down there, and then suddenly came back to life after we sent it back.",
  "The irony of your position is that it has those harshest consequences in those rare cases where there was a denial of constitutional right.",
  "But isn't it true the real problem with the capital cases? The state's interest in getting things moving is the strongest in the capital cases, I think.",
  "In the non-capital cases there is an interest in promptness, but the longer the guy stays in jail is not going to prejudice the state. But you do want to get your death cases terminated as soon as you can. And what we're really talking about as I understand it is whether in most death cases we'll add on a period of six, eight, nine months to the total period. And in most of those death cases, which is a limited number -- I don't know, you have a couple hundred people I suppose in death row -- in those cases it's going to be seven, eight, nine years anyway.",
  "Doesn't the title of a statute indicate the category of cases that Congress was primarily interested in?",
  "The death penalty.",
  "Let me ask this question as to the basic issue of whether you should be relying on Teague or the statute. If you're relying just on the statute, how would it apply to a case which was correct under established law at the time that the state court made its ruling, but before the case reached the appellate court, in which there was a change in our interpretation? What if this case -- if Crawford had been decided while the case was on appeal?",
  "So it really makes a difference whether we rely on Teague or whether we rely on the statute if we disagree with you?",
  "The word was is somewhat ambiguous. It could either mean at the time of the trial court's decision or at the time of the final judgment on appeal.",
  "I know you win under either view, but - -",
  "-- it could mean either of those two things.",
  "You make the same analysis if you say the right is not necessarily the right of confrontation but the narrower right of cross-examination.",
  "Because that is central to Crawford.",
  "Ms. Forsman, can I ask you a personal question? Were you a moot court finalist?",
  "I attend a moot court at Notre Dame in about your year and it was an awfully good moot court.",
  "May I ask a question, Mr. Phillips? Focusing on this question in the amicus brief which the EPA representative answered no. Supposing the EPA had answered yes at that time. Would that have been a permissible answer within the meaning of the statute?",
  "You know -- what's that, page 7 and 8 of the -- of a source to modified have to have a significant increase in the SO2 elements.",
  "And they answered no. You say they were right.",
  "I'm just asking -- want to know, under the statute, could they have answered yes and would that have been a permissible answer?",
  "So you're not basically relying on the fact that you were misled, you're basically relying on the fact that they have interpreted the statute incorrectly.",
  "Mr. Phillips, can I ask another sort of basic question? In your view, would it be permissible for the agency to interpret the word - - to adopt a regulatory interpretation of the -- in the PSD regulations of the word \"modification\" that was different from the definition it used under the new source regulations?",
  "Substantively different.",
  "You think the statute required the regulation to be identical?",
  "Your answer is no?",
  "Would it have been permissible for the agency to adopt one definition for 10 years and then change the definition to the other definition for all programs?",
  "Yes.",
  "So either definition could comply with the statute?",
  "They make a kind of interesting argument, major modification is not a subset of modification.",
  "Mr. Phillips, I want to be sure I understand your position. Are you saying the statutory text in effect says every regulation using the word modification must employ the same definition, or are you relying on a general principle that when the same word is used it should be used in the same way?",
  "So there's nothing in the statute itself that says that principle shall apply to this case?",
  "But your reference of modification as defined elsewhere merely defines the scope of the statutory meaning. That's not the same as saying every regulation that is a modification must be the same no matter what the program.",
  "Let me just be sure I understand the point. If instead of saying as defined in X, the second statute had merely quoted the same words that were in X, would your argument be the same?",
  "So you're saying that if you used the definition as defined in another statute, that implicitly says all regulations defining this term must be identical.",
  "This is very helpful to me, because the government has accused you of abandoning the court of appeals approach to the case, and I think you're endorsing the court of appeals.",
  "Mr. Phillips, can I go back for a second to the meaning in (a) includes the same meaning as in (b). Is it not correct under your view of the statute that that meaning can include either of the two definitions that the two regulations identify? So that either -- whether you start with (a) or the second statute, either statute includes both - - may include both alternative regulations?",
  "Yes.",
  "Suppose that they had beat him up two or three times. The first time it didn't relate to it, but then they took him into the interrogation room and they beat him up again. What about that case?",
  "So there would be two causes of action?",
  "May I ask, just to get it straight at the beginning, what if the claim includes a Fifth Amendment claim for extorting a conviction and it's mixed up with a Fourth Amendment claim? What about that claim?",
  "But isn't there this practical problem? I think what you say fits together beautifully with regard to the law, but isn't it true that this will give an incentive in every criminal case for the defendant to file a 1983 action. So we may multiply the number of Federal cases that are filed and then sit there while a criminal case proceeds.",
  "Well, if your opponent's rule is adopted, they wouldn't file unless -- if they get convicted and the conviction stands up, the case would never be filed.",
  "The thing I just want you to comment on is, my thought is every person arrested has a potential, and something follows and so forth, has a potential Fourth Amendment claim, even though he may not have one on the merits. It just seems to me that there's a potential here of an awful lot of what may turn out to be frivolous claims filed, but it would seem to be routine procedure for defense lawyers who want to make a suppression motion to say, well, I better file my 1983 case at the same time. So you might get literally hundreds and hundreds of cases.",
  "May I ask, I may have missed some of the colloquy here -- is it correct that he would not be eligible to file a-- to have a, institute a Chapter 13 proceeding if he had unsecured debts of over a certain amount?",
  "And what if at the time he makes the motion to convert, which you say he has an absolute right to make, what if the record then disclosed that he had debts exceeding that amount? What should the bankruptcy judge do in that case?",
  "He concludes they're over the amount? So it is clear under the record. What should he do then?",
  "He should what?",
  "So he does not have an absolute right in all cases to convert, then.",
  "May I ask this question. If the remedy of not allowing them to convert to Chapter 13 is denied, are there other remedies that the bankruptcy court can impose against the debtor who engages in misconduct of this kind?",
  "Are there any criminal sanctions?",
  "Then how are the creditors hurt by this series of events?",
  "Wouldn't a Chapter 7 case be refiled immediately?",
  "But the creditors aren't going to let him just run away with the assets, are they?",
  "Whenever he denies the motion, he must know about it. He must have a reason to deny.",
  "May I just clear up one detail that's confusing to me. The -- are there two judges? Does the same judge rule on both the motion to convert and the motion to reconvert?",
  "But, Mr. Fisher, even if it's true that there are other examples out there that might qualify for that example, it's not true of this case?",
  "In this particular case, there was -- it was necessary to make an additional finding of fact, even though there may be cases out there in which you could get consecutive sentences without an additional finding of fact?",
  "But that's not necessarily true. Isn't it also possible if, at the time of the first judgment the judge could have said, well you really haven't exhausted your remedies because it is not final until the whole thing is over. But nevertheless, because exhaustion is not a jurisdictional matter, I'm going to go ahead and decide it.",
  "Yes.",
  "May I just be sure I understand one thing about that? So you're saying at the time he filed the petition on December 28, 1998, he had already had, the second judgment had already been entered by the Washington Supreme Court?",
  "Pursuant to the reversal of the - -",
  "Of the second judgment?",
  "Maybe you can give me just a little more help on this. The finding number 18 that you referred to says in substance, if by just sentencing him on the basis of the jury verdict he won't get - - he'll get a free pass. But it doesn't say the judge can -- could therefore increase the sentence. It seems to me there had to be additional findings that justify a result that he thought would have been a miscarriage of justice.",
  "You think that just having pointed out that he would get a pass would have been sufficient to justify consecutive sentences?",
  "Yeah, but he did make additional findings. It goes on. In fact, 19 and 20 are additional findings.",
  "It nowhere says they're unnecessary either.",
  "May I ask you this question: It seems to me there are two ways to read the burglary, arson or extortion examples: That they are clear examples of crimes that would involve harm to individuals, physical injury to another; or they are put in the statute to say, even though they don't involve serious risk, these specific crimes will be covered, because your statistic of 3 percent suggests that burglary itself probably would not qualify as a crime that presents a serious risk of physical injury, but the statute nevertheless defines it. So do you read those terms as giving examples of crimes that would not involve that risk of injury or as examples of crimes that would?",
  "Mr. Marcus, isn't there this -- this linguistic problem with the statute anyway? Because this language if it said -- that sometimes presents a serious risk, then the answer would be obvious. If otherwise it said that characteristically presents a serious risk, then it might be closer. And which do you think is the more normal reading of it? I think either is -- certainly fits the language.",
  "Either means sometimes presents a potential risk of physical injury, then obviously they're all covered. Or if it says characteristically presents the risk, potential risk, then do you have to decide whether that, it is a characteristic of potential burglary that it -- that it does present this risk or that just once in a while it does.",
  "If that were true, and if as your opponent said, that in actual burglaries there's only three percent of them actually involve risk to - - of physical injury to another, then attempted burglary must necessarily be somewhat less than three percent. I would think that. Would that satisfy the characteristic requirement?",
  "Why is it two or three percent?",
  "Well, I don't think that's perfectly clear. The \"otherwise\" language does suggest that you are right. But if the statute instead of saying \"otherwise\" had said, \"or involves other conduct that presents a serious risk,\" which I think is a permissible reading, perhaps not the best reading, but if it said that, then it is not -- you are not taking as a given the fact that the others satisfy the violent requirement but rather that they are eligible, whether or not they do.",
  "Do I correctly understand, we don't need the statistics, I guess they're not available, but in your view if we did have statistics and they showed that in 1/10 of 1 percent of the category of crimes across the nation, there was this risk, that would be enough?",
  "Yes. Well, for attempts or complete -- I mean, just say the standard of what presents a serious potential risk of physical injury, if 1/10 of 1 percent of the crimes -- whatever the category, did present such a risk, that would be sufficient under your view.",
  "The answer is yes?",
  "So then it's a really easy case, because really there is some risk in every case. There's some risk that somebody will, you know, bump into somebody or give them a punch in the nose at least.",
  "Yes, but none of the elements of the offense satisfy the risk of physical injury in the burglary case. You can have unarmed burglars.",
  "Right. And as I understand your view - -",
  "If in 1/10 of 1 percent of the cases, there is in fact a physical confrontation, that's enough, which makes it a pretty easy case.",
  "Well, what about -- do you think the facts in the presentence report are admitted by your opponent or not?",
  "Therefore, can we consider them?",
  "So therefore, then the question is whether throwing the hammer through the window is sufficient; is that right?",
  "Would you think that the hammer through the window is a decisive fact if we do look at the individual case?",
  "Because the hammer is thrown through the window, is that -- I just want to be sure I understand your view of the importance of the hammer.",
  "I'm still a little unclear as to how much significance we pay to that hammer.",
  "May I follow up on a question the Chief Justice asked you during the last argument? We got into the government's construction of the statute to narrow it to intentional situations. Would you explain a little more exactly what situations you would exclude and what you would include in your interpretation of the statute?",
  "Would you measure the mens rea at the outset of the procedure when they begin the dilation a day or two before the actual operation is performed, or is it at the time of beginning the operation?",
  "General Clement, That brings up a question I was intending to ask you. I notice the finding says nothing about interstate commerce but the statute says any physician who in or affecting interstate commerce performs the procedures. Does that mean that the procedure is performed in a free clinic, as opposed to a profit organization, it would not be covered?",
  "But how could the Commerce Clause justify application to a free clinic? I don't understand.",
  "Activities that - -",
  "Would you clear up one thing for me? You say it's always the doctor's intent to extract as much as possible before causing fetal demise. I thought there was significant number of cases in which there was a deliberate decision to cause fetal demise before I start any extraction?",
  "From the point of view of the doctor it would be the safest thing to avoid criminal responsibility.",
  "Doesn't the answer to my question turn largely on the age of the fetus? Isn't it a vast difference between the kind of decision the mother that is to make if it's a 14 week fetus on the one hand and 26 week fetus on the other?",
  "For example, one of the congressional interests described in the finding is avoiding fetal pain to the fetus. And I guess they don't suffer any pain prior to 20 weeks but after 20 weeks there is some risk of pain. And that seems to me, that could affect a calculus very dramatically for the woman making the decision.",
  "General Clement, are not some of the findings by Congress clearly erroneous? For example, there is a statement that no current medical schools provide instruction in the procedure. Now that's clearly wrong, isn't it?",
  "Do you think that finding is correct?",
  "Supposing there was a lot of evidence introduced in the district court that there were schools like Yale and New York University that did include this as part of a curriculum, could the district court disregard that finding and make a contrary finding?",
  "Well, on other findings, is there a different standard of review of what the district court found as opposed to what Congress found?",
  "Well, I don't understand Congress to have made credibility findings. As I read the -- I read the whole finding. There were six or seven pages of findings, and I don't find a single reference in those findings to the performance of an abortion on a nonviable fetus. All of the language in the findings seem to be referring to viable fetuses just inches away from becoming a person. And I don't think you can even find the word fetus in those findings. The findings as opposed to the text of the statute.",
  "I'm talking about the findings. Is there a single word in the findings that refers to a viable fetus? It maybe refers to a nonviable fetus.",
  "May I interrupt?",
  "It's not preventing the lethal act, it is requiring that the lethal act be performed prior to any part of the delivery, because there is no doubt there will be a lethal act. The only issue is when it may be performed.",
  "Yes.",
  "Whether the fetus is more than halfway out, and some of these fetuses I understand in the procedure, are only four or five inches long. They are very different from fully formed babies.",
  "Wouldn't the fetus be -- I think it suffer a demise in seconds anyway.",
  "Do you not agree that it has no chance of survival, in most cases?",
  "Yes, that's right.",
  "Congress has made the judgment that it is far preferable to ensure that fetal demise takes place before any delivery begins. That's the big issue.",
  "May I ask you this question about what you think we should do. If I thought the evidence did support the conclusion that it's never medically necessary, it merely -- the evidence merely supports the proposition that a doctor has to be a lot more careful if he goes one way rather than the other because there are more risks involved in one procedure rather than the other, would that be sufficient to support the -- I can see the argument that the intact delivery may have less risk of complications and so forth without it not necessarily being absolutely necessary.",
  "I didn't understand one of your answers. Supposing that today the management does not know of the prior discrimination. Just, records that have been lost, it happened a long time ago. But there was evidence that there was a firm policy that women get 20 percent less than men forever and it's still -- that policy has continued up to date, but that these people making the decision today did not know that. Would there be liability or not?",
  "I thought you said the other. That's why I was - -",
  "Let me ask this question. Supposing in the annual review before a promotion is concerned the officer making the recommendation was instructed not only to decide what increase would be appropriate but also to review past history and decide whether or not the employee was being paid fairly in a nondiscriminatory basis and that was part of the assignment. Would you have a case if that were the case?",
  "You couldn't rely on the past history in that situation?",
  "Because I think that's sort of what Justice -- Judge Jofla thought was going on here.",
  "Mr. Nager, can I test your theory with a hypothetical question? Supposing 20 years ago, there was an actual written policy statement, we pay women 20 percent less than men. And that was written up and everybody knew it. And then nothing changed for the next 20 years, and the person then sued today. Would she be -- and there was no intent to do anything, this is just the way it's always been. Would she have a cause of action?",
  "If present intent was merely to do what we have always done, you have to go back 20 years to find out that what we have always done is the result of a policy decision made 20 years ago that we can hire women at a less expense than men so we will continue to pay the same rate. Would the per paycheck rule apply to that case?",
  "But there is a slight difference in that you're focused on whether discrimination occurred within the 180-day period. And if I understand you correctly, discrimination would have occurred during the 180-day period if the employer knew of the policy that I described, because then he would be knowingly paying less.",
  "I thought your answer to Justice Alito made that point.",
  "But the question of whether just knowing that that's a source of the policy would be a gender-related reason.",
  "Well, in my hypothetical there was a policy established 20 years ago, a 20 percent differential, never been changed. And the only question that would differ, in some cases the employer knows about it and in some others he doesn't.",
  "Well, what his reason is, this is always the way we did it. That's his reason.",
  "But you could if the person making the decision was aware of the discriminatory policy.",
  "But you're changing the hypothetical. My hypothetical was simply a pay case.",
  "You're saying, I think contrary to your colleague if I remember correctly, that even if the employer knew of the 20 percent differential policy established 20 years ago, it could still carry it into effect today.",
  "Well, but isn't the next sentence, the substance of the sentence is \"plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that defendants have entered into a contract combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their respective telephone and/or high speed interstate markets, and agreed not to compete with one another and otherwise allocated customers and markets to one another.\" Now, does that state a violation of the Sherman Act?",
  "It does not?",
  "I mean, you could leave out everything before plaintiff, the part you quoted, that's not part of the declaration in the sentence. But the sentence itself alleges a garden variety of the violation of the Sherman Act, doesn't it?",
  "It's got the language of the Sherman Act, a conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their respective telephone and/or high speed markets. That's not in the Sherman Act, that's a description of the alleged conspiracy in this case.",
  "But Mr. Kellogg, that's not a legal conclusion, it's an allegation of fact that there was an agreement to prevent competitive entry into respective markets. There are dozens of antitrust complaints that are no more specific than that.",
  "Of course, that may be true on summary judgment, you may be dead right on the merits, but are you telling me that an allegation that the defendants have agreed not to compete with one another is not a statement of fact?",
  "Well, what if they said they agreed in writing not to compete with one another, would that be sufficient? Or if they have agreed orally not to compete with one another, would that be sufficient?",
  "If they said they have agreed orally not to compete with one another, would that be a statement of fact, an allegation of fact?",
  "Then why did you leave the words orally out? Why is it not a statement, allegation of fact?",
  "But that's a direct allegation of conspiracy, that very statement.",
  "They make it fairly clear that they may only have the evidence of parallel conduct that you describe, and that may not be sufficient, and maybe for that reason, you get a summary judgment. But how you can say this is not an allegation of fact, I find mind-boggling.",
  "It's clear it's not sufficient to prove it, but is it admissible evidence?",
  "Should a plaintiffs's complaint fail because it includes unnecessary, verbose, admissible evidence?",
  "Is not it an allegation that they've agreed not to compete with one another an allegation of fact?",
  "But they have alleged more. They have alleged an actual agreement.",
  "What if the complaint in addition to that alleged that up to a certain date, it was unlawful for the companies to compete with one another but the law was changed and after that change took place they were advised by their lawyers they could compete, but they agreed not to. Would that be sufficient?",
  "Mr. Richards, can I ask you this question. Supposing that you were allowed to have discovery and each chief executive of the defendant companies got on the stand and said: I never talked to my, my competitors at all, I never seriously considered competing in the other, other company's territory for the reasons set forth in the, in your opponent's brief on the merits here. We never did agree. And you're able to prove the things you've alleged in the agreement. Would the, would it be appropriate to enter summary judgment against you on that testimony if you had no evidence of a specific agreement?",
  "But my question is you can prove what you've now alleged factually, but they deny the existence of any agreement and they explained the reasons for it exactly as the lawyers did in this brief. Would you not lose on summary judgment?",
  "Prove what you have alleged, in effect, except for the key allegation of agreement among the competitors. If you had no other evidence of that agreement, would you win.",
  "You mean the mere fact that you have alleged something is against their self-interest is enough to make an issue of fact on whether it's against their self-interest?",
  "They could have gone on the stand, they gave all the reasons in the red briefs -- or the blue briefs in this case, that say it's not against their self-interest; you'd say that would be a jury question?",
  "Are you suggesting that you don't have to prove an actual agreement? You can merely prove conduct contrary to self-interest is sufficient?",
  "Do you agree you must - - do you agree that you must prove an actual agreement among the defendants?",
  "Don't you think there's a grammatical difference in the meaning of the word obvious and the meaning of the word apparent?",
  "So you're saying that the question is whether it's obvious?",
  "Tell me again, just to be sure I have it my -- tell me very briefly, what it is that makes this invention nonobvious?",
  "The invention, to use an old-fashioned term, is the decision of where to put the control.",
  "Can I ask you a preliminary question before you get too far into your argument? Is it your understanding that the instructions to the jury were that finding that predatory price cutting was in itself sufficient to establish a Section 2 violation? I know the Court of Appeals opinion reads that way but is it, do you think the jury was so instructed?",
  "You may consider it as an anticompetitive act, but it does not say you may regard it as a violation of Section 2.",
  "And as I read the instructions, it did require there be three elements of the violation of Section 2 which, two of which were not discussed by the Court of Appeals.",
  "Do you concede there is monopoly power?",
  "But is that relevant to the question whether, if there is monopoly power plus an attempt to preserve that power or require that power, plus an anticompetitive act, is that a violation of section 2.",
  "But you do agree that the conduct in itself is not sufficient to establish a violation, the question of whether the conduct plus the monopoly power - -",
  "And so you're arguing not only that the pricing conduct was not itself sufficient to prove a violation, but it also was not even an anticompetitive act that may give rise to damages?",
  "Obviously, if there's just an anticompetitive act without a violation of the statute, then there would be no basis for damages.",
  "Of course in the Brooke case, it may not have even been a monopolist.",
  "May I ask this question? Supposing the evidence was perfectly clear that the company did engage in a plan to get a total monopoly and there were minutes of the board of directors says that in order to do this we've got to drive company X out of business and so you, we want you to compete in every transaction with company X that you can and buy the logs at a higher price. Would that be an anticompetitive act even if it did not result in loss to the defendant?",
  "No. The anticompetitive -- the plan is to drive the company out of business. And the only anticompetitive conduct other than proving the whole objective is that you pick on this one competitor and outbid him every time you can. Could that possibly give rise to a damage claim?",
  "Even if the whole purpose was to drive it out of business?",
  "Pursuant to a plan to acquire a monopoly.",
  "No, but only intent plus monopoly power. You have to be able to prove monopoly power, too.",
  "There aren't too many cases that fit this.",
  "No, but unilateral conduct where you have monopoly power. There aren't too many of these cases, as you know.",
  "It was an issue that was resolved by the jury in this case and I don't understand you to be disputing the resolution of that issue.",
  "But that did not involve a monopoly. That did not involve monopoly power.",
  "No, you have to have the monopoly power as well.",
  "In your view, if as the jury was instructed in this case there was proof of monopoly power and intent to maintain or preserve that power, plus anticompetitive acts, does the anticompetitive act have to be in and of itself a violation of the Sherman Act?",
  "And if you do have all three, is that enough to prove a violation?",
  "And isn't that how the jury was instructed in this case?",
  "Yes, but if it was not instructed it would be sufficient to find a violation of section 2 by those, by that accounting, is that not correct?",
  "Go back to my hypothetical. Supposing you have the first two elements and you say in order to drive this company out of business we want you to compete with them and get the logs at whatever cost it takes. Would that be an anticompetitive act?",
  "Even if it was for the sole purpose of driving the company out of business in order to accomplish the goal of getting a monopoly?",
  "No, no. I'm assuming this is not evidence of intent. There's independent evidence of both intent and monopoly power. With those two elements established, would this, the kind of evidence I described, be evidence of an injury to the plaintiff that could be actual in damages?",
  "Will you need to meet the prongs of the Brooker test even if you otherwise prove a violation of section 2?",
  "You prove monopoly power plus an intent to maintain or acquire it.",
  "That's insufficient to prove a violation of Section 2?",
  "But there is no evidence of monopoly power and it isn't even remotely at issue in that case.",
  "I find it interesting that the scientists whose worked on that report said there were a good many omissions that would have indicated that there wasn't nearly the uncertainty that the agency described.",
  "But in their selective quotations, they left out parts that indicated there was far less uncertainty than the agency purported to find.",
  "Is there uncertainty on the basic proposition that these greenhouse gases contribute to global warming.",
  "As I understand the government's position, you're not merely questioning standing but you also take the position you do not have the authority to do what the plaintiff asks you to do; is that correct?",
  "May I ask you on that question, if we turn to the statute, to Section 201, there's reference to \"shall regulate\" if in the judgment of the administrator there is a for real danger and so forth. In your view, is there a duty to make a judgment?",
  "Could they have a discretion never to make the judgment?",
  "But as I read your brief, you didn't really confront the question, s I understand it, of whether or not there was a duty to make a judgment at all. And I'm interested in what your position on that is.",
  "To me, just reading the text of the statute is a little ambiguous. I'm not entirely clear, but it seems to me that just reading that statute, I got the impression that Congress thought that the administrator had a duty to make a judgment when there was enough evidence out there that people were concerned about it and so forth, that there would be a duty there, but you think not?",
  "But you would agree that if they did make a judgment, then you would have authority to regulate?",
  "May I just finish, please? You argued, as I understand it, correctly, that the state does, exercises certain regulatory controls that will not be exercised -- will not be replaced by federal controls; is that right? In other words, you -- that they will be unregulated to a certain extent? There will be less regulation under the federal sovereign than there is under the state; is that correct?",
  "Can you give me some specific examples of what Michigan would require that the OCC does not require? You mentioned licensing, for example.",
  "Does that have any impact on the way they run their business?",
  "I mean, does it make any difference as a matter of what they have to do in order to comply with the law that they are now exempt from Michigan rules and subject to Federal rules instead?",
  "Mr. Blanchard, may I ask you a question. I just want to understand. Wachovia has branch banks all over the country. Are they generally subsidiaries or are they divisions of the bank?",
  "I understand that. I'm asking a factual question.",
  "They are actually divisions, in effect, of the national bank itself?",
  "At least they are not separate corporate subsidiaries.",
  "Why is that, that the Best bank decided to use the subsidiary approach for this business, rather than the more traditional banking approach.",
  "It protects from liability, too.",
  "-- in the district.",
  "But you do take a field preemption position, don't you?",
  "I mean, it's truly broader than just conflict preemption.",
  "Literally.",
  "Does Wachovia have any branch banks in Michigan?",
  "Are there States in which Wachovia has both branch banks and subsidiaries comparable to this?",
  "Yes, but it is true, is it not, that as long as this mortgage company was a subsidiary of a holding company rather than the bank itself, the State would have done the visiting, the visitorial power, whereas once they changed the Federal Government assumed that responsibility?",
  "Well, as your co-counsel pointed out, previously this very company was a subsidiary of a holding company that also owned the bank, and at that time it was exclusively regulated by Michigan.",
  "And the change in the corporate structure is the sole basis for saying now it's exclusively regulated by the OCC?",
  "But this results in field preemption to the extent that the exercise of visitorial power is a regulatory function?",
  "Well, it is now only the Federal agency that does the visiting, whereas it used to be only the State agency?",
  "And the question that led me to is how many additional personnel did OOC employ when it took over this area for 48 States?",
  "But it was certainly quite a few people, I assume.",
  "But the authority under the old regime was just to make sure that the operation did not affect the financial stability of the parent bank.",
  "I have a question. Does the record tell us, the 300 people who have failed to get into the schools they wanted, the racial composition of that group?",
  "May I go back to the Cleveland school that Justice Alito mentioned? An I correct that there were 16 percent whites under the plan? And I'm just wondering what happened to it during the last couple of years?",
  "And it was -- about half as many whites as there were under the plan.",
  "General Clement, can I ask you a question that's prompted really by your argument in the last case. I wonder about the purity of the motive that's required. Supposing you had a city like Chicago with a neighborhood school system and in one neighborhood there was a school that was 100 percent African American, both student body and faculty, and up on the North Side there's a school that's 100 percent white, both students and faculty. Would it be permissible for the school board to decide that it would be healthy for both schools to have five African American schools in the North Side school and five white teachers in the South Side school?",
  "And then order that, hire teachers to do that?",
  "The only purpose is racial integration.",
  "Just say some. We want to -- we're going to make a decision there will be some white teachers and some African-American teachers in the other. And we're going to do it no matter -- if the Constitution permits it. And that's our only motive.",
  "My example is 100 percent motive to avoid 100 percent segregation.",
  "Just some, any without violating the Constitution.",
  "Judge Kozinski thought the real problem here was we should not deify strict scrutiny. That's what's caused all the problems.",
  "It is often true that sometimes doctrines do have unintended consequences when you push the logic of extremes. There is no doubt about that.",
  "Well, it isn't that we've made a judgment, the local school board has made a judgment which has a lot of experience under both systems.",
  "May I just. Was there a petition for a rehearing en banc in this case?",
  "Were there any votes in favor of the en banc rehearing?",
  "May I ask just one quick question?",
  "What was the public disclosure of the claim that ultimately prevailed?",
  "And the public disclosure was made in the newspapers rather than in an official Government proceeding?",
  "I have a question.",
  "As I understand the statute, you his the first prong. It has to be an action based on public disclosure of information, which you agree it was; is that right?",
  "You agree that it's within 4(a), that it was an action based on a public disclosure of information disclosed in newspapers; is that right?",
  "I am asking you, really what I'm seeking to find out is what is the scope of the public disclosure that everyone agrees was made? Was it all newspapers?",
  "If it was publicly disclosed in the newspapers, does that fit into one of the categories of public disclosure mentioned in 4(a)?",
  "And everybody agrees on what those news reports contained?",
  "So you're saying that the original source of the information was published?",
  "May I ask this question: Supposing he is the only source of the information that's publicly disclosed on which precipitated the filing of the complaint, and after the complaint is filed discovery reveals other violations of law on which the Government prevails, but they do not prevail on the theory of the original complaint. Would he be -- come within the statute or without? The statute focuses on the information that gave rise to the suit, not on what's found by way of discovery.",
  "Assuming we only look at the public information at the time the complaint is filed.",
  "Mr. Himmelfarb, what about accessory after the fact, do your comments apply to that argument as well?",
  "Well, it may not be fairly included but as you've acknowledged, it is an argument asserted to defend the judgment.",
  "Both West and Toro.",
  "Does any of those cases squarely hold that he could be convicted of being an accessory after the fact on a general indictment like this?",
  "What I guess we really don't know is whether Justice Breyer's parade of horribles are cases in which the municipality was able to provide the service more cheaply if it subsidized it, in which case there's no burden on commerce, or were they accompanied by prohibitions against competition, as Justice Scalia pointed out. I don't know.",
  "Mr. Cahill, you started to tell us three reasons why it was important that you regulate. You gave us one. Mention the other two.",
  "But the challenge here isn't gauging this business, the question is whether you can require everybody in the area to go through the one facility and pay a tipping fee.",
  "Let me ask you a sort of simple question. Is there an interstate impact on, of a municipal rule whether it is milk, or garbage, or what, that says all of this product must be processed within this city before it can go out of State?",
  "Doesn't that have a burden on interstate commerce?",
  "Isn't that exactly what we have here?",
  "You -- I'm sorry. We're looking at the interstate aspect from the wrong point of view. I'm a home owner. I have two choices. I either send it to the local facility or I can ship it over to New Jersey. You're telling me I can't ship it to New Jersey. Doesn't that burden an interstate transaction?",
  "This is an export ban.",
  "Your case involves an expert ban. All the trash has to be processed in your tipping facility.",
  "Just on the merits, the first thing that the tax authorities have to do is they have to value the property.",
  "May I ask, would the Ninth Circuit have had jurisdiction after October 30, 2004 to vacate the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court and send the case back?",
  "We did that. \"We don't have jurisdiction but we are nevertheless going to enter the following order, which presumably depends on our having jurisdiction, that the judgment is vacated,\" assuming it's bad. You agree that the Ninth Circuit could have done that?",
  "May I ask, how much time did the Petitioners have after the statute passed? 90 days? Or the interval of 90 days minus whatever had been run?",
  "Why would that be so?",
  "Miss Brinkmann, just to follow up on Justice Scalia's question, is there any history of the Federal government having to bail out the Guam government for bankruptcy or anything close to that?",
  "And is there anything in the record that tells us what kind of a credit rating Guam has?",
  "May I ask about the first one? Does the Constitution require there be no involuntary?",
  "So if the record showed that he didn't get, there wasn't a procedure followed to voluntarily waive those Constitutional rights, wouldn't the district court be able to reexamine that?",
  "Let me ask this question. It seems to me that there are two separate parts to the waiver issue. One, did he intend to say I don't want to put on any mitigating evidence? But then the second part of the question is, was that statement made knowingly and voluntarily, just as a guilty plea or something like that has to be. So is it enough for you to say it's clear what he intended, or is it also part of your burden to say that that intent was expressed in a way that was knowing and voluntary, compliant with the rule that applies to waivers of constitutional rights?",
  "Is that a sufficient waiver without inquiring as to whether it was a knowing and intelligent waiver, that he knew what he could put in, and so forth and so on?",
  "May I ask what might be an awfully elementary and stupid question? But -- it seems to me that there's no question about the facts of what he said. And you can interpret him saying I don't want any mitigating evidence put it. But isn't it clear that the waiver of the right to put in any mitigating evidence at a capital sentencing hearing is a constitutional right of very important dimensions? And can that right be waived if the record does not show whether or not he knew the full right of -- that is available to every defendant in a capital case? Namely, he had been advised by his counsel he could put in all sorts of stuff. Is there anything to show that there was that kind of waiver here, on the face of the record?",
  "Then it is, as a matter of law, an ineffective waiver. Isn't the Ninth Circuit dead right, not factually, but just as a matter of law, that you cannot waive this right unless the record shows that he's fully advised of the scope of the right that he's waiving.",
  "But why should it be, why should there be a less complete colloquy for this kind of waiver than a guilty plea itself? Now I admit there's no authority on the point. But isn't it absolutely obvious?",
  "Do I correctly understand your argument to be that, that in this case it happened to be the doubt about personal jurisdiction rather than subject matter jurisdiction but you would make the same argument if it were a doubt about subject matter jurisdiction?",
  "May I ask this question. We talk of course about the unnecessary burden on the litigants, but I wonder if there isn't even a more fundamental problem with the procedure that the Third Circuit followed here. That is, is there really a case or controversy down there? Does the defendant have any motivation to spend a lot of money fighting about jurisdiction when he knows that the case is going to be transferred anyway? Is this a real live controversy on the issue that's left open?",
  "Am I correct in understanding that at the end of the line here, if you win the Federal money will go to your two districts, whereas if the other side wins the Federal money will go to the State? Is that what the bottom line is?",
  "Yes.",
  "Let me ask another general question. If it were true, and I don't think it is in this case, that the biggest district was the one that got the most per pupil money -- the two biggest districts that were at the opposite ends of the spectrum, they would all be taken out, wouldn't they, under your view?",
  "May I ask - -",
  "-- a rather basic question? What if I'm convinced that your opponent's reading is really only the fair reading of the statute, but I'm also convinced by you that that's not what Congress intended. What should I do?",
  "Well no. Accept, accept my premises. What do you think I should do?",
  "I don't think it has to be absurd, it's just, I would measure it by what Congress actually intended. Assume there two permissible readings, and two -- both of them make sense. And I'm convinced, assume I'm convinced by you, that they really intended to perpetuate the prior method of procedure. May I take that, may I come to that result even though I think the language really says exactly what your opponent says it says?",
  "Mr. Clement, if we reverse as you suggest and the State Supreme Court said, well, I guess we were wrong under the First Amendment, we just realized our State constitution requires the same result, would that judgment stand, do you think?",
  "May I ask this question on your overinclusive, or underinclusive rather, argument? Supposing the statute was broader and said the union may not use any non-member agency fee collections for any non-germane purpose at all without affirmative consent? Would that solve all the constitutional problems?",
  "Could you just tell me yes or no, and then explain?",
  "At least insofar as your argument under inclusiveness, the answer would have to be that was, that statute would be okay.",
  "I'm talking about a statute that the individuals say I don't want to spend any more money, give any more money to the union than I absolutely have to. And the legislature decides to protect the right, that right by saying you cannot use agency sock fees for any non-germane purpose. What's wrong with that?",
  "If that's perfectly constitutional, this is a fortiori okay.",
  "And it's less of a burden on the union and there's less protection to the employee.",
  "So it's a First Amendment right that is waived by failing to make a timely objection.",
  "It's gone under your theory.",
  "Back to your example about the political party saying you can't use it for Democrats, what if they said, as they might have in the 1940s, you can use it for anybody except communist candidates?",
  "Okay.",
  "What do you say about his hypothetical involving Democrats versus Republicans?",
  "Well, he says, well, this is content discrimination. Is that - -",
  "Well, but it's content in the sense that only some speech has to be affirmatively authorized.",
  "Can I just go back to, you mentioned my question.",
  "Your point of your answer to his hypothetical is, well, the viewpoint discrimination would be impermissible, but the content discrimination is permissible?",
  "Could you just back up just for a second? Supposing at the time of the bankruptcy that the services have not been performed. It's post-petition conduct by the lawyer.",
  "Well, why wouldn't it be worth -- I know here. But why wouldn't it be worth the effort, instead of getting $90 on the note, to get 95?",
  "Are you telling me just based on your experience that in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, normally, no fees are recovered?",
  "But assuming in those cases where there's some distribution, is it correct, as I'm assuming your answer to Justice Kennedy's question, that the normal practice is you don't bother because there is not enough involved?",
  "The pre-petition contract, but not out of pre-petition conduct.",
  "But what I don't -- there is a body of law on the other side of that issue, too, isn't there?",
  "Yes. Absolutely. The Second Circuit is a lower court.",
  "That's exactly right. There are no cases from this Court speaking to this precise issue, are there? On which there is a disagreement among the lower courts?",
  "One quick question, if I may. Would one of the issues open on remand be the construction of the contract? Is there an issue at State law as to whether Travelers pays for these particular services?",
  "Well, why then isn't the proper disposition of this case to send it back to the Ninth Circuit to consider all these other arguments?",
  "Let me ask you a question about that. Your argument depends -- you analogize - - you would agree, I take it, that if this was an oversecured, secured creditor they'd be entitled to fees?",
  "But assuming, assuming the contract provides that.",
  "If that's so, why isn't their argument that, well, your client is solvent, the complete answer to your position?",
  "They argue it in their reply brief here.",
  "Yes, but that's not the facts of this case. Isn't that correct?",
  "This will not have any adverse, if I understand the facts, any adverse impact whatsoever on any unsecured creditor.",
  "No, but just looking at this case itself, if there is plenty of money there to pay a State law obligation, why shouldn't just ordinary rules of contract law apply?",
  "It's interesting. You're of course a teacher too. The amicus brief by a bunch of professors has a different view of the history than you're describing.",
  "Would you say a word about Justice Holmes' opinion in the Scruggs case.",
  "It is a subjective standard or an objective standard?",
  "So if the potential liability, as in these cases, is huge, then you have to be even more careful because there is liability so great. So is it the greater the liability -- the greater chance of recklessness, the greater the potential liability?",
  "May I also ask, do you agree with the Petitioner on the meaning of adverse action?",
  "I've read your reference to those documents. Explain why you think that's so important.",
  "How do those documents shed any light on recklessness? I didn't see that.",
  "How do the documents that you describe shed any light on the extent of their recklessness, if any?",
  "I still don't really understand this part of the case very much. Assume that a lawyer writes a letter saying you read it two or three different ways, read the statute, it's very ambiguous, and we think the government's reading is the better reading. And the executives think about it and they say no, we don't think that's right. Has that proved reckless disregard?",
  "If the statute's clear. And of course, Miss Mahoney said the district judge thought it was clear, but the other way.",
  "Yeah. May I ask this question? The reading of the statute in subsection i about, in the charges for insurance advice, seems to favor your view. But subsection ii about denial of employment really seems to read in favor of the government's reading.",
  "No. But my point is, it seems to me that getting a lesser salary, it just seems like the first applicant would be an adverse employment action under subparagraph ii, just -- do you see what I'm trying to say?",
  "It adversely affects any current or prospective employee. Now the language in i isn't, it doesn't read that way. But the thing that's troubling me is whether you should interpret i in the light of what ii seems to say.",
  "If these cases aren't Nelson that's a reason why we should decide these cases; it seems to me.",
  "Well, why don't you try to convince us of that?",
  "Well, do you think the case should have been decided differently should it have been decided after those decisions?",
  "But those decisions didn't purport to change the law.",
  "Am I correct, your position essentially is that, while it may well be true that these instructions did not permit the jury to give full effect to this mitigating evidence, that was not clearly established law at the time of these decisions?",
  "That's your view.",
  "But that wasn't the question. Your question was how many were before or after the - -",
  "May I, may I ask this question about your position? Is it your position that they should not have applied any harmless error review, or that they applied the wrong standard? And if it's the latter, what was the standard they should have applied?",
  "It wouldn't be preserving the Chapman standard if it was Federal collateral review, would it?",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Isn't there a difference between waiving it as a procedural bar and waiving it as an objection to the proper standard of review?",
  "Yes, but Mr. Cruz, is it not true that if he did fail to preserve the objection then there should have been a procedural bar to the case going forward?",
  "Why is that?",
  "In other words, they are saying that the failure to object does not constitute -- would constitute a procedural bar if we elected to treat it that way, but we've decided not to, but we're nevertheless going to rely on the failure to object to justify a higher standard of review on harmless error?",
  "Is there any precedent for that ambivalent use of a potential procedural bar?",
  "Mr. Cruz, would you clarify one thing for me? Did the Texas Court of Appeals say in effect, there is a procedural bar but we're going to waive it, or did they just not address the issue?",
  "How about in this case?",
  "Well, you're assuming there's longstanding precedents. It is also at least conceivable that at the time they thought the objection was properly preserved.",
  "But you're assuming that they decided to be more lenient rather than assuming that they may have actually decided and rejected the procedural bar.",
  "That's at least possible on this record, is it not?",
  "But did they cite that case in this case, in this opinion in this case?",
  "Are you talking about both collateral review and direct review, or just collateral review?",
  "This question is a little different. If you had two harmless errors in a given State, do they have to apply them consistently?",
  "In other words, if for example the higher standard only applies to unpreserved error and the record clearly establishes and the several State judges confirm there was no unpreserved error, then would there not be a duty to apply the lower standard?",
  "And if the State follows the rule in just one exceptional case before the Federal court, can the court said, hey, you're not following your regular rule?",
  "To what extent is the Congress's purpose later than the Congress that enacted the statute we're construing? The statute we're construing was enacted by one Congress and these expressions came later.",
  "May I ask this question: It seems to me that in sentencing there are two different broad categories of decision that the judge has to make, one involving the severity of the crime, and the other the characteristics of the particular offender. And might it not be the case that you give a greater presumption of following the guidelines when you're talking about the severity of the offense, and a greater deference to the trial judge when you're evaluating the factors of the individual that might affect the sentence? There might be a difference in the - -",
  "Yes, but didn't the court of appeals draw the inference that he had been distributing drugs during that 6-month period and that was not supported by the record? Am I wrong on that?",
  "Would it have been error for the court of appeals to find a fact like that that was not supported by the record and didn't it do it in this case.",
  "And the court of appeals is willing to draw a factual conclusion that he had in fact distributed during that 6-month period?",
  "But should the court of appeals act as a fact-finder in that posture of the case?",
  "Is it not possibly a fact that would justify the conclusion that they committed error?",
  "It may not have been essential, but it may have contributed to their judgment.",
  "May I ask just one other question? I do not understand you to argue that the court of appeals can apply a presumption of unreasonableness just because there's a departure.",
  "Because of the, the accessory after the fact point.",
  "Isn't it true, just to get one thought out on the table, that there are factors that the guidelines don't -- did not consider, such as military service?",
  "But isn't it true that under the guideline no weight is given to military service?",
  "What should a judge do if he thought some weight should be given to military service?",
  "May I ask you, this is the hypothetical: Supposing a judge thinks military service is relevant, and he decides to impose a sentence a little below the guidelines. But then he says, I recognize that in this circuit there is a strong interest in uniformity and the court of appeals has adopted a rule where they will presume a within guidelines sentence is reasonable and will affirm in those cases. And I think with respect to the court of appeals, I think I would be wise to impose the guidelines sentence, so I will do so even though my own judgment is that it should be slightly lower. What should the court of appeals do with such a sentence?",
  "Should reverse the judge then, within a -- a within guidelines sentence?",
  "No. He operates with total candor. He's saying exactly what he feels like saying.",
  "Well, they didn't say you're obligated, but you can be pretty sure you'll be affirmed if you do impose within guidelines sentences.",
  "May I ask this question? The district judge is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard, which I take it means there's a presumption he got it right. Is that correct? There's a presumption the district judge sentence is correct?",
  "Why shouldn't there be also the same presumption when it is outside the guidelines range?",
  "Well, do you think the interest in uniformity, in same sentences across the board is stronger than the interest in getting the correct sentence for the particular defendant who's in court at the time?",
  "No, there isn't. But if you say the district judge has broad discretion, which he does, and the review is under abuse of discretion, why should there not always be a presumption that the district judge got it right?",
  "Yes, but it's sort of like findings of fact. They must take into consideration all sorts of aspects of the case, and you have a strong presumption that the findings of fact are accurate. Why don't you have a strong presumption that the ultimate judgment on the sentence is also accurate?",
  "We'll hear argument now in No. 05-1056, Microsoft against AT&T. Mr. Olson.",
  "Mr. Olson, isn't one of the questions whether the software is really being copied when it's transferred from the golden disk to the new manufacturer, or whether it's actually being supplied?",
  "Well, I'm a little confused, because I thought the golden disk was just one method of getting the software into the new computers. And I thought it was the software which was arguably the component, not any physical manifestation.",
  "But do you -- what is your view on whether or not software is a component?",
  "What is patented? Is the physical object patented or is the software patented?",
  "Right.",
  "Mr. Joseffer.",
  "What, what is your view of what the component is in this case.",
  "The software is the component?",
  "Your time is up, but I want to ask you one yes or no question. In your view is software patentable?",
  "Thank you. Mr. Waxman.",
  "Is that really what happens? As I understand it there is an intermediate step. They don't send it directly from the United States to each of the individual computers in Germany. They send it to a central point which then redistributes it. Is that not right.",
  "If you're correct that they're just sending from New York direct to the 500 different machines all on one transmission from New York, there's no lawsuit here.",
  "Is that what you're trying to tell us, that they do send it directly from New York to 500 different recipients in Germany?",
  "Would it be a violation if they sent, if they sent the golden disk abroad and nobody ever copied anything off the golden disk?",
  "Would you answer my question?",
  "If they send the golden disk abroad and never use it, would that be a violation?",
  "Suppose it is never, it is never combined?",
  "Yes, but it doesn't have to be - -",
  "The physical object does not have to originate in the United States. Can they not transmit the commands to a physical object in Germany and have that be the substitute for the golden disk?",
  "Yes.",
  "But that they now send to some central point which redistributes them. They send one copy to, say, the wholesaler, who then makes 500 copies that are sent to the retail customers, isn't that correct?",
  "Which is exactly what happens in this case?",
  "My question is if that is what happens, when the retransmission takes place when one copy is converted into 500 how can those 500 all be components rather than copies of the single component?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Mr. Olson, you have, let's see, four minutes.",

  "You're not challenging the amount of the assessed tax, are you? You're just - - whether they can collect it from this particular person?",
  "And isn't that the basic difference between the two statutes, that one of them deals with a fight about how much money the taxpayer owes, and the other one deals with the method of collection.",
  "But it does seem to me if you think of the two statutes as performing rather separate functions, one primarily focused at the method of collection, the other the amount of tax, makes quite good sense to have different statute of limitations for the two, because there is an interest in the prompt resolution of the former issue that doesn't apply to the latter.",
  "It doesn't seem to me that the fact that there is a waiver of sovereign immunity with regard to levies answers the statute of limitations question. Sure, there is a waive of sovereign immunity, but the question is how long does the -- how promptly do you have to act?",
  "Can I ask this question about the shopping center. Wouldn't your case be exactly the same if the shopping center incident had not occurred?",
  "So that we really don't have to get distracted by the shopping center?",
  "Well, isn't the speed also relevant to the likelihood that -- that running into a car at that speed would cause the death of a driver?",
  "Isn't it a fair high probability that if you hit someone at that speed that there will be something, either death or serious injury as a result?",
  "Well, do you contend that an officer can always use deadly force to stop a high-speed driver who's creating this kind of a risk?",
  "Running into him with a high probability that he'll get killed.",
  "Wasn't that acknowledged in the district court, in the trial court?",
  "Yes.",
  "But the jury might find that it was deadly force.",
  "And do you conclude that the jury could not find that it was deadly force?",
  "Well, but is your -- is it your view that a jury could not find on these facts that there was deadly force?",
  "Does a police officer have any obligation in a situation like this to consider other alternatives, and if so what other alternatives might have been available to this officer?",
  "And even with letting him go, isn't it possible they could get other roadblocks up ahead or get other people involved in the attempt to catch him?",
  "Isn't it true that there's no traffic on the road at that particular time?",
  "Well, in that circumstance why wouldn't he just consider discontinuing the chase?",
  "Would that have been likely if the officer had discontinued the chase?",
  "Yes. But that was while he was being chased, right? Before being chased he hadn't done any of this. He was going 72 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone, isn't that right.",
  "No but if you're thinking of the likelihood of harm if they discontinued the chase, is it not reasonable to assume he might go back to going 72 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone?",
  "There isn't a question. There is a question of whether it justifies the use of deadly force, to prevent this -- this situation.",
  "What if they knew there were drugs in the car that he would dispose of if he had got caught. Would that justify this using deadly force?",
  "I'm rather clear it would not, isn't it? Because that would be no more serious than the crime in Garner, would it?",
  "May I just make this one point? Is it correct that the issue is whether it's reasonable or is the issue whether a jury could find it unreasonable?",
  "Let me just ask this question. In trying to assess the likelihood of harm to innocent people who would be hurt by this by this guy driving so fast, is that, do we measure it by assuming that the chase will continue? Or do we measure it by assuming that the chase would be discontinued?",
  "Just as we did in Garner?",
  "If it were -- clear that a jury could find that there would be no unreasonable risk to innocent motorists if they discontinued the chase - - assume that's a possible finding. If that were true, would there be a duty to discontinue the chase?",
  "You're saying there is a duty not to use deadly force.",
  "It is certainly the case that if there is going to be a, a risk of deadly harm to innocent third parties, there would be a duty to discontinue the chase rather kill him. But you don't seem to buy that.",
  "How do you classify right to reimbursement?",
  "The right to recover money, it's just a remedy, it's not a right?",
  "Why don't we go back to my other question to be sure I got your point. The reimbursement is paid to whom?",
  "The child or the parents?",
  "You reimburse the child for money that his parents spent?",
  "What would -- what would happen if the child were deceased or incompetent?",
  "Maybe, maybe these children don't. Do they set up trust funds for these reimbursements?",
  "But the guardian can't the funds that belong to the child.",
  "Yes.",
  "Do we think have a duty to follow precedents that don't make any sense?",
  "Can I just add this thought before you answer. And isn't that exactly what Justice Stewart said in his concurring opinion?",
  "Let me just clear up one thing to be 100 percent sure I understand your position. It does -- the message is the critical part of this case. If it was a totally neutral message on a 15-foot sign, that would be okay. You're not saying 15-foot signs are disruptive?",
  "And so we're focusing on the message and that's the whole crux of the case.",
  "It's also critical here to your case that it was a school event. If it, if this had have been two blocks down the street there would have been no objection.",
  "Is that a judgment clear enough as a matter of law, or is there possible debate as to whether that's a reasonable interpretation of the message? Let's assume it was an ambiguous message. Would we have to accept her interpretation on summary judgment?",
  "What if the sign said \"bong hits should be legal?\"",
  "Under your view wouldn't the principal's judgment always prevail?",
  "Is that a question of fact or a question of law?",
  "Is whether it's a reasonable judgment - -",
  "If I could come back to, may I ask this question: Is part of your argument that even under the Brecht standard it was not harmless?",
  "This is a case, am I correct, where there were two, two hung juries and then a five-week deliberation in this case? And there was a harmless -- and the testimony of Maples was she had seen a guy who didn't fit the description do the killing?",
  "Would you help me with one thing I'm not terribly clear about, though. Is it clear which -- what side the magistrate thought had the burden of persuasion?",
  "Does your opponent now concede that the State has the burden?",
  "But two or three of those did it on an improper ground, that you agree with now, don't you?",
  "For purposes of argument.",
  "Isn't this the -- I may have it wrong -- but isn't this the case in which the witness was unique not cumulative because she was the only one who was completely disinterested.",
  "Did they ask for a read back of Mrs. Maples' testimony?",
  "Oh, that's right. Of course.",
  "Well, maybe a critical witness was left out. That argues the other way, I think.",
  "That's classic going to the weight of the evidence. That goes to the weight, not the admissibility.",
  "So we don't assume that he's committed a whole lot of killings, I don't suppose?",
  "May I ask two questions and then you can proceed. One, do you take a position on who has the burden of persuasion? That's the first question. And do you have an opinion on proper application of Brecht in this case?",
  "But you do agree if it were in equipoise the State would have the burden?",
  "I have the same problem Justice Souter does, in all candor. The jury takes five weeks to decide the case and there's a fairly interesting bit of testimony that doesn't get in. And to say to be totally satisfied it didn't have an injurious effect on the deliberations is a close question, I think.",
  "No, but an equally divided call goes the other way.",
  "If it's not just a close call, but if it's equal, it goes the other way.",
  "You will concede it was a close case, won't you?",
  "If you take five weeks it's pretty clearly a close case.",
  "It has to be close on an alternative murderer. It wasn't suicide. Obviously, if he didn't do it, somebody else did. So if it's a close case from the first, it's obviously a close case for the second.",
  "Yes, but we don't know what they would have done if they had this evidence that was excluded. That's the problem.",
  "That was all presented to the jury, right?",
  "May I ask one sort of preliminary question. Supposing the prosecutor misstated the law in his closing argument. Would that be reviewable in this Court under AEDPA?",
  "Do you think his argument here contained any misstatements of the law?",
  "You don't.",
  "Don't you think the argument based on the General Patton analogy told the jurors they had a duty to do what he suggested?",
  "What is the relevance of that argument otherwise?",
  "Do you think if he said in so many words, you have a duty to return the death penalty, that would have been a misstatement of the law?",
  "And you don't think this could be so interpreted? You don't think you could interpret that, that passage, that way?",
  "I suppose your concession about the duty is based on Chief Justice Stone's opinion in Viereck, isn't it?",
  "Which did involve the very word \"duty.\"",
  "Chief justice Stone's opinion in Viereck talked about telling the jury that they have a duty and condemned that. That's probably why you made the concession, I think.",
  "May I ask you this question about your position: We are trying to find cases that clearly establish law by decisions of this Court. Do you include in that group of cases, cases such as Berger against the United States, and Viereck against the United States, which were direct review of Federal cases in which they say there was a denial of the fair trial, but they're not setting aside State cases? Would it be proper for the Court of Appeals to rely on those cases?",
  "Even though those cases say in so many words it deprives you of a fair trial.",
  "May I go back to my question? Because there's a legal question here about what law we can look to under AEDPA. And actually, of course, it is a question of whether AEDPA applies, I suppose. Because actually, wasn't this habeas petition filed two days before AEDPA was -- there's a footnote in the red brief that says -- raises that question.",
  "May I ask this question before you sit down? In the Viereck opinion, Chief Justice Stone reversed in that case. And one of the reasons was the prosecutor indulged in an appeal wholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case, the purpose and effect of which could only have been to arouse passion and prejudice. That's part of our Federal law. Is that law applicable in this case, do you think?",
  "Well, it is either directly -- it's either yes or no.",
  "That rule can be ignored by State prosecutors?",
  "Well, it is - -",
  "Well, the question, I suppose, is whether that is a constitutional rule. It is established by the Supreme Court of the United States, an opinion written by Chief Justice Stone a good many years ago. But you're argument is it is not applicable to State prosecutors, as I understand it.",
  "Mr. Blume, before your time is up, I want to ask you one other question. I'm still troubled about whether AEDPA applies. And was it argued in any court below? Was the question actually ruled on after an adversarial presentation as to whether AEDPA applies or does not apply? As I understand it, it either does or it doesn't and it doesn't matter whether it was argued. But was it discussed in any of the lower court decisions?",
  "Two days before the act.",
  "No, I mean in this proceeding.",
  "And if Lawrence had gone the other way, then it also -- then it would be right. In other words, whether AEDPA applies really is a function of our decision in Lawrence?",
  "Mr. Olson, suppose just the dealers in New York, the retail dealers agreed among themselves on the price. Would that be lawful?",
  "Would you say that it's per se unlawful?",
  "Why should that be any different from the arrangement where those dealers all got together in the convention and recommended to the manufacturer that he impose a vertical restraint of precisely the same dimensions? Why - -",
  "No, but I'm asking what if he did, why should you draw a distinction?",
  "No. They just passed a resolution asking the manufacturer to impose this vertical restraint and ways to do it. Should that be different from one in which the manufacturer does it independently?",
  "No, but there was in the patent case, though, Mr. Olson. We relied on the fact that the patent law changed.",
  "Yes.",
  "Wouldn't your argument also apply to a conspiracy among the New York dealers in this product just to fix prices? Because there's plenty of interbrand competition, I think. I don't think you can say it's absolutely clear that that would always be anti-competitive because they would also agree to provide additional services.",
  "I'm talking about a case in which it's the dealers who want to agree to provide extra services at higher prices as their method of better serving the public and they all agree that they have to be conscious about the competition from other brands. Why can we be absolutely certain that's always going to be harmful to the consumer?",
  "They might be precisely the statement as the manufacturers: We think we'll make more, all make more money if we concentrate on service rather than price.",
  "Yeah, but the conspiracy that it facilitated was just with intrabrand competition. There wasn't conspiracy that affected interbrand competition.",
  "So I'm not sure that economically it makes any difference whether the dealers are the one who decide to do it or the manufacturer was, or they all did it at the same time.",
  "No, but if we say the rule or reason should apply to all cases that just affect intrabrand competition, I'm not sure why we should keep this outmoded rule about horizontal conspiracies that only affect intrabrand competition.",
  "Am I correct on the congressional point that there was a period when Congress would have prohibited the Solicitor General from making the argument he made today?",
  "So there was a legislative expression of a position on this particular issue?",
  "But you're just giving them an additional ground for termination.",
  "You're just giving, you're just suggesting we should give them an additional ground for termination.",
  "And the person who did the reliance was you, I guess?",
  "And is it correct that - - who -- was this litigant represented by counsel during the period when he didn't get the notice of the September 9 order?",
  "So neither the, neither the prisoner nor you received any notice of the first goof up?",
  "I see.",
  "I know I could find this out by looking at a calendar. Do you remember what day of the week February 24th was, or 26th?",
  "We don't have a weekend problem, do we?",
  "Let me ask this question: Is the order on page 151 of the joint appendix, just those three lines, that's the entire order that the judge entered? It just says granted, and motion - -",
  "He did not make the findings that the rule requires?",
  "Because the motion requires - -",
  "The rule requires that he make three specific findings which he did not make.",
  "May I ask this question. Supposing there was a dispute as to whether the order had been entered on February 10 or February 12. Say his handwriting was illegible. Would that be a dispute that would remain open throughout the appellate process?",
  "If he'd entered this order on February 12 or 13 -- I forget which day it was -- the appeal would have been timely?",
  "And I'm just -- and the order was defective because it didn't make findings required by the rule. And I'm just wondering, supposing it was ambiguous as to the date it was actually entered. Would the party then be entitled to rely on the date, February 27th, set in the order, or would he have a duty to investigate and find out exactly when the judge signed the order?",
  "My question is what if that's somewhat ambiguous? A busy court, he handed it to the clerk and the clerk didn't enter it into the docket. You're not sure, there's a fact dispute about that.",
  "I understand. I'm just wondering what your view is, how should courts resolve that kind of dispute? Should that be a dispute that remains open throughout the appellate process/ There's a factual dispute as to when the judge signed order.",
  "If he had written here, instead of \"2-10,\" he had written down \"2-12,\" then the prosecutor 3 days later realized he had written down the wrong date, would that have made the appeal untimely?",
  "And that's ambiguous, I'm saying. That's ambiguous.",
  "In that case, you then rely on the February 27 date in the order? Then it must be permissible to rely on appeal to be filed by 2-27? In such a case it would be okay.",
  "I know, and I say it's hard to figure out when the order was actually written down in the docket.",
  "And not rely on the 2-27 date.",
  "Mr. Stewart, that's one those interesting examples. We lack jurisdiction of the case but we have power to order it refiled, to vacate the order and have it refiled, don't we?",
  "But it begins with the exception as provided in subparagraph (c).",
  "Yeah.",
  "Mr. Mancino, does the record tell us how you got notice of that order?",
  "You, you got that order in the mail?",
  "But how did you find out it had been entered on February 10? Because you did know that at the time you filed your notice of appeal.",
  "Mr. Shapiro, to what extent has the SEC regulated the specific vertical restraints that are alleged here?",
  "And laddering, for example?",
  "And are we to assume that if the allegations are true, which they of course may not be, that this is a violation of the -- of the securities laws?",
  "The allegations in this are quite different from Gordon. There you have got a horizontal -- allegedly horizontal agreement. Here you have got a vertical agreement which it seems to me depends on non-disclosure for it work at all. If there been full disclosure of all these laddering and flippings I don't see how in the world you would ever get a -- an antitrust violation.",
  "The difference between this case and Gordon is that this case, the heart of their allegations are failure to disclose which is quintessentially the SEC's business, making sure disclosures are right. I don't think if there were disclosure, they would have a problem in this case. Am I missing something on that?",
  "The allegation in the complaint is there was no disclosure.",
  "The allegation is the agreement -- the agreement not to disclose.",
  "Let me just ask one more question, Mr. Shapiro. Supposing there had been full disclosure here. Do you think there would be an antitrust violation?",
  "Agreeing on what the - -",
  "The preliminary before the IPO. But what they did after the IPO, would that violate the antitrust laws?",
  "May I ask this question about the laddering and so forth? If it were fully disclosed, would it be unlawful under either statute.",
  "I can see how they would affect the market if they were disclosed.",
  "May I ask you if your conspiracy allegation would be the same if there were only one underwriter?",
  "It is critical to your case that there are multiple underwriters?",
  "What if we thought that the activities of the multiple underwriters were Comparable to a single joint venture? In many respects they're like a joint venture. Would that mean your whole case could collapse? In other words, I'm really wondering to what extent you're depending on your horizontal agreement as opposed to the vertical arrangements like laddering and flipping and that sort of thing.",
  "If there had just been the vertical agreements and if they had been fully disclosed, there would no antitrust violation, would there? If there had just been publicly disclosed agreement by one underwriter with the purchasers to engage in these activities, there would be no violation, would there?",
  "Mr. Phillips, can I ask this question?",
  "One of the amicus briefs talks in terms of the percentages, how likely the inference, the word strong inference means 50 percent, 30 percent, 60 percent. Do you think the inference has to be stronger or less strong than the inference of probable cause in an affidavit for a search warrant to get access to the privacy of a home and so forth?",
  "A civil case would impose a higher standard for getting discovery in a civil case than they would for getting access to a citizen's private papers and the like?",
  "May I just -- may I just, very briefly. . Putting aside the constitutional problem, do you think the standards are the same or different between the pleading stage and the constitutional stage -- and the summary judgment stage?",
  "I understand that. That's not my question.",
  "It is either a yes or no question.",
  "Then it seems to me that you have the meaning of strong inference and reasonable inference.",
  "You don't want to answer yes or no there?",
  "So you're saying those words, strong inference, mean essentially the same thing as reasonable inference.",
  "Mr. Miller, going back just to the word strong, forgetting the particularization from it, do you think you can categorize the strength in percentage terms? They have to be more than 50 percent? More than probable cause? We're talking all abstractly here and I find it easier to think when I think about numbers.",
  "At least we know that in the probable world - -",
  "Let me just reclaim the question. Is it stronger or weaker than probable cause in a criminal context?",
  "It's not trial worthy, but rather discovery worthy.",
  "I think the question is not whether it's trial worthy, it's whether it's worthy for discovery. That's really what's at issue in this.",
  "Surely it could prohibit discovery altogether which it did before they adopt in 1938.",
  "Mr. Frederick, may I just follow up on Justice Breyer's question? It seems to me that your answer suggests that you have two bites at the apple because you -- all the way along, you might win. And if you won, then it wouldn't matter. If you lose, you always have the argument that you've made here, let's go back and start over again.",
  "Yes, but - -",
  "But you might win that litigation. It's not impossible, is it?",
  "And if you lose, you always have a point on appeal and may start all over again later on.",
  "Can you help me with - -",
  "I just want to be sure your position. Assume that there is a remand that was improper and cannot be appealed under your theory and the Powerex argues all along, I was entitled to a Federal forum and a non-jury trial. And the State court says no all the way up. Can they file a petition for certiorari saying, we had a Federal right that was denied us, not the remand but our entitlement to a bench trial? Can they petition for certiorari at the end of the State proceeding in your view.",
  "I'm just wondering what your position is.",
  "Mr. Farr, would you agree that the position expressed in the notice itself would have -- in the original notice would have been consistent with the statutory language?",
  "Well there would be a basis in terms of the size of the third-party employers.",
  "Mr. Salmons, can I ask you a question about the importance of the whole litigation. Am I correct in believing that there's a provision in the law that protects the defendants from damages liability if they relied in good faith on the regulation, so that what we're really talking about is whether the regulation would apply in the future rather than there being a damage issue in the case?",
  "That would clearly apply to this case, would it not?",
  "So in your view we're really faced with a question of whether the regulation should be given prospective effect.",
  "As to whether the Government's position should be given prospective effect because the past liability doesn't -- the damage liability just doesn't exist.",
  "You're saying it's permissible to change the rules because the industry has changed. Is it not possible that the industry changed at about the time the statute was enacted? That the prevalence of third-party employers is something that really developed later?",
  "How long has that been the government's -- the EPA position? How long has that been the EPA's interpretation of the statute?",
  "Has that always been the EPA's position? Because there's an allegation in one of the briefs that you changed your position in this Court, to change the position you took even in the lower courts at issue. Is that - -",
  "But your position was they didn't have to?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, may I ask a question about the memorandum of agreement? That's kind of a new concept that I have a little difficulty following. Is there -- is that, is one of the nine conditions of approval that the State enter into a memorandum of agreement?",
  "Is there not a regulation that issues, that requires the states - -",
  "What's the statutory authority for the regulation?",
  "What if -- what if the State just refused to enter into a memorandum of agreement? Would that, could that be a ground for refusing to transfer decision?",
  "Just says don't want -- it just says we don't want to enter into a memorandum of agreement, period.",
  "-- that require the making of a memorandum of agreement.",
  "But how can that be consistent with your shall argument?",
  "May I ask this question about changing position? Have you agreed and conceded that the nine statutory criteria are satisfied?",
  "You shift back and forth on that point.",
  "What is your view now? Are they or are they not?",
  "And it's in your discretion -- your distinction to the snail darter case is that the decision to built the dam is discretionary, not mandatory?",
  "May I go back to the Chief's question about the failure to object? I think I got the impression from Judge Kozinski's opinion that he thought that the Washington Supreme Court found that with respect to two out of the three jurors at issue that there had been a finding that they were substantially impaired, but with respect to this juror, that the Washington Supreme Court seemed to rely on the failure to object as the principal explanation for their decision.",
  "Isn't this perhaps just such a case? Because this finding by the Supreme Court of the State is based only on the written record, so it does not get any benefit of observing the demeanor of the witness -- I mean, the demeanor of the prospective juror; isn't that correct.",
  "So if we disagreed and thought there was not evidence in the written record that would support that conclusion, we should not give deference to that appellate court finding.",
  "May I ask to be sure I understand the record, because I did miss something before. Did the trial judge say in so many words that Deal's views would have prevented or substantially impaired his ability to follow the court's instructions and abide by the rules of the jurors?",
  "So that's the point of the absence of objection. That's why he didn't make the critical finding.",
  "Because the judge didn't make the critical finding.",
  "Please finish up the thought because you're equally well prepared. How do we know the trial judge would have made that a finding if there had been an objection?",
  "Does that respond to the possible suggestion that Judge Kozinski made that what he really did was act on the basis of no objection, rather than on the basis of a finding that he failed to make?",
  "But doesn't it follow that his limited cases, the views about when the death penalty is appropriate would translate into views of whether he could or could not impose the death penalty if instructed properly by the court?",
  "Doesn't it have to be automatic in order to justify the result in this case?",
  "Isn't there a world of difference, at least it has been my experience in trials like this of what a juror will do on his own and what he thinks the law might be, and what is fair, and so forth, as opposed to what a, the juror will do in response to proper instructions?",
  "The jurors mostly are pretty conscientious.",
  "Is there any reason to believe this guy wasn't?",
  "Well -- without -- because there was no objection.",
  "May I ask, one of the most troubling parts about this case is the failure to object. As I understand, under Washington law, that doesn't making any difference, the review is exactly the same as it would have been if there had been an objection. But under our review as a matter of constitutional law, should it make a difference?",
  "Do you have any response to Justice Kennedy's concern that this really allows for a mouse trapping of the trial judge who very likely would have paid less attention to the issue as long as any counsel doesn't object, just as a realistic way that this kind of thing is handled?",
  "If I can get back to my concern about the failure to object again. Supposing this defense counsel instead of just saying no objection, said no objection, I think he's a hanging juror?",
  "In other words, he thought contrary to the prosecutor, his appraisal of this man was that he's going to be pro-death penalty, and he let that be known. Would that make a difference?",
  "I don't think it would under Washington law. I don't suppose it would.",
  "No, no. The juror just did what he did, but everybody was evaluating his demeanor in the courtroom, and defense counsel's evaluation was to mean I don't want that juror, he's going to hang my client, and that's what he thought and he let it come out when he told the judge no objection.",
  "Would that make a difference?",
  "You did. Do you think it should make a difference to us if we think that he didn't really want this guy on the jury?",
  "Would this case be different if the defendant had consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction?",
  "So if this had been, if they had entered into a consent decree covering just the one event on the front burner, that would have been?",
  "But if they consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction, why wouldn't that be equally binding?",
  "Well, they were able to go ahead with their one demonstration that precipitated the litigation, and they would have been able to do it the same way if they had a consent decree instead of having the other side not fight very vigorously in opposition to the preliminary.",
  "But then why isn't the attorney -- if there were a consent decree -- I don't understand the difference.",
  "But you would get attorney's fees for the preliminary injunction work, even though you lost on that?",
  "Yes, but assume the district court thought he was right at the preliminary injunction, and ruled otherwise at the permanent junction. But what if the court of appeals when it reviews the fee application, thinks he was wrong both times?",
  "Is the district court.",
  "But maybe the court of appeals is in the best position to determine whether they made an error of law or not.",
  "And if they think he made an error of law, what should they do?",
  "No, there's no reverse. It's too late. They've had the demonstration so it's all over. But in reviewing the fee application, the court of appeals concludes that the district judge - - the decision represented an incorrect premise of law and therefore, he did make an error. Would that control or would the district judge's view of the validity of his own decision control?",
  "It's a direct appeal on the fee issue.",
  "Let me ask you this. Is it correct that an underlying principle of law that justified your claim for relief and your actual relief was that there's some First Amendment right to demonstrate in the nude?",
  "And what is the support in our cases for that proposition, if any?",
  "It's not just a question of weaker, but what Congress intended when they wrote a statute authorizing these fees.",
  "And these trump the literal language very definitely.",
  "Yes. But in this very case, if you had gotten a TRO instead of a preliminary injunction, you'd have exactly the same practical situation.",
  "May I ask this, what is your response to the, one of your earlier questions. Suppose they sent out a general brochure to all the graduating grammar school students to -- advertising that they come up to Brentwood and so forth and so on, and the rule prohibited that? Would that rule be valid?",
  "But isn't the coach recruiting just a subcategory of a broader - -",
  "I'm not asking you about the school for the rule. I'm trying to figure out what's the scope of the First Amendment protection.",
  "You do agree at some point the First Amendment would prohibit some kind of rule.",
  "Is that permissible, in weighing the -- both sides of the equation to consider the advantages -- I mean the justifications for the speech?",
  "-- justification for the rule in this case and the justification for the rule that would prohibit the general solicitation I described.",
  "Is it the same justification, but the justification is a little stronger in one hypo than the other?",
  "Mr. Blumstein, am I not correct for purposes of our decision, if you're claiming constitutional protection, you're claiming that you'd be constitutionally protected even if you knew in advance that this particular communication would violate the rule and even if you did it deliberately? That's what your constitutional position is, is it not?",
  "Is it or is it not?",
  "It is.",
  "So that what really, you're -- it is sort of a side issue as to whether they really had adequate notice and so forth, insofar as we're talking about the First Amendment?",
  "I thought your claim was that you had a witness available to testify, but you didn't put him on because you didn't think they were going into this issue. That's all.",
  "Well, didn't one of the decisionmakers testify that they relied on this - -",
  "No, but one did.",
  "And did not the district court find that his testimony was credible?",
  "Well, almost by definition a settlement is for the full amount that you'd have to spend without the settlement, almost by definition.",
  "You don't usually settle for 100 percent of your liability.",
  "May I ask just one question about your position on the remedial settlement provision in 113(f)(2)? Do you read it to provide not only immunity from contribution suits but from any other litigation whatsoever?",
  "If there were a claim that didn't really technically qualify as contribution, it would not, it would not provide a bar.",
  "May I ask this question? Suppose after the stop the passenger in the back seat starts to get out and the officer says: Stay in the car. Is he then seized?",
  "Doesn't it mean that the authority to cause the person to stay in the car existed throughout the stop?",
  "Let me ask you this. On a casual street in downtown, if they say, I'd like to stop and talk to you, you don't have to stop. There's no authority to make them stop. But there is authority for the passenger in the back seat of the car.",
  "Is there a difference between legal authority and factual authority?",
  "If there's no difference then there's legal authority.",
  "If there's no difference then there's legal authority, which would mean the person is subject, is in custody of the officer.",
  "But those are encounters in an airport where there are pedestrians; there's no authority to make the person stay, where here I think you've conceded that there is legal authority to require the person to stay where he was.",
  "And if it wasn't a seizure what's the source of the legal authority?",
  "Yes, but isn't your case he doesn't in fact have the authority, he has apparent authority, but in this case he has actual authority, not just apparent authority?",
  "Suppose 10 or 20 years ago we had this case and we decided your way and decided passengers are not seized, and then subsequently we had the question of whether an officer could order a passenger out of the car. What would be held then? Would we have said we can't because he is not seized? Or would you say yes, he was seized. I meant if we decided in your case there is no seizure, would we then have later on, do you think said, notwithstanding the absence of a seizure the officer could order the person out of the car?",
  "But in most situations where an officer meets a person, unless there is a crime scene or something like that, he can't order them to cross the street or go someplace else, can he? He can't issue any order to a citizen.",
  "But he can issue orders to passengers even though they are not seized.",
  "I'm puzzled. Can I just get myself straightened out a little bit? If there is a decision to terminate you're suggesting, you're suggesting that it's after that decision made, is made, there can be a decision to merge which would not be a termination?",
  "Your, your adversary - -",
  "I disagree with you on that.",
  "Your adversary takes a position that the merger would be not a termination.",
  "It would seem to me that a merger is a continuation rather than a termination. And explain to me why I'm wrong on that.",
  "May I ask -- may I ask this question? Suppose another jurisdiction had a tax system which was just a little different from New York's and didn't provide for a lien until after a suit had been brought and there had been a failure to pay or had to get a judgment first. On that case, that jurisdiction could not enforce this tax law?",
  "And don't you think it's sort of a strange way to define a tax immunity, by - - by, by describing the -- the interest in immovable property?",
  "But, but the basic issue in final analysis is whether they have to pay their taxes, isn't it?",
  "The ultimate issue is whether they have to pay their taxes.",
  "Did their practice draw a distinction between occupied by the ambassador himself and property occupied by employees of the embassy?",
  "We will hear argument in No. 06-618, the Office of Senator Mark Dayton against Brad Hanson.",
  "But in the flag case the whole statute was either valid or not. There weren't different applications, were there?",
  "We simply didn't rule hold was a right to burn flags in some cases and not others.",
  "I'm puzzled. Firing somebody is a legislative act?",
  "Firing someone is a legislative act?",
  "And how do we do it? I mean, you've said -- I don't want to go too far with a metaphor, but you spoke a moment ago of there being sort of a, what did you say, a hole or a space in the legislative sphere when somebody is fired. In the sphere at the moment is totally empty. The Senator's gone. Everybody knows that this, this office of Senator Mark Dayton is a totally fictional construct. And in reality, as you point out, the money is going to come out of the Senate or some Senate fund. If we allow this to go forward, we've got to face the reality that it's the Senate which is the defendant and there hasn't been a waiver of immunity.",
  "Mr. Salzman.",
  "What if his dissent -- or defense, rather, to the charge is that he was very inefficient in giving me help in legislative hearings and so forth, or words of that kind which might be arguably a legislative act, and that Speech or Debate Clause forbids inquiry into the quality of his performing those duties?",
  "But maybe the Senator might argue that this is all privileged: It's the reason I fired him, but I can't go into it because I don't want to invade my own privilege not to discuss matters that are covered by the immunity.",
  "That doesn't quite capture the problem that I'm having. It's not that the plaintiff can't inquire. Usually they can't. But my thought is that the defendant cannot put in his own defense without waiving the privilege that would otherwise be applicable. So he's sort of in a dilemma. Either I give up my constitutional right not to talk about this stuff or I've got to waive that right in order to give a full explanation of why I discharged the plaintiff.",
  "Or he just wrote a lousy memo. In order to demonstrate it's lousy, I've got to talk about legislative matters.",
  "Even if the Senator did not have a defense?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Salzman. Mr. Caballero.",
  "Ms. Manning, you have about a minute left.",
  "Ms. Manning - -",
  "Thank you, Ms. Manning. The case is submitted.",
  "Are you trying to convince us the purpose of these ads was to convince Senator Feingold to change his position on filibusters?",
  "Do you think they had much chance? Do you think that was a realistic goal?",
  "May I ask a rather basic question? Do you agree that the Constitution permits Congress to pass a statute that prohibits your using electioneering ads that use magic words?",
  "Would it also prohibit you from using -- urging everyone to look to a web site that used the same magic words?",
  "Yes.",
  "So that if your web site used the magic words, then your ads would be -- could be regulated.",
  "No, but you would agree the statute could be validly applied to an ad that says look at this website, and the web site then uses the magic words?",
  "Well, do you believe that the First Amendment would not be violated by an ad that was the functional equivalent of one that contained magic words?",
  "There might be an upholdable constitutional difference between two ads that convey the same message.",
  "If they're the functional equivalent, by hypothesis, they convey the same message.",
  "You haven't identified the statutory provision that you think provides the authority for the payment in this case.",
  "Justice Alito can defend his own question, but he asked whether or not the Grange stated that this was the purpose.",
  "And then you -- you didn't quite answer that question. You said, oh no, and you gave an explanation. But just as a matter of the historical record - -",
  "-- Justice Alito's question was accurate with respect to the proponent's position, was it not?",
  "Let me ask this question. Is there anything in the State law that would prevent you from requiring a candidate to be a member of the party whose preference he states?",
  "And under the -- under the court's, holding it would be equally unconstitutional if he did that, I suppose.",
  "Indeed, there's -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "Is there any evidence, any historical evidence, that any candidate has ever done what Justice Scalia suggests?",
  "May I ask this question? It's hypothetical, I suppose, but supposing the statute further provided that a candidate may not designate a preference unless he has been a registered member of that party for at least a year, and otherwise the statute is exactly how it is now. Would that be constitutional?",
  "In my hypothesis the person is a real Republican. He is just not the one selected as the candidate.",
  "Even if the information is by statute true, in my hypothetical he must be a member, but still you make the same objections.",
  "You're stating to suppress information. So the plaintiff says there is nothing to prevent the nominee or the convention from publicizing widely the fact that the convention picked me as their standard bearer. The fact that some other member of the party gets his name on the ballot doesn't prevent the public from being informed about the truth, does it?",
  "It would prevent him from running and saying he is a Republican.",
  "Well, but don't you think it's relevant information? Wouldn't a voter like to know whether a person preferred the Democrats or the Republicans?",
  "Only if true.",
  "Let me ask this question: This is a facial challenge, is it not?",
  "And what exactly -- what relief did the district court grant? Did he enjoin the entire blanket primary or just the designation of parties?",
  "Do you think that was the narrowest relief he could have granted to avoid the constitutional difficulty that you see?",
  "Do you think it would be administerable if it was severed, if the preference provision was just deleted?",
  "I'm confused about the difference between a facial challenge and an as-applied challenge. On the one hand, it's very helpful to you. There's no evidence out there that this has ever -- this has ever been a problem, so you've got to attack it right away, but then you have this relief that basically enjoins the whole -- whole procedure.",
  "Yes, but it also seems highly improbable if you have a nominee as a result of a convention, everybody reads the newspapers, they know who the Republican nominee is, that there's going to be such confusion that everybody thinks it's one or two of the other people who also put an R after their name. The likelihood of massive confusion seems highly improbable to me. I mean you -- you have your own convention where you nominate the Republican nominee, your preferred candidate, and that's publicized generally throughout the State, and you're concerned that somebody going into the ballot box won't -- won't understand what's been going on.",
  "But, again, the ballot's not the only information available to voters when they go into the polls.",
  "Isn't it also true that, by hypothesis, there will be other candidates beside the one R and the one D? If there aren't at least two R's and two D's, there is no problem.",
  "But my point is there could never be a ballot just like this, what your opponents are talking about, because there are always going to be at least two or three R's and two or three D's. And the sample shows there is only one, which must then be the party chosen -- I mean the nominee chosen at the convention.",
  "May I interrupt before you answer. The question isn't whether they can justify a reasonable. It's whether they can justify not following one that creates unwarranted disparities within the meaning of the statute.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, can I ask a question right at the outset that is critical for me. I think this case may well be controlled by the decision in Neal against the United States, which is not cited in the government brief and wasn't cited in the blue brief. But there the Court held that a policy judgment by Congress fixing mandatory minimums on the basis of the weight of the carrier rather than the drug did not justify guidelines based on that ratio -- based on the same principle -- if that would produce unwarranted disparities. And, as I understand the facts of this case, the Commission has told us actually in some of its reports that the 100 to 1 ratio does produce unwarranted disparities. Therefore, we should disregard the entire guideline as we did in Neal, and the reason the Neal case is controlling in this case.",
  "But that is a construction of what Congress intended, and for purposes of decision we assumed that Congress intended what we held the statute meant.",
  "It does hold that a guideline that does not conform with a congressional judgment merely expressed in a mandatory minimum is a guideline that would survive.",
  "Yes, but there's also more data that the Commission has reflected on all this and still concludes that the 100 to 1 ratio creates an unwarranted disparity which is contrary to the statute.",
  "It establishes the ratio for mandatory minimum purposes only, is what Neal held.",
  "But those are the same cliff effects that are the product of Neal, precisely the same.",
  "In response to that statute, did the commission revise the guideline that was involved in Neal?",
  "Shouldn't it have done it?",
  "But is it not true that that only affects about 20 percent of the crack cocaine cases, because they say -- maybe I'm wrong on this - - that 80 percent of the sentences are actually fixed by the mandatory minimum?",
  "I was -- and correct me if I'm wrong. I was under the impression that 80 percent of the sentences that are actually imposed are at the mandatory minimum.",
  "Isn't this another alternative? If the district judge concluded, as some scholars have, that the 100 to 1 ratio itself creates unwarranted disparities, could not a district judge sentence by just disregarding the guideline for this particular substance? And then use just ordinary principles, what's appropriate sentencing in this case.",
  "You have a conflict in the statute. One says await the guideline. Another says avoid unwarranted disparities.",
  "Is it not a fact that this guideline is also unique in that it was not based on a history of other similar crimes like all the other - - most of the guidelines were? There's no expert interpretation of the history of sentencing in this particular area?",
  "I understand. This guideline is pretty much unique in that regard. It is not based on experience in sentencing in comparable cases.",
  "The 100 to 1 ratio is not based on history?",
  "Therefore, none of the sentencing guidelines relating to crack are based on history.",
  "So there is really an entirely different rationale for defending these guidelines than any other guidelines in the system?",
  "One question. Why couldn't, if there is some kind of substantive standard of reasonableness, why couldn't a court of appeals in a particular circuit say that -- if one judge relies on age, 19, and the other judges do not, why couldn't the court of appeals say that one of those two positions is unreasonable?",
  "There could be a common - - sort of a common law of reasonableness developed through the public process?",
  "May I ask, we've been talking about a lot of hypotheticals. Is there any dispute, any claim that any of the facts on which the district judge relied in this case were improper - -",
  "-- that they were out of harmony with what's done throughout the country?",
  "Excuse me, may I ask this question because it comes up throughout your brief, and you've used percentages to decide when a case is sufficiently outside the Guidelines to justify a special hard look. You used the term \"dramatically\" in your brief. At what percentage point is the threshold that this standard of review kicks in?",
  "So you do not rely on a percentage as kind of the magic basic test?",
  "I think some of the courts of appeals seem to.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, do you think there are any facts that would have justified probation for this particular crime?",
  "What is the difference between the facts in this case and the ones which you would find acceptable?",
  "I'm asking about whether in cases exactly involving the crime we have here, whether any such cases would justify probation, where the culpability was exactly the same as there was here.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, you are saying that you admit there's no presumption of unreasonable merely because it is outside but there is a presumption of reasonable if it dramatically or significantly is outside and you don't define dramatically or significantly?",
  "You are not able to give any definition. You disavow a percentage. You just come up with nothing else. Just the word dramatically. You do say it is a presumption at that point by - -",
  "Mr. Dreeben, can I ask another question? I go back to percentages for just - - to illustrate the point. You say that the justification has to be responsive to the extent of the departure. And you -- you kind of disavow percentages that trigger -- you say substantial. But how do you measure the strength of justifications? For example in this case, there were four or five justifications -- withdrawal from a conspiracy, youth, that he got over alcoholism, so forth. Is the judge supposed to put a percentage value on each of those justifications and see if they add up to the percentage? And if not, aren't you comparing oranges and apples?",
  "Does that call for a 40 to 50 percent justification?",
  "But don't you read the court of appeals opinions as in effect saying we've got to get a percentage that matches the percentage of departure?",
  "Can I ask you -- if it wipes it out entirely, does that make this case different or like a case in which the maximum was say - - was 30 years instead of 30 months? Are they both to be judged by the same standard on the justification?",
  "Supposing the guidelines provided 30 years? Would the justification for probation in that case have to be just as strong as in this case?",
  "Because the percentage is really irrelevant - -",
  "It would -- then the percentage is irrelevant, if you said it has to be stronger in that case.",
  "Maybe the question presented doesn't present it -- -",
  "But I think the facts of the case do present it. I mean, it's theoretically possible we could agree with you on the profits issue, but nevertheless say this doesn't fit the promotion.",
  "I understand all that, but we can still do it if it's perfectly obvious that that's the right way to dispose of the case.",
  "-- Mr. Roberts -- that the gambling offense is conducting a gambling business, so it makes it -- it is not just the gambling itself - -",
  "You are saying it would not be covered as money laundering, but nevertheless it would be illegal and be punished as gambling.",
  "And everything they've done here would be punished as gambling - -",
  "Can you imagine running a illegal gambling business and advertising your expenses? I mean, you have got to conceal these - -",
  "But it's not additional conduct. That's the point.",
  "Well, what about - -",
  "Didn't Justice Kennedy asked if the Kusper case was correctly decided?",
  "May I ask you this question, Mr. Schwarz. Supposing that the statute did not contain the delegate-selection process and instead, said: Delegates shall be selected by the county chairman in each county and by the organization. Would it then be unconstitutional?",
  "By party officials.",
  "I'm just saying just eliminate this whole folderol about picking delegates and say the county chairman shall pick the delegates, period. I don't see why that would be unconstitutional.",
  "Mr. Schwarz, you're talking about the election of the judge or the election of the delegate? I think you're mixing two oranges and apples there.",
  "It -- the evidence shows the thumb on the scale is just as strong as if the party chairman picked the delegates. And, therefore, it seems to me, it presents the question of whether it would be unconstitutional to enact a statute that allows the party chairman to pick the delegates.",
  "They're all policy arguments about why this is a terrible statute. They're not necessarily constitutional arguments.",
  "And that's a vast difference.",
  "Mr. Shapiro, what is your strongest case, in your view, for the reliance requirement?",
  "Central Bank itself?",
  "Mr. Shapiro, in your judgment, is the reliance requirement an element of the violation or of the private cause of action?",
  "Mr. Hungar, I want to be sure I understand one part of the government's position. You do take the position that there has a violation of 10b-5?",
  "Were the other elements present?",
  "Do you have an opinion as to whether there was a violation of 10(b) in this case?",
  "You don't have an opinion?",
  "I know you haven't taken a opinion?",
  "You have not reached opinion as to whether there was a violation of the statute?",
  "He agreed to let the other party to the transaction use a gun to pay for the drugs, the other party to make the use of the gun.",
  "If you're on the other side of the transaction, it's perfectly natural to say I used the gun for the transaction. What is the converse sentence? I used the gun - -",
  "I didn't use the gun as a medium of exchange. I accepted the gun as a medium of exchange. He didn't use it until he got it.",
  "But you don't have the simple sentence. I used the gun to pay for the drugs - - that's easy, but you don't have a simple countervailing sentence.",
  "Yes but Justice Breyer made the very persuasive argument that it doesn't make sense to treat both sides of the transaction exactly the same; but isn't it the fact that in many drug transactions the buyer is not treated the same way as the seller? It's a crime to sell poison drugs but it may not be a crime to buy the poison drugs.",
  "But generally speaking buyers and sellers are not always treated alike in the criminal law, are they?",
  "Yes, but the argument in Justice O'Connor's opinion was largely linguistic. The natural use of the word \"use\" is to say: I used it to pay for the gun -- I used it to pay for the drugs, rather. But you don't have a countervailing sentence that fits into anything in her opinion, and you haven't really answered his reliance on the -- on the other case, which requires active use.",
  "Something just occurred to me. When you distinguish the case,our unanimous opinion requiring active use, you said, well, that - - that gun was in the trunk of a car so -- what if this gun had been in the trunk of the car also and the guy said, well, it's now -- that's your gun?",
  "Well, they just transferred ownership in exchange for drugs with -- by transferring title to a gun that was located in the - - in the trunk of a car.",
  "So it -- it was not sufficient in -- in Bailey in any case, but it would be sufficient here because it played a role in the transaction?",
  "Thank you.",
  "May I - -",
  "May ask this question? I don't think you've answered the Chief Justice's original hypothetical. It's easy, of course; they cannot compel us to violate our Constitution by a judgment of their kind. But what about the hypothetical that they said the sentence for this man should be 5 years, not just there be an investigation to see if he's been prejudiced. Would we have to follow that judgment?",
  "In this very case.",
  "This very case. Supposing they had said the judgment is that Medellin should spend 5 years in jail and no more. Would we have to honor that judgment?",
  "You're arguing it's just the normal choice of law problem, that even though the judgment's clearly wrong on the matter of international law, if the court had judgment -- had jurisdiction to enter the judgment, we must treat it as binding?",
  "That's provided that we regard these individuals as though they're tantamount to the parties to the judgment itself.",
  "May I ask a question, please?",
  "It's critical to me to understand the effect of the judgment, and you said there are six reasons why it's not an ordinary judgment. I really would like to hear what those reasons are without interruption from all of my colleagues.",
  "Mr. Cruz, could I go back to your discussion of whether this is a judgment or not? It seems to me some of your reasons actually go to whether the -- whether it was a correct interpretation of the treaty. And if it were a judgment, would you agree that this Court would have to accept it, even if this Court disagreed with its legal analysis?",
  "How is it given away to a treaty if it just says one State court must honor a judgment of a sister State even if it thinks it's dead wrong? Is it giving away its judicial authority by obeying the Full Faith and Credit Clause?",
  "Even if it was agreed by treaty to give it conclusive effect?",
  "And so they have -- the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals didn't adopt a simple solution of the case, to say He got all the protection; that there's no prejudice and therefore there's no treaty violation.",
  "Yes, but that statute really would not have divested -- if I understand he Texas law correctly -- if you did agree -- which you don't, I know -- that there was a preexisting Federal obligation to honor judgments of the ICJ, then under Testa v Katt principle and Howlett opinion and others, the Texas court would have had jurisdiction.",
  "Well, but Sanchez-Llamas doesn't deal with the judgment. And It says a separate Federal obligation - -",
  "Then I think the Texas - - there would be jurisdiction in the Texas court to entertain this claim. I think you -- you agree with that?",
  "Well, I'm -- you just -- for -- putting the President's assertion to one side, it seems to me if you did agree -- and I know you vigorously don't -- that there were a pre-existing Federal obligation -- an obligation of the United States to respect the judgment of the ICJ, which is -- which we think is wrong as a matter of international law; we have previously construed the treaties to the contrary -- but if there were an independent obligation to expect - - Federal obligation -- respect that judgment, it seems to me that that obligation could be enforced in Federal court.",
  "You don't.",
  "Yes.",
  "But even if it's a term of art, do you contend that client was not engaged in a transaction subject to the rules.",
  "What is the scope of the term \"transaction\" in your view? What does it cover?",
  "In fact between either the buyer or the seller and the clearinghouse, not the clearinghouse, the FCM or whatever?",
  "And who are the parties to the transaction?",
  "And the intermediaries are not subject to the transaction either though they are liable either for the purchase rights or the sale rights?",
  "They are not parties to the transaction.",
  "But you can expose them to millions of dollars in liability.",
  "But they are subject to liability if the transaction doesn't -- isn't consummated.",
  "Are they persons engaged in contracts subject to the rules -- are they persons engaged in transactions subject to the rules?",
  "Who are subject to the rules in your view? It doesn't include the FCM, it doesn't include the broker, it doesn't include the trader.",
  "I was under the impression from the briefs, and maybe I'm wrong, that you did not defend the reasoning of the Second Circuit. Am I right or wrong?",
  "Which was the principal basis for its decision.",
  "But even if the - -",
  "But, Mr. Pincus, even if you limit it to the word \"trades,\" it does not necessarily follow that the only parties to the trade are the original buyer and the original seller. There are two intermediates who participate in the execution of the trade.",
  "Does it include this transaction?",
  "Why do you say - -",
  "Why do you say that Klein had no role in it? It was an indispensable party to the transaction.",
  "Before it was completed he participated, he was -- he functioned as a guarantor.",
  "It was cleared by the time it was over.",
  "There is no distinction between A and D, but before it can be consummated B and C have to play a role.",
  "Aren't there lots of situations in which a various -- serious -- harms a whole bunch of people, and they all recover?",
  "You would agree if the client had been trading on its own account with a scalper, it would have been able to recover for the - - for its loss to itself; right?",
  "If it's trading for itself and some for other customers, it only can recover half of those. Does that make sense?",
  "May I ask, following up on Justice Alito's question, has there ever been a debate in earlier stages in this litigation as to whether this was a detention?",
  "Because if it were not a detention, then you'd win.",
  "I'm just wondering why you didn't make the argument somewhere along the line.",
  "But it is clear -- there are so many exceptions from exceptions from exceptions, that you get a little mixed up, but I am clear, am I not, that if it were not a detention, you would win?",
  "Everybody agrees.",
  "And is it also not clear that under the government's -- I guess I should ask them, but I got it right in front of me now -- if you deleted the words \"officer of customs or exercise or any other,\" if you just took those words out of the statute, it would then mean exactly what the government contends it means?",
  "If you - -",
  "No, but -- but a short time ago you said there was no basis for distinguishing between excise officers and all other law enforcement officers. But there was indeed a basis for it, namely that there was an alternative remedy for people specifically named in the statute, which is not true of all other officers. It's true now, but it wasn't then.",
  "I'm not suggesting that, but that is a reason for drawing a distinction between all others and this particular claim.",
  "It didn't serve that purpose before 2000.",
  "But you are talking about the use of the word \"any\" all by itself. Here it says \"any officer or customs or excise or other\" -- \"or other,\" and you would just take those words out of the statute.",
  "But you believe they add nothing to the text of the statute.",
  "At any time in consideration of these statutes did Congress consider, to your knowledge, perhaps making the test be the length of the actual sentence served rather than eligibility for -- it seems to me one normal way of differentiating between those who are most trustworthy and those less trustworthy would be by looking at the actual sentence served.",
  "Supposing the underlying movie is a depiction of atrocities being committed in some foreign country, in a war zone or something, by soldiers who rape young kids. And so it comes within the literal terms of the statute. And if one said I'd like to take a look at this movie, wouldn't that be covered by the statute?",
  "The movie itself would be pictures of soldiers raping young kids.",
  "If the news -- I'm thinking of the news reel -- somebody makes as exhibit at a war crimes trial, or something like that -- sees this actually happening. Now, as I understand the language of the statute, if the person who had that film described it to someone he wanted to send it to, he would violate the statute.",
  "They are.",
  "Depiction of a war crime taking place? He saw that on camera -- that would be a crime?",
  "You do agree I guess that there are some -- there would be some valid as-applied challenges to this statute.",
  "The universe of child pornography includes activities of 17-year olds.",
  "But your basic position is that we should not be making new law. We should be - - we might have misinterpreted the law over the years, but, basically, this Court has no power to change the text of the Constitution or its meaning. I guess Justice Scalia's position is we have all that power in the world.",
  "You're overlooking what I understand to be the basic distinction you're drawing. I know the Chief Justice has cast doubt on it. But I think there is a basic distinction between rights and remedies. And you're holding -- I understand your position to be that the remedy may not be retroactive, even though the decision itself can assume that there would have been a violation from the beginning of the Constitution today we may have misinterpreted before. But if there is a violation of the right, then there's a decision about what kind of remedy shall be imposed. And you can say we will not impose a remedy for past wrongs, even though we must impose them in the future and we can let other states decide whether to post a remedy or not. And that's totally consistent with the holding that the violation is always retroactive, but the remedy may not be.",
  "It is the same as the question of whether to apply the exclusionary rule.",
  "That was a remedial decision. Everybody agreed the knock and announce business was a violation. The only question was on remedy. And there are lots of rights that -- for which there's no remedy. Look at all our implied cause of action cases, you will find many, many examples of that.",
  "May I ask you, just at the outset, when you use the term retroactivity, are you saying there was no violation of the Constitution before the decision, or there just is no remedy for it?",
  "-- one of the cases where the line is drawn when the expiration of the direct review has passed. Is it your view that at that particular point in time a constitutional violation either exists or it does not exist? It's not a remedy question?",
  "Can you give me an example of a case in which this Court candidly said, we're announcing a new rule which was not the law before? Aren't we always interpreting what we thought the intent of the framers was from the beginning, even though we may have gotten it before? What is your best example of a new rule, in the sense it's a different rule of law as opposed to a different remedy? See, all these equitable considerations go to the remedy. But the notion we can make up a new rule of law at will strikes me as a very dramatic departure from what I understand the rule of law to require.",
  "Finality is a condition for fashioning the right remedy. There's no doubt. Everything you say is necessary for treating litigants in a -- in a fair manner. But that all goes to remedy, not to the violation.",

  "May I ask another sort of basic question? The Teague rule is a Federal rule - - the Teague ruling. What is your understanding of the source of that rule? Is it the Court's power to announce, make Federal common law? Or is it a constitutionally mandated rule? I will give you one other decision, cover it all at once. And if it were not a judge-made rule, and rather, it was a statute and it goes beyond regulating Federal habeas corpus proceedings and effects State court proceedings, what provision in the Constitution would have given Congress the authority to enact such a statute?",
  "Interpreting it the way you interpret it.",
  "Which qualifies for the Federal system. Where is the authority to regulate the State system come from?",
  "No. Where would Congress get the authority to require State courts to follow the rule, the interpretation of Teague that you're advancing in this Court, that they may not go beyond the decisions of this Court? What under the Federal Constitution authorizes the Federal government, either judges or Congress, to tell State courts that they cannot do what your opponent argues they should able to do?",
  "I agree when you are talking about what Federal court can do -- administering a Federal habeas corpus. I have no problem. I'm asking where does the Federal authority to tell State courts they cannot do what your opponent says they should be free to do?",
  "In Federal habeas corpus proceedings, yes.",
  "The protection of this Court. What -- why can't they provide more protection? What Federal rule prevents that?",
  "Suppose it is a knock and announce violation. They don't want to apply an exclusionary rule. Can they apply a remedy that will fire any officer who does this? Or will they say, no, you can't do that, because it goes beyond what the Federal Constitution requires?",
  "May I ask this question? I understood you to be arguing that the district court made an error of law in not receiving evidence of a different methodology offered by the railroads. And also, if they conceivably -- if I understood you correctly, you could send the case back, they could then receive the evidence and come to precisely the same conclusion that they already came to. That would be permissible, wouldn't it?",
  "May I ask this question about your position? Supposing Dickerson had adopted the stock-and-debt method and taken the $12 million - - $12 billion figure and said that's really a reasonable basis, and then he ended up with that value. Would you be able to defend that decision with precisely the same arguments that you're making today?",
  "I just wanted to be sure.",
  "I take it this question about the unit rule -- I take it Georgia is figuring out what the entire value of the railroad is throughout the country. Have other States had to make the same determination to apply their unit rules?",

  "Is there any evidence in the record as to how much -- what percentage of the Kentucky bonds are bought by Kentucky residents?",
  "Does it -- do we have it for any State?",
  "-- not really standardize. Even without a tax exemption, residents of Kentucky would be interested in public improvements in Kentucky and have -- give a slight edge in the market to all Kentucky bonds. I think there would be just a natural preference for locally issued bonds.",

  "What do you do with Justice Rehnquist's sentence: \"We think this case affords us an opportunity to adopt a more general rule to govern the applicability of equitable tolling suits against the government\"? Is there an implied exception for Soriano there?",
  "I understand, I think I understand what you're saying, but I thought that the government's distinction of Soriano was that was the general rule for equitable tolling, so it doesn't apply here, which I think is certainly understandable. But you're saying it wasn't even a general rule for equitable tolling?",
  "Let me ask this question, Mr. Stewart. Supposing we didn't have any precedent at all, just the whole -- this is the first time this issue had arisen, and we have the plain language of this statute. Would you not read this statute, without any background, supporting your opponent?",
  "When you read the plain language, you left out the words, \"of which the United States Court of Claims has jurisdiction.\"",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, because it said it in a case -- the issue in the case was whether Franconia was overruled -- I mean, Soriano was overruled. And Justice White thought it was. He said so in so many words. And it's interesting that Justice Rehnquist in the majority didn't disagree with that. Rather, he cited Justice White's dissent as part of his description of why some statutes are different from others, then comes to the points that we want to adopt a general rule that applies to all statutes. So it seems to me that the implicit -- in his opinion he did not disagree with Justice White's characterization.",
  "But the interesting part about this is the discussion of the majority of this case is part of its development of the fact that we've got cases all over the lot and we want to adopt a clear rule to apply across the board. So it's part of the reasoning of the Court.",
  "One last question: We disagreed on parts of the Irwin opinion, but I take it you would agree with me that the government was particularly well represented in that case, wouldn't you?",
  "But are you telling us stuff that's not in the record at all? Why is that relevant to the argument here?",

Would that trump the statute?",

  "Yeah.",

You're assuming and the Chief Justice's line of questioning was assuming there's an adequate state remedy available for enforcing this contract, but the whole premise of the statute at the time it was enacted was that there was not a state remedy, because there was a bias against arbitration. And this was thought to be the sole remedy for arbitration at the time the statute was enacted.",
  "May I ask this sort of basic question? Forgetting the text for a minute, what policy reason -- can you think of why would Congress want to prohibit this particular form of agreement?",
  "Why would they want to prohibit an option that takes a little bit longer?",
  "Why do they want to prevent the parties from choosing the option they chose in this case? I don't think that answer says why they'd want to do that.",
  "But then there'd be no arbitration at all. That's right.",
  "But I just don't understand why it makes any sense at all to say this type of arbitration agreement is invalid.",
  "Can I ask a question about your individual point? What if the individual's account was 60 percent of the assets of the total plan? Because different accounts are of different sizes. Would you give the same answer to that?",
  "Even if it was 90 percent, you'd give the same answer?",
  "So just one individual, as far as we know it's a very small percentage of the total. That's the whole case as I understand it.",
  "May I ask this sort of elementary question, and it may reveal my stupidity. But actually sometimes these costs are incurred by individuals, and sometimes they're not. But -- so that you would normally think there's going to be a case-by-case analysis of what happened in the particular case. But do I understand correctly that both you and the government take the position that we should apply the same rule across the board regardless of the actual facts?",
  "That's the most normal reading of the language, it's a case-by-case test. It seems to me the -- probably the most unwise reading, also.",
  "May I ask you the same question I asked your adversary? Whether you use the term \"could\" or \"customarily\" or whatever you're formulating, the bottom line, as I understand your position, is that these costs will never be deductible?",
  "But they will never -- you would not say some trusts yes, and some trusts no?",
  "Would you have to have a case-by-case analysis of the facts as to whether the particular advice would have been sought, whether the advice was by a trustee or by an individual?",
  "Mr. Rubin, is there a subcategory of investment advisors who hold themselves out to be fiduciary investment advisors?",
  "Or even those who advertise themselves as specialists in fiduciary advice? I never heard of them. Maybe there are.",
  "Mr. Farr, is there --",
  "Is there a limit on New Jersey's rights? As long as it's building a wharf, can it do anything it wants to on that or is there -- for example, could it dam up the navigable part of the river in order to build a superstructure on the wharf?",
  "Well, then I should --",
  "I should rephrase it. To what extent, if any, does Delaware place a limit on the way in which New Jersey may exercise its riparian rights?",
  "Any limit whatsoever?",
  "Even if -- even if the building of the wharf interfered with the navigation on the river?",
  "Well, I'm just asking, is it --",
  "-- does Delaware law place any limit on what New Jersey may do in exercising its riparian rights?",
  "I mean, can they validly impose a limit?",
  "And what about the example of using a -- setting a gambling casino or something at the end of the wharf, well into Delaware territory? You'd say Delaware has no right to object to that.",
  "That's not a riparian use.",
  "Anything involving loading and unloading of ships and so forth would be permissible?",
  "May I just interrupt right there, Mr. Frederick? Do you contend that they may no longer build wharves that go beyond the State line?",
  "Well, then boundries don't matter completely.",
  "I don't understand the difference between withdrawing water as not being subject to the police powers. That could mean they could drain the river, in effect.",
  "Mr. Frederick, does the riparian right include the right to dump refuse or sewage into a river?",
  "And even though that would create a nuisance across the river, you could -- they still would have -- who would trump? Who would prevail?",
  "No, I'm assuming something that pollutes the river.",
  "Mr. Stern, can I ask you this question: To what extent are we dealing with a tobacco problem or a broader problem? Do you have other products that are contraband such as -- or have special restrictions on who can ship wild animals, prescription drugs, firearms; or are there other products that you regulate in the same way?",
  "You allow shippers to ship firearms and poisonous substances without having this kind of restriction on it, do you?",
  "But I don't really see why the States have -- have a different interest in regulating shipment of tobacco to minors than they would a variety of other substances that could be harmful to minors or contraband in general. And you don't try to regulate any of those?",
  "By -- by regulating how they may be shipped, I mean.",
  "Before you leave the alcohol point, I don't quite understand the relevance of the 21st Amendment. It seems to me if you can pre-empt -- if Federal law can pre-empt State laws that are authorized by the 21st Amendment, I don't understand how that has anything to do with the preemption issue.",
  "Why isn't it still a State regulation of shipping, even if it's a law that's authorized by the 21st Amendment? I don't see the difference.",
  "What if a new carrier said, well, I'd like to get into the business of shipping tobacco products, none of the other companies want to do it, I want to form -- I'll form my own company. It will meet all these requirements. Would it -- would it then be pre-empted?",
  "Well, they're saying the retailer must use a service that fulfills these qualifications. And if there are services out there, why would the law be pre-empted?",
  "But that's the effect on UPS; is that not right?",
  "Does that foreclose the possibility that somebody else might just specialize in delivering tobacco products, for example?",
  "No, but they are presumed to have read the label, the stamp on the label; isn't that correct?",
  "Would you answer my question? May they presume that if the package is labeled cigarettes, that the delivery -- the delivery person knows that?",
  "When they pick up the package, they don't look at the labels?",
  "That statute is definitely preemptive. A State cannot insist on that. Could they insist on firearms being slipped only in labeled packages?",
  "Could the State do it beyond the Federal requirement?",
  "You mean it's akin to the health exception.",
  "You say it's akin to a health exception.",
  "I am somewhat puzzled. How many bad actors does there have to be before you can draw an inference that someone superior to the bad actors had a motivating part in the whole situation?",
  "Let me ask this, though. Does it show whether the person more senior to the five supervisors involved here was the same person or a different person?",
  "Have we said that 404 applies to corporations? Corporations have a character?",
  "Mr. Bright, may I ask, in your judgment, was all the reference to O. J. Simpson relevant at all to what is before us?",
  "May I ask you about Juror Hawkins. You haven't talked much about him.",
  "Why did they strike him? He seemed to me to be a pretty good juror for the prosecution.",
  "Wasn't he struck before they back-struck the first black on the jury?",
  "So that probably explains why they didn't make a Batson objection.",
  "I understand why the defense would have struck him. I'm trying to understand why the prosecutor - -",
  "My problem -- after the back strike of the first black juror who had been accepted, can they thereafter renew an objection if the jurors two and three, who are accepted on the assumption that there would no - -",
  "Although you could have made an objection. As I understand your opponent, he very helpfully said that they probably would have left the courthouse - -",
  "So what could you - -",
  "Mr. Olson, suppose the manufacturer did not provide information. Would the preemption nevertheless exist?",
  "At least as a theoretical possibility, there could be a newly discovered risk that the FDA never knew about. And, nevertheless, the claim would be preemptive.",
  "Could you answer one thing for me on that? Is that a -- as soon as they get the information requirement, or is it an annual requirement that they have to take - -",
  "Right.",
  "But of course the FDA took this contrary position some years ago.",
  "The converse question is: Could we prosecute a crime committed in Guantanamo by Cubans? And the answer is yes.",
  "General Clement, you said it was modeled after 190-8. Is it identical to 190-8?",
  "How is that personal representative chosen?",
  "Under 190-8, does the defendant have a right to counsel?",
  "As I understand the government's position, these people are not in uniform, so they're not an under the law of war. They have all committed murder, not just fighting a war. That's your theory, I think. They are all committed war crimes. Those that were caught on the battlefield, I mean. I'm talking about those.",
  "That's right. And they are not prisoners of war under the law of war, because they were not in uniform.",
  "I'm talking about common law. I mean under the law of war, the common law of war. They were not prisoners of war.",
  "Their engaging in war-like acts would be the crime of murder or the crime of assault and so forth and so on. That's how I understand your theory in one of these prosecutions is that not --",
  "I mean it is your theory?",
  "Right.",
  "For the duration of hostilities, if you can show that they are enemies.",
  "General Clement, I thought your answer to Justice Breyer -- and maybe I'm missing something -- would be that there is a third alternative which he didn't consider, namely: That these are combatants picked up on the battlefield, and they may be detained indefinitely without proving they committed a crime. And that is your position, I think.",
  "You have a hypothetical claim that a particular prisoner says: I was kidnapped by people who were not in the United States Army and sold for a bounty. And I am -- I just happened to be there when I got kidnapped. And then there is a genuine question of fact as to whether the fact that they may have been sold in that manner justifies detention, which is a different question entirely from whether they committed a violation under the law of war.",
  "Let me interrupt again, and I know your argument. But with respect to those claims, do you make the argument in your brief that some evidence is enough to refute that claim, or do you say it is a preponderance standard?",
  "Isn't the main issue the fact that it has taken six years to have the issue resolved -- \"relevant\" --",
  "They say they have been unlawfully detained for six years from the beginning. And isn't that delay relevant to the question of whether they have been provided such a wonderful set of procedures?",
  "General Clement --",
  "General Clement, your suggested reason why they're right is quite different from the reason they actually gave. They did not reach the question of the adequacy of these procedures.",
  "Yes, but they did not reach this very important part of the whole case. And, Of course, the substitute procedures here are not nearly the same as those in our prior cases of where we sustained the 2255 and district here.",
  "And you say those later cases are not relevant because habeas corpus in the modern world is much broader than it was in 1789. That's part of your point?",
  "Yes.",
  "And the comparison you ask us to make is between what the habeas writ was in 1789, not what the comparison to a habeas writ would be today?",
  "I don't think you would seriously contend that the procedures set forth in the statute are equivalent to those afforded under the habeas writ under today's jurisdiction?",
  "At least you haven't argued that.",
  "On the point I made, I think that's critical to your argument that the substitute is adequate.",
  "I'm not sure I understand it. Are you asking for automatic tolling just until the motion to reopen is decided or until the motion is decided and also the appeal process has run?",
  "Does not he lose his right to have the motion to reopen ruled upon?",
  "But do you also agree with the counter- proposition that if it is not properly administered there is some risk of excruciating pain?",
  "And do you agree that if that risk, say, occurred in every case, that it would violate the Eighth Amendment?",
  "Yes, but isn't it clear that a five gram administration of that drug would be fatal?",
  "It's not in the record, but it's in this document that we received the last few days, this long deposition of Dr. Dershowitz.",
  "And if it doesn't, if you just administerED more of the drug, then what?",
  "I understand.",
  "Would you contend that the second drug in the three-drug protocol is necessary in order to make the execution effective?",
  "Particularly the one that the Chief Justice described.",
  "You don't want to have unpleasant appearance of death at the time.",
  "What is the justification for the second drug when it does, that is the drug that creates the risk of excruciating pain?",
  "Right. I understand that.",
  "The dignity of the process outweighs the risk of excruciating pain?",
  "But then the risk of excruciating pain outweigh the risk of an undignified death?",
  "Even a minimal risk. Everyone who goes through the process knows there is some risk of excruciating pain that could be avoided by a single-drug protocol. Would he prefer to say, I want to die in a dignified way?",
  "Well, what's \"very long? 10 minutes?",
  "They use a single drug protocol for animals because it's more humane than the three drug protocol.",
  "Mr. Englert, can I ask you a rather basic question? Do you think the constitutionality of the three-drug protocol itself is at issue in this case or merely the question whether Kentucky has done an adequate job of using that protocol?",
  "So if we just decide this on the ground -- and the record is very persuasive in your favor, I have to acknowledge -- but if we decide the fact that Kentucky is doing an adequate job of administering this protocol, that would leave open the question whether the basic use of this second drug, which does nothing but avoid unpleasantness of the visitors, is itself constitutional?",
  "Do we have to wait for another case to decide that rule?",
  "Because I -- to be very honest with you, I think that you're -- you make a very strong case on the administration in Kentucky on the record in this case, but I'm terribly troubled by the fact that the second drug is what seems to cause all the risk of excruciating pain, and seems to be almost totally unnecessary in terms of any rational basis for a requirement.",
  "But that we're not going to be able to decide today.",
  "It may have been in this very case, it may be. But that leaves often a whole other area of litigation, is what troubles me.",
  "But no legislature has ever required it, as I understand it.",
  "The three-drug protocol?",
  "But if we held that that justification was insufficient to justify this protocol, it's hardly likely we would hold that it's so serious and make the whole procedure unconstitutional.",
  "The interest in protecting the dignity of the inmate and of the observers is the justification for the second drug.",
  "If we held that that - - that that justification is insufficient to justify the protocol, how could we ever hold that that justification is so serious as to make the whole procedure unconstitutional.",
  "I know it's a different context, but -- it does not relate to the magistrate versus Article III judge, but do you think that a lawyer could stipulate that the judge or a magistrate presiding could do all the questioning and the lawyers would do none, without the -- without the express consent of his client?",
  "It seems to me that the voir dire is peculiarly the -- an area in which the lawyer knows what he is up to and what's at stake, and the client does not.",
  "Do you think a jurisdiction could adopt a rule that was especially careful about selecting the jury panel and then decided they would take the first 12 jurors off an arbitrary list, just to pick them at random and have no voir dire during the trial, just to have a preliminary screening of qualifications of the -- of the entire panel?",
  "May I ask how it works in practice? Does the magistrate's ruling on objections to jurors, are those rulings subject to review by the district judge or are they final?",
  "But in practice, as I understand it, very often the judge will, will review the magistrate's decisions on contested objections.",
  "Can I can ask you sort of an elementary, stupid question? What is the Government's theory as to what this money was? Is it the theory that it was a dividend or that it was salary?",
  "So your theory, just to be sure I understand, it was not salary; it was not a dividend; it was the proceeds of an embezzlement?",
  "It does not have to prove that it was income.",
  "I just want to be sure I have the right answer. You do not have to prove that it was income?",
  "Ms. Maynard, may I just go back to your hypothetical for a second? In the closely held corporation situation you describe where they pay a huge salary to the wife of the president and they decide you can't deduct that, that's really a dividend - - that's what the Government normally does in that situation. And don't they decide it's a dividend irrespective of the intent of the company making the distribution?",
  "So there's no attempt on the part of them to satisfy with \"respect to stock\" requirement?",
  "No, but the only fact and circumstance in your hypothetical is they paid them a million dollars when they only earned",
  "And it's clearly with respect to stock - -",
  "-- regardless of intent?",
  "It's sometimes based on age.",
  "It's sometimes based on age, sometimes years of service.",
  "Am I correct in understanding that your plan does not provide a disability benefit just as a disability benefit? The only time disability is relevant is when it determines whether or not a person will become eligible for the regular retirement benefit?",
  "So that for the old person who has already reached retirement age the fact that he doesn't get a disability benefit is common to everybody subject to the plan.",
  "Isn't that the answer to Justice Breyer's question?",
  "That's because of the period necessary to qualify for retirement?",
  "Let me just interrupt you. Is there -- is it your position there is a disability benefit that is different from the retirement benefit?",
  "I thought that all that disability did was determine -- help get a man who is disabled eligible for the retirement benefit.",
  "That's the only function it provides.",
  "It seems to me your argument boils down to the claim that people who have already reached -- become eligible for retirement by either age or period of service, the State has a duty to give them a chance to recover a disability benefit if they give a disability benefit to younger workers.",
  "The computation is for a different purpose in that -- in -- for the younger workers the purpose is to make them eligible for retirement. For the older workers, they are already eligible for retirement.",
  "The term \"eligibility for retirement,\" as used in that part of the statute, is referring to actually the same thing as retirement achieved by getting their -- getting credit for post-disability years.",
  "May I ask this question right on that point. Supposing you have two different people retire, one -- that become disabled, rather - - one because he's five years short of the age eligibility and the other because he's five years short of years of service, so it would be a younger person, and both would have become eligible for retirement in five years after their disability. Are they treated the same way under the plan? And if they are, where is the discrimination?",
  "Well, first of all, tell me whether they're treated the same way under the plan.",
  "What other variables?",
  "Years of service.",
  "That's a hypothesis.",
  "So then how is that discrimination on the basis of age?",
  "It's not even discrimination as far as I see it.",
  "It seems to me that your claim boils down to an argument that the statute requires someone who is already qualified for retirement to get a disability benefit that the younger person would. It seems to me that's the basic difference.",
  "I see you talking about two benefits.",
  "There not two benefits. It's only one.",
  "Mr. Smith, is there anything in the record about the extent to which the political parties help people get their IDs, as they sometimes drive them to the polls for voting and so forth, the part they play in this process?",
  "Isn't it fair to presume that the parties would play a role in helping people get registered and getting to the polls?",
  "But you don't -- you don't have the photo identification required at registration, do you?",
  "Why wouldn't you have the same from in being sure the registration is correct? I don't understand that.",
  "Why wouldn't you require photo ID then?",
  "Is it the policy to have it tougher to vote than to register? That doesn't make sense to me.",
  "Is it not unrealistic to assume it would be easier to file a lawsuit and go off with the burden of litigation rather than go back to get the second affidavit? If you're challenging two affidavits, you know, to have a Federal case over it seems a little bit improbable.",
  "If you look at the real world impact and you ask whether the Democratic Party has standing to challenge the law, is it relevant that the State legislature is split entirely on party lines?",
  "But don't you think it's fair to infer that this law does have an adverse impact on the Democrats that is different from its impact on the Republicans?",
  "Well, you say he made a custodial arrest. Did he search the defendant at the time of the arrest?",
  "And did he search him at the place of the arrest?",
  "Well, how can this be incident to an arrest?",
  "But the search is unrelated to the arrest, as I understand the facts.",
  "It took place later in a different place.",
  "Well, why is it present if he's not -- he searched when he wasn't arrested? I don't understand. Could they wait a week and do it?",
  "It's an ongoing arrest, is it?",
  "Incident to an ongoing arrest? That's kind of a new concept.",
  "Let me ask this question: You would argue it doesn't matter whether it violated State or Federal law; it's a question of Federal law on probable cause. But does the character of the crime for which the person is being arrested have any relevance to the question whether the search is reasonable? For example, supposing he is arrested for a tax offense; could you go ahead and search him incident to that arrest?",
  "The answer is yes, they could search?",
  "Even though the rationale for the search incident to arrest doesn't apply?",
  "But under that analysis, it seems to you we rely on the citizen's expectation of privacy as the justification. And I think Justice Kennedy makes a rather strong response to that, because it's unrealistic to assume that a citizen in certain counties in Virginia had such an expectation but did not in other counties, because most citizens don't know the sophisticated aspects of the Virginia law.",
  "Could I ask one question that I just want to be sure I understand your position? If we had not granted cert, if you had gone to the administrative agency and the agent had ruled against you, what would you have next done?",
  "To the court?",
  "May I ask this question about your interpretation of the word \"otherwise.\" Do you think it is the equivalent of the statute that omitted that word, but added in \"conduct that presents an equally serious potential risk of physical injury\"? Do you think -- in other words, do you think that the four examples define the risk of physical injury that, the risk of potential physical injury the statute contemplates?",
  "Isn't the significance of Justice Breyer's point that each of the listed crimes is more dangerous when a criminal is carrying a gun, but driving drunk isn't made any more dangerous whether or not there's a gun in the car?",
  "Could you comment on one other point that Judge McConnell made in his opinion? Is there significance in the title of this statute, \"Armed Career Criminal Act.\" Does this statute intend to identify career criminals?",
  "I take it -- supposing there's a dispute between the prosecutor and the defendant as to whether in fact he was a recidivist or not. Is the fact that there was just an argument that he would be a recidivist enough or does the record have to establish that he was a recidivist?",
  "Shouldn't the mere existence of a dispute be enough, because then at least he's potentially subject to being treated as a recidivist.",
  "How would you treat an enhancement - -",
  "So it's not just recidivist and non-recidivist. It's some enhancements, but not all enhancements?",
  "You're depending upon the guidelines.",
  "Well, I understand, but my point is I don't think your proposal just has two categories. There -- it seems there could be multiple kinds of enhancements that would fit your general description.",
  "It's not just recidivist versus nonrecidivist.",
  "Of course, the recidivist doesn't necessarily be a recidivist because he committed the same crime three times. He might have done two very different things under the California three-strike law. Sometimes very minor crimes push the person over to qualify as a recidivist.",
  "Then for double jeopardy purposes you must look at the second offense as the offense, not the offender. I mean, the prior conduct is -- is not being punished as a matter of constitutional law.",
  "Can I go back to sort of a fundamental question I'm not quite sure I know the answer to. Supposing we don't have corporations here, but an individual resident of New York owned this whole business and a big bunch of it was activities in Illinois, and he sold the business. Would Illinois have the authority to impose any tax on that transaction?",
  "I'm assuming it's not the domicile. The owner lives in New York. The business is all over the country, but does millions of dollars of business in Illinois. And they sell the whole business. Would the owner be subject to any tax of any kind in Illinois on that transaction? Could he constitutionally be subjected to any tax?",
  "Assume it's not the domiciliary State.",
  "Could we get an answer without reference to cases? Do you think Illinois would have the authority to impose a tax on that transaction?",
  "Millions of dollars of business in Illinois, that's my assumption.",
  "Could they tax the sale of the business?",
  "You're saying only the domicile could impose a tax?",
  "But if they owned a truck instead of a business, they could tax that transaction, I suppose?",
  "May I ask this question just -- it shows my ignorance, but if the unitary-business approach to taxation was not applied in this case, how did you compute the amount of the tax?",
  "So you use a different formula from the normal three-factor formula to compute the tax?",
  "In the Illinois courts, they did argue that as a matter of Federal constitutional law the tax is impermissible, didn't they?",
  "May I ask this question. Does the record tell us whether other States have sought to tax the capital gain on this transaction?",
  "As far as we know, Illinois is out on its own here?",
  "Ms. Mahoney, can I just get one thing straight in my mind. Which transaction triggered the exhaustion doctrine in your judgment, the general license to Intel or the sale by Intel to Quanta.",
  "Was the license unrestricted? That's one of the reasons I asked the question. Wasn't there a use restriction on the resale?",
  "On the condition that it be sold to someone who would not use it on non-Intel products.",
  "Ms. Mahoney, I understand that's really the way it's been litigated, but I have to confess I was puzzled by the court of appeals' statement that the granting of the license constituted a sale for exhaustion purposes, and they cited the Masonite case for that proposition, but it doesn't seem to me to support that proposition.",
  "It's not exhausted by the manufacturer, is it?",
  "It's exhausted under this view by the licensee's sale of an article that it manufactured pursuant to the license.",
  "And it seems to think there's no distinction between the sale itself and the basic underlying license, whereas I had thought for years that there was recognized a distinction between those two transactions.",
  "Are you saying that this case would come out differently if instead of just requiring a notice that the -- the item should only be used on Intel products, that had been a condition of the license. If the license itself said you may manufacture and sell to only people who agree to use the product exclusively with Intel products?",
  "So the key fact in this case is it was just a requirement of giving notice rather than a condition in the license?",
  "I understand that.",
  "The big key is what is an authorized sale? And I'm asking you if the -- if the license agreement to the -- to Intel had said you may only sell to people who agree to use the products on the patentee's products, that then would -- and they did otherwise, they didn't get -- then it would not have been an authorized sale?",
  "Am I correct in understanding that you do not defend the Mallinckrodt decision?",
  "I understand you also do not challenge the proposition that the sale by the licensee in this case should be treated as a first sale.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's other - -",
  "Is the reason that there's no implied license here, one, because you got the notice, or two, because the component has uses in other kinds of methods than the patented method?",
  "You think the notice on that to defeat the implied - -",
  "The court below did not rely on the fact that there might be non-infringing uses, did it?",
  "It relied on the notice.",
  "It seems to be kind of an unusual answer to the implied license argument, because normally it doesn't depend on what the patentee decides to say somewhere down - down the line. That's kind of an unusual reason for not finding an implied license, I think.",
  "Before you sit down, to what extent do you think the Court of Appeals has already adopted your theory of the case?",
  "They did not get your theory of the case out of my reading of their opinion.",
  "Mr. Guerra, can you help me on a provision of the statute that I'm a little puzzled about? Am I correct in believing that Section 2000e-16, which is the provision under Title -- 42 U.S.C. -- I'm using the code number -- that that is the provision that makes the Federal Government liable for retaliation based on sex and race?",
  "Is there another provision that is necessary for there to be a remedy against the Federal Government?",
  "Under Title VII.",
  "Then -- your argument, if I understand it, is that precisely the same language that's found in 2000-16e is found in 233a.",
  "633a.",
  "And, therefore, the two should be treated alike?",
  "In other words, that the language \"shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, or religion,\" and so forth, covers retaliation. And when you use the same language based on age it also would cover retaliation.",
  "It's just as simple as those two provisions being exactly - -",
  "But the same anomaly applies to the private sector, because section 631a applies to the private sector and 631b to the public sector.",
  "The language is the same. They both are limited to prohibitions to people who are over 40.",
  "But that's no reason why that trumps -- any more reason why that trumps 631a than 631b.",
  "I don't think it says that -- the protection doesn't apply. The word is prohibition -- but that - -",
  "That's the explanation why the problem doesn't arise in the private sector. The same explanation would apply to the public sector, if you choose the word prohibition as talking about these people who are protected by the - -",
  "Mr. Garre, can I go back to the authority you're pointing out for a moment? Is it your reading of 631a, the private sector section, that says \"the prohibitions in this chapter shall be limited to individuals who are at least 40 years of age,\" that it's correctly read as the prohibitions in this chapter, except those contained in 623a, shall be limited? That's the way you read it?",
  "But the effect of giving the effect to the word \"any\" in this section is in effect to read in this exception.",
  "Do you - -",
  "That's the practical effect?",
  "But it seems to me, Mr. Garre, that, following up on Justice Breyer's question of what's the reason for it, the most striking thing to me is that Congress used precisely the same language in the two sections: \"All personnel actions shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color\" and so forth. That clearly includes retaliation. But \"all personnel actions shall be made free from discrimination on account of age\" does not include retaliation seems to me rather anomalous.",
  "In the key section describing the prohibition, the language is exactly the same.",
  "I'll repeat myself. I didn't have the mike on. The Court will hear argument in Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc., against Snohomish Public Utility District No. 1, or Public District -- Snohomish County No. 1. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Mr. Dellinger.",
  "Can I ask this question? Assuming there is absolutely no bad faith or fraud or anything like that, but there is just a general conclusion that the market was such -- in such turmoil that there could not be made reasonable or long-term contracts, because the predicate for that kind of negotiation just didn't exist. Would that be a basis for setting aside the contract?",
  "Mr. Dellinger, does that mean that it is your position that no matter how dysfunctional the market was, just complete turmoil, as long as the contract was made in good faith without any fraud or abuse of power, it's a binding contract?",
  "All right.",
  "Mr. Wright.",
  "I'm still puzzled by your answer to Justice Scalia. If, say, it is something like an atom bomb or terrorism or something totally innocent, where the parties are -- but it causes the same economic consequence, namely: That the rates are a lot higher than they otherwise would be, why do you draw the distinction that he says doesn't make sense?",
  "No, but in each case the rates would be higher than they otherwise would, and you'd have to say they're high enough to be no longer just and reasonable.",
  "Even if infected by an act of God, it seems to me the same consequence.",
  "-- know that's a premise in the debate. I find it hard to accept. How could the two be totally separate? It was the crisis that made it necessary to engage in the long-term account.",
  "The case is undertaken.",
  "Mr. Hawkins, is it at all relevant on the issue that the several courts of appeals have come out the same way both before the 1991 amendment and since the 1991 amendment, and opinions to the contrary are pretty scarce? Does that have any weight in a sort of a stare decisis sense?",
  "I know, but even under the 1991 the courts of appeals have been fairly uniform on the answer to the very issue we're confronting here. Isn't that true?",
  "My question is, are they entitled to give any stare decisis weight to a consensus among all the courts of appeals both before and after the 1991 amendment.",
  "Don't have to, but does it make sense in trying to understand the stability of the law generally?",
  "No. But your point is that Patterson made a number of lower courts think that retaliation was no longer a viable cause of action.",
  "Before Patterson they had all thought retaliation was a cause of action.",
  "May I just ask, what do you mean by method of transportation in this case? I mean, that it was in a car or the fact it was wrapped up in dirty -- in a dirty kind of container, and so forth and so on?",
  "But isn't that all just evidence that there was a motive to conceal the ownership?",
  "Now, what you understand the language \"disguise the nature of the proceeds of this specified unlawful activity\" to mean, does that - - is that satisfied by merely proof that it is proceeds of unlawful activity? Or do you have to tell that -- what is the word \"nature\" talking about?",
  "Well, that's what it seems to say. What I'm asking is: What do you think it means?",
  "But I'm just asking about the word -- the meaning of the word \"nature.\" What is the nature, other than the fact it's proceeds of unlawful activity?",
  "\"Dirty\" in some sense other than being proceeds of specified unlawful activity?",
  "I just don't know what that means other than that it is proceeds of unlawful - -",
  "I'm just talking about the one attribute, \"nature.\"",
  "I'm trying to understand what you think that means.",
  "Proceeds of unlawful activity.",
  "It's always dirty.",
  "But the verb is not \"transformed.\" The verb is \"disguise\" or \"conceal.\"",
  "May I ask you a broader question, forgetting the text of the statute for just a minute, because the text is extremely broad. Do you think the question whether there's an attempt to create an appearance of legitimate wealth has anything to do with the analysis? The question presented is whether there must be such a - -",
  "And you're arguing that's totally irrelevant and that -- and also that that familiar title, \"Money Laundering,\" totally irrelevant?",
  "There is no -- okay.",
  "And the term \"laundering\" really should be totally ignored?",
  "I understand you could find a violation of it, but what I'm really asking you: Is this just a total wild goose chase? We shouldn't even consider laundering at all? As I understand your argument, it's totally irrelevant.",
  "So it is irrelevant?",
  "May I ask -- may I ask this question? If the statute did include -- and I know you think it does not -- a requirement of trying to create an appearance of legitimate wealth, you would lose? In this case.",
  "Well, there's also, consistent with the evidence, they want to pay the drug dealer for the drugs. And then a jury -- you can't say it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt that that was not what it was going on.",
  "May I ask the same basic question of you? Do you think that this line, \"create an appearance of legitimate wealth\" is an essential element of the offense?",
  "So then your question presented raised that question, you're walking away from that question?",
  "It is not an essential element of the offense?",
  "The Court will hear argument in Warner-Lambert against Kimberly Kent. Mr. Phillips, whenever you're ready we will be happy to hear you?",
  "Mr. Phillips, May I ask this question that's related to Justice Ginsburg's, but not the same. You are saying that the defense is not pre-empted; the response to the defense is what is pre-empted here.",
  "What if you didn't have a statute at all and you just had a common law lawsuit in which you defended on the ground of compliance with the Federal statute shows, the Federal program, shows a lack of negligence. And then it then came back with the rebuttal: Yes, but your compliance was tainted by fraud, the same kind of thing. Would that response be pre-empted in a common law lawsuit?",
  "Let me just finish with one other thought before - -",
  "In one of your arguments and the government's argument, this is very burdensome to the FDA because we have all this litigation. In all the years we have had this kind of tort litigation, has this issue ever proved to be burdensome to the government in any of these -- these attempts to make out this charge and this defense?",
  "Because It seems to me that we have three or four States that have these statutes.",
  "But most States don't have these statutes. I wonder if the problem is really as serious as everybody - -",
  "Do you think there can also be the same argument for pre-empting the section, the subpart (b) of Michigan statute, the bribery exception?",
  "It seems to me what you are saying is: We're going to win this case even if there were no pre-emption.",
  "Because they have such a burden of proving that the drug wouldn't, in fact, have been withdrawn and so forth.",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Joseffer.",
  "May I ask this sort of general question? Apart from Buckman itself, which describes a very serious theoretical problem, as I understand it, there must have been a fair amount of litigation over the years where the regulatory compliance defense was raised or challenged or so forth. Is there -- are there any reported cases describing the magnitude of the problem to the government, when the - - as the result of debate about these issues?",
  "The whole theoretical problem.",
  "The litigation is not, not new.",
  "May I ask would you -- is the bribery exception also pre-empted, do you think?",
  "I understand. Do you think - -",
  "Supposing the -- supposing the official pleaded guilty to bribery. Would it be pre-empted then?",
  "It seems to me we've got a lot of theoretical litigation out here without much actual experience with any of these cases.",
  "Thank you very much. Ms. Zieve.",
  "It seems to me that you could prove that the -- an exception to the defense applies and still lose your lawsuit?",
  "I want to be sure I understand something. In the other case, the plaintiff is the one who argued there was pre-emption, and the whole statute was invalid, and not the defendant.",
  "I see. I missed that.",
  "So the defendants kind of take the risk when they make the argument they are making. They have a chance to either lose or win.",
  "If there is no severability, the defense is gone, period.",
  "Thank you. Mr. Phillips, you have five minutes.",
  "Does restitution for victims include damages?",
  "Well, you're not talking about profits when you have an injured -- a patient who died as a result of malpractice or something. That's not disgorgement of profits. That's damages.",
  "It couldn't give recovery to a class action of a couple of hundred plaintiffs who were injured, could it? No such remedy under the FDA, or am I wrong on that?",
  "The case is taken under advisement.",
  "Well, the words \"by the government\" are in (a)(2).",
  "The words \"by the government\" are in (a)(2).",
  "But (a)(2) says it has to be paid or approved by the government.",
  "Let me ask you this question: Suppose they had submitted the qualification certificate, but not a claim? Would they have had a case, under your view?",
  "What I am really asking is: Do they still need a claim?",
  "May I ask this question, Mr. Dellinger?",
  "In some punitive-damages cases, the liability attaches because the person has hired someone who is obviously incompetent. Supposing that the -- a crew member was - - an obviously incompetent crew member was hired by the captain of the ship. Would that be sufficient to justify punitive damages?",
  "And if he was hired by a shore-based personnel, then, would that be the difference for you?",
  "The one -- the company says the captain hires the crew members who could cause all sorts of damage. And another company says somebody on shore can do it. You have a different rule between those two?",
  "Would there be vicarious liability or not in the case: Negligence in hiring an incompetent crew member?",
  "Well, he has the authority to decide who to hire. Is that policymaking?",
  "Recklessness in hiring the employee who caused the damage can be a - -",
  "In hiring the third mate here, if he was negligently hired by somebody on shore, there would be liability? But if he was negligently hired by the captain, there would be no liability?",
  "Let me just interrupt. To what extent is present maritime law informed by State common law throughout the country?",
  "Let me throw this thought on the table. If the policy is made by the board of directors, can the president unilaterally change the policy? The Chief seems to be suggesting he could?",
  "It seems to me we have this problem, the president of the company is the same as the vice president.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you this question: Would the case be different if there were secured creditors rather than judgment creditors?",
  "Yes, but may I ask a sort of -- maybe it's too elementary a question, but has any court ever decided the merits of the question whether the Marcos estate or the Philippine Government owns these assets?",
  "It decided there was no remedy, I understand that. But has it decided the merits of the basic dispute?",
  "You agree that the Ninth Circuit gave sovereign immunity great weight in the balancing?",
  "Mr. Coleman, may I just ask this kind of simple question. If the prosecutor had participated in the magistration, then under Texas law would the right to counsel have arisen?",
  "Whether the prosecutor participates is not relevant?",
  "What about the very proceeding in this case? Supposing instead of a detective bringing in the affidavit, that the prosecutor did it, had the detective's affidavit, and the prosecutor said: This is a case we intend to pursue more seriously. That's all he says to the judge. Would have that been sufficient?",
  "It would not?",
  "I got the impression from the briefs that the absence or presence of the prosecutor made a difference. But you're telling me I'm wrong under that?",
  "Only if they ask for them. Only if they ask for the lawyer.",
  "That's why I wondered --",
  "Let me ask on Texas procedure. Supposing after the magistration he wanted to have the charges dismissed. Could he have hired a lawyer to come in and ask the judge to dismiss the charges?",
  "Let's say he wanted to get a release from bond and said he wanted to terminate his custody. Is there any procedure whatsoever available to a defendant to say: I want to get this monkey off my back after this bond premium?",
  "And could he have a lawyer appear before the Court to ask for that?",
  "Could the judge say: You got to appear yourself?",
  "If the prosecutor said: You are not entitled to a lawyer, wouldn't the judge have said: You're crazy; of course, he is entitled to a lawyer to come in for this proceeding?",
  "We are talking about theoretical problems here, and the question is whether he would he have had a right to a lawyer asking him to get released from bond. Twenty minutes after the first proceeding ended his father hired a lawyer and brought him in. Would the lawyer have been allowed to appear?",
  "Even though he is paying for his own lawyer?",
  "That's your answer?",
  "He would not have had a right under the Constitution to have a lawyer come in and say: I want to get released from this bond. I find that hard to believe.",
  "It would not include the right to be represented by counsel if I understand you correctly.",
  "Then I am not sure why we are having this discussion.",
  "May ask this question, Mr. Dellinger? To what extent do you think the similar provisions in State constitutions that were adopted more or less at the same time are relevant to our inquiry?",
  "I'm not talking about those.",
  "I'm talking about the contemporaneous actions of the States, before or at the time of the adoption of the Second Amendment.",
  "The Bill of Rights only protected the rights of protestants.",
  "And it was suitable to their conditions then as allowed by law, so it was -- it was a group right and much more limited.",
  "May I ask you a preliminary question. Do you think it has the same meaning that it would have if it omitted the introductory clause referring to militia?",
  "So you think some weight should be given to the clause. And also, the other question I wanted to ask you is: Does the right to keep and bear arms define one or two rights?",
  "There's a right to keep arms and a right to bear arms?",
  "Not plenary authority. Not plenary authority.",
  "Who appoints the officers?",
  "Do you think he was guided at all by the contemporaneous provisions in State constitutions?",
  "And how many of them protected an individual right? Just two, right?",
  "And the others quite clearly went in the other direction, did they not?",
  "There was also a proposal to make it clear there was an individual right, which was also rejected.",
  "The Pennsylvania proposal.",
  "This provision has the additional limitation to \"suitable to their conditions,\" and a large number of people were not permitted to have arms.",
  "Not only Miller, but the Massachusetts declaration. \"The right to keep and bear arms for the common defense\" is what is the normal reading of it.",
  "--- the right to keep and bear -- I'm sorry. It's one right to keep and bear, not two rights, to keep and to bear.",
  "Let me ask this question: In answering yes, do you attach any significance to the reference to the militia in the Second Amendment?",
  "You think that is -- to understand the amendment, you must pay some attention to the militia requirement?",
  "If it limits the kinds of arms to be appropriate to a militia, why does it not also limit the kind of people who may have arms?",
  "How do you explain the fact that you include self-defense, but only two States, Pennsylvania and Vermont, did refer to self-defense as a permissible justification and all of the others referred to common defense or defense of the State, and in the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution itself there is no reference to self-defense?",
  "1895. I'm talking about contemporaneous with the adoption of the Second Amendment.",
  "Just the text of the State constitutional provisions, two of them refer to self-defense. The rest refer only to common defense; is that not correct?",
  "I understand that judicial interpretation sometimes is controlling and sometimes is not. But the text itself does draw a distinction, just as the Second Amendment does. It doesn't mention self-defense.",
  "Well, if you look at the individual rights I suppose you start back in 1689, the Declaration of Rights in England. And the seventh provision that they talked about said that: \"The subjects which are protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.\" Now do you think the term \"suitable to their conditions\" limited the number of people who had access to arms for self-defense?",
  "So you think that the Second Amendment is a departure from the provision in the Declaration of Rights in England?",
  "So that's not really your -- you would not confine the right the way the English did then.",
  "You say that the right of self-defense was the heart of the Second Amendment, in your view. Strangely that some provisions suggested that and were not accepted by the authors of the Second Amendment.",
  "Pennsylvania.",
  "May I ask this question? Are you, in effect, reading the amendment to say that the right shall not be unreasonably infringed instead of shall not be infringed?",
  "So we can -- consistent with your view, we can simply read this: \"It shall not be unreasonably infringed\"?",
  "And how about a State university wants to ban students having arms in the dormitory?",
  "That's the bare fact. That's what -- a State regulation prohibits students from having arms on campus.",
  "You'd have to think about that.",
  "May I just ask on that last point, does the government agree that the paralegals' fees are subject to a cap?",
  "But they do not agree with the bottom line that they are subject to cap?",
  "-- attorney's fees.",
  "But may I ask you this?",
  "Supposing at the time the statute was enacted, paralegals' fees were not generally treated as lawyers' fees, but rather were disbursements, does that make a difference?",
  "At this discretion, let me ask this question. Maybe it's the same question Justice Kennedy asked, but I want to be sure of your answer. Suppose you had independent firm of paralegals. I don't know whether the market contains them, but it surely could. A firm that they are all paralegals, and they then bill the law firm at their own hourly rate, and then the law firm in turn bills the client. In that situation, would the market rate of the independent firm of paralegals govern?",
  "Do I understand the government's position that the -- the result would different if a firm uses its own paralegals as opposed to outsourcing?",
  "No. But under my example they would be paying the market rate for paralegals, and I think you say they could be reimbursed for that.",
  "Well, they are not market to make business. I presume the paralegals would charge the going rate.",
  "I assume that they also charged the market rate.",
  "May I go back - -",
  "May I go back to the point, because I think you were cut off before you went into the full legislative history. I'm still concerned about the argument that even if they are not fees but rather costs, that the costs should be those that are billed to the client. And you think there is some conclusive answer in the legislative history that that's not the case.",
  "Which took place when?",
  "At that time were they billing paralegal's fees at cost to the client? Was it - -",
  "Every expense that's reimbursed at cost has a profit element in it for whoever performed the service.",
  "Business or otherwise.",
  "But the cap doesn't apply to expenses, does it?",
  "The cap does not apply to reimbursement expenses at cost?",
  "It seems to me just the opposite just as the Chief Justice suggests. It seems to me you're creating an incentive for the firms to - - to charge as much as they can -- I mean, under market rates for everything under the -- under the time of the lawyer himself.",
  "No, because other costs reasonably interpret to include overhead. It's not just the paper and the accounting time.",
  "Mr. Gottesman, can I ask sort of a background question to be sure I understand your position? Am I correct in assuming that if the State of California had its labor relations agency make it an unfair labor practice to engage in this employer speech described here, that that would be pre-empted?",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, if they adopted the rule that the Federal labor board applied prior to the Taft-Hartley Act.",
  "That's what I'm asking.",
  "That would be pre-empted?",
  "I want to be sure.",
  "It does require that this -- it arguably requires that this area of combat between labor and management be unregulated.",
  "Ms. Millett, if it was - - if it was that obvious, why did it take so long for the coal companies to realize that the government owed them money?",
  "What if there had been no challenge to that election, but two or three years later somebody challenged the election and then the Supreme Court said it was invalid.",
  "Then there never would have been a State statute.",
  "Then there never would have been a State statute, a valid State statute.",
  "Mr. Newsom, I hate to intrude on your rebuttal time, but I would like to ask you this question. Supposing a State after 1964 and before 2000 made 35 different changes of all improved voting rights, could they always go back to the practice in effect of 1964 and not have to preclear?",
  "It could be any kind of change, legislative, administrative, judicial, could they always go back to 1964 and have a safe harbor?",
  "I understand. I'm just trying to understand how much teeth there is in the 1964 date. Is it safe harbor or isn't it?",
  "If it's in the materials, then perhaps I should have known, but did the -- I take it Munaf was present and was represented by counsel?",
  "But how did that work? Was he present in American custody and then he goes to the Iraqi court?",
  "So then he just goes every day to the Iraqi court and then he comes back at night to U.S. custody?",
  "May I ask just one question. Would your argument be the same if the place of detention was in the United States?",
  "Well, could they be released to a lynch mob?",
  "Does your case -- does your case depend entirely on the fact that these are American citizens?",
  "If they were not American citizens, would there be jurisdiction?",
  "So then citizenship is irrelevant on the jurisdictional issue?",
  "I don't know how you can avoid taking that question. That what bothers me. How can you avoid addressing that question?",
  "Are you aware of any cases in which we have held that habeas jurisdiction is available to a citizen where it would be not available to a non-citizen?",
  "May I ask this second question: Do you think the place of detention has any relevance to the issue?",
  "Do you think whether or not it's a -- there are ongoing hostilities would have any relationship to the issue?",
  "But you say that does not exist in Iraq today?",
  "But the place of detention has always been Iraq?",
  "The place of detention has always been Iraq?",
  "Would the legal issue be the same if there were violent ongoing hostilities in Iraq?",
  "Do we have any -- any precedent in our cases for saying that that test would apply during an active combat in a zone of hostilities?",
  "It's a very different place of detention.",
  "So are you saying then that the zone of hostilities does not include all of Iraq?",
  "So what if we thought otherwise?",
  "What if we thought otherwise? What if we thought all -- all of Iraq is a zone of hostilities? Would we have a different result?",
  "How can you say that the United States lacks the power to transfer? Suppose this fellow had been arrested in the street by a sergeant in the Army and he says, what will I do with him? I'll take him to the Iraqis and turn him over. Would that be an illegal transfer?",
  "A sergeant caught this guy, and he wants to turn him over to the Iraqis. Does he -- is there some law that prevents him from doing that?",
  "That applies to the sergeant in the city of - -",
  "Why isn't all of this within the zone of military discretion?",
  "You're talking about a transfer in what I assume you said was a zone of hostilities.",
  "I thought you were talking about a transfer in an area that you say was engaged in active hostilities.",
  "Does that affect the decision at all?",
  "Mr. Garre, is it the position of the government that this is a war zone?",
  "Do you think any part of Iraq is like a battlefield situation?",
  "Why isn't it a war zone?",
  "That means you haven't made your strongest argument.",
  "And you do have policy guidelines with money laundering.",
  "Do you think your rule would create an incentive for trial judges in close cases to always deny self-representation? Because certainly most trials proceed more efficiently and less trouble for the judge if you have a lawyer there.",
  "May I ask this question: Do you think the inability to speak English would be a factor that the judge could take into account in making this judgment?",
  "Mr. Stancil, can I ask this question: Do you agree that at a certain point in the trial it could become a farce and the judge could declare a mistrial for this reason?",
  "If he did so, he's going to have a second trial. Could he decide before the second trial starts that the man has to have a lawyer or could the man still demand the right to self-represent? He's had to proceed -- he spoke to the one -- you know, one mistrial. It seems to me that under your position he'd have the right to a second bite at the apple.",
  "Well, assume he had a record in open court before the trial started that was just as persuasive as events going sour during a trial.",
  "May I ask this one other question: Do you think the Faretta right includes a right to have no standby counsel?",
  "Absolutely.",
  "You were asked, and I think tried to answer and never got your answer out, and I'd like to hear: What is it you were saying about cases in which pre-confirmation transfers are made and the tax exemption is made? Did you start to tell us that you might never recover the tax later on? Or what kind of a problem does it create?",
  "Yes, but then the question is, can you nevertheless, in an untimely fashion, eventually get the tax imposed and the tax collected?",
  "Isn't the tax imposed on the purchaser, not the bankrupt's estate?",
  "Isn't the tax imposed on the purchaser, rather than the bankrupt's estate?",
  "May I just ask this question? I guess this has been the rule in Florida for awhile. There's a problem, and has the problem been that you actually don't get the money? Or is it an administrative problem, keeping track of things and finding out whether or not you are entitled to it?",
  "Are there any studies showing how much money you've actually lost by this practice?",
  "Did I understand you correctly? You say you have, in fact, lost millions of dollars from the failure to get access under this rule?",
  "It would seem to me that, normally, because you do require recording, that there would be -- it wouldn't be all that difficult to keep track of all these cases in which there had been transferred pre-confirmation transfers. And if you did you have some filed in the computer that had them all there, as soon as the -- if the confirmation did not occur, you could just go ahead and send out the bills.",
  "Is it -- another question I had: Is it not true that even under your rule there will be a number of cases that, even though it was clear that the transaction was after the confirmation, there's an issue as to whether it was under the plan?",
  "Let me just ask this. As a practical matter does the judge, the bankruptcy judge, enter some kind of an order approving the transfer, even though it's pre-confirmation, an order to establish the tax exemption?",
  "So it would have to be after the filing of the bankruptcy proceeding.",
  "Would the -- would the jurisdiction issue be any different if it were a contract claim? Supposing your client -- they had brought suit against your client claiming a breach of contract, would there have been tribal court jurisdiction?",
  "Well, we would assume that the corporation had a breach of contract claim, could they have sued in tribal court?",
  "The question isn't whether that was an appropriate plaintiff. Do you think the tribal court would have had jurisdiction of such a contract claim?",
  "Could we go back to the example for just a minute? I want to be sure I fully understand it. Why couldn't that issue have been adequately discussed at a hearing in which there was no particular notice, but at the end of the hearing the judge said, this is what I'm planning to do because I'm worried that they won't get treatment in prison and so forth? Well, wouldn't the government have had an opportunity to then say, Judge, you overlooked this fact? And wouldn't all involved in the hearing?",
  "Couldn't the lawyer have done that?",
  "But wouldn't - -",
  "Well, that solves the problem because the judge apparently was operating under a misunderstanding of facts.",
  "And the lawyer could say you're wrong.",
  "No, I understand.",
  "In your - -",
  "In your experience, do judges often bring in experts on this kind of stuff?",
  "Well, not judges -- do judges say, \"Oh, this is very interesting; I'm going to have a new hearing\"? I mean, how long do these hearings go on?",
  "But you're saying that, routinely in sentencing matters, you have expert who come in and advise the judge of programs and so forth?",
  "May I ask you this question? I've been thinking about this case. Supposing your client prevailed on appeal and they held a resentencing. Could the district judge have increased the sentence?",
  "The district judge could not have increased it? If they sent it back for a new sentencing, a fresh hearing on what the sentencing should be, would the district judge have been foreclosed from giving a higher sentence than he gave the first time?",
  "What's the authority for that proposition?",
  "Say, if it was a capital case and he won on appeal, he could get the death sentence the second time around, which is a little more serious sentence. Why couldn't he have gotten a higher sentence.",
  "I believe you say it has decided not to make an exception to the cross-appeal rule. Of course, the cross-appeal rule itself is not statutory, is it?",
  "It's an arguable rule among the courts of appeal as to whether there is such a rule.",
  "So it's not surprising that Congress didn't make exception to a rule that isn't that firmly established.",
  "But in this very case could the court of appeals said: We will grant the appellant a new sentencing hearing and send the case back to the district for resentencing; and, by the way, district judge, when you do the resentencing, take a look at the section that imposes a mandatory minimum? Could they have done that?",
  "And you could have ended up with precisely the same result that they ended up with in this case.",
  "May I just ask this one question? This problem has been around for a long, long time; and sometimes cross-appeals -- courts of appeals have corrected what they thought was plain error, and without a cross-appeal there. Has that generated a whole lot of problems over the years? I mean there are isolated cases that you've all been able to find searching 30 or 40 years of jurisprudence, but I don't see any widespread problem being generated by the courts of appeals who have disagreed with your view.",
  "Could you just clarify about the -- were those injuries permanent?",
  "They were not permanent injuries.",
  "If you're looking for time, let me ask you one -- one question that interests me but is a little divorced from the terms of the arguments so far. I know it is not popular to refer to refer to international commentary on issues like this, but the English law lords have filed an amicus brief discussing the international principle that nations that retain the death penalty may not extend the death penalty to crimes to which it does not presently apply. They suggest that as a matter of international law, there's sort of a correspondence to our evolving standards of decency that have generally governed our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. It's kind of a one-way rachet, we look at trends in one direction but we don't look to see if you suddenly have changed gears and go in the other direction. Could you just comment on that argument?",
  "I'm not asking that. I just used that as an analogy to our evolving standards of decency cases which has been part of our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, that sort of is a -- one way direction in which these cases go. Do you think it's appropriate -- are you aware of any case saying we can turn around and go in another direction?",

  "Repeated requests - -",
  "-- but if they're all the same, wouldn't they say, well, that's the same case we had last week?",
  "All right.",
  "Correct, and he's the one who raised the suit.",
  "But did any -- defeat the suit by claiming there was preclusion because of a suit in another jurisdiction, rather than stare decisis?",
  "Let me ask, following up on Justice Ginsburg's question: Suppose it's not a class-of-one, but it's a class of two or three because, on two or three occasions they fired somebody because he wouldn't pay the supervisor a bribe. Would that cross the threshold? He had a practice of not -- you know, getting a little money out of every promotion.",
  "If it's not a class of one --",
  "Do you say no or yes to whether there would be a cause of action?",
  "Yes, but those are all considerations that would be an adequate defense to a claim. If you had a judgment call to make, you say, I had a judgment call to make. And maybe there are good arguments on the other side. You can't be liable for that kind of decision.",
  "-- your opponent's statement that this really has not generated an awful lot of litigation. Do you think he's right or wrong on that?",
  "What proportion of your workforce is really hired at will? Haven't they all got some kind of protections under your statutes?",
  "Don't have you some kind of civil service system, too?",

  "In a mixed motives case, both ill will and a -- some reason, she was also late to work -- you would win that case.",
  "If you have one good reason and one bad reason, the bad reason doesn't trump the good reason.",
  "Why can't he go out and raise funds? Does the statute prohibit him from raising funds from third parties?",
  "Well, but they certainly can allocate funds more generously to one candidate than another; can't they?",
  "Isn't one of the virtues of the independent self-financed candidate is he can emphasize his independence? So he very rarely is going to complain about not being able to get too much money, enough money from outside sources. And isn't it a fact that most of them do finance a very significant percentage of their total campaign costs?",
  "Your dying declaration cases are not just murders, though.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "But the rationale for the dying declaration rule has nothing to do with who caused the death.",
  "But it has to be imminent, too.",
  "He has to think it's imminent.",
  "But that's an entirely different rationale from the issue we have here, because it applies across the board to civil cases and all sorts of litigation.",
  "Mr. Waxman, what do you do about the language \"otherwise prohibited\"?",
  "What do you do about that language in the statute?",
  "Sure.",
  "Even that, there's a question about not merely statistical disparity, but a causal connection between an identified practice --",
  "-- in the disparity.",
  "Mr. Waxman, you have to keep in mind they are not just showing a disparate impact. Because of a particular practice there is a disparate impact. That's what you leave out. So the quality of the practice is what is at issue, and the defendant doesn't come in and say I admit that it was unlawful. He first tries to prove it was necessary, and he fails on that. And if he fails on that, he has the lesser burden of proving reasonableness.",
  "Here we have a jury verdict that was affirmed by the court of appeals.",
  "Well, wasn't the issue of reasonable factor under age tried in the trial court when the case was tried?",
  "Am I correct to understand that your trial counsel then took the position you must prove business necessity? I mean an absence of business necessity, rather than reasonableness. They didn't advance their strongest defense.",
  "Right.",
  "As everybody now knows, that was wrong.",
  "But did you plead this as an affirmative defense? Did you plead it as an affirmative defense?",
  "Well, if he put in all the evidence he's described, that would not have proven business necessity. It seems to me that evidence had to go to the issue of reasonableness.",
  "Was he arguing that it was necessary to follow this one downsizing practice?",
  "And just one other detail, Did -- the district judge not instruct the jury on this defense?",
  "It did not?",
  "You have an unusual case where the decisive issue, at least when you get to this Court, is something the jury never passed on.",
  "Yes. But as I understand your brief, you say the conflict of interest is only relevant if it affected the decision. But how does the plaintiff prove that it affected? What sort of evidence would go to that issue?",
  "Well, you're just saying that the plaintiff has to have an overwhelming case. I don't think you'd need the conflict-of-interest point in that kind of case.",
  "Well, I can understand that in normal trust situations, but it's hard for me to understand how you're going to prove an insurance company's particular claim adjustment was really motivated by a conflict of interest rather than thinking the claim wasn't valid.",
  "Mr. Olson, you're relying on 1334(b), I take it, specifically.",
  "But the prohibition you're talking about is in 13 -- in your express pre-emption argument -- 1334(b). And I was just going to ask you, is a State requirement prohibiting false statements about smoking and health a requirement based on smoking and health?",
  "The predicate for \"based on smoking\" is the word \"requirement.\" And a requirement that you may not make any false statements, would that be a requirement based on smoking and health?",
  "The question I'm asking, though, is a requirement that you make no false statements a requirement based on smoking and health?",
  "But did the Illinois -- Illinois court reach the question whether the claim was pre -- pre-empted? I think it firmly decided on the merits there was no fraud, if I understand what you said.",
  "So we must assume there was no pre-emption, because it wouldn't have reached the merits otherwise.",
  "When it's not - -",
  "Do I understand your basic argument to be that this statute is a prohibition against State warnings in either promotion or advertising different from the Federal one?",
  "This specific quotation deals only with the contents of the advertising that might be described as warnings different from those in the Federal scheme.",
  "Isn't it correct that your argument requires us to reject the fraud analysis in Cipollone?",
  "Does that mean that each time they buy an insurance policy they have to investigate which locals are going to get the most benefit out of it?",
  "Would you give one answer to the Chief Justice on the facts he gave and a different one if the record showed that everybody got a proportional benefit out of the group policy?",
  "So your answer doesn't depend, then, on the facts that he included in that question?",
  "I'm not sure he was, either.",
  "Does that mean all insurance policies are bad?",
  "I'd be interested in your comments on this dialogue.",
  "Does that mean, because I want to be sure -- you exclude the librarian example of Justice Breyer?",
  "So which side? You have to be clear with me.",
  "I understand you to be saying they could not charge the nonmember for the expenses of the Hawaiian librarian.",
  "The librarian in Hawaii researching something that the plaintiff has no interest in spending money on, would that be prohibited.",
  "I hate to interrupt you here, but would you explain why the words \"save for such agreement\" cut back on the jurisdiction? I didn't quite understand your point.",
  "Doesn't it just instruct the court to decide whether, if there were no such agreements, would there be Federal jurisdiction in the underlying dispute?",
  "So in this case there would be.",
  "No, it's not the underlying bank debt, but it is an underlying dispute over which this Federal -- if you had brought your class action as an original case, there would have been Federal jurisdiction.",
  "So then why doesn't the language read on this case?",
  "The text says nothing about the ouster doctrine.",
  "Rather than literally.",
  "Is that point argued in Moses -- Moses Cone? Was that point argued in that case?",
  "I am not -- I mean just -- I have to be sure I follow. Why couldn't it require the same look through in a diversity case as it does in a Federal-question case?",
  "Right.",
  "Complete diversity.",
  "What's wrong with that?",
  "Maybe it would. So what?",
  "Mr. Phillips - -",
  "Clear up one thing for me. Is it correct, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, that the counterclaim was purely defensive? Didn't it ask for additional relief? The counterclaim, wasn't it a class action?",
  "So it was not merely an defense to the action, the State court action.",
  "-- answer that the litigation does exist.",
  "Let me get one fact.",
  "Is the State court suit still pending?",
  "So there are two separate underlying actions.",
  "You don't have any trouble.",
  "It's not really -- of getting constants from Federal judges; the arbitrators can decide this question.",
  "The arbitrator might decide there is no preemption.",
  "May I ask this, I haven't reread the Moses Cone case, but is your adversary correct in saying that there would have been no jurisdiction in that case it we followed your view?",
  "Because the arbitrator was not of diverse citizenship from the other parties?",
  "But -- if, in fact, were a nondiverse party in the Moses Cohen, there should have been no jurisdiction?",
  "Mr. Phillips, the answer to a better hypothetical is what if there had been no original collection action but they had brought such an action.",
  "That's the case you're really saying. You're saying that is like this case.",
  "And Justice Ginsburg is suggesting it's not, because it happens to arise out of a different -- quite different dispute.",
  "As I understand your opponent, they would agree there was no jurisdiction even in that case.",
  "That isn't quite true, because here there is a definition in the Federal claim in your counterclaim.",
  "There is a definition of the controversy in your counterclaim and in their response.",
  "You're suggesting that every credit card debtor would have a class action?",
  "Could I ask this question --",
  "Could I ask this question? You're saying that the question is whether anybody did anything wrong at all. This is not undisputed, that this person was illegally arrested? The arrest itself violated the Fourth Amendment.",
  "The question is whether it can be justified.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, can I go back to your point you were just making. What incentive does the police department have to withdraw warrants that have been cancelled? Why not just leave them there? As long as they are there, it would justify an arrest.",
  "If you put aside good faith for the moment. If you just think in terms of incentives of officers, would they not have an incentive just to leave everything there?",
  "The existence or nonexistence of the warrant doesn't affect the danger.",
  "But the incentive exists whether there is a warrant in his pocket or not.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, can I ask a background question? How frequent does the issue in this case arise?",
  "That's my understanding, too.",
  "It seems to me the case may have more symbolic importance than practical importance.",
  "Are there any cases where -- this is a drug peddler here that was caught. Are there any cases involving violent criminals that have been affected by the outcome of this case?",
  "Of course, if you did the cost-benefit analysis the way Justice Stewart would, the cost is always zero to the State because they would not have had the evidence if they had obeyed the law.",
  "Something was happening back there. The automobile exception is much older than that.",
  "The automobile exception is much older than that.",
  "But, you know, the automobile exception could provide a rationale that would cover all of these cases. Do you remember my opinion in Belton?",
  "It's for officer safety when the defendant is no longer in the car and is under -- under the control of the officer?",
  "Which are not the facts of Belton.",
  "You are asking for the expanded Belton rule, not the rule of Belton itself.",
  "But it isn't true that we didn't have the recent occupant problem at the time of Belton?",
  "Why wouldn't the rule of requiring just the automobile exception, where you would require probable cause to search a vehicle, why wouldn't that be a bright line rule that would fit into everything else.",
  "Are you more concerned about the ability to search the vehicle or the protection of the officer?",
  "But doesn't -- don't these rules apply to ordinary traffic arrests where there really is very little risk to the officer?",
  "The need to search the vehicle is primarily justified by the interest in officer safety?",
  "But the interest in preserving evidence really should only be present when there is probable cause to believe there is some evidence.",
  "Normally, to overcome the privacy interest, you need probable cause. And you did need probable cause for the automobile exception too.",
  "But really what's at stake here is the right to search the vehicle for things that are not right out in front at the time he does the custodial arrest.",
  "If it was right there, obviously he had a right to search the whole vehicle under the automobile exception, but in the normal case, I don't see why officer safety is an adequate justification for going beyond the authority that it would have under the automobile exception. That's the problem I have, because you do have broad authority if you have probable cause.",
  "I understand Chimel, but - -",
  "-- underlie Ross.",
  "My basic question is: Why doesn't that different doctrine apply the bright-line rule, simply administered, that you need?",
  "Of course, one of the really contentious issues at the time Belton decided is whether you can search containers in the back in the passenger part of the car. And under the automobile exception, you could search those containers if you had probable cause to believe anything in the car was contraband. And that's what Belton really opened the door to, was container searches. It was not just searches of things in plain view. And, of course, the justification for suggesting that that's too broad a rule is the very strong privacy interest in containers in cars driven by ordinary motorists. That's really what's at issue under Belton.",
  "You think -- you think the conduct in this case is also covered by the participation clause?",
  "You do?",
  "Mr. Young, even under your definition, why is not the statement that's made in this case, \"get the hell out of my office,\" wouldn't that be opposition even under your statement, under your definition? She's opposing his advance to her. That's an active opposition it seems.",
  "Get the hell out of my office.",
  "Why isn't that opposition under your statement -- under your definition?",
  "Is bringing frivolous cases cost-free for the plaintiffs? There are certain costs.",
  "Just as to dolphins?",
  "And what percentage is that of the total population in the area?",
  "May I ask this question, Mr. Solicitor General. Is it understood, though, that there is a duty to prepare an environmental impact statement?",
  "Mr. Garre, could I ask you a question?",
  "If this were not a Navy case with all of the implications of the Navy, but an ordinary case in which it was demonstrated that an EIS had to be filed, would it not be normal -- normal action to enjoin the -- the government action until the EIS was filed? Because the -- the very fact that you need an EIS is -- is because you don't know what environmental consequences may ensue. That's the purpose of the EIS. So isn't it the normal practice to enjoin government action until the EIS is filed when it is clear there is a duty to file?",
  "The whole theory of the - - of the environmental impact statement is that we don't really know what the harm will be. So how can you say that in order to get an injunction against the government action you have to prove irreparable harm?",
  "But you're really arguing that an -- that a temporary statement is enough, will always be enough.",
  "But there is a finding that it is necessary, and here we have that finding as I understand it.",
  "May I ask -- may I ask this one follow-up question, because I want to be sure I understand your position. Supposing the plaintiff in his declaration cites three or four cases in which the action was taken so promptly they didn't have notice in order to object. And then he says but so -- they -- all this was too fast for me. Now I want to -- want to do just what the plaintiffs are trying to do in this case. Would he have standing then?",
  "You would agree that with that scenario he would have standing if his only injury in this is exactly the same as the plaintiff in this case?",
  "That is not what it says. It says this is our ordinary practice it doesn't say it's the limit on our practice.",
  "I thought you were talking about - -",
  "In this case which way does the presumption favoring what the legislature did cut? Here the court set aside what the legislature did; is that not right?",
  "Mr. Thurman, can I ask you this question? It seems to me that a rigid 51 percent rule assumes that the minority communities throughout the country are all alike, and that there is enough variety in every district and every part of the country where we have this problem. There are variations. Maybe 51 percent would not be enough. The minority group might, itself, be divided as is often the case. I -- I think the underlying premise -- the underlying -- the premise underlying your argument is that all minorities are exactly alike. That's why we can have this mathematical figure, and that answers the question.",
  "You mention how well it worked. Did you see the graphs -- one of Amicus briefs have the graph showing what the 50 percent rule did for one gerrymander and how the lesser percentage worked out -- remember which were much more -- not using the 50 percent rule produced much more compact districts?",
  "But they were designed to produce 50 percent, and that's why they got so -- so - - so grotesque.",
  "Mr. Stewart, could I interrupt you, because there is something that hasn't been reached. Do you think that we should answer the constitutional question first or the immunity question first?",
  "The rule - -",
  "May I ask you a question that may seem totally irrelevant? Do you think our decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania was correctly decided?",
  "It seems to me under your reasoning in your case you might say that case was wrong. And I think it was wrong. I will be perfectly candid and say so. I think it was a very important decision.",
  "No, I understand. But it seems to me it is -- in the old common law tradition, following sort of the reasoning in the case you relied on, McMillan really should have come out the other way, because the jury normally would be finding the facts that would allow the minimum -- the maximum to go up or the minimum. I forget which it was.",
  "And, of course, it's part of your position that historically sentences were always consecutive, if you go way back.",
  "What happens with sentences from multiple States? You commit the crime in State A; you flee. You are then tried and found guilty of a second crime in State B. I -- I -- let's assume that the judge in State B has considerable discretion as to whether or not he intends to impose a sentence in B or send back to A, and that he knows that A is going to be concurrent. Under the theory of the case that's advocated by the Respondents, do you think that a jury trial or some sort of finding would be required?",
  "May I ask you a rather broad question?",
  "In Apprendi the opinions were rather lengthy and discussed precedents at great length. Justice Thomas's opinion was quite scholarly and I discussed a lot of old cases. If this case that we have today had arisen before Apprendi was decided, what case would you have supporting your position?",
  "I didn't hear that.",
  "Jones - -",
  "What if it had arisen before Jones?",
  "And then the historical analysis was to prove citation to what cases?",
  "All the cases in Apprendi dealt with elements of the crime and that sort of thing.",
  "Is there any room for harmless error here? I mean, it seems to me patently obvious that both of the statutory conditions were fully satisfied. It was within -- put it within the discretion of the judge.",
  "I mean, is there any doubt that he wanted to commit an offense twice?",
  "Can I interrupt you? You are saying no error occurred, and on page 11 of your brief you say, \"An unconstitutional instructional error occurred in this case because there was a reasonable likelihood the jury found,\" and so forth and so on.",
  "But you said that's what happened here. That's what your brief says.",
  "Do you agree that the California Supreme Court gave an incorrect explanation to the answer to that question? They said there was no harmless error because the -- the jury made a specific finding that rebutted that, and that finding depended on the difference between the word \"and\" and \"or.\"",
  "No. I'm -- I'm questioning the basis for the Supreme Court's conclusion that the error was harmless.",
  "Right.",
  "Which meant that the jury really hadn't answered the question they thought it had answered.",
  "If you do that, you are removing the basis for the California Supreme Court's decision.",
  "Is that not right?",
  "At least the basis - -",
  "The basis - -",
  "-- for the decision was a -- was a specific finding - -",
  "All right.",
  "Isn't the special circumstance finding the one that had the word \"or\" in it, and therefore allowed the jury to give a post - killing interpretation of the event.",
  "I thought that was what the California Supreme Court relied on?",
  "But do you not agree that the harmless error -- the -- the rationale of the California Supreme Court was incorrect?",
  "In the harmless error analysis. Actually, I'm agreeing with you that there should have been harmless error. Did it perform the proper - -",
  "The -- answer was incorrect, too, wasn't it? And that answer was incorrect?",
  "The difference is when you only got one theory, you know what he relied on. When you got alternatives, how do you know which one he relied on?",
  "No. But in this case the question is whether the uncle did it or the nephew did it. And if there is a lot of doubt about -- about -- if there is substantial reason to believe maybe it was the uncle, they might have taken the easy case out. I think this is vastly different from a single theory case.",
  "Because it's an -- there is plenty of evidence that he might have been guilty after the fact. There is no doubt about that. But there is doubt about the former.",
  "Perhaps after -- after the death occurred. That's all we really know.",
  "Excuse me. Let's go back to 131 for a minute. I thought that applied to the \"accomplice\" instruction.",
  "That's a question specifically applied to the defendant only for the defendant or his accomplice.",
  "Mr. Fisher, can I just ask you a question? Is it your view that the question that is troubling the jury was whether they had to find that the driver of the car knew that there was a gun in the car.",
  "Assume proof of the gun in the car was enough to prove - -",
  "It wouldn't -- and that's what presumably may have taken a lot of time deliberating whether or not he knew there was a gun.",
  "And in one theory it makes a difference; in another theory it doesn't.",
  "Mr. Frederick - -",
  "Mr. Frederick, I'd like to put the misbranding point to one side and just concentrate on pre-emption. And I understood you to agree with Justice Alito that there is a hypothetical case in which there would be pre-emption, and would you tell me what particular fact distinguishes your case from his hypothetical?",
  "May I ask this: When did the duty on the part of Wyeth to have a different label arise, in your view?",
  "Did it arise before or after submitting the original drug application?",
  "Does that boil down to a claim that there was new information that was available between the original approval and the time of the lawsuit?",
  "Either one. But is your theory really a theory based on new information or new judgment about old information?",
  "Mr. Olson, can I ask you a kind of a -- maybe it's too obvious -- preliminary question? Is there a definition of the term \"Indian tribe\" in the statute?",
  "Section 19 defines the term \"Indian,\" but there is no definition of what an Indian tribe is.",
  "See that -- that word isn't limited by time or date, is it?",
  "Well, but the word \"Indian\" -- it says the word \"Indian,\" in the last sentence, \"'adult Indian' wherever used in this Act shall be construed to refer to Indians who have attained the age of 21 years.\"",
  "I'm looking at the Government brief. That's - -",
  "Mr. Olson, am I not correct that the membership in the tribe is just one category of persons who are included in the broader definition of the term \"Indian\"?",
  "And one of the them is members of the tribe.",
  "Another is one who -- Indians who have attained the age of 21 years. The other other is -- let's see. \"The term 'tribe' wherever used in this Act shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe, organized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation.\" Now, that reference to the term \"tribe,\" as opposed to \"Indian,\" doesn't have any limit on the time.",
  "Mr. Olson, let me just make sure I get this off my chest, and then I'll be quiet. The first sentence in section 19 defines the term \"Indian.\" And that's the section you're talking about?",
  "-- in this Act. The second refers to -- the second sentence refers to Eskimos. The third sentence defines the term \"tribe,\" the term \"tribe\" -- and in that definition there is no reference to time.",
  "No. I'm talking about the third -- the first sentence defines the term \"Indian\"; the third sentence defines the term \"tribe.\"",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "\"Organized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation.\"",
  "The word \"Indian\" does not modify the word \"tribe\" as used in the third sentence. That's my point.",
  "I'm saying for purposes of getting the meaning of the word \"tribe,\" just look at the sentence defining that term, and that doesn't refer to any time limit.",
  "It doesn't limit it to Indian tribe. It says, shall include \"any Indian tribe, organized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on a reservation.\"",
  "Ms. Maynard, would you clarify one other thing for me? The sentence in question with the word \"now\" in it and so forth, does that have the meaning that it includes descendants who are less than a half-blood, quarter-blood, eighth-blood and so forth?",
  "So that is an expansive definition of the term \"Indian,\" right?",
  "Can I ask you a question? It seems to me that the limited definition of \"the tribe\" really is quite irrelevant to this -- to this case. The term \"Indian\" is defined to include two classes of persons: One who are members of a certain category of tribes and others who have more than half Indian blood. It seems to me that -- and then you get to the definition of \"tribe\" that comes later. It seems to me that when you're talking about the definition of \"tribe,\" the statute would have exactly the same meaning if, instead of it limiting by time from 1934, it said tribes located west of the Mississippi. If they just limited it to that, that wouldn't have limited the definition of \"Indian.\" I mean the definition of \"tribe.\" It would have made the category of -- of persons of Indian dissent or eligible to be treated as Indians and whose eligibility is determined by tribal membership, limited but the -- not to include all tribes. So you can limit it, as I say, to tribes west of the Mississippi. But then when you get down to defining the term \"tribe,\" there is no such definition. So that I just think the fight about what \"now\" means is totally irrelevant to the meaning of the definition of \"tribe.\"",
  "It just describes the subcategory of Indian tribes who -- for whom members can qualify even though they don't have half blood. That's the point. It picks up people who are less than half blood if they are members of of those tribes.",
  "Didn't the statute also prohibit private employers from doing that?",
  "And you concede the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them?",
  "And you agree with that conclusion?",
  "And what is the difference between the private employer and the county agency?",
  "Do I understand that the counties, if they elected to, could decide not to -- not to do the checkoff?",
  "And so why should counties be different from -- from -- I'm still puzzled about why counties -- county employers are different from private employers in terms of the State interest in preventing the checkoff.",
  "May I ask a question about, say, an attempt to deduct contributions to a charity like the United Fund? Do counties have a choice to either do that or not do it, or does State law require them to accept such requests?",
  "They have discretion to do that?",
  "With respect to the union situation, the statute takes away that discretion.",
  "And the question is why is there -- why is there a State interest in taking away that discretion for unions, but not as to charities.",
  "For political activities. But what is -- what is the reason for differentiating political activities from charities?",
  "I see.",
  "Mr. Collins, may I interrupt you and ask you the converse of the question I asked your opponent? He conceded that it was unconstitutionally what you call it, content discrimination -- whatever - - to have the deduction from the private sector, but the counties were different; and he justified the counties on the ground that the State's interest in avoiding taking a position with regard to union matters justifies it. But that's the only justification for the -- it's not the administrative justification -- this statute wasn't enacted to save the government administrative expenses. The purpose of the statute is perfectly clear, and I'm surprised that you concede that it's constitutional as applied to the State government, when there's no evidence whatsoever that it serves the purpose that everybody is talking about.",
  "But this is not a case involving a State's decision not to spend the time and energy to do payroll deductions because they do them for everybody else. It's simply based on the reason for the payroll deduction, which is, in your view, an impermissible reason. Is that not correct.",
  "How can it not be clear? It enacted a general statute that had the same justification throughout the State. And now you're justifying on the ground it doesn't apply to all their other government activities because they allow payroll deductions.",
  "I see your argument.",
  "Mr. Stewart, can I ask a question about the scope of discretion involved here? Assume the facts were not exactly as they are here, it is not a fungible product, but that each shipment was separately identified and each shipment was processed as a different batch in France and then sent back. That I assume would not normally be treated as a sale of goods?",
  "That's really what I wanted to ask you. Even if the facts were more extreme, just as in the example I gave, do you think the Commerce Department would have discretion to treat that as a sale of goods?",
  "But then supposing they send the suit back to a different person for alterations, and they say, well, this is part of the sale, so we want to treat it as a sale of goods?",
  "What is the difference between that and what we've got here?",
  "But isn't it correct that the universe of transactions that is the subject of this Act is sales? Is that not right? Rather than service contracts.",
  "But do you -- do you contend the word \"sold\" is an ambiguous term, requires construction by a particular agency?",
  "Do you think Congress intended the ambiguity to be resolved by an agency rather than judges applying the rules of common law and the rules of sales law generally?",
  "Mr. Farr, are there earlier cases that applied Chevron deference to the Commerce's determination of what a sale is?",
  "Would you - -",
  "Would you do that if you thought it was clear as a matter of common law or under the Uniform Sales Act, or something like that, that it was not a sale?",
  "Under common law, you don't need deference.",
  "I'm sorry. If it were clearly a sale under common law, you wouldn't need to rely on deference.",
  "Isn't it true that in all of those cases there is no transfer of ownership of the basic product? And here -- and I am not sure you have really addressed it --it is a fungible product, and you are assuming you can't tell whether -- when it is in process or whether it is one party's or the other's. But if you could tell and you had some way of identifying just which one here, but they wouldn't care because they are all equally valuable, and if it developed that it was actually a third party's product that was being processed, then there would be a transfer of ownership, and there clearly would be a sale. Isn't that true?",
  "But you have the same contract you've got here, but you are able to identify that, in fact, there is a difference in the -- in the commodity that -- that -- at least not a different raw material that was sent to France and returned. It is just a substitute. It seems to me that -- in that context, within the meaning of your argument, that there would have been the transfer of title to that -- that commodity.",
  "Well, isn't it true, if you can't tell, the odds are that there is some product the title to which has been transferred?",
  "Isn't it true that - - isn't it true that that is a word that often is used with -- with no reference whatsoever to the -- the sexual connotation?",
  "You think it's equally - - it's equally subject to being treated as indecent within the meaning of the statute regardless of which meaning was actually apparent to everybody who listened to it?",
  "Yes, but wasn't the rationale for the lesser standard largely the scarcity of the frequencies?",
  "But it relied on it in Red Lion?",
  "Maybe I shouldn't ask this, but is there ever appropriate for the Commission to take into consideration at all the question whether the particular remark was really hilarious, very, very funny? Some of these things - -",
  "-- you can't help but laugh at. Is that -- is that a proper consideration, do you think?",
  "If there is -- if there is a change in the community standards, does that justify a change in the FCC's policies? And the second question and the reason I ask that is: Do you think today the community generally is more offended by these words or more tolerant of these words - -",
  "-- as compared to what Pacifica was concerned with?",
  "May I ask this question, Mr. Phillips? I guess in the -- in the last analysis we are trying to decide what the word \"indecent\" means.",
  "And do you think that the word \"indecent\" can have -- that -- that a fleeting expletive could be not indecent, but the same words could be indecent if they are repeated several times?",
  "Yes, but I -- I am not - - not sure I make my question as clear as I should. If we are trying to define the term \"indecent\" - -",
  "-- does the -- does the number of times the word is used in a particular context make a difference in the definition?",
  "As a matter of statutory definition, if a particular word can describe those activities, it is equally indecent if used for a different purpose?",
  "-- would not be indecent. That is the interpretation - -",
  "-- you should accept. Let's say because one interpretation of an ambiguous word would not be indecent, you are saying the rule of lenity in that sort of approach would require in a criminal case to just adopt that -- that definition?",
  "Could I ask one question that just occurred to me? Do you think the use of the word dung, D-U-N-G, would be indecent?",
  "Am I correct that on the underlying merits of the basic claims, that each -- his lawyer filed an Anders brief?",
  "He's probably not a very -- he's not -- has the greatest in the world of succeeding, I wouldn't suppose. Isn't this characteristic of this category of cases, that really most of them heard are pretty frivolous?",
  "What strikes me about the case is we are fighting about the limitations and whether it applies and so forth; you probably could have disposed of the whole litigation a lot faster by just looking at the merits for about ten minutes.",
  "This is all -- this is a product of Congress trying to save us all time.",
  "Mr. Pincus, refresh my recollection about something about the Fedorenko case, which I should have reread, but I honestly didn't in detail. Am I not correct that the point that Justice Alito makes was really part of the background of the case there was that nobody really believed his testimony? It was assumed, for purposes of decision, that he was telling the truth, but it was pretty clear he was not. Whereas here everybody does assume, for purposes of decision, that this man is telling the truth?",
  "What is your answer to the question?",
  "All right.",
  "Voluntariness is the purpose the statute. What is the difference between intent and knowledge, in terms of the purpose of the statute? Why is intent different -- lack of intent any different from lack of knowledge? If you read this statute literally?",
  "You say that, do you not, that with a case involving lack of knowledge.",
  "Pardon?",
  "There was an intent to persecute or an intent to perform certain acts that constitute persecution?",
  "May I ask you kind of perhaps a farfetched hypothetical question just so I get the case law in mind? Supposing a prosecutor wanted to develop a policy which would keep -- which would create a bifurcated regime within the office where the people who interrogate prisoners are entirely separate from the people who prosecute trials, so that they don't have the malicious purpose that your adversary says is involved in this case. And supposing the prosecutor then hired some expert layman who had no trial experience at all to develop such a program, and the program, itself, is desirable from the prosecution's point of view but - - but presumably unconstitutional. Would the person who developed that program be entitled to immunity - -",
  "-- in my example?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, why -- why is it qualified immunity if a separate person does it, but not qualified immunity if precisely the same task is performed by somebody who happens also to be a prosecutor?",
  "And in my hypothetical is it or is it not a prosecutorial -- does the layperson perform or not perform a prosecutorial function?",
  "No, but I'm trying to divorce the information in the particular case from developing the program.",
  "Even if it's made by a layman?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, what do you do with my hypothetical? Do you remember it?",
  "No, I'm -- my hypothetical is they hire a layman - -",
  "-- to develop a policy that will keep separate from prosecutors information about the way witnesses are developed. And the policy I think is highly unprobable, I agree with you, but the policy is designed to avoid the obligation imposed by Giglio and Brady.",
  "But that's true even without -- without an immunity.",
  "Of course, the next question is, if that's true, and if there is -- you can compartmentalize the prosecutor's work in the office and he develops a separate chapter of his own duty to just do that performance, why is that trial-related?",
  "Can I ask you this question? I know we have an immunity case, but your underlying cause of action, the one you just described, the policy there of not filing supplements, or say you had a policy of training lawyers how to evade the Batson issue. There are all sorts of troublesome policies that might be developed. Are you aware of any case in which the court has held that such a policy can be challenged in the abstract, in the -- as, sort of, on its face, rather than as applied?",
  "The policy when they - - when they deny someone his Giglio rights or so on and so on. Have you had any cases like this one in which a court has held that such a cause of action is available against an office policy?",
  "Can be brought under 1983 for such a general policy?",
  "That it will produce on a regular basis constitutional - -",
  "Then it seems to me that in this case the absolute immunity question is harder than the question that you present on the merits.",
  "But your client's standing to challenge this whole policy is the fact that he was the victim of the -- of the use of the policy in a particular case for which the prosecutor has absolute immunity.",
  "But I think you told me earlier that there are no prior cases in which such -- a person who suffered such an injury can bring an independent 1983 case challenging the policy at large.",
  "Mr. Roberts - -",
  "Mr. Roberts, have you had occasion to look at the -- the recent figures compiled by the Sentencing Commission?",
  "Is the magnitude of the risk relevant? Suppose it happens one out of 10,000 times or 99 out of 100 times. Are they different cases?",
  "Do you think those statistics show a greater danger than the dangers from drunk driving that were involved in Begay?",
  "Mr. Roberts, I'm sorry; do you think a soldier who is AWOL commits a violent crime?",
  "Well, he has to be a recidivist. This is one of three offenses for an aggravated sentence. You never have the isolated question.",
  "It would only be a crime if it's his third crime and not if it's his first.",
  "Sure.",
  "Mr. Fisher, I just want to be about -- clear about one thing. We are talking about drug cases primarily. But the rule that we are fighting about is not limited to drugs. Doesn't it apply to laboratory reports on DNA, blood tests, all sorts of evidence? Isn't that correct?",
  "Well, it seems to me it's a very important point.",
  "Ms. Schertler, please clarify one thing for me. Is the rule you're seeking one limited to tests performed by machines?",
  "So would you agree the Confrontation Clause would apply if it were an independent expert's test -- test results and testimony.",
  "Just tell me yes or no.",
  "Well, then we shouldn't talk about just machines.",
  "Yes but the rule, the issue is not limited to drug cases. Murder cases, all sorts of cases where there is scientific evidence.",
  "May I ask -- may I ask, to make sure I understand the alternate reading. Is it your view that the statute does mean the same as if, after the words \"deadly weapon,\" there had been inserted a parenthetical (iii), closed paren, \"is committed by\"? If -- now there is the element of \"attempted use of force\" is one, is the second requirement; and the third requirement is that it be committed by a current or former spouse.",
  "So your -- your reading -- I'm just following up on the Chief Justice's question - - requires us to assume that Congress really intended there to be a triple \"i\" as well as a double \"i\", and the triple \"i\" would have begun with the verb \"is.\"",
  "But it is true, is it not, that if you did do it that way, it would have been a lot clearer than it is now?",
  "While we pause, can I just ask you one question to make sure I understand the two -- two different positions? Your view of the subsection ii is that the meaning you attributed to it is -- would be exactly the same if you left out the word \"committed\"? In other words, it seems to me under your view the word -- either the word \"committed\" or the words \"committed by\" is superfluous?",
  "Why would you need that in there if the statute means -- if the element is the use of force by a family member? Why do you have to put in another verb, \"committed\"?",
  "Well, I'm not interested in changes. I'm just interested in the text before us. And it seems to me that your reading of the statute is exactly what the statute would say if it did not include the word \"committed.\"",
  "Let me be sure I understand the legislative history correctly in a broad sense. The text of the bill as originally introduced in the Senate favors the Government. Is that correct?",
  "And there was a change made in the House in the form of an amendment to that bill? Or was it a separate bill introduced in the House?",
  "They enacted a different text.",
  "And then -- without explanation. And then the bill went back to the Senate. As I understand it, it was approved in the form enacted by the House without -- with only that one comment.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Let me be sure. But under your view, it actually made it narrower?",
  "Yes.",
  "May I ask you, so I understand your position on the underlying question if we don't dismiss. Am I correct that the granting of an evidentiary hearing was based on a showing by the Petitioner that he failed to develop facts which might change the result?",
  "Why did the -- why did the Federal court grant a hearing?",
  "Wasn't he only entitled to do that on the basis of a showing that there was more evidence that the State court did not consider?",
  "So maybe the district court was dead wrong, but the assumption I think we made when we took the case was that there was a body of evidence that had not been available in the State proceeding that might be available in the Federal proceeding.",
  "And if that were true -- I know you disagree with that and I understand your argument. Maybe we shouldn't have taken the case. But if that were true and the Federal court then had to decide on the basis of all the evidence, do you read the statute to say at that time he may only rely on the evidence presented to the State court?",
  "All right. Suppose he looked at the State court evidence and he says, that was not enough. The State court's decision on the merits was reasonable based on that record. I have a different record before me. May he look at the different record?",
  "That's what we're talking about. May he look at it?",
  "All right. Forget the cause and prejudice for just a moment. But if he looks at that new evidence and he decides that any neutral judge would have reached a different result from the State judge on that evidence, may he reach that result?",
  "Then what's the point - -",
  "What you're saying is the correctness of decision based on the State court record. And if he decides there was a sound decision on that record, that's the end of the ball game; is that your position?",
  "It's the same claim. It's the same claim.",
  "Then it seems to me the statute has constructed a pointless procedure.",
  "Can I ask you question that's kind of in the background of the case?",
  "Assume you didn't have the policy that you do have, but it was perfectly clear that the city decided not to put up this monument because it disagreed with the message of the monument. Whether you call it Government speech or private speech, would that be permissible?",
  "Let me ask you a question to make sure I understand your position. It would have been permissible for the city to say, our park it filled with monuments and we are only going to let those in who convey messages that we agree with?",
  "If that's a policy.",
  "But really, in this case sort of the debate as to whether the policy justifications for the monument are a sham are not are really irrelevant?",
  "Even if it's a Government forum for private speech, I think it's the same thing. You're defining -- you define the forum to include only those -- the forum is putting up monuments. You just put up those monuments that agree with the message.",
  "Well, supposing the Government in the Vietnam Memorial decided not to put up the names of any homosexual soldiers. Would that be permissible?",
  "I didn't get the answer. Did you - -",
  "Mr. Salvatore, are you going to get to your explanation about Gardner-Denver before you're all through?",
  "But not a judicial -- not a judicial forum.",
  "General Six, under your reading of the statute, 1934 particularly, would the Court have authority to charge your fees to your adversary, shift attorney's fees?",
  "Did you make such a request in this case? Why should -- why should attorney's fees be treated differently from expert witness fees? Let me put it that way. Or should it be treated differently?",
  "Would you just answer my question of a moment ago. Why should expert witness fees be treated differently from attorney's fees?",
  "You used lawyers to prove your case, too.",
  "You used lawyers to prove your case, too. Why should they not be compensated?",
  "I don't understand that to be an answer to why he didn't also ask for attorney's fees.",
  "May I ask. Just to put one thing on the table if I could. How do you deal with the problem that Justice Ginsburg raises: If a court wants to appoint an independent expert and pay him more than $40 a day? Do you say that's flatly prohibited? And if it's not flatly prohibited, what is the authority for doing so, other than 1911?",
  "But what authorizes it? Doesn't 1911 authorize it?",
  "Well, then what does?",
  "Then why don't you have the inherent authority to pay expert witness fees a little more money, then?",
  "You're not spending the government's money; you're spending the litigant's money.",
  "That's enough.",
  "We can't see you.",
  "What I understand, Mr. Rothfeld, that if you win on the question presented, you would agree that the -- the arguments the other side makes on this, on whether there's a cause of action under equal protection and so forth, that would remain open on remand?",
  "And you may still lose the lawsuit even if you win here?",
  "Yes, but if you lose under -- under Title IX, a fortiori, you would lose under the Constitution, I would think.",
  "Isn't it quite clear we can forget about issue preclusion and assume as Justice Scalia did, the client brought an action under 1983 and did not rely on Title IX at all, and just sued the school board, you would say he can't do that?",
  "And that's your issue, whether that's right or wrong. We don't have to talk about issue -- issue preclusion to decide that issue.",
  "Let me ask you one sort of anomaly that keeps running through my mind in this case. If you have two school boards, one of -- two schools, state schools, one gets federal funds and the other does not, does this preclude -- no 1983 remedy against one, but there is a 1983 remedy against the other, that's your view, isn't it?",
  "Is it anomalous to think it - -",
  "Would it prove the same facts in both cases? I mean, the case of it would involve the same evidence, same alleged wrongdoing, and then one case you can rely on 1983 and the other you can't?",
  "Are you disagreeing with the premise of Justice Kennedy's question?",
  "You don't think - -",
  "-- Congress intended a tougher standard?",
  "You do not think Congress intended a tougher standard; is that true?",
  "Mr. Lazarus, can I ask you - -",
  "May I ask you this question? It's not economically available if it would bankrupt the whole industry?",
  "What about if it bankrupts three firms?",
  "But it's not economically available to those three firms.",
  "No, but this -- they just have -- they are just not quite as strong a company.",
  "Yes.",
  "Just you ask an offshoot of Justice Kennedy's question. Supposing you had a statute that said in railroad cases there should be no damage -- railroad tort cases, brought by employees of railroads, there was no damage judgment in excess of $10,000, in State court? Would that be okay?",
  "Do you think - - consistently with our FELA cases it could have a rule that no tort -- no tort cases may be brought by railroad employees against the railroad in a State court.",
  "Well, they shouldn't have closed the Federal doors under the FELA. They surely could bring the suit under Federal.",
  "But you are saying they could -- as opposed to State courts, the suits against railroads where the damage gets -- over $10,000?",
  "But they could totally close it?",
  "If you leave the door open to suits against every other possible defendant except railroads? I mean, it seems to me your hardest case is really the FELA cases here.",
  "In county - -",
  "But the State court hadn't ruled on it at that time.",
  "So how do we rule on it as a matter of first impression?",
  "I want to ask you about that. That's the thrust of your argument: It would have been futile to comply with the specific, drafting a perfect -- perfect instruction \"correct in all respects.\" But I have to think the trial -- the record is subject to the reading that the trial judge thought the issue had already been adequately taken care of, rather than it would be an incorrect instruction.",
  "Where in the record is the portion of the colloquy about the instructions most clearly stated in your view, on your side of that issue?",
  "But that's exactly the point I make. I think the trial judge was saying, I think it's already covered, which is different from saying, no matter how you phrase it, I won't give it.",
  "There was a basis for questioning the good faith of the court in that case, I think.",
  "And I don't think that's true here.",
  "Could you just tell me, well, why was it an exercise in futility? That's what I don't quite understand.",
  "But she said she thought it was already covered. That's what I -- on that very page you pointed me to.",
  "The problem - -",
  "Do we give any weight in the case to the fact that the instruction that the Petitioners now request and the rule had not really been announced clearly as of the time of this trial? It's not exactly a new rule, but let's -- for our sake we will call it a new rule. Does that have any weight?",
  "But it does in our cause and prejudice jurisprudence. In habeas, which is also a civil action - -",
  "-- we say there is an overarching Federal principle that allows; because of cause and prejudice, we can consider the Federal issue. We do that all the time. Those cases weren't raised by the Petitioner, but it seems to me they're quite relevant here, especially when you consider the importance of the constitutional issue, which was not really -- let's face it -- clear to counsel on either side of the aisle or to the trial judge.",
  "But the trial judge didn't have the benefit of -- of the ruling that this Court has subsequently made on that point. The trial judge in fact here said: Now, if you can give me a case, then I will give you an instruction; you can't give me a case. And she was right.",
  "Was Congress aware of this when the Administrative Procedure Act was passed, you mean?",
  "Maybe I am not following this as I should, but it seems to me you are suggesting that there is no error.",
  "What was the error?",
  "Are you saying that error was not prejudicial because the earlier information she received gave her what she needed?",
  "Why wasn't that statement you just made sufficient to discharge the burden of showing no prejudice?",
  "May I ask a factual question. You said most of these people were represented by counsel. There used to be a rule that they could only be paid ten dollars a case. Is that still in effect?",
  "But not during the nisi prius proceeding.",
  "There can be counsel. But is it really typical?",
  "There would be a dramatic change, because years ago I remember a case in which the Court upheld a ten-dollar fee limit on the notion that these people didn't need lawyers at all, which struck me as a little strange.",
  "May I just clarify: Are you arguing there is never a price-squeeze claim under Section 2? In other words, are you challenging Judge Hand's reasoning in the Alcoa case?",
  "Was there such a duty in the Alcoa case?",
  "Ms. Maynard, do you join in your colleague's suggestion that we should overrule the Alcoa case?",
  "Do you think it's necessary to do so to decide this case?",
  "My question is really, you think it's necessary to overrule that decision in order to decide this case correctly?",
  "Do we have to say it was decided incorrectly?",
  "That's not my question.",
  "I know you think it's incorrect. I am asking whether you think we have to say it's incorrect in order to decide this case correctly?",
  "Right.",
  "May I ask this: I'm not familiar on this point. Apart from Alcoa, what are the cases applying a traditional price squeeze claim?",
  "Do you agree with your opponent's submission that antitrust scholars uniformly agree that the Alcoa case was incorrectly decided?",
  "Let me ask just one quick question: Is it your view that the evidence was deliberately suppressed or negligently suppressed?",
  "May I ask -- let me get something on the table. Do you agree that the evidence shows that this evidence was deliberately suppressed?",
  "But is there any explanation for -- was there any explanation for it other than the tactical explanation?",
  "It seems to be relevant because if it was suppressed for tactical reasons, it seems to me hard to say that the prosecution thought it didn't make any difference.",
  "What they -- one of the first questions always troubles me in a Brady case is the conduct of the prosecutor and the ethics of the profession, the whole -- whole importance of the rule is to be sure prosecutors perform their public function. And I'm just wondering if there is any -- if this was a case of just an honest mistake, it would be one thing, but if it appears to have been a tactical decision and a tactical program, it seems to me very difficult to assume that the prosecutor thought it was really not important evidence.",
  "It's a simple question, yes or no?",
  "That's not my question. Can you answer my question? Did he have an ethical duty to turn this material over?",
  "May I ask if your view of the law that, if the officer is pretty sure that the person he's having a consensual encounter with has a gun -- he could see the bulge or something -- is that sufficient or does he have to have some proof that the person is about to use the gun?",
  "What about just meeting on -- on the street, the officer meets the man on the street and asks him where he's going or something like that, and he sees a -- a bulge in the pocket that convinces the officer he has a gun, but that's all. That's the only evidence of a threat to the officer. Is that enough?",
  "What if he says \"yes\"?",
  "General Parkhurst - -",
  "General Parkhurst, I -- I seem to be a little confused about the facts of this case. I had the -- remember the testimony that she thought the -- that the encounter had become consensual, which meant that he was no longer -- in her view, no longer under police custody. But are you also saying she also thought he was about to assault her; and, therefore, she was in danger?",
  "There is a substantial difference between being both in danger and saying, well, the arrest was all over.",
  "Let me ask you, suppose it's a roadside encounter in which the driver is changing a flat tire and the officer stops and wants to talk to him for a while and then he suddenly thinks, well, maybe this guy's armed. Is it okay for him to go ahead and search him?",
  "Well, Maybe he has an articulable suspicion.",
  "Is that any different from meeting somebody on the -- on the street corner?",
  "The flat -- my flat tire example.",
  "But those are roadside encounters after a traffic violation.",
  "You don't rely at all on the fact this is a traffic stop?",
  "On your second point, that is.",
  "Why is it easier?",
  "Yes, but those are all cases in which there is a violation of law that preceded the activity. I asked you about cases in which there is nothing other than the officer's interest in patting down the guy because he thinks he has a gun.",
  "But you'd apply the same rule if the -- if the officer just stopped to help the guy change his tire.",
  "May I ask you if the Department of Justice has ever taken this position before?",
  "I'm asking you whether you have. You don't think they have, do you? It's a rather extreme position.",
  "Well, there is a dispute as to whether the man thought he was free to leave. That's a big dispute, isn't it?",
  "Did he testify?",
  "So nobody asked him whether he thought he was free to leave -- which would have solved a lot of problems.",
  "Do you agree that if you -- if you lose on the seizure issue, you lose?",
  "I have difficulty accepting your suggestion that there is a sliver of cases. It seems to me there are a multitude of cases in which officers might suspect somebody is armed but not think criminal activity is afoot, but decide they would like to pat them down.",
  "Do you argue in -- in all of this that this guy was not dangerous?",
  "Well, Mr. Garre, it seems to me you are really arguing -- I am very sympathetic to the argument -- that if there was no plausible claim in Bell Atlantic, in which there was a direct allegation of a conspiracy in violation of section 1, was rejected because the Court thought it implausible, a fortiori this claim is implausible because it's got exactly the same problems in that you don't want to subject these important people to all the inconvenience of discovery. It seems to me these cases are very, very similar.",
  "Of course, in both of the cases, the job of the district judge would have been made much easier if one of the defendants had filed an affidavit denying those allegations, but nobody has done that in either case.",
  "Mr. Garre, can I ask you a factual question because I really don't know? In the -- assume that -- that they had to go to trial on this case, which may not be the case. Would they be entitled to be defended by the Department of Justice or would they have to get private counsel?",
  "And that applies even if there would be a trial later on?",
  "I see.",
  "Of course, the problem with the president of the Coca-Cola is the allegation probably would be that the Coca-Cola Company has adopted sloppy procedures in its manufacturing lines, and the president is responsible for those procedures, and that's why the bottles are filled with rats.",
  "That's the way you would allege it. You wouldn't say he did it personally.",
  "And then you would have a similar question.",
  "No, this is a policy of being derelict in the sanitary conditions in the plant and so forth and so on; therefore, mice -- mice are getting into bottles with undue frequency, and the president is responsible for that. I don't see that that's a fanciful allegation.",
  "I'm not suggesting that Coca-Cola really does that. Of course not, but --",
  "But the standard theory is that --",
  "May I just interrupt? There are a whole bunch of other defendants in this case. As I understand it, they're still in the case.",
  "So you do have discovery of maybe 25 to 30 officials who would have a lot of information about this case. It seems to me it's entirely possible that you could either postpone discovery and dismiss the two principal defendants for now and then bring them in later, if the facts you develop from the other discovery would prove what you have alleged.",
  "Mr. Garre, I just wanted to -- would you say that the -- the Attorney General might be subject to taking a deposition, even if he's not a defendant?",
  "Is there any -- some standard rule of law that government officials don't have to testify at proceedings?",
  "I certainly didn't think there was when I wrote Clinton v. Jones.",
  "Let me just be sure I understand one thing: Are you contending that the plan is not unlawful or that the claim is untimely?",
  "At the time it was adopted, it was lawful.",
  "Do I correctly understand that -- that you would agree that if this plan were adopted today it would be unlawful, but because it was -- that at the time it was adopted, and the statute uses the word \"adopted,\" it was lawful?",
  "May I ask a question? If there is a facially discriminatory system, are you saying this is a disparate impact case or a disparate treatment case?",
  "When did the -- when did the intentional discrimination take place?",
  "You do not -- you do not contend that the plan was unlawful at the time it was adopted?",
  "Well, let me ask you this question: At the time the plan was adopted, discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not discrimination on the basis of sex, according to the majority in Gilbert.",
  "Which I happen to disagree with. So as a matter of law, it seems to me at the time the plan was adopted it was a lawful plan.",
  "Under what?",
  "But does the statute use the term -- does the statute use the term \"facially discriminatory system\"?",
  "Right.",
  "It is also clear that -- is it also clear that a statute -- that -- that a plan that does not intentionally discriminate may, nevertheless, discriminate facially? I think the two things --",
  "Yes, but that was the current application of a system that was plainly discriminatory, intentionally discriminatory. Lorance was. They intentionally discriminated against women.",
  "No, but in Bazemore each paycheck was discriminatory.",
  "But the reason for that is because they adopted a plan a long time ago that was lawful.",
  "They're not applying a plan in Bazemore. They're paying a current salary. They're paying black people less than whites just because they are black.",
  "Yes, they were still paying -- each paycheck was a discriminatory paycheck. It didn't depend on history; whereas, a pension plan -- they always look at the formation of the plan. At least under subsection (h), I think you do.",
  "And that's what I disagree with. It seems to me if you look at the present in Bazemore, you find they are getting different salaries because of the difference in -- one is of one race, and the other is of another race.",
  "I still want to go back to assure that I've given you a fair opportunity to answer this. You are relying on Nashville v. Satty, which was a discriminatory impact case, and now you are arguing that the key is the -- is the intent. Which is it?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "Well, as soon as you get back to the intentional, you get away from Satty.",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "But it was not unlawful at the time it was done.",
  "But if it did not have the including phrase, if it just stopped there, would it then include proceedings necessary to exhaust the State remedies? I'm a little unclear why you think it does not include necessary proceedings -- proceedings necessary to exhaust State remedies.",
  "Why doesn't the word \"shall\" require it?",
  "Does that seem reasonable that Congress would have -- suppose you had a real complicated case with five or six issues in it, and they find out one issue is not exhausted. The capital case has been around for two or three years. Does Congress think, well, you've got to go on your own when you go back to the State court and try and exhaust that one claim?",
  "Now, where is that language again, \"appropriate motions\" - -",
  "No, but that's in the next clause.",
  "Why does that limit the interpretation that -- of the words \"subsequent stage\" -- \"throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings\"? And doesn't the State collateral proceeding which is necessary to exhaust a remedy fall right within that language?",
  "What?",
  "May I just make sure I understand your position. Does (a)(2) authorize the - - the federal judge to appoint counsel for a -- a person on death row under a state death conviction under 2254 or 2255?",
  "Yes.",
  "So he is -- he is entitled to a lawyer in the -- in the federal collateral review of a State death penalty case?",
  "And what in the statute limits the scope of that review?",
  "But you agree that (e) applies to State prisoners?",
  "In the -- for a State prisoner in a federal collateral proceeding?",
  "What, then, in that proceeding does the word \"clemency\" refer to? Is that clemency by the President of the United States?",
  "Even though the statute says so in so many words?",
  "Now, supposing on the eve of execution he wanted to apply for a stay of execution. He'd be entitled to representation before a federal judge, right?",
  "But what if the federal judge says, you have to -- under our practice you can't get a federal stay without first exhausting your attempt to get a State stay. Could he represent the defendant applying for -- in the State court for a stay of execution in that situation?",
  "So he would have to get a separate counsel to -- to go to the State court because -- even though the federal judge required him as a normal matter of practice to exhaust the State remedy under the very limited situation of a stay on the eve of execution?",
  "I understand that, but he would have no right to have his federal lawyer get paid for doing that work?",
  "Just for this, for the stay application on the eve of execution?",
  "It comes in with the - - the general language \"other appropriate motions and procedures,\" and so forth. That's got to be tailored back to mean other appropriate motions and procedures in a federal tribunal?",
  "You think that is perfectly clear from the text of the statute?",
  "Do you think that is perfectly clear from the text of the statute?",
  "It could have used the \"federal\" modifier very easily just by inserting the word \"federal\" in places.",
  "Mr. Jay, would you comment on this general reaction I had when I read the statute? I had the impression that most lawyers appointed under this statute would be to represent defendants in State execution cases, and there are a few cases where there are Federal death penalty cases, but not very many across the whole spectrum. Am I right about that?",
  "But you're primarily dealing with the representation of State defendants in capital proceedings, and the number of cases in Federal proceedings where at the last minute there is a plea for executive clemency is very rare. And you think this particular provision we are debating here was really intended just to take care of the rare case where a Federal defendant is on death row seeking executive clemency, and not even to consider all the cases in which -- in State -- before -- that originate in State trials, where there is a lot of applications for executive clemency. You think it was intended to focus on that very narrow category?",
  "There are occasionally Federal constitutional question and sometimes arguments made in Federal clemency -- I mean, in State clemency proceedings and Federal clemency proceedings.",
  "But arguably there is Federal right or constitutional right to a fair proceeding in a clemency application?",
  "May I just be clear on one thing on your position, Mr. Jay? Is it your view that the federal judge may not allow the lawyer to do anything in an unexhausted claim, or does he have some discretion?",
  "What is the government's position on that issue?",
  "It seems to me that issue would arise more often than the issue we are fighting about in this case.",
  "But doesn't the EPA have a veto power over the fill material permit?",
  "So they're not totally mutually exclusive.",
  "But as I read that sentence, Mr. Olson, it says they are subject to both permitting.",
  "You are talking about the last sentence on - -",
  "Let me ask you this question. Supposing we were convinced, and I'm not suggesting we should be on the record, but supposing we were convinced that only the dumbest, untrained lawyer in the world could have failed to advance this defense, and that therefore I would have no doubt about it as an original proposition that he was incompetent under Strickland -- under the general Strickland standard. Would we be permitted to say that in the case, or would we have to say, well, this particular kind of attorney error has never been addressed before, and therefore, we can't look at it?",
  "But isn't it true that there's a whole host of counsel errors that could violate Strickland? But do you have to find one that we have addressed before before a Federal court can apply and say Strickland was violated?",
  "Would it be -- wouldn't it be a clear answer in this case to say this was a terrible lawyer, and therefore Strickland -- Strickland applies? Or could you say, we don't care how bad the lawyer was, Strickland -- we haven't adjudicated this precise set of facts before, so that's the end of the ball game?",
  "Is that what you're asking us to do?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "That's his argument, not the one you've been making.",
  "You say the standard is Strickland.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, is it part of your assumption that at the time the police were doing the interrogating that they knew he had been appointed a lawyer?",
  "That's why I'm interested in your comment.",
  "Do you presume -- do you argue that we should presume that the entire police force is aware of what happened in court?",
  "Let me just interrupt. Isn't it perfectly realistic to presume that the police knew at the 72-hour hearing he was appointed a lawyer?",
  "But it happens in 99 percent of the cases, I think, in a capital case. And surely, the police should be presumed to know what the normal procedure is.",
  "Yes, but in this very case, if there had been a court reporter present - - present, and if the record showed that this defendant said, thank you, I would like to be represented, then he would have been protected, right?",
  "Louisiana does not -- does not provide a transcript of all these hearings, does it?",
  "So what would -- what should we presume to be the general practice that happened, that most of them say, no, I don't want one or most of them will say, thank you?",
  "He had no -- no way of knowing that being silent would produce a different result than saying, yes, I'm happy with the lawyer. Does the uncounseled defendant have any way to know that? Does the routine require the judge to tell him, you have got a lawyer, but he's not going to be available unless you say you want him?",
  "I understood you to concede that if he had made that request at the 72-hour hearing, the outcome of this case would be different.",
  "The key time is did he make the request at the hearing, not at the time he was confronted by the officers.",
  "But it's sufficient protection for him if you presume, as is true in most States, that he did make the request, then you would lose. You would argue against such a presumption, I know, but if we did indulge that presumption, the case would be over.",
  "Let me ask you: If the case had gone to trial without any intermediate proceeding -- they just show up for the day of trial - - and there's no record of whether he accepted the lawyer earlier, would the State judge start out with the presumption that Faretta would apply and he's going on his own, or would they start out with the assumption that he is going to have a lawyer?",
  "So you're drawing a distinction between this -- the kind of proceeding that's involved? He doesn't really need help on deciding whether to confess, but he does need help if they go to trial?",
  "There's an irony in this case that Justice Kennedy put a finger on earlier: If there were a civil case, whether you could go talk to a lawyer -- a client, rather, who was represented by a lawyer, the answer would be quite clear: You could not, as a matter of professional ethics.",
  "I really wanted to ask you pretty much exactly the same question. If we assume exactly the terrible way he fired the first two -- the first lawyer certainly, maybe the second, would it be true that no matter how long the delay occurred after that, he could never get Sixth Amendment relief?",
  "Why not?",
  "Let me ask you this question about your reliance on pages 27 and 28. If you describe it as delays by the lawyers themselves, I understand your comment as being right on the nose. But I understood part of that to be talking about the situation in which the defender general's office has not performed its duty with sufficient promptness. And would you not agree if there were a period, say, of seven or eight months in which they just didn't get around to appointing a lawyer, that that should be charged against the State?",
  "Isn't the prejudice factor pretty much established as long as the guy has to stay in jail during this entire period?",
  "Would you really get by that rule if there were, say, four years of delay and two years and one month was attributable to the defendant and two years to the State?",
  "Mr. Nelson - -",
  "-- what is your judgment on how much time all together was attributable to the State?",
  "May I ask essentially two questions. You mentioned the fact that this is not - - this is an unusual agreement, and that some of the provisions were negotiated and the record shows they were -- they were deliberately undertaken. It seems to me that this was probably a scrivener's error. The normal -- most plea agreements would include a provision that if the defendant engaged in unlawful conduct, all bets are off. And my hunch was that somebody just forgot to put the boilerplate language in the agreement. Is that fair to say? I can't imagine the government negotiating an agreement that doesn't include that clause.",
  "But going back to my question, isn't it a likely explanation for the defendant's lawyer's failure to object that he just didn't realize this agreement didn't have this normal provision in it?",
  "Right.",
  "No, I understand that. But the other thing I wanted to ask you: You keep using the term \"void.\" Do our cases say that any breach of a plea agreement renders it void rather than subject to some kind of other remedy?",
  "But those are cases that say that the remedy is setting aside the -- the guilty plea, but they don't characterize the -- the agreement as having become void, if I -- if I remember correctly.",
  "Yes, but those -- that goes to the integrity of the guilty plea, not to whether or not the underlying contract became void, I think. Maybe I'm missing something.",
  "May I ask this kind of conceptual question? Is it your view that a breach of a plea agreement can never be concluded to be harmless error?",
  "I'm trying to get rid of the labels like \"plain error\" and \"structural.\" But if in fact it's totally harmless and everybody agrees it's harmless, would the government still have to -- or would there be an adverse consequence nevertheless?",
  "So, there could never be harmless error, harmless breach of a plea agreement?",
  "You're talking about manipulation of the system. I just wonder if the government wasn't manipulating the system when they said we should grant cert in this case. You did -- you did agree that the cert should be granted.",
  "And are you taking the position that -- that every case, that the absence of objection would always be controlling?",
  "For example, in this particular case, it seems to me that if the -- if you had an objection and if the judge had agreed with the objection and said I will set aside the plea because of adopting the arguments of your opponent, I think the government would have appealed, and said that that decision is so wrong and it's because it's really harmless error. I think here the real question is whether there's harmless error available, rather than turning anything on whether or not an objection was made in the district court.",
  "But in talking about the division of the circuits, do you think all breaches of -- of plea agreements should be governed by precisely the same standard? Or do you think there are varying facts in different cases?",
  "It seems to me that the government has tried to pick a case in which it has the strongest opportunity to win on the merits in order to have us decide a rule that really isn't important in a lot of other cases, but it is totally unimportant in this case.",
  "But don't you think it would have been open to the government to make the argument that Justice Breyer has made and said there really wasn't a breach here, at least an insignificant breach that should be ignored?",
  "May I ask you this: What other remedy, other than suppression of the confession made after six hours, is there available to the defendants to enforce the interest in prompt presentment?",
  "I just have one question. Do you think the -- that the D.C. Circuit -- the statute pertaining to the District of Columbia is relevant?",
  "Let me just ask before you get to those, Mr. Dreeben: Other than the McNabb- Mallory Rule, what was available as a sanction for violations of the rule of prompt presentment?",
  "No, not -- apart from an evidentiary sanction.",
  "So at the time that Mallory and McNabb were decided the Court thought that an extra rule was necessary to give the government an incentive to comply with prompt-presentment requirements. The very same factors are still at work today, aren't they?",
  "No, but I am not -- we are not talking about a constitutional problem but a rule problem encouraging compliance with the -- the -- with the rule that requires prompt presentment.",
  "I say that to the extent -- to the extent that was a motivating factor in McNabb, it seems to me that it would be precisely the same motivating factor in McNabb.",
  "Not the sole, but it was a motivating factor. And it would have equal strength today as then.",
  "It is still true they have everything to gain and nothing to lose by continuing to interrogate.",
  "If they don't get the confession within six hours, they haven't got it. So if they continue on, their only purpose is to try to get a voluntary confession.",
  "But if it doesn't, Mr. Dreeben, what do the words \"time limitation\" mean in the proviso?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, do you think the Rule 402 argument is strong enough to prevail even section -- the statute that has never been enacted?",
  "The statute was really unnecessary to overrule McNabb-Mallory, in your view?",
  "But it is superfluous and unnecessary answer if your interpretation of the rules is correct?",
  "We could never acknowledge or recognize a new privilege, then, for example - -",
  "-- psychiatrists or something like that?",
  "It seems to me you are just confirming the answer to the Chief Justice's question. There really isn't any down side. The worst that -- the worst that happens is maybe they can't use the stuff. But what -- what is the down side?",
  "Has any police officer ever been disciplined for doing this; do you know?",
  "I would find it rather amazing if he has.",
  "The defendant could sometimes lie. But sometimes people who are in this position in prison are not the most trustworthy people, either.",
  "You could bring that out on cross-examination. I understand that.",
  "It seems to me that that all confirms the fact, well, they have nothing to lose. Maybe we have one witness who is not very persuasive, but no harm in giving it a try.",
  "If it is truthfully reported. Of course, that is always -- that is an issue of credibility in all of these cases.",
  "Would that apply equally for statements under oath?",
  "Excuse me, but I'm not following. I have the same difficulty that perhaps the Chief Justice is trying to get at. In the case where it appears to the -- the judge that the -- that the alien would be murdered when he is returned, wouldn't his deportation be prohibited by law?",
  "GEN. KNEEDLER, when we entered this stage, did we violate (f)(2)?",
  "Where -- where do we get that authority if (f)(2) means what you say?",
  "May I just ask this one real quick: Do you understand -- is your understanding that the government's interpretation of the statute that our stay in this case violated the statute?",
  "General Kneedler - -",
  "Can I ask one question? I probably should have asked earlier. But there is no dispute as the case comes to us. I know the government has taken the position that there was no breach of trust. But do we -- we do have to decide it on the assumption that there was a breach of trust that caused all this damage?",
  "Of course, the Illinois Supreme Court was assuming a Federal violation when it decided what the reversal rule would be. But your Federal violation determines -- is bottomed on the notion that there was an unlawful adjudicator on the jury. Would that reasoning apply, in regard to one of the earlier questions, if you have a Cook County jury and they had a juror from Dupage County and the law says no, you have got to have a local juror, and it turns out that they had wrongly seated such a juror? Would that be an unlawful adjudicator?",
  "I just have one more thought. And if it is such an unlawful adjudicator, it would definitely be Federal constitutional error?",
  "But Justice Alito's question is could the State say as a matter of State law whenever the trial judge has a hunch that there might have been discriminatory purpose involved, may he refuse to allow the preemptory challenge?",
  "No, but I -- if the State explicitly gave the trial judge that authority, would that be constitutional?",
  "Going back to Justice Scalia's question, do you think we would have jurisdiction of this certiorari condition if we were convinced there was no Federal or constitutional error; they were merely trying to decide whether the State court applied the correct constitutional standard in correcting what it thought was a correct federal constitutional error?",
  "And if there is none there, we don't have jurisdiction to answer and give an advisory opinion on how the Illinois Supreme Court should run its shop.",
  "You -- they did make that assumption, but you think the assumption is wrong. And if we think the assumption is wrong, you would agree with Justice Scalia that we can go ahead and say, well, you are running for reelection, so we are going to correct your errors on Federal law.",
  "Suppose the Illinois had a statute that the prosecution gets 10 peremptories and the defendants get one, would that raise a federal question?",
  "Isn't the answer pretty clear that that would be unfair.",
  "The reason it's unlikely is it is so clearly unconstitutional.",
  "But that is almost the same, at least in some states, as getting a new trial anyway. If we find out after the fact that the jury was biased, and in some States that's a reason for a new trial in the discretion of the trial court, anyway.",
  "The point is you are not giving much substance to the rule.",
  "May I just ask one sort of a preliminary question? If we just applied the plain language of 1447(d), then this case was properly remanded; the remand order is not subject to review. Is that correct?",
  "What really prevents us from reaching that decision in this case? Because actually it's an open question because you were both arguing about it here and you certainly disagree. Why couldn't we just simply say for this particular category of remand orders, we'll just apply the plain language of 1447(d)?",
  "I understand it would be a modification of the dicta in Thermtron, but why wouldn't that be a simple solution to this case?",
  "No, no, that wouldn't avoid the plain language of the statute. Pretextual district court orders wouldn't avoid the plain language of the statute.",
  "You just have to distinguish Thermtron. You don't have to overrule it. You'd still apply it on its facts. That's a very different problem. When the judge says, I'm too busy to hear this, I'm going to send it back to State court, that's what Thermtron resolved. Here - -",
  "That's not involved here.",
  "Let me just make one comment on the large departure: Would it be a large departure if we just said, in the very narrow category of cases where there has been a remand on the basis of -- the district judge doesn't want to exercise supplementary jurisdiction over State law claims, that's not appealable, period? Just say that's a slight exception from Thermtron?",
  "-- not for that basis? They're not amendments of subsection (d), and subsection (d) is what has the language that really reads right on this case.",
  "Yes, but your opponent's argument is that the claims that remain do include a federal claim.",
  "What about the ruling on the RICO claim itself? That was clearly a federal issue.",
  "Ms. Sullivan, can I interrupt you? Because I'm still puzzled by your answer to Justice Alito. Are you conceding that if in this case Shell had an alternative carrier who would not have spilled a bit, that then there would be liability?",
  "I thought you did in your answer to Justice Alito. Why wouldn't that be? Explain your answer a little more fully?",
  "Independent of the time of control.",
  "May I ask, is it essential to your theory that Shell had title to the material until delivery?",
  "What if it were a fungible product and the purchaser just agreed to take either some product of this -- this quantity and quality and so forth, but they could substitute other -- other goods from another source? Would Shell still be liable?",
  "Well, Shell gave all the same instructions they gave here, but they just didn't insist that it be their product rather than somebody else's, another oil company's product.",
  "Excuse me. Does that proposition settle the question whether your opponents have equitable interest in the lands?",
  "But isn't it perfectly clear that's a question of State law?",
  "Are you saying that the State court couldn't do it but the legislature could?",
  "Could the legislature do it?",
  "The State power -- the State legislative power to act depends on the validity of its reasoning.",
  "Well, it does, though, in a way, because I understand your theory is there are two basic kinds of crimes. You just use the document for your own source if you want to get the job or you want entry into the country or something like that. That's a minor crime. But if you are -- it's identity theft where you are pretending to be somebody else so you can get advantage of his credit and his assets and his access to computers. That's a much more serious crime. Now, if it's a dead person, it seems to me to be in the former category, rather than in the latter.",
  "Mr. Heytens, this raises the question I was talking to your opponent about. Do you think that Congress intended there to be a more severe punishment for somebody who really steals another person's -- knowingly steals somebody else's identity so he can cash in on his credit and so forth? It seems to me, arguably, that's the important difference.",
  "Yeah, but I think -- I thought that argument cut against you, because what you are saying is everybody is on the hook. There's a basic problem here, which iis -- I will call it identity fraud -- and yet you get an extra two years if it just so happens that the number you picked out of the air belonged to somebody else.",
  "-- history, do you know what people who are stealing identities of people who have been bilked or -- I think that - -",
  "But the reason for that is that it is an equally culpable act where you steal something off of a field than Morissette. I agree the Morissette case supports you, even though they relied on it, which is interesting to me. But that's a -- you are distinguishing between two equally culpable acts. It doesn't even make any difference whether he knew the owner was some private farmer or the United States. In this case, you have got two really big categories of different kinds, and instead they are treated alike is the thing that troubles me here.",
  "You can do it in this statute. That is the point.",
  "Even that isn't -- I mean, here you are treating it as if it is a separate thing. That is fair enough. And what are the words \"of another person\" doing there if really they are not supposed to make any difference in terms of mental state?",
  "And those are the category of cases in which Congress wanted to have a more severe penalty.",
  "In any of those cases did they talk about unknowing identity theft?",
  "You might not convince Justice Scalia of this, but you might convince me.",
  "Yes, but isn't it true that we've had DNA cases where the person has been found innocent despite the fact they confessed?",
  "How do we know this isn't one of those cases?",
  "Am I right in understanding that the State has agreed that this evidence is exonerating; that this evidence potentially could exonerate him?",
  "You mentioned the floodgates. There are seven cases in this State in the whole history of Alaska.",
  "Is that right? That's floodgates?",
  "May I -- before you start, would you -- I want you to clear up the question that Justice Breyer asked. Assume on remand he would now make the declaration under perjury that he's innocent. I understood you to say that would enable him get discovery, not necessarily to say he would get the DNA evidence. Am I right?",
  "Why don't - -",
  "Yes. I just want to be - - if your answer, as I understand it, is he can now apply for discovery, but you don't know what will happen then.",
  "Right.",
  "But the net result is that it is perfectly clear to me from the argument that you have not conceded that if he now files the paper, he will definitely get the DNA.",
  "Okay.",
  "Mr. De Marco, can I ask you this question? In section 3 do you agree with his reading of the word \"parties,\" or do you think \"parties\" just means parties to the contract?",
  "Yes.",
  "You are concerned about - - does that mean you agree with him that \"parties\" means parties to the action and not parties to the contract?",
  "Mr. Frey, is it your position that the appearance of impropriety could never be strong enough to raise a constitutional issue?",
  "I'm assuming appearances only. Are you saying that appearances without any actual proof of bias could never be sufficient as a constitutional matter?",
  "Is that your position?",
  "That's not an answer to my question.",
  "Supposing, for example, the judge had campaigned on the ground that he would issue favorable rulings to the United Mine Workers, and the United Mine Workers campaigned, raising money saying, we want to get a judge who will rule in our favor in all the cases we're interested in. Would that create an appearance of impropriety?",
  "Or take another example. The Chief Justice asked what if there are ten members of a trade association and would all -- and they all contributed to get a judge to vote in their favor in a case that involved a conspiracy charge among the - - charged the ten of them for violations of the Sherman Act, something like that. And if all ten of them raise money publicly for the very purpose of getting a judge who would rule favorably in their favor, that would clearly create a very extreme appearance of impropriety. Would that be sufficient, in your judgment, to raise a constitutional issue?",
  "No, it would meet the test in the -- in the judges' brief of an average judge would be tempted under the circumstances. That's the test that the Conference of Chief Justices judges - -",
  "And do you think that could ever, just appearance, could ever raise a due process issue?",
  "No matter how extreme the facts?",
  "The whole point of this case is it has not been recognized. We have never confronted a case as extreme as this before. This fits the standard that Potter Stewart articulated when he said \"I know it when I see it.\"",
  "The question is not whether we have, but whether we should.",
  "Of course, you can stop at what is obviously improper.",
  "Why not?",
  "You don't think the community's confidence in the way judges behave is an important part of due process?",
  "May I ask you on your challenge to the probability of bias as a standard. Do you think it's an unworkable standard or that even if there is a probability of bias, that should not be constitutionally disqualified?",
  "Why is it any more unworkable than probable cause in a Fourth Amendment case?",
  "Well, it has probable cause as a standard.",
  "Let me get back to the question. Why is probability in this context any more difficult to figure out than probability in the Fourth Amendment context?",
  "Or is it?",
  "Well, I'm not -- I'm not asking you about debt of gratitude. I'm asking you why isn't the probability standard perfectly administerable, just as it is in the Fourth Amendment? And surely you would agree - -",
  "-- that if there is a probability of bias, he ought to get out.",
  "Mr. Frey, there is obviously a difference between appointed judges and elected judges. But why do we have to rest on just one factor? The Conference of Chief Justices suggested their seven factors should be taken into account. Why is that totally unworkable? Why does it have to be just one theory, debt of gratitude and nothing else? They don't -- the chief judges who are elected don't think that's the way to do it.",
  "May I ask this question as just a matter of history? Is it perfectly clear? I think you said that the -- the presence of the use of the telephone was not just a jurisdictional hook. Because back in 1970 the Federal Government really wasn't in the criminal law business the way it has become in the last 30 or 40 years. At that time there was a lot of concern, the Travel Act and other statutes, about exactly what the Federal justification for -- justification for Federal participation existed. And I -- I always had the impression that that was really what was behind the telephone aspect of this statute.",
  "Let me ask you a question about that. I thought that \"or possesses\" was separate from the \"uses or carries.\" Is possession an example of using or carrying or is it as it says -- \"or who in furtherance of such crime possesses\"? Is that a separate -- separate enhancement?",
  "Right.",
  "But merely possessing is enough to get the first enhancement of five years.",
  "Or relation to.",
  "The \"uses or carries\" doesn't -- doesn't necessarily apply to the possession.",
  "Right.",
  "But it's also uncontested it was accidental, I think.",
  "What do you say to your opponent's argument -- I don't know if it's right or not -- but that there's sort of a background rule that generally we assume when Congress prohibits conduct, it means intentional conduct; and normally if they don't mean that, they make it rather clear in the statute. Is that a correct -- is his background principle correct?",
  "What's the difference between a sentencing factor that adds five years to a sentence and an element of the crime? There are a lot of us that think that -- you've read Harris and Apprendi. You know there is some debate about whether that really makes all that much difference.",
  "Let me -- let me rephrase the question.",
  "If it were an element of the crime, would you then agree with his background rule?",
  "Then the fact that the sentencing factor is an element really isn't significant.",
  "But why would it be a harder case for you?",
  "But in that situation would there be a background rule that we normally think Congress intends to punish intentional conduct?",
  "So you really then are relying on the difference between an element of the crime and a sentencing factor?",
  "What you're saying, to make sure I understand, is that the \"in relation to\" language modifies both \"use\" and \"possession\"?",
  "May I just make sure I understand your position? \"During and in relation to\" modifies the first words it follows. \"In furtherance to\" modifies \"possession.\" Now, do either \"in relation to\" or \"in furtherance\" to it modify the three subsequent subparagraphs?",
  "So neither of them applies. So it doesn't have to be \"in furtherance of\" or \"in relation to\"?",
  "None of the sentencing factors require that that factor be in -- either in relation to the crime or in furtherance of the crime? It could be just walking down the street, you happen to have a gun?",
  "Sentencing factors need not be in relation to the crime nor in furtherance of the crime.",
  "Why does it have to be \"during\"? It -- it doesn't in the statute?",
  "There is an \"in furtherance.\" There is an \"in furtherance of the crime.\"",
  "I want to make sure I understand. You are saying it need not be \"during\" or -- you said it has to be \"during\" but not because the statute includes the word \"during.\"",
  "Well, what does -- where does the \"during\" come from then?",
  "Then you're telling me that it need not be during as long as it's in furtherance of. So the \"in furtherance of\" is also incorporated implicitly in the sentencing factors.",
  "This must be during?",
  "The strange thing about this case is we're talking about a category of crimes in which somebody person mistakenly fires the gun, that doesn't happen very often. The whole -- the whole dispute is about really a trivial set of crimes.",
  "Sure, when the defendant -- and says I didn't really mean to shoot the guy?",
  "What was the case you cited when you started your rebuttal?",
  "Is that the antitrust case? You caught me by surprise.",
  "Well, why not? It is a successive prosecution.",
  "It is in the sense of an indictment that took place after the other acquittal.",
  "Isn't there a difference in the fact that in the first case where there was a conflicting simultaneous verdict, one can explain the acquittal on grounds of leniency or compromise or something like that, that says that, therefore, we will give effect to the -- the conviction when they're simultaneous because of the reasons why there may be irrationality in the conflict. But there is no reason to doubt the -- the validity of the acquittal in this case.",
  "But if they had time. And when you have 150 counts, it's entirely possible they just didn't reach a decision on it.",
  "When you have a case in which there is no conflict between a guilty and an innocent verdict, there isn't -- there is no reason to doubt the integrity of the acquittal.",
  "But the reason for that is there are doubts about the integrity of the acquittal. They probably compromised, just to say not to be too tough on - -",
  "No, here you have sequential prosecutions, and there is no reason to question the integrity of the acquittal in this case.",
  "But the key to your argument is the government is entitled to one full and fair opportunity to try its case. It had that opportunity the first time around.",
  "If there were no separate counts, that would have been -- that would have been a fair -- that would be the end of the matter.",
  "But it has -- but it has the right to retry in the same position as it would have been if it had not brought the first proceeding. And if it had not brought the first proceeding in this case, it would have been barred.",
  "Why not?",
  "Oh.",
  "That's why we have the Dunn doctrine, which itself is questionable. It basically says there is a certain situation in which we will tolerate what may be an irrational verdict, and the reason we tolerate it is that the acquittal itself may be explained on other grounds. Namely - -",
  "But the whole -- whole doctrine of inconsistent verdicts depends on the assumption that what appears to be an irrational inconsistency may have another explanation.",
  "But one hung jury followed by a second when there has been an acquittal the first time around is not customary.",
  "So the difference is in the -- in the first trial, you're not impugning the integrity of the jury's verdict. You're following the acquittal, and that's true in the compromise cases, the Dunn case and those cases, but that's not the case here because you're talking about two different juries. You're saying the second jury should have an -- an opportunity to correct what the first jury did, even though it would not have that opportunity if the first jury had not faced the issue.",
  "It should have, but it didn't. We know that. And we just know they did not reach a conclusion on this issue, but they did reach a conclusion on the count on which they acquitted.",
  "Do you make the same presumption when there is an inconsistent verdict, but you say even if it's irrational we'll go along with it because of the one jury, and they may have had non - - unsound legal reasons for saying, well, we'll let the guy off on the one count.",
  "The jury did not take irrational action in this case. The only action - - that's relevant was the acquittal. The other they didn't act.",
  "It would be irrational if they had returned a verdict, but they said we can't agree for who knows why.",
  "It's not all that clear, because as you argue the court -- the district court was correct in analyzing the -- the estoppel issue. And it's obviously a very difficult issue because judges have disagreed about it and the government and your opponent disagree on it. So, it's entirely possible that the jury wasn't able to figure it all out.",
  "The jury could not have been as confused as the court of appeals was.",
  "And maybe those cases presented more difficult issues than this one.",
  "Mr. Olson, can I ask this question? Coming up with Wisconsin Right to Life, Judge Randolph thought the Chief Justice's opinion in that case was controlling in that case. Do you think the Chief Justice's opinion in that case correctly stated the law?",
  "I want to be sure because you're -- sometimes I don't think you're quite saying that. But you agree that that opinion is correct?",
  "But you accept the test that was stated in his opinion?",
  "But is there collateral review available in the civilian system in your view?",
  "I mean in this case.",
  "So the answer is no in this case?",
  "Will you clarify something for me. Are you contending that the result you seek is constitutionally compelled? I didn't think you were.",
  "Mr. Ostrager, may I ask this question. I -- I was unable to find the complaints in the voluminous filings here. Do any of the plaintiffs' cases seek recovery from assets of the estate that would reduce the payments to creditors of Manville?",
  "How do -- how do these pending actions have any impact on fulfilling the objections -- objectives of the channeling instruction or affect the disposition of the assets in the estate? I just don't understand it.",
  "Yes, but there has been one and it's been a success.",
  "None of whom would be affected - -",
  "Mr. Phillips, can I ask you - -",
  "Can I ask you your views on a question that I've asked myself over and over again and had trouble finding the answer. Supposing a company appointed a committee to decide whether or not to fire X. And the committee came back and said: \"Yes, you should fire him; he's too old and he's late to work every day.\" Now -- and that's all the evidence in the record. Would the -- would the judge be obliged to enter a judgment on summary judgment -- at the end of the plaintiff's case, to enter judgment for the defendant?",
  "Because all that would have been proved was there is one motivating factor there, but not necessarily a decisive one.",
  "But he has only proved that it is one of two possible motivating factors, but that is sufficient in your view to get to the jury.",
  "Mr. Phillips, let me just - -",
  "I'm not quite sure I understand one thing. If it's a motivating factor, it's enough to get by summary judgment and get the case to the jury, but the -- the defendant will still win, if I understand all this, if he -- if the defendant proves, yes, I did do and it may have had an influence on it, but he would have fired him anyway. And if he -- if he can prove under Mt. Healthy that, yes, he thought about age and that -- what raised the issue and everything else, but after he got all through, he was clear he fired him because he was a lousy salesman - -",
  "-- and he wins.",
  "So he does not lose just because you say it's a motivating factor.",
  "Well, but not only that, but the jury would be free to say, well, there were both clauses, and the one was illegal. But under the Mt. Healthy defense, if they are convinced they would have fired this guy anyway, the company gets off.",
  "I know, but inevitably in these cases the employer is really -- whether he calls it an affirmative defense or -- or just a regular resistance to the plaintiff 's case, the issue is: Did -- would he have fired him anyway? And -- and if he - - if -- if that's what the jury believes, you can take Justice Breyer's view and say that's -- that's not a sufficient defense because they acted illegally. But if you are allowed that, you are saying notwithstanding the illegal motive, if you show that the real reason I fired him was unrelated to that, then the compelling reason, you win. And you win despite the fact that the process may have violated the statute.",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, can I ask you a question, just focusing on the Tonnage Clause, not the elements of discrimination? If you assume that the Tonnage Clause was designed to protect New Jersey from being exploited by New York and perhaps other States because they don't have their own ports, why does that rationale have any application to this case, because the only State ships oil out of Alaska is Alaska? So there is no other State like New Jersey who could be harmed by the Tonnage Clause.",
  "What State is being discriminated against in the scenario we have before us today?",
  "But you are saying it's an unduly onerous burden on the oil companies and their tankers, and they only ship oil out of Alaska.",
  "Well, that's exactly the question I wanted to ask you. Supposing the city did not impose any taxes on anybody except the people who pay this tax, and that's all. Would it -- would it be constitutional or unconstitutional?",
  "It would not be constitutional?",
  "Oh, but then why is the - - what other people pay on other taxes even relevant?",
  "So we can take as a -- as a given for the purpose of analyzing the issue, that this tax is either the only tax that's relevant to our analysis or that it's so much higher than all the other taxes, it should be treated as the functional equivalent as the only tax we have to look at?",
  "But I suppose you could - -",
  "May I ask a - -",
  "May I ask you a question that I don't' think has come up, but I just wondered if anybody has argued this. The duty of tonnage, it seems to me, might refer to the cargo rather than the ship. So if the ship made ten voyages it might have ten times the tonnage of another vessel of exactly the same value. Has anybody argued that that's what the Tonnage Clause refers to?",
  "Mr. Goldstein, could I ask this question? You are reading into it the exception, of the words \"any other provision of law.\" And I can understand your argument one of two ways, and I want to be sure which. Are you saying it means any other provision of the law, except those that affect the jurisdiction of courts? Or are you saying any other provisions of law that relate to foreign assistance?",
  "Mr. Starr, how do you explain the fact the State of Arizona and the board of education are troubled by the same two points?",
  "What discipline did the tipster receive? What discipline was the erroneous tipster given?",
  "May I ask this question about: Are there a number of circuits that follow the 60-day rule?",
  "And in those cases, suppose we decide your way in this case. What happens to the -- all the appeals that have been taken relying on the 60-day rule? Because I understand the failure to file a notice of appeal is jurisdictional.",
  "All of those would be terminated?",
  "And what about judgments that have been entered based on appeals that were - -",
  "So we are really -- in several circuits, a really rather important decision is being called for?",
  "May I just ask this question? Is it undisputed that it was a race-based decision?",
  "Are you contending that that's an issue of fact that has to be tried out or that we should accept your version of that -- of that issue?",
  "May I ask you one question - -",
  "-- because I'm not sure I understood your answer to Justice Kennedy? What is your answer to Justice Kennedy's question about the two alternatives, one of which would fit exactly into the concluding clause of the first question presented to achieve racial proportionality in candidates selected? He says there are two alternatives before the school board, one would achieve the proportionality, the other would not. Are they free to choose the former?",
  "They could take that test, even though its sole purpose was to achieve racial proportionality in candidates selected?",
  "This is the -- putting to one side liability in the lawsuit, is the interest in avoiding disparate impact a valid State interest?",
  "I didn't say compelling. I said is it a valid State interest. Just the interest in avoiding the kind of results you got here.",
  "The City is not merely trying to avoid liability, they are trying to avoid a disparate impact. Is that a valid interest?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you this? You -- you've recommended that we set aside the summary judgment and send the case back for a hearing.",
  "What is the issue of fact that you think needs to be decided?",
  "Mr. Meade, let me -- let me go back to one earlier question. Suppose everybody agrees that you're right on the -- on the record here now, and the City goes ahead and does another test, with all the advantages and studies they've made and so forth and so on, and it turns out you just had an unfortunate selection of candidates, and they come out exactly the same way. Would you agree that at that time the City would have to certify the results?",
  "It's a test they made after talking to everybody who testified in this case and filed amicus briefs and everything else - -",
  "And they came out, and it turned out exactly the same results.",
  "Absolutely what?",
  "They would have to certify it.",
  "Mr. Moseley, can I get your help on a question I really have difficulty with. It seems to me as I read the text, it is easy to read it in one of two ways: It involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim in fact exceeded $10,000. In that case you would lose. Or it could be read to say involves fraud or deceit in which an element of the crime is that the victim or victims exceeded a loss of $10,000. You would lose under that also because it is not an element of the crime. So you are relying on a modified approach, and under your modified approach what does the statute say?",
  "But the statute doesn't say anything about conviction.",
  "But your position -- I want to be sure I understand it -- is that if the record in this case had been -- let's say it's a mail fraud case, they proved one mailing and one victim lost $30, and that's all the trial established, but as a matter of fact you could establish this was part of a scheme, just like the one we've got here, in which millions of dollars were lost, you could prove that independently and he would still be required to be deported?",
  "But the scheme -- the evidence of the scheme consisted of just two mailings, say. They allege a scheme and say it's a broad -- a broad scheme, but they don't describe the amount. They merely prove two mailings that involved $25 apiece. But the scheme itself, because you proved it in other cases, you have the facts, actually was a big scheme like we have here. Could they rely on that for -- for immigration purposes in a proceeding like this?",
  "You can determine exactly what you proved in this case.",
  "Yes, it was.",
  "But it didn't describe the dimensions of the scheme. As far as the record shows, it only affected -- it was one scheme that was as large as this one, but the evidence to prove the scheme only required you to prove two or three mailings involving small amounts of money. But then later on you proved before the immigration judge there really was a big scheme, and that's the one he was convicted of. Isn't that enough?",
  "You had the evidence, but you didn't need it.",
  "I know it's easy; I'm wondering if it's necessary. I -- I think under your theory, it would not be necessary. As long as the evidence is out there, you can use it in a de novo proceeding before the immigration judge.",
  "No, my -- he pleads guilty to the mammoth scheme proved, the evidence before the court or on the plea colloquy, whatever is described is enough to show that he was guilty.",
  "But then as I understand it, you can prove the size of the scheme later on.",
  "But the -- but the Chief Justice points out that the facts that make the fraud aggravated are facts that you do not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, which takes back to your opponent's argument. Therefore, you were not convicted by proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the aggravated felony that's the basis for the immigration order.",
  "So you were not convicted of the aggravated offense that -- the issue in this case.",
  "But the -- but you hadn't been convicted of the aggravated offense until you established its aggravation by proof of less -- not under a reasonable doubt. So the word \"convicted\" really is pretty important.",
  "No, but the word \"convicted\" -- the question is whether the word \"convicted\" applies to the word \"aggravated.\" That's the point, as I understand the Chief Justice's questioning, which goes to the burden of proof. So you would win even under that approach if you said you had a proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the other factors. But the thing that creates the -- the missing link is that to convert it from ordinary fraud to aggravated fraud, you have to prove X under one view by a reasonable -- beyond a reasonable doubt, but, under your view, by only clear and convincing evidence.",
  "May I interrupt right there, Mr. Mizer? Is it fair to interpret the jury's decision to impose the death penalty as having found that he was not mentally retarded and therefore was not a mitigating factor, or that even though he was -- a mitigating factor, the aggravating factors outweighed that factor?",
  "Wasn't there some testimony that one test was only 50?",
  "Mr. Mizer, can I just get one clarifying question? The concession at page 160 of the record, \"The record reveals the defendant to be mildly retarded with an IQ of about 69,\" and then they argue as a matter of law that he cannot be -- he may be punished. Is it your position that the further proceeding in the Ohio trial court, that the State intends to argue that a person who is mentally retarded with an IQ of about 69 may be executed?",
  "So you'll offer evidence to show that statement is inaccurate?",
  "I understand that. The - - could well be different. But is it Ohio's intent to disagree with that statement insofar as it recites facts? That the record reveals the defendant to be mildly mentally retarded with an IQ of about 69? I understand you will argue that that's not sufficient to -- to come within Atkins. But do you intend to say - - to challenge the accuracy of that factual statement?",
  "I still don't understand your answer to Justice Scalia. What if the school board just was adamant that he is not entitled to any special education? It just maintained that position throughout the litigation?",
  "Well, they got a stay and they wanted to appeal it. And if they did what happens?",
  "But they don't have a risk under your view of the law as I understand it. They could take that position and they would never be liable -- never be liable.",
  "But that's the consequence of your position as I understand it, that they could do that and they would not have any risk of liability.",
  "Doesn't your interpretation of the statute create an incentive for the school board to just say, we'll never provide any kind of education, special education, we will just tough it out? Because they can't lose, they can't be liable if they do that, if I understand you correctly.",
  "One thing - -",
  "One thing puzzled me about this. They are not pre-empting any New York laws; is that correct?",
  "Did we ever -- do we have any precedents dealing with the question whether preemption of the right to enforce a valid law is appropriate?",
  "Yes, but if you have a situation in which the OCC, say, has very limited personnel -- they only have ten people in their enforcement division, for example -- and Congress thought they have to get more, wouldn't it be appropriate in that background to say, you shall start enforcing? And that wouldn't necessarily mean you are excluding States from also enforcing.",
  "May I ask you this question? Naturally, if it's State laws, clearly they can look at, but what if New York was trying to enforce its discrimination laws in an employment context or in context where they said you are charging minority depositors -- giving them lower rates of interest than you give Caucasian depositors? Would they have -- would the discrimination and the rates of interests paid on deposits -- assume that was the question. Would you make the same argument, if that was what New York had alleged?",
  "All you would have to just look at the records. You can tell from the records whether people of different classes are paying different -- are getting different rates on their deposits.",
  "It would be unlikely to persist. Maybe it's an unlikely example. But you are suggesting that that would also interfere with the Comptroller's ability to regulate the banks?",
  "Mr. Waxman, assume - - assume for a minute, this -- what if before writing the letter, the Attorney General of New York said, \"We have conducted 500 interviews with people who have borrowed money from you, and on the basis of all these interviews we have drawn these tentative conclusions that there is discrimination. We would like to give you an opportunity to explain all of this by showing us your records.\" And they say no, we won't do it. Would they then be pre-empted from bringing their lawsuit?",
  "Even though they didn't have to look at any bank record to make their prima facie case?",
  "I am asking about a hypothetical. I understand your argument here. But I just don't understand how your argument would apply to my hypothetical. But I think the regulation would apply to the hypothetical.",
  "He doesn't even want to look at your books; he just wants to prove it by people who have been borrowing money and compare them with - - among them they can orally.",
  "I don't understand why that would be visitorial power.",
  "Let me ask this question just as sort of background. Does your case challenge at all the standards that Congress has used throughout the statute for causing States to become covered jurisdictions?",
  "Correct. Have you ever challenged those as a basis for making a State or county or election district covered?",
  "Well, you have a history that some States are covered and some are not because of certain requirements that the statute imposed. And I didn't understand the case to involve a challenge to the method by which States became -- become covered.",
  "Then why is it relevant there are a lot of States out there that are not covered?",
  "Are you arguing the statute is unconstitutional because Congress failed to extend it to other -- other parts of the country?",
  "Before you do, Mr. Olson --",
  "Mr. Olson -- Mr. Olson, would you answer Justice Ginsburg's question yes or no? Can the -- leaving aside foreign investors, can the - - can -- does the First Amendment permit any distinction between corporate speakers and individual speakers?",
  "I am not asking you that. I meant in your view does it permit that distinction?",
  "But if there is a compelling government -- can there be any case in which there is a different treatment of corporations and individuals in your judgment?",
  "It more than said we are not deciding. It said they are entirely different situations. You read that long footnote which has been cited six or eight times by our later cases.",
  "But it has been repeated -- that footnote has been repeatedly cited in subsequent cases, most of which were unanimous.",
  "It did discuss it precisely in that footnote and it said it's a different case.",
  "I don't think you are correct to say the Court said there was no distinction. It said the distinction requires the use of magic words. And that's what they said in Wisconsin Right to Life, too. Both of them said there is a distinction.",
  "It's difficult to draw in some cases, but nobody said there is no distinction that I am aware of.",
  "Yes, but that point wasn't even discussed in the opinion, was it?",
  "No.",
  "Mr. Olson - -",
  "-- may I ask one question you can answer on rebuttal? No one has commented on the National Rifle Association's amicus brief. None of the -- none of the litigants have. That's in response to Justice Sotomayor's thought that there are narrow ways of resolving the problem before us. On rebuttal, will you tell us what your view on their solution to this problem is?",
  "No, but to answer my question, the line suggested by the NRA is the line identified by Congress in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment dealing with individual financing of speech which would separate all of these problems. What is your comment on that possible solution to the problem?",
  "Much later than 1947.",
  "But those were union cases, weren't they, rather than corporate cases?",
  "But have you read Justice Rehnquist's dissent in the Bellotti case?",
  "Have you read Justice Rehnquist's dissent in the Bellotti case?",
  "Which is somewhat inconsistent with what you said.",
  "Before you go to your second point, may I ask you to clarify one part of the first, namely, your answer to the question I proposed to Mr. Olson, namely, why isn't the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, which was picked on by Congress itself, an - - and which is argued by the NRA, an appropriate answer to this case?",
  "Oh, I'm sorry.",
  "I don't think you -- I don't think you really caught what I suggested because you treated it as an enlargement of the MCFL example.",
  "But that is not what the National Rifle Association argues or what Snowe-Jeffords covers. It covers ads that are financed exclusively by individuals even though they are sponsored by a corporation.",
  "Correct and treating the Snowe-Jeffords amendment as being the correct test. And nobody has explained why that wouldn't be a proper solution, not nearly as drastic as -- as being argued here.",
  "But - -",
  "Congress also said if you strike down the Wellstone amendment, we want the Snowe- Jeffords amendment.",
  "And why shouldn't we follow that direction?",
  "Right.",
  "Correct.",
  "Then why is that not the -- the wisest narrow solution of the problem before us?",
  "One of the amicus briefs objects to -- responds to Justice Kennedy's problem by saying that the problem is we have got to contribute to both parties, and a lot of them do, don't they?",
  "Ultra Vires would take care of about 90 percent of the small corporations that Justice Scalia is talking about. They can't just - - they can't even give money to charities sometimes because of Ultra Vires. Giving political contributions is not typical for corporate activity.",
  "If the FEC chooses to prosecute only those who do not -- who do not rely exclusively on individual contributions.",
  "Yes. I want to see he gets it.",
  "But it would solve it for the advertising, and there are two things. There is the long Hillary document and the advertisements. It would cover those.",
  "And they are the only - - only ones that clearly violate the statute.",
  "Does that mean you disagree with the NRA's submission?",
  "If it solved the problem as it would for the advertising, would it be an appropriate solution?",
  "But it is a nightmare that Congress endorsed in the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment.",
  "We have held the Wellstone Amendment literally cannot be applied.",
  "We unanimously held that.",
  "You do not endorse the NRA's position?",
  "May I ask two yes or no questions? One, did you, in fact, ask for a 1292(b) right to appeal, make an interlocutory appeal?",
  "And the second question is, would your rule apply if the decision had gone the other way? If they had denied access to the documents, would the other -- would the person seeking discovery have the same right to appeal that you asked for here?",
  "Why not?",
  "Is the attorney-client claim sometimes raised, along with a host of other discovery issues, as a bargaining chip?",
  "It certainly doesn't go ahead with the trial, does it?",
  "It never would, would it?",
  "Well, just go ahead with trial while a material issue is still pending, I can't imagine that.",
  "I can't imagine a judge going to trial in a case when an important issue like this is pending on appeal. Has that ever happened?",
  "Do we know exactly what the Miranda warning in this case was?",
  "But what did it tell the person in prison he could do about a lawyer?",
  "Did it tell him how he could get a lawyer?",
  "If you're in prison and they give you the Miranda warnings, what would that tell the average prisoner with respect to access to a lawyer?",
  "And would they have provided a lawyer to him right away if they had -- he had asked for it?",
  "When he is in prison, I mean.",
  "Well, I understand that.",
  "I'm just wondering if he thinks, well, I'd like a lawyer, what can he do?",
  "Right on the spot, when he is in the room there and they give him the Miranda warnings and he says, that sounds like a good idea, what would happen?",
  "So the Miranda warning is a little misleading, isn't it, in that context?",
  "Do they also say it will be provided to you?",
  "And it's not going to be provided to him.",
  "True, we have to reach out and find some arbitrary number, but after all, Edwards is an arbitrary rule.",
  "Well, I wonder if you're right about that premise. Supposing the prison had a rule that the inmate does not have to see visitors and they say that: Somebody here wants to talk to you. And he says: I don't want to talk to him. And if he refused to talk, then if he did talk, it would be voluntary, rather than the situation you described. Do I make myself clear?",
  "But carrying -- carrying that analysis one step further, if you are just talking about people who were inmates pursuant to prior conviction, why wouldn't the better rule be that if the inmate is given the opportunity to say no, I don't want a visitor today, and then if he accepts the visitor, you would say he is no longer in custody? But if he says, I don't want to, then he -- then he is in custody and you preserves the presumption.",
  "Well, that -- such a rule would accomplish the benefit when he really wants - - willing to talk, he would say: I would be glad to talk to the officer.",
  "If he doesn't want to, he should just say no.",
  "But it is a little different when the man first comes, says, will you talk to officer. He can very clearly say no. But if he is in the room with two or three people around in a different setting, then he is still in custody.",
  "That's not true, because my hypothetical, if you told him you don't have to talk to the officer, and you could produce something, they could question every -- everybody in jail all over the country.",
  "They can't force him to attend the questioning. But if they give him an opportunity to say, I -- I'm a prisoner, I just want to stay in the prison population and not go to an interrogation room. And if he is willing to go, you could question him. You do not have the example of no possibility.",
  "May I ask you about a different approach? We are dealing in this case with somebody who was constantly in custody but for a different reason than the during the pretrial situation. He is in the general prison population. What -- what would be wrong with the rule that said that a person in that situation should be advised that somebody wants to question him, and he has a right to say I do or do not want to talk to the visitor? And if he is willing to talk to the visitor, then you have to give him new Miranda warnings and you start from scratch. But have the -- have the focus on whether he is in custody at the time of the questioning, and say that an inability to refuse to go to the interrogation room would be not treated as custody. It would be treated as in the general prison population. What would be wrong with such a rule?",
  "But the record doesn't tell us whether he was given an opportunity to say \"I don't want any visitors today.\"",
  "No, it's a question who has the burden of showing he's in custody or is he free to live leave. If he has the burden, he didn't carry the burden in this case.",
  "Correct.",
  "But you can still live in a maximum security prison and say I don't want any visitors.",
  "As far as the records show.",
  "Would that require us to overrule Roberson?",
  "Well, you agreed that, if he is questioned and he is not in custody when he is being questioned. If he stopped on the street or in his living room, they can question him there. That's the - -",
  "Yes, but -- but wouldn't it make sense to treat the -- the change from a pretrial detention to a general prison population as, by itself, a no longer custody, provided he is told that he doesn't have to talk to people who want to pay him a visit. He could say -- they could have a rule, say that the prisoner does not have to talk to everybody who comes -- comes around, and then you could treat that as the functional equivalent of not being in custody. Wouldn't that be a sensible rule?",
  "They can, but, if you say, as a condition to -- to questioning, he just has to know that he doesn't have to see visitors he doesn't want to see, which doesn't seem, to me, a very hard rule to administer.",
  "Well - -",
  "They have the prisoner there, and he shows up, and then -- that's the end of it.",
  "But only as a felony.",
  "May I ask -- may I ask this, following up on Justice Scalia's point? Are there any other crimes other than battery that -- that create the same situation where in the first time it is committed it's a misdemeanor, but then it becomes a felony because it's committed twice? So what we have here is conduct that first time is misdemeanor, second time is a felony. Are there any other examples of crimes that fit that category that come within Subparagraph 1?",
  "The district court thought that the two were related. The district court, if it thought a slightest touching was qualified under (1) it was not unreasonable to say that it would also qualify under (2). But if that argue ment is rejected under (1), it seems to me it would follow necessarily that it would also be rejected under (2).",
  "Mr. Roberts - -",
  "May I ask you, Mr. Roberts, to comment on your opponent's argument that you are creating a rule that if a particular district has a standing order that motions be filed after seven days and then another district has a standing order that it be 21 days, the effect of your rule would be to make the seven-day district an 86-day -- give them 86 days under the Speedy Trial Act?",
  "That's for response time.",
  "And that's automatically excluded, so that won't affect the -- well, like you said, it's - -",
  "Yes.",
  "But if the difference is specifically authorized by Congress?",
  "But doesn't it seem fairly clear that the district which has a 21-day rule, they won't have to -- normally, they won't need extra time in the routine case for an extra motion, whereas the districts with a seven-day rule would pretty automatically need another 10 days or so.",
  "Would you repeat that just so I have you: It comes under (h)(1) -- what sub?",
  "Did - -",
  "But what -- what subsection does all this? I really -- I got lost in - -",
  "Because you agree, as I understand it, it is not covered by (D).",
  "And what subsection does cover it?",
  "But it's not governed by any lettered subsection?",
  "But there is no period - -",
  "-- no subsection talks about another proceeding? That's just your gloss on the statute; is that right?",
  "I see.",
  "But just one quick question. It seems to me that everything described in (7)(A) would fit your description of proceedings.",
  "That's a tough argument.",
  "What about hunting with a bow -- What about hunting with a bow and arrow out of season?",
  "No, but hunting with a bow and arrow, and some depictions of hunting are pretty - - are pretty gruesome.",
  "May I ask you a question about your view of the breadth of the statute. I didn't yet really get an answer out of your opponent. Do you think the statute would prohibited depictions of hunting if it involved killing in the District of Columbia, because hunting as I understand it is not allowed in the District of Columbia, it's prohibited. Does that mean that any depictions of hunting that show the killing and cruelty are prohibited by this statute?",
  "Wait, I want to just be sure I understand you. Even if the hunting depiction is very offensive and cruel and all the rest, and that the cruelty to the animal using bow and arrows or knives or something, you say it's not -- and even if it's illegal in this particular jurisdiction, you say the statute still does not apply at all?",
  "But the hunting would never qualify, because the hunter's motive is benign; is that what you are saying?",
  "Can I ask a sort of basic question I never understood about this case. As I understand it, the end-of-the-line concern of the fairness of the settlement, and particularly to people who have copyrights who have never been registered. Am I right, that that's what - -",
  "But those were people who owned some registered copyrights, but had other works that were not -- had no registered copyrights. Is that right?",
  "Were there any of those people who had no -- no copyrights at all?",
  "But they had some registered works?",
  "You see, one of the -- one of the risks involved here is whether people who had no registered works are being adequately protected by this Class C settlement.",
  "And just to get the question on the table -- I don't want to take up much of your time. I don't understand how it makes any difference whether you say the rule is mandatory or the rule is jurisdictional, in terms of the fairness of the settlement, at the end of the line.",
  "May I ask -- I just hate to reveal my ignorance on something like this, but I had the same problem with your opponent. I really don't understand why it makes any difference whether you call a requirement mandatory or you call it jurisdictional in terms of the fairness of settlement, all the considerations you are discussing. It seems to me as a practical matter it doesn't seem to make any difference.",
  "But would you not make all the arguments directed at the fairness of the settlements and so forth if it were merely mandatory?",
  "But what percentage of the total area do they represent?",
  "What percentage of the total area do they represent?",
  "But do you concede there was a violation at the time the case was decided?",
  "Do you concede that the Establishment Clause was violated at the time this case was decided?",
  "But isn't it also a very different case if a condition of the transfer is that the transferee will preserve a memorial that has been designated in the statute as a five-foot-tall white cross.",
  "So it is a condition of the transfer.",
  "But there is also the point that I don't think you stressed, that if the reversionary interest was activated -- say they abandoned or destroyed it, the property would come back to the government. And if I read the -- the designation of the national memorial statute correctly, the Department of Interior would have to rebuild the old cross and put it up. There's an affirmative duty to replace the cross if there is a reversion.",
  "May I ask this question: Do you think the issues in this case would be -- stay the same or different, if this whole scenario occurred on the Mall in -- right out in front of the Washington -- the Lincoln Memorial? Would the -- the issues be any different if it were not an isolated memorial in the desert?",
  "And which way would it cut, if it is different?",
  "May I ask a different question, just based on your understanding of all these monuments? Are there any other federal monuments that contained crosses, other than those associated with the cemeteries?",
  "How can you say that when there's a reversionary interest? How can you say it's completely dissociated? There is a reversionary interest if they don't maintain the cross, which is the monument, it goes back to the government.",
  "Yes, but the particular memorial described by Congress was this cross.",
  "Yes, but then it doesn't -- I don't think it's fair to interpret Congress's interest to being and preserving this memorial.",
  "Right.",
  "Do you think anyone thought there is the remotest possibility they would put up a different memorial?",
  "How can they say it's an inappropriate war memorial when Congress has designated the national memorial as, quote, \"the five-foot-tall white cross\" and so forth and so on? That is what is the memorial.",
  "Do you really think there is any possibility that would happen?",
  "That is not my question.",
  "They not only started it out, but they authorized the use of $10,000 in money in order to replace the very cross they had designated as a memorial.",
  "May I ask, just to be - - do you -- do you contest the question of whether there was conferencing?",
  "You conceded that there was conferencing?",
  "I'm not sure that answers my question.",
  "Are there any -- is there any rule describing how one has to get this into the record? It's just-- how -- what would have been the proper way to prove that conferencing occurred?",
  "But that doesn't refer to conferencing, does it?",
  "Implicitly includes con - - not expressly includes conferencing.",
  "I see.",
  "May I ask this question. I may have an incorrect impression about it. Is the - - the thing that's at issue is whether or not conferencing occurred. Is it also important to know what happened at the conferencing? You may not know this. Is the -- is there some sort of -- of factual description of the negotiations that took place during conferencing an important part of the submission?",
  "So the only -- the only importance is to just to establish the fact that there was a conference?",
  "Let me ask you this question, if I may: Your opponent says there is sort of a common-law adjudication method of developing new rules. And that there is precedent out there for dismissing these arbitrations because the conferencing was not established in the record at the time the proceeding started. Is this a reference to the -- to precedent, correct?",
  "Well, I understand that, but were there presidents that might well have put you on notice that you better get this in the record?",
  "Well, that's really not my -- but you do concede, do you, that there are half a dozen cases out there which were dismissed because there was the failure of the record to show that there was conferencing below?",
  "So your -- your objection is -- is two-fold. One, that you think the requirement that the record show it affirmatively is not supported. And secondly, there -- you should have had an independent right to -- to make an offer of proof that would have cured the defect.",
  "Let me ask you some questions about the common law that we are talking about here.",
  "Are there also cases out there in which the record doesn't tell us whether there was conferencing, but nevertheless, the merits were decided?",
  "There are least six -- six or are there more than that?",
  "Were any of those decisions that were boardwise or did they apply to one panel?",
  "May I ask this question: What do you think -- if there is deficient advice by counsel under Strickland, what do you think you have to prove in order to get relief under Strickland?",
  "No, assume that advice is inadequate -- to prove prejudice.",
  "Right.",
  "May I ask this question: Supposing this wasn't a drug crime -- a sexual abuse of a minor, which would lead to all sorts of restrictions on where the defendant could live and report to as a resident, and the like, would there be –- would that be a collateral consequence or a direct consequence, in the advice on that?",
  "Even though the consequence is a -- is something required by the law of the jurisdiction imposing the criminal penalty, it would still be collateral?",
  "General Cordray, may I -­ may I -- you are basically arguing that he was not -­ not deficient in performance.",
  "Assume I am persuaded that there was deficient performance, for all the reasons your adversary argues, and I am focusing on the prejudice issue. I think you make a very strong argument that this guy would have gotten the death penalty anyway. But what if -- what if the deficiency had been even worse? Supposing the defense counsel had got up and said: I wish I could make an argument, but I really think you ought to give him the death penalty -­ just outrageously sided with the prosecutor. Would that mean that we could still find no prejudice?",
  "No, I -- I understand that. But -- so you really are saying the question is whether Cronic or Strickland controls?",
  "Yes.",
  "But does your argument really depend on any deference to the State Supreme Court? It seems to me that your argument is just sort of as a fresh matter there wasn't prejudice here. And -- and isn't it also true that we really don't know what the Ohio Supreme Court's basis for its decision was, whether not competent, incompetence, or lack of prejudice.",
  "But we don't know which prong of Strickland it relied on, do we?",
  "So you'd say a State supreme court is entitled to more deference if it doesn't tell us the basis for its decision?",
  "Yes.",
  "That's the rule on direct appeal, of course, not on collateral.",
  "Can we just go back to that one point for a minute.",
  "Would your deference be exactly the same if, instead of listing all 47 claims or so, they simply entered a one-line order saying, \"Affirmed\"?",
  "Let me -- let me go back to the question.",
  "Do you think they are entitled to more deference because they did cite Strickland if they -- than if they did cite nothing?",
  "So it would be exactly the same deference whether they say it's Strickland or not.",
  "Mr. Miller, if I -- if I understood your argument, you are saying that Duke's interests are really with South Carolina, or -- to increase the flow. But I would think then it would be North Carolina who would be objecting to their participation in the case rather than South Carolina. And they don't. They -- they welcomed them in, as I remember the papers.",
  "May I ask this question: In what respect does the relief sought against the city differ from the relief sought against the State?",
  "But that was before the statute was enacted.",
  "But isn't the basic argument that you make that a forfeiture hearing is all the process that is due?",
  "Now, let me ask you this question: Suppose your statute said there shall be a forfeiture hearing with all the procedures you want, but the forfeiture hearing shall take place 1 year after the seizure. Would that be adequate?",
  "Yes, I'm saying the minimum. The hearing will take place 1 year after the seizure, nothing earlier or nothing later. Would that be constitutional?",
  "Clearly, it's possible to do it in less than a year.",
  "Well, there is no practice, no background practice. This is a new statute. So this -- you have to have a forfeiture hearing, as you describe it, that shall take place 6 months --",
  "-- or a year later. Would that be constitutional?",
  "Well, I understand what the Court has held. I'm asking your view of that hypothetical statute.",
  "And if you agree that it's unconstitutional, then you have to agree that time is –- is relevant to the question whether the forfeiture hearing --",
  "So you would then say it would be constitutional to say one hearing 1 year later?",
  "May I just get you to answer what I thought you were going to do at the beginning of the argument. How do you answer my hypothetical? You have a forfeiture hearing, but you have a provision that it shall not take place for 6 months.",
  "I understand it's different. I’m just curious to know what your answer is.",
  "Wouldn't it be unconstitutional on its face?",
  "Would that justify a statute that says in all cases it shall be held for at least 18 months without telling the owner?",
  "Of course, all of these problems really arise out of the fact that the effect of the court of appeals’ decision basically was to overrule the motion to dismiss, left everything open on remand. So if we said it is moot, you'll just get another plaintiff and bring another lawsuit, which is what you do if the Court -- we are trying to get into the case much earlier than we should, it seems to me. Just let the proceedings go ahead on remand and find out what all the -- all these factual answers that -- or these questions that should be answered.",
  "The mootness -- the mootness decision won't really decide anything. You'll just say you’ve got to file another lawsuit and start over again.",
  "But if you just say, we –- probably, in my judgment, we ought to dismiss this writ as improvidently granted and let the record be developed and the case go by, and we could decide the issues.",
  "Well, what good would a Munsingwear order do, anyway? They'll just file another lawsuit, won't they?",
  "Yes.",
  "And then if the district judge said -- having read this opinion, which was vacated, says, well, I guess it states a cause of action, I will deny the motion to dismiss -- we would be exactly where we are now.",
  "But does that -- does that mean that the fee would be the same under the lodestar whether the lawyer won or lost?",
  "But if for some reason, if -- if you did had some reason to calculate it, theoretically it would be the same fee as if he had lost?",
  "And so the quality of performance really is totally irrelevant.",
  "Right.",
  "Even if the judge found as a fact that this lawyer spent 50 hours doing what any good lawyer could do in 5 hours?",
  "I don't -- I don't see how that is set forth in the lodestar rate.",
  "May I ask this one final question: We have a question of law before us, whether there’s an absolute ceiling here. Am I justified in assuming that if we could reach the question of whether it was a reasonable enhancement, there’s no argument about that?",
  "We are assuming for purposes of decision that the enhancement was reasonable, if that was -- if it's ever available, because you are not challenging the amount. In other words, you are making an argument of law. Even if they give them a $10 enhancement, it would be exactly the same issue before us.",
  "That is not the question presented in the cert petition.",
  "If I understand it, the question of law presented is that even if the enhancement had only been $1,000 --",
  "-- you would say that was equally wrong.",
  "Right.",
  "Can I ask you one brief hypothetical?",
  "Supposing this statute, instead of being as broad as it is, said any statute imposing penalties against insurance companies may not be brought as a class action, any claims brought under that statute?",
  "I thought you said that if it puts a ceiling on it, that would be -- that would be substantive rather than procedural.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, you can make it a claim brought under the insurance code, instead of against insurance companies.",
  "Yes, well, let me be -- I just say I want -- I want to be sure I understood your answer to Justice Sotomayor. Is it your position that, if we follow your view in this case, it would also be true that -- if New York had passed a statute saying no cause of action based on New York law may be maintained as a class action?",
  "And that would -- that would apply not only to statutory causes of action but causes of action based on New York common law.",
  "Let me just be sure I am not lost on one point. Does this just apply to statutory cause of action created by New York law? Or does it apply to a statutory cause of action created by New Mexico law?",
  "The language doesn't limit it that way, does it?",
  "Well, let me ask you this question: Supposing it did apply to statutory cause of actions created by New Mexico law?",
  "But it seems to me that your position basically is that New York can decide what kinds of cases shall be brought as class actions, period.",
  "Well, whatever the reason --",
  "-- for some good reason.",
  "May I ask you a question going back to Justice Kennedy's early question? Do you think the fiduciary status of the defendant in this case is different from the fiduciary status of a president of a corporation?",
  "May I ask one question before your time is gone? Has there ever been a precedent in Pennsylvania where they have applied the procedural default rule against a capital defendant who -- who was guilty of flight?",
  "But wasn't there -- wasn't there a general rule that capital defendants always get one shot at their constitutional issues?",
  "But were there Pennsylvania cases in which they had prevented a capital defendant from raising a Federal constitutional issue for the first time?",
  "How about other rules? In capital cases, had they applied other procedural default rules at -- for the first time a capital defendant sought to raise a constitutional issue?",
  "So then how can you have a firmly established rule?",
  "May I ask - -",
  "May I ask this question? We have all been somewhat trouble because some ambiguity in the opinion below. What if we -- I think your opponent answered this question. What if we were to say that the answer to the question presented, in italics in your brief is no? And send it back to the court of appeals and tell them whether they -- that would change their decision or not. Would you agree that were a proper disposition.",
  "The guidance you have asked us to give is whether there is this automatic rule. And if you say there isn't, doesn't that give guidance? And the answer -- wouldn't that -- that answer the question on which there is a conflict among the circuits?",
  "Could you give me an example of a -- of a challenge to a rate that's set under this whole program that would succeed under the just and reasonable standard and fail under the public interest standard, or vice versa?",
  "Yes.",
  "I'm not sure that answers my question. Could there be -- could there be a rate that would violate one standard and not the other?",
  "May I --",
  "But it is your view, is it not, that the rates that result from the auction are not contract rates within the meaning of Mobile-Sierra?",
  "The Hawaii case didn't involve a claim to taxes.",
  "Right, and parens patriae for the community at large.",
  "But none of them involved a claim to taxes.",
  "Well, maybe that isn't completely true. Maybe it's a matter of convenience, at least theoretically. You buy stuff over the Internet, you buy these advertised cigarettes, the price seems all right, and you don't -- whether you pay the tax or not is your decision.",
  "Well, we were - -",
  "But what if the seller didn't make those misstatements but just says -- the whole operation is set up exactly as this one is, but they don't have that statement in there; they just say: Get advice from your lawyer about whether you need to pay taxes or not. And what if that was the -- that was exactly the -- and then they all got the advice, and the lawyer says: They'll never catch you if you don't pay it.",
  "Would you clear up one thing for me I really don't quite understand. You do agree that if the police officers did this there would be liability?",
  "Are you assuming that to be correct or are you disputing that?",
  "But if that's true, why doesn't the trial immunize the police officers because they didn't cause the trial? Well, they were in the background in the same sense that these prosecutors are. But why would the police officers be liable?",
  "Not to get immunity, but why is he liable? Why is he liable? Because the injury was caused by the trial, if I understand your theory.",
  "But it was not a malicious prosecution. The prosecution -- the prosecutors acted in good faith all the way through, so there is no malicious prosecution. So what is the basis for liability against the police officers?",
  "Why doesn't the theory apply to the facts of this case also?",
  "This investigation by the prosecutor could not have caused injury but for the immunized act of going forward with the trial.",
  "What's the difference?",
  "I don't understand why at the time of introducing the evidence, the policy concerns that you've described arise, because we were criticizing what he did before he introduced the evidence.",
  "Right, and he would know whether or not it was fabricated.",
  "But haven't we said that during the investigating stage their conduct is subject to different rules than during the trial?",
  "I just don't see the -- I don't to see if I can understand the reason why the time in which the violation is completed, namely after the trial, goes to the question of whether there is liability for pretrial conduct.",
  "It was completed at the trial, but it began when the -- the phony investigation started.",
  "That's the reason the rule seems perverse.",
  "That's the very reason the rule they're arguing for seems perverse.",
  "Yes, but what about the pretrial detention? Isn't that a deprivation of liberty?",
  "Why would it be Fourth Amendment? Why isn't it Fourteenth Amendment right on the nose? They're deprived of liberty without due process of law.",
  "But that case talked about the institution of prosecution, not the deprivation of liberty during pretrial detention, which is a different matter.",
  "Could you clarify one - - could you clarify one thing for me? I understand that you can understand the record as indicating that they made a reasonable strategic decision not to let that report come in or make these arguments at the guilt stage, but the separate question is whether, did they also decide, make the same decision with respect to the penalty phase? And if they did, were they assuming that the Kirkland report would become a part of the record at the penalty stage as it would have at the guilt stage if it came in?",
  "Right.",
  "Could I ask a question? Maybe you need a little extra time. I want to be sure I understand one thing. What is your view of what the unreasonable determination of facts was in this case, either the decision not to go forward with further investigation or that the results of the investigation would not have been -- would have been -- would have been prejudicial?",
  "Let me just interrupt because I am trying to follow this here. The four facts you have described would -- would support a conclusion that it was not unreasonable to make a strategic decision not to use the report at the guilt phase trial. But what if one believes that it would have been unreasonable not to pursue the investigation and - - and -- and to find out more facts for the penalty phase trial, and the -- the -- the State court said, no, those facts have answered the case. Would the unreasonable use of the reasonable facts violate the statute?",
  "That's exactly right.",
  "Would that violate (d)(1) if even -- even if every one of the subsidiary facts was correctly filed and the conclusion drawn by the court was also correct, that it was a reasonable strategic decision at the guilt phase but unreasonable at the penalty phase? How did -- what is the answer there?",
  "It also has to involve what the strategic decision was?",
  "Mr. Gowdy, can I ask this question?",
  "If your client in this case had been processed in the juvenile system instead of the adult system, what would the maximum penalty he could have received been?",
  "So the choice is between that short a term and an indefinite term?",
  "May I ask this: Is there a minimum age when a juvenile can be transferred to -- to adult procedures?",
  "Well, I'm just interested in one. Is there a minimum?",
  "Is that an arbitrary line, or how do you -- how do we know it shouldn't be higher or lower than the line?",
  "Yes, but could I interrupt with one question? Isn't it correct that the age is relevant on whether or not to transfer the person to the adult system, but once he's in the adult system, age is entirely immaterial?",
  "I still don't understand. Just to make sure I get the point correct: After the decision has been made to have them prosecuted in the adult system, at that -- after that decision has been made, is the age of the defendant a relevant factor in sentencing?",
  "I understand, but statutorily? As a matter --",
  "The answer is no. It's -- under the statutes, it's totally irrelevant after he has been transferred to the adult stage. Is that correct?",
  "But the statute doesn't draw any distinctions once he is in -- in the adult --",
  "May I ask this question? There are an awful lot of amicus briefs in this case, and I haven't been able to read them all by any means. Do any of the briefs or any of the materials with which you are familiar discuss the rate of -- the difference between the danger of recidivism of a young offender and one who is, say, 40 or 50 years old?",
  "But it seems to me sort of -- as a matter of intuition, Justice Kennedy made the same sort of point. It seems to me that the older people are less likely to be recidivists than the younger ones, but is -- is there any empirical evidence that says that’s an incorrect or correct judgment?",
  "May I ask this question? What do you think the strongest case from our jurisprudence is that supports your position?",
  "Which one?",
  "Diehr?",
  "That's, of course, nothing like this patent.",
  "There's language in the opinion.",
  "Yes.",
  "But is it correct that there's none -- none of our cases has ever approved a rule such as you advocate?",
  "May I ask this general question, too? I have always admired Judge Rich, who was very active in drafting the '52 amendment.",
  "Has he written anything on this particular issue?",
  "I don't understand how that can be a patent on a machine if the only thing novel is the process that the machine is using. Isn't -- isn't the question -- really, the question there was whether the new process was patentable.",
  "I'm sorry. I must be awfully stupid. You say it would come out the same way. In the same way the court did or this way you argued?",
  "And you think it should? You think it should?",
  "I don't understand why that isn't just the application of a process, which -- which is not itself patentable subject matter, to a particular machine that can use the process --",
  "It's not on a computer, which the only difference from the old computer is it's using a new program. You can't say that's a new machine.",
  "But that patent didn't require any change in the hardware, if I remember it correctly.",
  "Mr. Schneider, can I just inject this thought? It goes back to Justice Kennedy's question. I don't think we are concerned about the defendants gaming the system. I think one other very important concern is plaintiffs sometimes in small communities want to sue somebody, and sometimes they would much rather be in Federal court, because sometimes the judges are better than the local judges, and so forth. So there are a lot of reasons why plaintiffs want to get into Federal courts. And it seems to me it's important to have a rule that makes it easy for the plaintiff to decide what is the citizenship of the defendant, can I get into Federal court or not. And I see it as a great argument in favor of a very simple rule to benefit plaintiffs.",
  "But you must acknowledge that it's a lot easier for a plaintiff -- there is some place to get on the internet and say where is their principal place and they get a simple answer. If you get a question, well, I got to analyze their business all over the country to decide, that's a formidable obstacle for a -- for a plaintiff to overcome.",
  "-- of an interstate business who are commonly defendants in a lot of lawsuits -- in a personal injury suit, and the question is, can I easily decide what the place of incorporation of that defendant is.",
  "May I ask this question before you finish -- if it is an appropriate time? What is your response to their argument they raise in the reply brief that this was specified under subchapter 1, rather than subchapter 2?",
  "May I - -",
  "May I ask this question: Is the fact that they've included the news media consistent with your view?",
  "That seems to be a much more open source of information than you're raising.",
  "May I, just one -- one quick question. I -- I -- I just want to be sure I understood. Do you draw any distinction between the preposition \"in\" and the preposition \"from\"?",
  "Mr. Hurt, let me just give you what's really troubling me about this case. You have two citizens of a small town. One of them goes to the hearing and gets all this information, the other one doesn't go to the hearing and reads about it in the newspaper. The latter is a permissible plaintiff, the former is not; is that correct?",
  "Does that make any sense?",
  "But one of the things they could not have done was file a lawsuit right then. Is that correct? Because they would not have had adequate facts to comply with the rules barring plaintiffs from filing suits based on information and belief?",
  "In those cases, of course, the statute would not run. Is that right?",
  "If we go back to the text of the statute, it says 2 years after discovery, and you argue it should mean 2 years after he should have discovered, though -- and that period being measured by a date from inquiry notice, which is not mentioned in the statute at all.",
  "But you do agree that you are reading as though it meant 2 years after he should have discovered?",
  "Mr. Stewart, you are talking about a hypothetical case here, right?",
  "Some -- we are talking about this particular case. Does the inquiry notice contribute anything to answering the question when this plaintiff or the -- the class of plaintiffs should have discovered this violation?",
  "Right.",
  "So, in this particular case, we should ignore inquiry notice entirely?",
  "But isn't there another problem? Even if Congress didn't think of the problem, don't we have the duty to construe the statute to avoid constitutional problems if there is any reasonable basis for doing so?",
  "That is an entirely different argument from the fact that Congress didn't think of this problem.",
  "Well, would the case be different if there had been such an allegation in the petition?",
  "It would not have been different then? What if it had been not only an allegation but an affidavit? Would the case be different?",
  "I’m kind of curious to know what your answer to my question is.",
  "Would the case be different if the Petitioner had filed an affidavit of undue hardship with the papers? Same notice, everything else exactly the same.",
  "Why is it a harder case?",
  "And I say it's supported by an affidavit.",
  "Supported by -- would then the case be different?",
  "There has to be an adversary hearing under your view?",
  "Okay. So if there's not only an affidavit, but an offer of proof, and then there's no answer filed and nothing in response to the notice of the -- the lender did exactly what it did here.",
  "Yes.",
  "But your legal theory would be the same if there had been an affidavit filed and the same -- the same response by the -- by the company?",
  "Can I just get your answer to a similar question --",
  "-- I asked your colleague? If the facts of this case were changed by the -- the creditor had come in and stipulated to the plan before the court and explained at the time, we think it would be better to get what money's available now rather than waiting for the interest to be collected later on, if they had stipulated to it, and then the order was entered, you would still say, 10 years later, they could charge it?",
  "He stipulates to the entry of the plan. That's all he stipulates to.",
  "So you -- you would have the same position then?",
  "But the irony of your position is it's in the creditor's interest to get what is available at this time, rather than waiting 10 years hoping to get interest later on, and even though that's the fact, you cannot give relief in this situation.",
  "Well, they did it in this case, didn't they? Under your view, they –- their ruling goes beyond Miranda, and they said that the Florida Constitution requires this result.",
  "So they did do it in this very case.",
  "But it also cited the -- the Florida Constitution, did it not?",
  "And did it not also say that this was a violation of the Federal -- I mean, of the Florida Constitution?",
  "Let me -- let me ask you one question. Isn't it the case that this particular warning is used in one judicial district, and the warning that was approved in Traylor was used in the rest of the State? And so there is an interest -- the Florida Supreme Court has, in effect, required the same warning throughout the State. And if you prevail, there may be one standard warning in one judicial district, and the other districts may continue to use the one they have used in the past. Isn't that right?",
  "That's true, but if you -- if they all followed the Florida Supreme Court in this case, then they all would use the same warning?",
  "Which most of them do already.",
  "Not all, but some.",
  "Mr. O'Neil, isn't one of the problems here that Florida had two different printed forms before this case arose, and that Florida Supreme Court has said they’ll all have the same one hereafter?",
  "So at least two of them?",
  "And isn't it -- isn't it wiser generally to have the same form used throughout the State?",
  "Well, while you’re looking at whether it would be an undue burden on law enforcement, it was -- it has a burden that’s consistent with the ones that Miranda required expressly.",
  "I say when you were inquiring, as you were at that part of the opinion, into how burdensome it would be on law enforcement to give these warnings --",
  "-- you are saying the burden would be consistent under the new warnings with those previously given by the FBI.",
  "That's really not -- that's really not quite accurate, because they used the term \"Miranda warnings\" generically --",
  "-- as opposed to a category of warnings which are required by both the Federal Constitution and the State constitution, and they said it violated the State constitution.",
  "That's not in the question they -- they took.",
  "May I ask one -- one narrow question? If we assume that the members of the board are inferior officers, and if we -- do -- would you agree that if the board had unrestricted power to discharge them at will, the statute would be constitutional?",
  "Yes.",
  "But your answer to my question is that even if they are inferior officers and the other conditions have been met, if the Commission had unrestricted power of removal, the statute would still be unconstitutional.",
  "The answer is yes is what I just --",
  "Yes. Sure.",
  "Let me just ask you --",
  "I’m learning something about the case that I didn't understand before. Are you agreeing that if there were a duty to disclose exactly what happened in this case, that then the statute would have been violated?",
  "I thought you were arguing that a duty to disclose could never qualify.",
  "I'm trying to figure out what your position is, not what you could argue.",
  "But if you then -- but if you do have some duty, would the statute have been violated on these -- on these facts?",
  "If there were a duty to disclose the negotiations of this prospective employer or --",
  "Well, it's a duty to disclose those facts to the legislature.",
  "Well, I --",
  "But your position is not that there’s no duty; it's that there is not a duty with sufficiently severe penalties? Is that what your position is?",
  "But that is not a -- your position is not that there be no duty to disclose; you are saying there is not a duty to disclose of sufficient moment to justify criminal penalties.",
  "Let me give you this example: Take the Judge Holzer case we all know about. Suppose, in 49 States, it always violates State law, but there’s some State that has a special rule that, unless the bribery exceeds $1,000, there’s no violation. Would -- could he be prosecuted in the 49th State?",
  "But if it's not illegal",
  "-- in the State I'm asking you about?",
  "It does not have to be Alaska law, then?",
  "In this case, it does not have to be Alaska law, then?",
  "But I'm just trying -- if it's -- it’s illegal in 47 States, but not in the State in which the prosecution is brought, you say the Federal rule could not apply?",
  "Let me ask you right at that point: Does the prohibited action, namely, voting -- does that vote have to be contrary to -- serve the interest of the other party?",
  "May I ask you this question? You -- you have described the issue in this case as not merely a nondisclosure, but as you spell it out, it seems to me it is actually a quid pro quo theory.",
  "Yes, but you say that in order for the violation to be complete, he must follow up by voting in the interest of the company rather than the polls?",
  "And it has to be a specific kind of official action.",
  "You're saying that you’ll win on the facts, not the theory.",
  "But that’s not what we have to decide.",
  "May I ask this question? We might then say the theory that they described there is inadequate. But would we then send the case back and say decide it on the theory that Mr. Dreeben has explained today?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, can I ask this? It seems to me that even if there is some economic harm amounting to the cost of a World Series ticket, that's all -- or the amount of gas used to drive to the ballpark, that could still not meet the materiality requirement.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, I should know this, but refresh my memory. The body of pre-McNally court of appeals cases, to what extent were they just public rights versus private? Was there a substantial body?",
  "Mr. Waxman, can I ask this preliminary question? Assume the contract expressly authorized class arbitration. Would you agree that was permissible?",
  "Yes.",
  "I understand, but would you agree that would be consistent with the law, to enforce such a provision?",
  "That is, does the Federal statute prohibit that kind of provision?",
  "Oh.",
  "And you would agree that if they phrased their order a little differently and said we think that the best reading of this agreement is that the parties intended to authorize class arbitration, then you would have no case?",
  "That there was manifest disregard –-",
  "And you would not contend -- you are not arguing that that would be manifest --",
  "What, in your view -- what, in your view, were the arbitrators asked to decide by the submission by the parties?",
  "I’m a little bit puzzled. I don't understand how something -- if you ask whether something permits it, and if it doesn't prohibit it, doesn't it a fortiori permit it?",
  "But let me just, right there, interrupt with one question. The alternatives before the arbitrator were whether it is permitted or precluded?",
  "No, that's not what they said there, is it? That -- that the parties agree they’re silent -- that whether they -- if they are silent, whether they permit or preclude class action. Those are the two alternatives that they were confronted with. They decided that it did not preclude; ergo, it permitted.",
  "That's what the answer to that on page 49a is.",
  "You --",
  "But the question you were asked was whether that silence should be interpreted as a preclusion or a permission.",
  "You said there was a permission.",
  "Well, you don't agree to that, do you?",
  "Would you help me with one --",
  "May I ask a question, a very basic, elementary questions? Where in the record is the specific question to the arbitrators found -- that they were asked to respond to?",
  "I understand what the arbitrators said, but is there anything in the record that says we want you to answer this narrow question, and if so, what is it?",
  "But the record does not contain --",
  "-- the specific question that arbitrators were asked to answer. Is that correct?",
  "Because I haven't been able to find it. I understand what they say they were asked to answer, but I thought there would be some document saying we've agreed to this supplemental arbitration agreement, which is going to define what the answer -- what is the question you have to answer.",
  "Because I don't think, that -- from what I've been able to read, I don't think they were ever asked the question whether the agreement authorizes class action or class procedures. They were only asked to decide whether it either permitted it or precluded it, but is that what the question really was?",
  "See, as I understand it, in the supplemental agreement, they were asked a question about the meaning of the underlying arbitration agreement.",
  "But I can't find what that specific question was, which seems, to me, answers the whole case, if we could find out what it is.",
  "Ms. Kruger, can I just ask this question? I just want to be sure. Supposing you have an eyewitness. Can you follow the same procedure that you recommend for the scientific witness here -- and for an eyewitness?",
  "But, Mr. Phillips, I really don't quite understand a part of your argument. I'm not sure what happened to the $80 million, and I guess you aren't, either. And if in fact -- and maybe it was -- they had in good faith used that money to try and complete the facility and then decided it's just not worth it, would you still be entitled to get the 80 million back?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you sort of a basic question about the Eleventh Amendment argument? You -- you framed it entirely in terms of the Eleventh Amendment, but is there not also a common law immunity that the States can plead against non-sovereigns?",
  "But the money that’s -- but the money that is talked about in that section, as I read it, that’s money that would be generated after the facility was completed.",
  "So you’re saying the money generated by the South Carolina facility was the money of the compact members?",
  "And that was the money that was given to North Carolina?",
  "But isn't it true that this statute applies even if a person has not been a sexual offender in the past?",
  "So that argument doesn't take care of that --",
  "No, but my point is the law applies to a person who is convicted of armed robbery or bank robbery, and just before the end of his term in prison the authorities decide he is in fact a potential sexual offender. They can detain him.",
  "Right.",
  "But that's not -- that's not a necessary element of the -- of the statute -- under the statute, is it?",
  "Mr. DuBois, what is your answer to the hypothetical that General Kagan posited? Supposing after a man has been sentenced, say, to 30 days for gun possession, 20 -- 10 days before he is to be released, it's determined he has a communicable disease -- he would spread a disease if he gets out. Could the -- could the Federal Government have the power to detain him at the end of the 30 days?",
  "Right.",
  "It may not call for it. My question is would it have the power --",
  "-- not to release him, because there -- there’s strong evidence that, as soon as he gets into the society, the disease will -- will pass to others?",
  "But, of course, that goes to -- that goes to the question of the wisdom of the statute. I think, as the case comes to us, we have to assume that there are cases out there in which there will be no solution such as the one Justice Scalia proposes.",
  "I think that's why Congress acted, because they think there are such cases.",
  "But we are asked to decide a question on the assumption that there are States and there are governors who will not react to the problem of particular prisoners who are released in Arizona or some place when they originally came from Michigan or whatever it is. I think we have to assume that there are cases in which the statute would -- would play a role.",
  "Absolutely, and that's why it seems to me that the constitutional answer is the same in this statute as in the case of somebody who incurs a very communicable disease and the government wants to prevent him from infecting the community. Why is it a different constitutional question?",
  "I understand. It's purely backwards looking, and it takes care of the case that -- the premise of the government's argument is that the release itself is a Federal act that has to be done responsibly, and the very release, if it causes harm to the community, can be prevented.",
  "I guess we can all think of a lot of different statutes Congress might have enacted. We have to decide whether this one is constitutional.",
  "I want to follow up on Justice Alito's question. Supposing Congress passed a statute that said at the expiration of every sentence, the prisoner shall examined for certain reasons, and if he fails certain tests, he shall not be released for another 30 days. Say he should be examined to determine whether he is a sexual predator. And that’s in every -- every sentence at the time of the sentence?",
  "Right. And it says so in the statute.",
  "One of the elements of the punishment is that you are subjected to this examination that otherwise you wouldn’t have to take. It seems to me maybe your case boils down to the fact that -- that Congress hasn't written the right statute.",
  "Does your argument really boil down to the claim that this was, in effect, joint custody? It seems to me it clearly was not.",
  "I’d say it's not, but --",
  "But -- but are you arguing that this -- that this case is -- is the equivalent of a joint custody case?",
  "But is there a distinction between the -- what’s before us in this case and the different case in which the order specifically said custody shall be joint? The same -- would that not be a different case, in your view?",
  "But the decree says that custody -- the mother is the one who has custody.",
  "Mr. Hays --",
  "May I ask this question about the term “place” -- “place of residence”? Putting aside the control of the ne exeat that would prevent her from leaving the country, just looking at the situation within Chile, what -- did she have any limitation on her right to pick that place of residence within Chile?",
  "So, the only control that the -- the husband had was the right -- whatever right was given by the ne exeat provision, that you can't take the child out of the country?",
  "And even if there had been no fight of the kind that developed, she would have had a unrestricted right to pick the place of residence?",
  "May I just ask this general question? Is there any danger that the child is old enough to make the decision now, and, therefore, the cases are really moot?",
  "So no matter what we do, the child may actually provide the answer in this case?",
  "May I ask you, do you agree with your opponent, putting aside removing the child from the country, that within Chile itself the custodial parent had the full right to determine the place of residence?",
  "Could you answer one question -- I'm just a little confused about. One statute has the defense in expressly. The other doesn't. Is there a difference in the likelihood of unfairness under the two statutes? Why -- is there a reason why Congress would have wanted to provide a mistake of law defense under TILA and not in this - - this -- in this case? Why would it treat them differently?",
  "But the question is -- is there a greater need for the mistake of law defense under one statute, rather than the other, I sort of - -",
  "-- have the same problem Justice Scalia expressed.",
  "Can I --",
  "Can I interrupt with this question? Is it not part of your burden not only to argue there are multiple actors, but also that their agreement has an adverse effect on competition?",
  "I understand it isn't, but it is part of your burden to say that this is not a pro-competitive agreement.",
  "Well, you at least have to relate it.",
  "But what if he -- what if he further concluded that the agreement had the overall effect of stimulating additional -- it was pro-competitive in that it would equalize the economic strength of the teams and, therefore, made them all better competitors on the playing field? Would that have been a defense?",
  "Right.",
  "He said: Sure, there’s an agreement here, but the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the agreement has an adverse effect on competition. And that the -- as I understand the facts, you've -- there’s revenue sharing here, isn't there? That they -- they all share in the product of the sales of the joint product?",
  "And as I understand your position, that could be the result in this case. We don't know whether the district court was right or wrong in what he did on the -- on the rule of reason issue.",
  "And one thing I wondered about the record: There is discussion in the briefs about the fact that the teams share the revenues from these -- these sales. Is that -- how did that get in the record, the revenue sharing aspect of their -- of the different teams' participation?",
  "Would -- wouldn't that -- that affidavit support the conclusion that this is basically a pro-competitive agreement because it tends to make competition stronger on the playing field, and, therefore, that's a sufficient defense under the rule of reason, and that's the end of the ball game?",
  "Yes, but you are not just competing --",
  "But with regard to sales of the paraphernalia and so forth that you have here, you’re not just competing among the members of the league; you’re competing in a market that includes all sports paraphernalia.",
  "That assumes there is no competition between the sales of those logos and the sales of other sports logos.",
  "May I ask you this question, Mr. Stewart? Would the antitrust issue before us be any different if instead of giving an exclusive contract to one purveyor of the product, the commissioner had entered into a multitude of different contracts, but specified a minimum price in every one he specified?",
  "So the fact that this is an exclusive agreement is kind of a red herring in this case, isn't it?",
  "Well, but you -- you certainly could because they certainly could -- theoretically, each club could sell its own logo.",
  "They have decided not to do it that way, but it could be done.",
  "But maybe they also collectively decide the best way to make money and finance -- attendance and so forth, all agree on a housing program that they all jointly sponsor.",
  "It would be the most effective way to -- to raise the money to pay these players who make so much money.",
  "Well, what is -- what is the contractual issue? What is the issue of interpreting the contract that this case presents if you let the 301 case go forward?",
  "Is there any dispute about that?",
  "Well, they’re not in all circumstances, but will you respond to your opponent's argument? Why in the world would they have signed on -- on July 2nd if they didn't think they were going to get the benefit of the no-strike clause?",
  "If they had the benefit of the no-strike clause --",
  "-- then any subsequent strike would have violated the contract?",
  "Well, there was a subsequent strike.",
  "What is the remedy --",
  "May I ask you, what is the remedy for an unfair labor practice? Can they get a damage remedy?",
  "Right.",
  "A make-whole remedy --",
  "-- for -- okay.",
  "May I ask you -- we often talk about price adjustments as causing the disputes between the franchisee and the franchisor. To what extent in these sets of contracts is the right of the franchisor to adjust the price controlled by terms of the contract?",
  "But is the formula required by the contract, or it’s just its own discretion to use the formula?",
  "I see.",
  "But, Mr. Lamken, isn't it true that the statute, as a whole, expressed Congress's feeling that the common law rules were really not sufficient because, under the common law, of course, they could just non-renew because they wanted to take over the franchise themselves. And under the statute, that is not permissible. So there’s a major change that's created by the statute, which suggests, to me, that maybe they didn't want to adopt all the preexisting common law.",
  "May I interrupt with this question that goes both to what Justice Ginsburg asked and the other? Should we treat all areas the same, depending -- say it's -- the disparity between a jurisdiction which has only 3 or 4 percent of a minority should be treated similarly to a jurisdiction where they have 30 or 40 percent?",
  "But isn't it perfectly obvious that you’re going to have dramatic differences where you only have a very small percentage, as in -- in Grand Rapids, for example, and where you have a major percentage as you did in Duren.",
  "But isn't it possible -- it's awfully hard to get these percentages when you get small numbers, as you do. But doesn't it seem intuitively obvious that if you give the district courts first crack of -- of the size of the pool that has more of the African-American potential jurors in it than the other, that it's -- it's bound to have an impact?",
  "Right.",
  "But -- but there’s a much higher percentage of African-Americans in Grand Rapids than there is in the county as a whole.",
  "But -- but the jurors that served on the district court, were they -- were they taken from the entire county, too, or just from Grand Rapids?",
  "So the district court jurors could -- could include as many jurors who are not from Grand Rapids as they could from Grand Rapids?",
  "I see.",
  "I -- apparently, we were not communicating correctly.",
  "Right.",
  "So the --",
  "So the jurors who served on the district court were primarily from Grand Rapids, rather than Kent County as a whole?",
  "Well, let me just ask you --",
  "-- a factual question. Could they put on the district court jurors who did not come from Grand Rapids?",
  "So, then, inevitably, if you give the district court jurors first, a pool of African-American jurors are going to be larger serving in the district court than in the -- in the felony court.",
  "Let me ask this factual question: Am I correct in understanding that Michigan in fact has changed the practice with regard to giving priority to --",
  "Yes.",
  "Let me just --",
  "Let me make sure I understand your position. Assume that there is an -- an identifiable disparity of 2 percent or 3 percent, or whatever it might be to get to the threshold of being significant, that’s entirely caused by the fact that the members of the minority have personal excuses that justify non-service. What do you do with that case? Do you find that it was -- it’s unconstitutional, or don't you?",
  "It is. It's assuming --",
  "I didn’t --",
  "But is it unconstitutional, is what I'm trying to find out. Society benefits because -- if you make them serve; the society benefits if you grant the excuses, too.",
  "Mr. Payton, can I ask this general question? Am I correct that each firefighter in the qualified group who did not make the well-qualified has a cause of action as though he had been refused employment when anyone else is hired? There were 11 people hired, as I understand. Did each one of those hirings give everybody else in the class a cause of action?",
  "But surely they couldn't all recover, because there was only one job available.",
  "What is -- what is the remedy other than saying change your practice? What is -- say one person sues and asks for damages, what would the remedy be for a single applicant who was not hired at the time somebody else was hired?",
  "May I ask this question, Ms. Solomon? Would your argument be the same if the practice in this case were -- required a high school diploma? Did you understand my question?",
  "Suppose the practice were a high school diploma. Could that -- would you make the same argument as you're making today?",
  "That’s right.",
  "No, but -- but in my example, everybody who is not a high school graduate would have been affected right away.",
  "But, Mr. Cole, don't you agree that some of the speech could be regulated?",
  "Some of the speech of your client.",
  "You think all of the speech at issue is protected?",
  "You identified quite a bit.",
  "In those cases, the real question was whether membership was enough, wasn’t it?",
  "Yes.",
  "But I want to be sure I understand that point. You think the issue in this case would be different if we were at war?",
  "And if that's true, why aren't we now at war, with regard to our opposition to these organizations?",
  "What is the difference, as a practical matter?",
  "But my question that I want to be sure you are focusing on --",
  "-- would they be different if we were now at war?",
  "Then it seems to me that your opponent's argument here today is prohibited.",
  "May I ask a sort of basic question that I’ve had trouble with throughout the whole argument? We’re talking about whether this is an as-applied challenge or on its face. And what the district judge did was hold part of the statute unconstitutional as being too vague: the words “training” and “advice,” et cetera. Why isn't that a facial decision?",
  "Specifically, does this particular man have to be prosecuted?",
  "Is this particular individual in risk of being prosecuted if he makes the speech to the United Nations?",
  "And is there evidence that he would be prosecuted if he --",
  "But in essence, this is an action to enjoin a potential prosecution against somebody for making a potential speech? That's really what we are fighting about, I think.",
  "Mr. Miller, can I ask you this question? We are construing Rule 52(b) here, not -- as construed in Olano, which has developed the four factors. In your view, does the character of the violation, in this case an ex post facto violation, does that ever make a difference? Could a court ever think that one kind of constitutional violation is a little bit more serious than another, or are they all fungible?",
  "Would it not also be possible that some constitutional violations undermine confidence a little more than others?",
  "Then why is the Second Circuit so wrong to say: We think ex post facto violations are perhaps a little more serious than some others.",
  "Are all omissions in jury instructions fungible, then? I'm -- here we have an omission in a jury instruction relating to the Ex Post Facto Clause. Does -- the fact that it relates to the Ex Post Facto Clause doesn't give it any extra weight or any lesser weight in the analysis?",
  "Mr. -- may I ask this question about the -- I -- I should know this, but I don't. To what extent has the regular test that my colleagues referred to applied in ex post facto cases in other circuits?",
  "Yes.",
  "Were those ex post --",
  "-- ex post facto cases?",
  "So that it isn't necessarily a conflict between this case and all other plain error cases; it's a narrow category of cases involving ex post facto violations?",
  "But it not only allowed the evidence before the jury, but it also told the jury it was sufficient to convict.",
  "And the jury was instructed that he could be convicted on the basis of what had happened in Canada. That would be the same?",
  "But in this case, it was the fact of the concession -- the confession that constituted the waiver. talk, but the confession itself isn't enough. We needed to have -- the State needed to have evidence that he understood his rights, which he said he did, and that there was -- that the confession was not the product of police coercion. And I think that that comes through directly in the language that's at issue in Butler. The Court said “an express written or oral statement of waiver” -- to remain silent or the right to counsel -- “is strong proof of the validity of the waiver but not inevitably necessary…. The question is not one of form, but whether the defendant, in fact, knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in Miranda.”",
  "May I -- just refresh my recollection. In the record in this case, do we know whether he said he understood his rights?",
  "Because that was present in Butler.",
  "Well, why doesn’t it --",
  "May I ask, can you go back to page 14 in your reply brief? \"Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear. If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\"",
  "So the question is whether during those two hours by not answering a -- a number of questions, did he indicate in any way that he wished to remain silent?",
  "Then it says that any -- in any manner that he wished to remain silent. And until the 2 hours and a half later when he did answer the three questions, that's pretty -- it's at least arguable that his silence indicated he wished to remain silent.",
  "Of course, that also assumes that McNally was correctly decided --",
  "-- and I don’t think it was. May I ask you another question --",
  "-- prompted by Justice Kennedy's question? Have any of the circuits taken a look at the probable merit of the underlying claim in evaluating the issue?",
  "No, not in this particular case. But Justice Kennedy says it's equally unjust to the client whether it's negligence or gross negligence, and I'm just asking whether in any of the reviews of this issue, that you are familiar with, have they sometimes looked at the probable merit of the claim, and if there was merit, why, you were more disturbed about attorney negligence, whereas if it's a frivolous claim, they wouldn't be. But do you know if any of them take a look at that at all?",
  "May I just ask just an information question before you -- are the postconviction lawyers in these cases that are appointed, are they compensated by the State?",
  "They are.",
  "May I ask another question? It doesn't go to the merits, but I'm really curious. The lawyers selected for postconviction work, which I understand now are compensated by the State, are they selected from the same panels as the lawyers that represent defendants generally and who are appointed by the State in criminal matters?",
  "Is it --",
  "But the collateral counsel registry is a different group of lawyers than are generally appointed in criminal cases?",
  "I see.",
  "Mr. Gura, can I ask you the same question Justice Ginsburg asked about: What if there were no Second Amendment? You say the right would still be protected under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. What about -- would it also be protected under substantive due process if there were no Second Amendment?",
  "Because of the -- the importance of the right to protection -- and would that apply to the entire scope of the Second Amendment or just the right to keep the gun, a homeowner's right to keep a gun for self-protection against intruders into the home, under the -- without the Second Amendment, just the Liberty Clause?",
  "I'm assuming we don't have a Second Amendment for purposes of the substantive due process analysis. I'm asking you what is the scope of the right to own a gun that is protected by the Liberty Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? Is it just the right to have it at -- at home, or is the right to parade around the streets with guns?",
  "Mr. Clement, would you comment on Justice Kennedy's question about whether that necessarily incorporates every jot and tittle of the Federal right into the Federal, keeping in mind that with regard to trial by jury in criminal cases, there’s a difference. It’s nonunanimous juries. Why does this incorporation have to be every bit as broad as the Second Amendment itself?",
  "Well, what is the last case in which we incorporated a substantive provision?",
  "Mapp was a procedural case.",
  "Mapp was a Fourth Amendment case. I'm asking you cases involving incorporation of substantive rights, as opposed to procedural rights.",
  "The procedural cases come in under the due process language, but the substantive cases comes under the word \"liberty,\" and \"liberty\" picks up the First Amendment and so forth. And I take it it's the word \"liberty\" that picks up the Second Amendment. And if it does, why does it have to be precisely the same scope as the Second Amendment?",
  "They stand in a favored position, but we've never said had to be literally all the way down the line, or we couldn't have done the criminal jury -- nonunanimous criminal jury case.",
  "That's true of the criminal jury trial right, too, all of those things? And yet we don't -- it's not exactly the same. I just don't see why it has to be exactly the same. I can understand your argument that it should be substantially the same, but I don't see that there's anything in the text of the Fourteenth Amendment that would justify saying it must be precisely the same, or of any of our cases.",
  "Incorporation jurisprudence is -- we haven't had an incorporation case for 30 years or more.",
  "You’re -- you’re dead right --",
  "-- about the majority of the Court, but it's interesting that during this whole period, Justice Harlan staked out a separate position on whether it should be just the substance of the right or the -- every detail. And we have followed Justice Harlan, rather than the majority in a number of cases in -- in the recent years.",
  "He is very much against you, and he's a very important member of our -- of our history.",
  "If you look to Justice Harlan's dissent in Griswold, where he says the Fourteenth Amendment stands on its own bottom and it can be either more or less than the provisions of the Bill of Rights, and there’s no reason in the world why this Court could not adopt the same position here and say: Insofar it’s incorporated, it applies only within the home. The Court had ample precedent for that.",
  "Would you comment on --",
  "May I ask you to comment on the fact that, in the Carlson case, apparently the assistant surgeon general was, in fact, a defendant, and the government failed to make this defense?",
  "But if you’re right, they should have.",
  "Now, that’s kind of interesting that apparently the government was not aware of the breadth of the position they’re -- you’re now taking.",
  "Do think your clear statement argument would apply even if Carlson had been decided before the statute was enacted?",
  "Okay.",
  "May I just be sure I understand your argument? Is the Westfall Act -- would it have covered every immunity that the Public Health Act previously provided? So, is it correct that the -- the prior statute is now totally unnecessary and does nothing except preserve the Bivens -- preserve the immunity for Bivens actions?",
  "May I ask just ask one quick question? Am I correct in understanding that you do not contend that your client was covered by 1603(b)(1)?",
  "It defines an agency or instrumentality of the --",
  "The principal argument is not based on the text. You do make that argument in the alternative then?",
  "It’s interesting that nobody has talked about that section during the entire argument.",
  "If they don't qualify under 1603(b)(1), it's kind of hard to get the statute to apply to them at all.",
  "And 1602 applies only to foreign states.",
  "I'm just a little puzzled. I think you are giving the State court an awful lot of power. Can it do it without new legislation? They have to adjust these other taxes, maybe the expenses they deduct in their regulatory filings and all the rest. But I don't know that the State court has any more authority to grant a judicial remedy than the Federal court would have.",
  "But the Tax Injunction Act goes to the authority or the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the case in the first place. I'm not sure the Tax Injunction Act prohibits the remedy that you describe, because there is a difference between filing the suit and entering relief after the suit's been filed.",
  "That raises another -­ another problem for me. Your basic standing is similarly situated competitors, one is being taxed and the other is not. But you are not similarly situated competitors because they are regulated utilities and you are unregulated. Isn't that right?",
  "Right.",
  "Let me just go back to my question before. I understand your point about regulation and nonregulation, but -- but your competitors are subject to a different taxing regime than you are; is that correct?",
  "And isn't -- is not the reason they are subject to a different tax regime is historically they were in regulated utilities?",
  "Except -- may I just interrupt a bit, just on the \"except\" clause at the very bottom. When you are talking about individual cases it's easy. Sure, one member dies; the other two can finish. But you are talking about long-run governance of the board. The two members -- two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence. Now, 2 years later, after -- what is the group designated pursuant to the first sentence at the time of the decision 2 years later?",
  "But there is no such group exists at the time that that power is being exercised.",
  "No, it's not the past tense. \"Two members shall constitute a quorum.\"",
  "But there is no group around at the time they're -- that this case is being decided, that was designated before.",
  "But your -- your inquiry is focusing on what happens 2 years later.",
  "Well, not only is the two-member board not -- not ideal. Do you think it is reasonably possible that Congress back in 1947 contemplated this particular problem and would have solved it the way you suggest?",
  "But that's always when there is -- there is in existence three people who could have served. But the particular problem we've got now, going on for 2 or 3 years: All the decisions by two members. Do you think Congress would have authorized this?",
  "Let me just ask, is this the cases in which the claim is he's ineligible for the death penalty?",
  "And is that -- is that a meritorious claim?",
  "The merits of the claims have never been decided?",
  "May I ask you on that point: Supposing the class of plaintiffs included a group of Americans who were shareholders of the Australian bank and who -- but who purchased their stock over the Australian exchange.",
  "What do you make of the fact that in subsequent proceedings the prosecutor acknowledged that the judge made a mistake?",
  "May I ask you as a matter of Michigan practice, could the trial judge have interrogated the other jurors beyond the foreman and asked them what they thought about whether there was a deadlock?",
  "Is there any reason -- do you suppose there is any reason why he didn't do that?",
  "He took the view of the foreman, an answer to one question, and that was it; is that right?",
  "His conclusion that there was a deadlock was based on one question and one answer of one of the jurors, and that was the whole record supporting his decision; is that right?",
  "Well, what other circumstance is relevant? The fact that they raised their voices during deliberation, certainly that -- that doesn't cut any ice either way, does it?",
  "Well, is it quite correct to say the legal issue is whether there's a deadlock? Isn't the legal issue whether there was a manifest necessity to take the action? Isn't that the test?",
  "And the argument is that there was not a manifest necessity shown, even though there was disagreement about whether there was a deadlock, because all deadlocks are not exactly alike.",
  "Some people think one -­ there is one holdout, that means it's a deadlock. Some people think it -- it might be more. I don't think the test is deadlock. The test is manifest necessity.",
  "Also you are ignoring the fact the first time the question was asked, do you believe it was hopelessly deadlocked and the foreperson said the majority of us don't believe that. And then later -­",
  "-- and there is a period, in the opinion of the supreme court after we don't believe that.",
  "The foreperson did not immediately answer. She had to ask a second question, yes or no. And the foreperson answered for herself but not necessarily for the jury when she said no.",
  "May I ask you, do you think the most relevant precedent from this Court -­ would you agree that the most relevant precedent from this Court is Arizona v. Washington?",
  "Why not?",
  "What do you think the most relevant precedent from this Court is?",
  "Yes, but that still couldn't give him the full 54 days, because there's only 42 days in six weeks.",
  "But I'm saying the special mechanism can't give the full 54 days.",
  "Because they don't make it until 42 days before the end of the sentence.",
  "May I just interrupt with one question? If he got a total of 540 or whatever it is, he should never enter the 9th year because he would finish the 10-year sentence in less than 8 years.",
  "Or less than 9 years, rather.",
  "So how does he -- how does he get his 10th block of good time? How does he ever get it under your -­",
  "Right. I understand. But explain to me how -- how he can get more than a year of good time credit before the 10th year begins?",
  "Which is more than a year.",
  "Yes, but as Justice Scalia says, you know, you do make the determination on the 365th day, but what you determine is that the -- having been a good prisoner, his first year expired 54 days earlier, and then you start over.",
  "Let me interrupt and get one thing off my mind that I just -- supposing he misbehaves in year 3. Does that just affect his good time credits in year 3, or does it mean he is canceled for years 1 and 2?",
  "But he can lose his 108 days?",
  "No, but isn't there another consideration? It's not the Rule of Lenity, but it's something else we should take into account. In the -- in their reply brief, they say it costs about 25 or $26,000 to house a particular prisoner, and the number of prisoners involved is -­ something like $100 million in taxpayers' money is at issue in this case. It -- is -- you don't disagree with that general figure, do you?",
  "But in any event, it's clear it's a lot of money. And -- and is that not a factor that we should be aware of in this case, because, all other things being equal -- assume the statute is totally ambiguous, and if you -- if one -- one -- one version will save the -- the government $100 million a year and the other version will cost it, is that -­ isn't that a factor we -- we should take into consideration?",
  "You say there are 195,000 sentences affected by this rule. I don't know which way that cuts. If there are 195,000 people spending more time in -- you know, significantly more time in jail than they should, that's kind of troublesome.",
  "Probably they didn't understand it because it's an awfully hard statute to understand.",
  "Well, he's a lot smarter than I am.",
  "Am I correct in understanding that 3582(c) was enacted prior to our decision in Booker?",
  "And is it clear that it should be construed as though the system was mandatory before the decision in Booker, rather than construed in the light of the remedial decision in Booker?",
  "Right. Is that any more a dramatic change than was made in the Booker remedial opinion itself?",
  "But the remedial opinion basically rewrote the whole statute on -- except first it didn't have to reach 3582(c), but it certainly changed the -- the nature of the mandatory provisions that were previously in the statute.",
  "May I ask this question? Accepting the point that there’s no constitutional compulsion that they had to open up for a full new sentencing, and I understand one reason for not doing it is that you don't impose too much work on the district courts for doing it, but could you explain to me why as -- just as a matter of policy and good judgment, the Commission would say, well, you can take a look at all the negative factors that would argue against reduction, but you cannot look at any of the factors that would show why you should have had the same sentence that if -- why you should get the kind of sentence you would have gotten if you had been sentenced in the first place today? Because I guess this particular man is going to be -- spend 22 more years in jail than if he -- if he had been sentenced today.",
  "You think the statute would have prohibited a more generous policy statement, then?",
  "Am I right that the District has been following this procedure for quite some time?",
  "Well, where a private party initiates, the beneficiary of an order of this kind, initiates a contempt proceeding against a person who violates it, and seeks a punishment for it, not just discontinuance.",
  "It doesn't say to me that the plea agreement goes to the question of whether there is sort of an inherent violation of the Constitution by adopting this procedure at all.",
  "I have trouble figuring out whether the plea agreement has any relevance to the kind of basic argument you are making.",
  "And if -- if that's true, they have been following an unconstitutional practice for about 25 years; is that right?",
  "And nobody thought about it in all this time?",
  "Because it is done many, many times, as I understand it, over the years.",
  "Could I -- I have this question. This -- again, I'm trying to see the case in the broad -- in the broader sense. Supposing there is a civil lawsuit that's settled and part of the settlement is a consent decree that would enjoin certain conduct, and the defendant then violates the decree and engages in the prohibited conduct. Are you saying that the only person who could prosecute for contempt would be the sovereign?",
  "Yes.",
  "So, no, the question would be whether the lawyer for the -- the party who entered into the settlement could bring a contempt proceeding against the adversary who had violated the settlement.",
  "What do you think the best authority from this Court for your basic proposition is? What is your strongest case?",
  "You think Gompers is the best case?",
  "But do I understand your position that in this particular case the U.S. Attorney could have entered into a settlement agreement that would have bound the Respondent?",
  "You draw a distinction between the D.C. Circuit -- the D.C. and the United States?",
  "But you would agree, I take it, that the attorney for the District of Columbia could have bound Respondent? Somebody could bind Respondent without Respondent even knowing about it, that's what I'm asking.",
  "Can I ask you this question about the basic background of a reasonable expectation of privacy? This is SWAT team work. Supposing it was an officer answering 911 calls or things like that. Isn't there sort of a background expectation that sooner or later, somebody might have to look at communications for this particular kind of law enforcement officer?",
  "I mean, wouldn't you just assume that that whole universe of conversations by SWAT officers who are on duty 24/7 might well have to be reviewed by some member of the public or some of their superiors?",
  "Well, but it's over official -- it's over the official communications equipment that they use for purposes of law enforcement.",
  "Yes, but there’s no normal reason for going through somebody's desk; whereas, there would be a very ordinary -- ordinary reason for reviewing calls made to the SWAT -- members of the SWAT team, it seems to me.",
  "Yes.",
  "So, what if the belief --",
  "What if the belief is that African Americans are inferior?",
  "May I ask this question, Mr. Garre?",
  "May I ask one question? I'd like you to answer, and I’d like your opponent, too: Do you think that, in order to decide this case, we have to pass on the constitutionality of an all-comers policy?",
  "That we must do that to decide the case? And I want to ask your opponent the same question.",
  "So they're all --",
  "There may be a lot of other things we can decide, but in all events, we must decide that much?",
  "Put -- put to a side a moment -- forget the as-applied. Just take a -- a pure all-comers policy. Must we decide the constitutionality of that?",
  "May I ask you one question?",
  "May I ask this question before you sit down? Are you aware -- maybe you cite them in the briefs and I didn't catch it -- of any cases in which the courts -- a court of appeals has dismissed an appeal because it was taken before the -- the civil remedy had been imposed?",
  "In those -- in those -- in that case, or any of those four cases, did they discuss the problem of whether there was -- both appeals were proper?",
  "They just went ahead and consolidated?",
  "May I ask this --",
  "May I ask this hypothetical? Supposing the defendant fails to appeal when he's sentenced, and then 90 days later, they impose a restitution order and he appeals from that. May he raise the issues about guilt and innocence and error in the trial in that appeal?",
  "Correct.",
  "But he -- he can appeal just the restitution order.",
  "No, I understand that.",
  "Let me ask you this question: If we conclude there’s a hole in the statute that Congress has to amend, is it more likely that Congress will cure the statute if we rule for you or if we rule against you? It's pretty clear, the answer to that, isn't it?",
  "Yes, but --",
  "-- being realistic about it, as I understand it you're relying entirely on the condition, general conditions of passage in the ticket, the fine print describing the term \"carrier.\" That's -- but do you take into account that the cover of the ticket, which is what the passenger would look at, uses \"Costa Cruises,\" blah, blah, blah -- \"Costa Cruise Lines\" and so -- and doesn't even mention the carrier?",
  "Don't you think, looking at that ticket, if you were a passenger you would think you were doing business with Costa Cruise?",
  "Just looking at the cover?",
  "Am I correct that on the cover of the ticket, the Italian name isn't used at all?",
  "And isn't that what the --",
  "-- what the passenger would normally look at, understand who he is doing business with?",
  "Because the question is whether the lawyer made a mistake. Isn't that the question?",
  "And he did make a mistake.",
  "Despite that, they made a mistake.",
  "They made a mistake, right? They read the ticket, and despite that, they made a mistake.",
  "What?",
  "Why isn't -- why doesn't the rule cover it?",
  "I'm still puzzled, because Rule (C) just requires -- describes the state of mind of the defendant, correct? C(i) and (ii); isn't that right?",
  "And is it not true that under (i), the defendant did receive such notice of the action, would not be prejudiced? That's clear, isn't it?",
  "And is it also true that at the time they received the complaint, they knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against the carrier instead of the broker?",
  "I just don't understand how you get around the plain language.",
  "You don't think -- you don't think that the agent didn't realize that they would have sued the carrier if they had known the identity of the right party?",
  "I understand all that.",
  "But we're talking about the -- about mindset of the defendant, and to say that they wouldn't have sued -- they would have sued the broker instead of this carrier? It's absurd.",
  "May I ask -- ask this question? The question here is whether there was eligibility for fees. Could the district judge in your view say, yes, I think the plaintiff is eligible for fees, but it was actually a very difficult legal issue, and the defendant's position was entirely reasonable, so I think as a matter of discretion I will not award any fees?",
  "But then, aren't you treating the statute as though it did have a prevailing party clause in it?",
  "Is not your construction one that just treats the statute as though it required the plaintiff to be a prevailing party?",
  "May I ask this question? You rely very heavy on Ruckelshaus, which of course was a case in which the fees were sought to be imposed against the government. Is there a basis for distinguishing on a sort of a sovereign immunity approach for saying that maybe there should be a stricter standard when you’re taking money away from the sovereign than when you’re taking it away from private litigants?",
  "I'm a little puzzled. What was the argument that was made? Why was it unconscionable, if not for that reason?",
  "And that's no matter how one-sided? I mean, suppose the agreement provided that the employee shall pay all the costs of arbitration no matter who wins and also at the end of the arbitration shall pay a penalty if he fails to -- it seems to me you could have a really one-sided -- that would not be admissible on the issue?",
  "May I ask this kind of elementary question?",
  "Are there cases out there that hold that an agreement can be partially unconscionable, that it’s unconscionable for some clauses but not in its -- in its entirety?",
  "But there are cases that -- that draw that distinction?",
  "There are cases drawing that very elementary distinction?",
  "Isn't there another --",
  "Isn't there another possible public interest? Would it be a legitimate public interest to say I’d like to know who signed the petition because I would like to try to persuade them that their views should be modified? Is there a public interest in encouraging debate on the underlying issue?",
  "Well, it does identify people who have a -- a particular point of view on a public issue. And if you had the other point of view, don't you have an interest in finding out who you’d like to convince to change their minds?",
  "You mentioned discovery. I don't see why you can't get discovery against this whole bunch of people.",
  "Subpoenas out there and depositions.",
  "Of course, in this particular situation you can do the same thing. You can file requests for admissions or serve interrogatories. I don't understand why you can't do that.",
  "I would assume the aggregators have the relevant information.",
  "I would assume the aggregator would have the relevant information.",
  "But they have to -- they have the burden of proof in the case and I assume they have to investigate the facts and be prepared for trial.",
  "May I ask a fact question? I'm just a little puzzled here. I probably should have asked Mr. Phillips. But what issues in fact are there going to be in this case? It seems to me everything ought to be on computer somewhere, and it's just a matter of pushing the right button and you know how much money you owe. Am I missing something?",
  "Mr. Phillips, do you attach any significance to the fact that every member of the so-called class here has individually agreed to be bound by the judgment?",
  "Which -- the assignees, but the assignors have agreed to be bound --"
