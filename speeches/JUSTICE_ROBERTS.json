  "The Court will now hear argument in IBP, Inc. vs. Alvarez and Tum vs. Barber Foods, Inc. Mr. Phillips.",
  "So, your approach introduces, really, a third concept. You have the principal activities and you have -- either preliminary or postliminary -- and now you've got a third concept: integral. But the statute -- that's nowhere in the statute.",
  "Well, unless they were saying those activities were, in fact, principal activities. If it's integral, if it's embraced by the principal activity, it is a principal activity, and that at least is more consistent with the statute in keeping it in two categories rather than inventing a third.",
  "Well, how does -- how does your analysis apply? Let's say these employees had to change their equipment several times during the course of the day.",
  "Yes, I mean, the -­",
  "-- the equipment is only good for, you know, an hour, two hours, then they have to get new ones. They have to walk back to the place -­",
  "-- they have to doff the other equipment, don new equipment, and walk back. Wouldn't your analysis say that that walking time is excluded?",
  "Why not?",
  "What was -­",
  "-- so unusual about the facts -­",
  "What was so unusual about the facts in Steiner? They're pretty common.",
  "No, but the -­",
  "-- the routine where you have to don, you know, safety equipment, and you have to shower when you're done, whether it's being -- the meatpacking or the stuff at Steiner -- that's a pretty common occurrence.",
  "That's right, they don't say -- I mean, they exclude, for example, the canine cases, where you have to walk and feed the dog in the morning before you show up at work. So -­",
  "-- they're not saying only -­",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips.",
  "Mr. Goldstein.",
  "Your -­",
  "-- answer to Justice Kennedy said that the dog cases were distinguishable because there was a break in the principal activity. So, if we were to rule in your favor, all the employer has to do is make sure that the donning and doffing station's far enough away from the production line so that there will be a sufficient break between the two activities.",
  "What do you mean \"it would be\" -- that's my question.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Goldstein. Mr. Gornstein.",
  "Mr. Gornstein, do you agree that just because it's a compensable activity doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't going to be a break in the workday? People have talked about the dog example, and there are others. I mean, and -- so, all you're talking about is the determination that this is a principal activity. It seems that there's a separate -­ second question, which is, How do we tell if the space in time between two different principal activities, and they're two very different types of activities, is a break or part of the continuous workday?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Phillips, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. The case is submitted.",
  "We will now hear argument in Wagnon vs. Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation. Mr. Olson.",
  "Well, Mr. Olson, the Solicitor General tells us that -- and here we have -- you have the statute, but they have the Kaul case that suggests that this tax is imposed on the reservation.",
  "Mr. Olson, what does it mean when they say, in law, the \"incidence of the taxes on the distributor\"? Does that mean anything other than that he has to pay it?",
  "Well, I guess the reason for my question is, they look back at the court's decisions and see that it turns on where the incidence of the tax is. And so, there's some bright lawyer in Kansas who said, \"All we have to do is pass a law saying the incidence is -- of the tax is on the distributor, and we're going to win.\"",
  "So, it suggests that we shouldn't give too much weight to that.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Gershengorn.",
  "But that's just a subsequent deduction. I mean, if we get income, we're taxed on it. If we make a charitable contribution, we get a deduction. But that doesn't mean we don't have to pay and are subject to the income tax.",
  "Where is -­",
  "-- where is it?",
  "But that -­",
  "-- works with the income tax, too. You have casualty losses and things like that. It turns out you were subject to the tax, but you don't have to pay it, because you get a deduction. But that doesn't mean you're not subject to it in the first place.",
  "Well, the statute says --",
  "-- the statute says it's a tax on the sale, but then it goes on and says it's the first sale, and the first sale is to the distributor, and that's why the incidence of the tax is on him.",
  "But nobody -- but it's not sold -- it's not taxed twice. If it's sold to a distributor, that distributor has to pay the tax. The distributor then sells it to someone else. That someone else doesn't have to pay the tax.",
  "Counsel, did I understand your earlier discussion, about the department store, to suggest that if the tribe had the tanker truck, and they picked up the fuel and then brought it back, that, in that case, you have no objection to the tax, even though the economic incidence and effect is going to be the same?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Well, why isn't it the sale between whoever is selling it to the distributor and the distributor?",
  "But none of this -- none of this mattered to the tenth circuit, though, did it? I mean, they didn't care where the incidence was. They just went right into the balancing, right?",
  "And you think that was wrong.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Olson, you have four and a half minutes left.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "The Court will now hear argument in Gonzales v. Oregon. General Clement.",
  "What -­",
  "-- what is the closest analog you have, outside of the present case, where the Attorney General's enforcement activity has impinged upon what the State has recognized as medical practice?",
  "Well, that's the FDA. I'm talking about the Attorney General, under this statute.",
  "Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Atkinson.",
  "Well, the relationship between the States and the Federal Government has changed a little since Gibbons versus Ogden.",
  "Well, that begs the question -- if you had said \"this specific subject,\" the regulation of controlled substances, your answer would have come out the other way, which is kind of what the case is about.",
  "Well, but let's -- but the supposition is that the State legal judgment is that that's the wrong characterization, that it's legitimate medical practice to make patients feel better, and morphine does that; and so, the State can allow them to prescribe morphine to make people feel better. And I understand your position to be that that would be permissible?",
  "That could not -- that's not prohibited under the Controlled -­",
  "-- Substances Act.",
  "What does that do to the effectiveness of regulation under the Controlled Substances Act? If one State can say it's legal for doctors to prescribe morphine to make people feel better, or to prescribe steroids for bodybuilding, doesn't that undermine the uniformity of the Federal law and make enforcement impossible?",
  "Well, that may or -­",
  "-- may not be true. But focus on the particular question. If you have one State that allows the use of a drug that the Federal Government has determined is illegal, and is illegal everywhere else because other States haven't done it, how is the Federal Government supposed to enforce that prohibition?",
  "I'm trying to get at the specific enforcement point. If you have one State that allows morphine to be used legally for -­",
  "-- recreational purposes, how is the Federal Government supposed to enforce the prohibition on that elsewhere?",
  "Well, what do you do with regulation 1306, which -- the one that, of course, talks about \"legitimate medical purpose\"? That was promulgated in 1971. It wasn't directed to the Oregon statute. And yet it suggests that the Attorney General has the authority to interpret that phrase.",
  "You had a -­",
  "-- second answer?",
  "I'm sorry. You had a second answer?",
  "Well, but in 1971 Congress didn't assume the States were going to pass legislation for use of drugs to assist with suicide, either.",

  "At the time --",
  "-- at the time this statute was passed to deal with lax State treatment of opium, was opium regulated as part of medical practice in any of the States?",

  "We'll now hear argument in Lincoln Property v. Roche. Mr. Frederick.",
  "So, I take it your answer to Justice Souter is yes. In other words, if the mistake that the court made was relying on 1441(b), it was a similar mistake for you, in your opening brief, to put such weight on that language in 1441(b).",
  "Mr. Frederick, earlier you made the point that Lincoln was a proper \"real party in interest.\" I take it that's not critical to your position. Your argument would be the same if they weren't a real party in interest, wouldn't it?",
  "But if they -- if they don't have a proper defendant, they should do that?",
  "I presume, then --",
  "-- that the plaintiff loses, not that you get to have the court find the proper defendant for the plaintiff.",
  "What -- I know you contend that's not the case, but let's say there is a in-State subsidiary that's completely responsible for all the challenged actions, and the in-State plaintiff sues an -- only the out-of-State parent. What happens in that case?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Joseph.",
  "Well, you had no ­ - I mean, you had no real reason to do it. You had somebody there who accepted responsibility, in the sense that they were willing to defend on the merits, right?",
  "And it's only because you lost that you now question whether or not they should have accepted -- you're saying they shouldn't have accepted responsibility, and shouldn't have defended on the merits.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Joseph. Mr. Frederick, you have nine minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frederick. The case is submitted. [Whereupon, at 11:57 a.m., the case in the",
  "We'll hear argument next in Brown vs. Sanders. Ms. Kirkland, proceed, please.",
  "Counsel, I was confused by your answer to Justice O'Connor's question. Do you think the -- we should review the California Supreme Court's harmless-error analysis, or should we undertake a Brecht analysis?",
  "Assuming you'd -- we'd --",
  "-- you lose on the first question.",
  "Yes.",
  "I would have thought that that might have collapsed into the Brecht analysis.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Kirkland. Ms. Rivkind.",
  "Why is --",
  "But the -- but the evidence supporting them was perfectly admissible. So, the jury could consider that evidence and come to the same conclusion; it's just the label that seems to be giving you the most concern.",
  "Well, didn't the California Supreme Court answer that in --",
  "-- its Bacigalupo --",
  "-- decision, where, as I read it, it says juries don't give special circumstances any extra weight in considering all the variety of factors listed in the statute?",
  "But it --",
  "-- but it's only invalid as an eligibility factor. It's not invalid as a selection factor.",
  "In this case.",

  "What do you do with a public university professor, who -- is fired for the content of his lectures? Certainly, in the course of his employment, that's what he's paid to do. That has no first-amendment protection?",
  "\"Should not be entitled, presumptively, to first-amendment protection,\" what does that mean? That there might be first amendment protection, in light of the particular context - -",
  "-- of the speech?",
  "I would have thought you might have argued that it's speech paid for by the Government, that's what they pay him for, it's their speech; and so, there's no first-amendment issue at all.",
  "Thank you - -",
  "-- Ms. Lee. Mr. Himmelfarb.",
  "And it's going to be clear that that's violating your job, and it has an adverse impact on your job-related duties, because you're going public, instead of going through the channels.",
  "How comfortable are you that this line you're trying to draw is one that's going to be workable in practice? I mean, suppose the employee writes a memo, and the boss comes and says, \"If you don't promise me you're not going to talk about this publicly, you're fired.\" And he says, \"Well, I'm not going to promise that.\" And so, he's fired. Now, is that internal, or is that external?",
  "Right.",
  "That's - -",
  "-- required by his job. But \"promise that he's not going to talk about it\" is not required by his job. And this case, kind of, raises the question, because the only reason it's squarely presented on the memo is because the Court didn't reach the Brady disclosure or the talk to the bar association that were related to the memo.",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb. Ms. Robin-Vergeer.",
  "But in Justice - -",
  "-- in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, if the employee filed a lawsuit claiming a violation of his first-amendment rights, you would say that could not be thrown out, on summary judgment, on the ground that the speech was within the scope of his employment.",
  "No.",
  "Well, that would - -",
  "-- be a dispute of fact, so it probably wouldn't -- so it wouldn't be thrown at summary judgment at all.",
  "Why doesn't - -",
  "-- why doesn't Rust answer this question? I mean, there, it was really -- this issue was just outsourced by the Government. They paid for the speech there, and we said that if you pay the piper, you get to call the tune. And this is just an insourced -- the same question.",
  "He was writing a memo about why the case should be dismissed. Wasn't - -",
  "-- that part of his job?",
  "Well, why is that? In the -- in your hypothetical, the doctor is -- it's not his job to challenge the restriction on the Government grant, but that's what he's doing, so that's not part of his job. Here, it's part of Ceballos's job to explain why the case should be dismissed, and that's what he wrote in his memo.",
  "What do you do with your friend's response to that, that in Connick the Court characterized Givhan as involving a case of a citizen complaining about a particular practice?",
  "Do you think he should have lost under the Pickering balance, in that case, if he went public right away?",
  "But Government misconduct -- if I get a memo from a law clerk that says, \"Justice So-and-So's jurisprudence is wacky,\" that goes to --",
  "-- that goes to Government misconduct, under your theory, right? And I fire them, because I think that's not appropriate to put in a memo.",
  "They have a first- amendment claim, right?",
  "Well, they disagree with it. They think it's -- whatever -- unprincipled, wrong. They write me a memo, and I say, \"Don't write me a memo like that.\" And they write me another one, and then I fire them.",
  "And they think it's Government misconduct because of the way cases are decided, and that they have a first amendment interest. What could be more important than how the Court decides cases? And that violates their first-amendment rights.",
  "But there was - -",
  "-- a dispute about that in this case, too. I mean, it -- under the supervisor's view, it may come down to simply whether there were tire tracks or tire rim tracks. And that's not as serious, in one view, as your client thinks it's serious.",
  "Some of them - -",
  "-- in fact, don't cover disclosures that are job related. If it's the employee's job to blow the whistle on this type of thing, it's usually not covered by a whistleblower statute.",

  "-- thinking of the Federal law, where the idea is, if it's part of your job, you have the normal civil-service job protections if you're being retaliated or discriminated against for doing your job, so you don't get the extra protections of the whistleblower law. The only people who get it are the people who -- it is not part of their job.",
  "Yeah. Thank you, Ms. Robin-Vergeer.",
  "Ms. Lee, you have one minute left.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Lee. The case is submitted. [Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the",
  "We'll now hear argument, United States v. Olson. Ms. Maynard.",
  "Well, I mean, that's kind of a $64,000 question here. Give me an example where you think there's no private-person analog.",
  "Right.",
  "Isn't there always a private -- I mean, we're talking about tort law -- isn't there always a private analog, which is, you know, exercising reasonable care under the circumstances toward people to whom you owe some duty, and you just apply that general principle?",
  "Well, all right, so if it's a police officer stopping somebody on a highway, it's the same as a private security guard stopping somebody at a -- you know, the driveway at a plant or something.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Maynard. Mr. Cotter.",
  "In the -- in the face of a district court opinion that applied the Good Samaritan statute and threw the case out because no allegation could be made to come within the Good Samaritan statute. So, it seems pretty clear that they're doing something quite different from what you're suggesting.",
  "But, doesn't that approach -- it doesn't make any sense, because you're only looking at half of the equation. Presumably, if you have a special set of principles for governmental actors, they include immunities and defenses and all that. And you just want the benefit of the liability, but you don't want, I take it, the immunities and defenses that go along with it.",
  "Well, doesn't that make it a contract case? If you're talking about the party who's contracted with, say, a private inspector -- I mean, I have a contract, somebody comes and inspects the house for termites, and I assume, if they don't do a good job and the house is damaged, they're liable. But that's under contract, and this is a question of tort liability.",
  "Well, but only -- presumably, only if they meet the requirements of the Good Samaritan law.",
  "Which -- they would have to show that there was an increase in the risk of harm, which I think it would not be true in your hypothetical, or that there was a duty owed to the third party -- the scaffolding inspector is presumably hired by the contractor, not by the employees -- or there was reliance.",
  "So, we're just debating now whether or not you've satisfied the requirements of the Good Samaritan statute.",
  "Did you argue -- I mean, you lost in the district court on the Good Samaritan statute.",
  "On your appeal, did you argue that that was wrong?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cotter. Ms. Maynard, you have five minutes left.",
  "You consider affidavits on a motion to dismiss?",
  "But what - -",
  "-- what argument do you have to avoid a remand for consideration of liability under the Good Samaritan law?",
  "But they didn't have a chance to argue that before the court of appeals, right?",
  "But court of appeals didn't decide that.",
  "But you think there is a private-party analog.",
  "But we didn't bring cert on that question.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Maynard. The case is submitted. [Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the",
  "We'll hear argument next in Central Virginia Community College versus Katz. Mr. Thro.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Lewis.",
  "Well, it's the same problem in the patent area, isn't it? And yet, in the Florida Prepaid cases, we've enforced the sovereign immunity with respect to patent proceedings.",
  "Your waiver argument is -­ is it under 106(b) or 106(c)? It's beyond both of those, isn't it?",
  "That's an abrogation, that's not -­",
  "-- a waiver.",
  "Well, my question would be, How can you argue in favor of waiver when you have a statute with a much more limited waiver, the limits in 106(b) and 106(c), and you're saying, \"Well, they waived it much more broadly\"? It would seem to me that the most you can argue is that there was a waiver under 106(b) or 106(c), but that doesn't get rid of the whole case.",
  "How do we interpret the statute to establish that Congress intended the States to waive their immunity with the filing of the claim? I don't see that anywhere in the statute.",
  "You're arguing that by filing the claim, the State has waived all of its immunity, but I don't see where in the statute it imposes that kind of waiver upon States. I see where they abrogate the immunity, but that's different than saying that there's a waiver. Is your argument that just because they abrogated immunity, and it turned out they didn't -- may or may not have that authority, they necessarily imposed a waiver?",
  "Okay. Well, then where is the waiver of sovereign immunity in this statute?",
  "But I thought -- you're not relying on 106(b) and 106(c).",
  "So, where is the waiver of immunity on which you're relying?",
  "But you have no argument that Congress imposed a waiver.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, how do you -- how do you have an informed waiver if the argument is over the authority to abrogate? In other words, the Federal Government is saying, under your theory, that we're abrogating your immunity. And the State's saying, \"You don't have that authority.\" And how do you get an informed waiver, simply because the State participates in a bankruptcy proceeding, on the basis of the legal theory that they're asserting here today, that Congress doesn't have the authority to abrogate the immunity?",
  "I understand that. But your theory, as I read in your brief, as an alternative argument, is that there was a -­",
  "-- waiver. The State waived its immunity by participating through -- in the -­",
  "-- bankruptcy proceeding. How is there an informed waiver if the argument is over the authority to abrogate?",
  "Yes, but all the -- all the statute does is abrogate.",
  "In 106(a). It's -­",
  "-- an attempt to -­",
  "-- abrogate.",
  "And if it turns out that Congress doesn't have that authority, I don't see how you can say the State has made an informed waiver, when their theory is, \"Guess what? You don't have that authority to abrogate.\"",
  "I think we're -- I think it's safe.",
  "It's a trick they play on new Chief Justices all the time.",
  "We're even -- yeah, we're even more in the dark now than before.",
  "Well, to what extent was this argument raised below, I guess is a -­",
  "So, the -- so, the long and short of it is, for good and sufficient reasons you did not make the same waiver below that you're making here today.",

  "We'll hear argument first today in Volvo Trucks North America versus Reeder-Simco GMC. Mr. Englert.",
  "You concede, though, don't you, Mr. Englert, that the language of the statute covers the conduct here?",
  "Well, you have a person who's engaged in commerce, who's discriminating in the price that they offer to different purchasers. Now, I know your argument about the structure, but the actual language does seem to encompass the activity.",
  "Well, just to -­",

  "Thank you. Mr. Hungar.",

  "What do you do with the policy argument -- at, sort of, the level of the forest, rather than the trees -- that the antitrust laws are designed to prefer competition in interbrand -- in the interbrand market, rather than intrabrand, and that, therefore, to the extent there's ambiguity, that supports an interpretation that allows the manufacturer to strengthen his interbrand position, as opposed to protect the intrabrand position?",
  "Your argument that focuses on the dealer's profits, I guess, doesn't depend upon you losing those sales at all. I mean, if you -- you had made all the sales, but you still thought you should have gotten a bigger discount that would have allowed you to make more money, you'd have the same argument, right?",
  "Oh, no, you just go back and look again, 7 months or a year down the road, and if somebody else was getting a bigger discount -- if you had gotten the bigger discount, you would have made more money on those sales, and then you would have had more capital, and you'd be able to be a dealer for a longer time.",

  "But the problem there is still the same. Whatever it is that gave rise to the motion to dismiss as a sanction -- the misconduct by counsel -- you're still addressing that same problem.

  "She's consenting. It's an intrusion, in the one case, on the conversation; in the other case, on the home. In the telephone case, it's recognized, in the law, the consent of one party subjects the other to having the conversation monitored. In this case, the consent of one party subjects the other party to the search.",

  "I was just going to say, it just reflects the expectation of privacy. And when you do live with someone else, you compromise your individual privacy interest to that extent.

Why is it -- why do you not compromise the expectation to the extent of giving the other person the right to consent?",
  "Well, that's not a fair reading of Rodriguez. There, it was, \"Come on in, he's asleep.\" It was quite clear that if he were awake, he was going to say, \"Don't come in.\"",
  "When you talk about that tie, your approach applies in the case -- a dormitory, you have a common room, there are ten rooms off of it, nine people say, \"Sure, come on in and search,\" and the one person says, \"No.\" That one person exercises a veto over a search of the common area?",

  "When you talk about the text, though -- and I understand that the \"may\" language here has been read by the Court in very different ways, depending upon the statute -- but you have a statute that literally alternates sentences between \"shall/may,\" \"shall/may,\" and it seems to me that if your rule is closer to \"shall\" than \"may,\" it seems that it was an odd choice of words for Congress to employ.",
  "Well, but that's a general -- you're -- you seem to be arguing more generally for the British rule, rather than the American rule. And I read our decision in Fogerty to say that when we're confronted with language like this, \"may,\" you don't assume that Congress intended to overrule the basic American rule and apply the British one.",

  "I thought a comparative advantage of the Solicitor General's approach, and, by the same token, of the Petitioner's contrary approach, is that it avoids a lot of litigation over a collateral issue, like which court you ought to be in. As soon as you get into a multifactor analysis, then you get briefs on both sides arguing their factors and the other side's factors, and the judge has to decide. If there's a presumption that applies in most cases, you don't waste time over jurisdictional squabbles like this.",

I mean, if our contract had a liquidated damages clause -- if you didn’t go ahead and murder somebody, you’d owe me $1,000 -- we don’t say, well, that part is enforceable even if the contract as a whole is not enforceable. We treat it as a whole. Because the subject matter of the contract is illegal ab initio, the whole contract is -- is void and illegal.",
  "Do we usually -- do we usually ask arbitrators to enforce broader notions of public policy as opposed to the specific agreements of the party? In other words, if the reason the contract is void or voidable has to do with broad State public policy, do we -- what -- what’s this -- the best you case you have for the notion that arbitrators enforce those types of constraints as opposed to figuring out what the parties agreed to?",
  "Oh, no, that’s not true. There may be dozens of other subsidiary issues apart from illegality. They may say, well, once you determine that it’s legal, we think that we’re entitled to these damages or those damages or -- or the rate should be this or that. Just because there’s a threshold issue doesn’t mean there aren’t other issues that an arbitrator might decide.",

And it’s just left to the creativity of the lawyer in any given case to explain why a particular contract is contrary to public policy. And you would allow that to be shifted from the arbitrators to court presumably based simply on an allegation, well, the contract is void, it’s against public policy.",
  "But there’s no -- but -- but why do you assume that that underlying illegality taints the arbitration clause? I mean, take the arbitration clause that you would find in a perfectly normal contract, and if you put it in the -- the contract of the sort that you’re hypothesizing, I don’t see why this underlying substance of the contract taints the enforceability of the arbitration clause.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Bland. Mr. Landau, you have 4-and-a-half minutes remaining.",
  "But State law -- the supposition is that State law provides that in this case, the usury context, whatever, you do not have a contract. That’s the difference between void ab initio and voidable.",

  "Thank you, Mr. Pincus. Mr. Hungar, we'll hear from you.",
  "Does the Government have -- I'd like to ask you the same question Justice Stevens asked Mr. Pincus about the broader question. Much of the economic literature on which you rely sort of sweeps aside the particular question today because it rejects the notion of tying as a problem in the first place. But does the Government have a position on that? Assuming there's monopoly power in the tying product, the Government's position is that that still presents an antitrust problem?",
  "This is not part of a broader approach to get rid of the tying issue altogether, is it?",
  "And -- and what is the Government's position on the latter question?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hungar. Ms. Sullivan.",
  "But this in -- as a practical matter, this screen is really the heavy lifting in the antitrust cases. This is where you need all the economic studies, you have the discovery, the experts. This is what costs a lot of money and shifts a lot of the litigation burden on the other side if you have a presumption.",
  "If your -- if your arguments are right, isn't that going to typically be the case? In which case, why do you need a presumption at all?",
  "Are you conceding that the presumption makes no sense outside of the requirements metering context?",
  "Well, didn't they do that? Didn't they do that in the Patent Misuse Reform Act?",
  "But isn't it logically inconsistent for Congress --",
  "-- to say that a patent is insufficient evidence of market power in the misuse context and then just turn around and say, but if you're having a straight lawsuit under antitrust, it is sufficient as a presumption?",
  "So it gets back to how important you think and how -- whether it's true or not that the market power is the heavy lifting, as far as all these screens go.",
  "But isn't -- it's in fact easier for you here. You can go down to the Patent Office and see what they've distinguished as -- the sense in which their product is an innovation and why it's not just like the other products that might be available that you could use.",

  "Am I right in reading your briefs that you don't object to a pre-enforcement challenge to the bypass procedure itself brought by physicians, for example?",
  "And I gather that the debate on the evidence and the circumstances that might arise in that case would be quite similar to the debate in the present context. In other words, there would be the same discussion between the different physicians about what emergencies arise and in what circumstances and whether that creates a problem and whether you can get to the courts in time and so on. It would be the same underlying sort of evidence that we have here, right?",
  "It would be a finding that the bypass procedure is inadequate which doesn't necessarily implicate the general notification provisions.",
  "Thank you, General. General Clement, we'll hear now from you.",
  "Thank you, General. Ms. Dalven, we'll hear now from you.",
  "Counsel, if your objection goes to the adequacy of the bypass procedure, what is wrong with a pre-enforcement challenge by physicians, presumably with standing, challenging the bypass procedure? Why should you be able to challenge the act as a whole if your objection is so narrowly focused?",
  "But it's a problem that arises only in the emergency situations.",
  "So bring in a pre-enforcement challenge concerning compliance with the act in emergency situations. Why does that even implicate the vast majority of the cases that don't create emergency situations?",
  "This case doesn't involve an emergency situation. This is a facial challenge. There is no case at issue at all.",
  "That's because the Court explained the inadequacies it identified were present in the large fraction of cases. We don't know if that's true here.",
  "Well, but that would be litigated in a pre-enforcement, as-applied challenge. I mean, you don't assume -- the fact that this narrower focused proceeding is going to be -­ could be brought doesn't mean -- doesn't answer the question of how it's going to come out. But presumably the litigation would be very similar to what we've seen in this case, in which a doctor is saying, well, you do need an immediate medical exception. Others are saying the judicial bypass adequately addresses the concerns. But it would be focused on the provision that is causing you concern rather than the statute as a whole.",
  "Your complaint asked for a preliminary and permanent injunction against the act.",
  "Well, maybe they assumed that the medical health exception of the sort you're arguing for is not constitutionally required and that's what would be litigated in a narrow focused challenge on the adequacy or inadequacy of a bypass procedure. Maybe they assumed it would follow the Salerno precedent, and they didn't have to worry about severing in light of particular unconstitutional applications.",
  "Do you think the statute, putting aside the medical emergency issue under our precedence, is the parental notification aspect of the statute constitutional?",

Right? for a -- an alleged prohibited personnel practice -- and, I think, an unconstitutional personnel action would be a prohibited personnel practice under the statute. The remedy for that is to complain to the Office of Special Counsel. Now, if the Office of Special Counsel seeks corrective action with the Merit Systems Protection Board and the MSPB issues a decision unfavorable to the employee, then the employee, under the terms of the CSRA itself, can seek judicial review of the MSPB’s decision in the Federal Circuit.

In other words, the -- the trial judge made a credibility determination that that was the reason, the person rolled her eyes, and you’re saying, in light of the other explanations, you think the prosecutor is just making that up.",
  "So you’re saying you don’t believe it. You think there’s a different reason, and the rolling the eyes is not the real reason. And we have a factual determination that the judge believes that that’s the reason or a reason. And under the -- the statute, at least that -- that’s -- that either has to be shown to be unreasonable or, under the State’s reason, that’s presumed to be correct, and you have to show it by clear and convincing evidence.",

  "Maybe I’m -- what -- what is the inference you try to draw from the treatment of juror 19? That the prosecutor wants to -- was striking people on the basis of their race or that she had better reasons for 19 than 16?",

It's not going to affect how the profits are distributed. It's still going to be the same whether it's Equilon gas or Texaco and Shell. Why does the joint venture lose the authority to set the price of its product?",
  "I concede that it would have been perfectly legal for them to do that if they called all of their gasoline Equilon gasoline because they owned all the gas and the profits are going to be distributed to the owner the same way whether they call them Texaco or Shell. Why is it suddenly different because they put different labels on the -- keep different labels on the gasoline?",
  "I don't understand that. I mean, now you're backing away from your concession. If you have a lawful joint venture that's marketing a product, the joint venture has to be able to set the price of the product.",
  "No. No, if it's -- if it's a lawful joint venture and it's selling gasoline -- there's no retaining of prior brands -- the joint venture sets the price. And if the -- and all those people you said suffered when Equilon did this, those same number of people would have suffered if they're selling Equilon gasoline at a price determined by the joint venture. It seems to me a very artificial hook that you're trying to hang your case on, which is they retained for presumably legitimate brand competition reasons their separate brands, but that was the decision of the joint venture. And again, the joint venture has to be able to price its product whether it's sold as Equilon or whether it's sold as Texaco or Shell under -- under the same -- same joint venture.",

  "We are supposed to look at all of the evidence, the new evidence and the old evidence, and determine simply whether or not it would be unreasonable for any juror to vote to convict on the basis of all of that evidence. Is that right?",
  "So, in other words, no reasonable juror -- no -- no juror could reasonably vote to convict. In other words, if we look at this evidence and think that -- and again, we're not reviewing the prior jury's evidence. If we look at this and say, maybe a jury would come out 10 to 2 in favor of acquittal, if we think that would be reasonable, then you lose. Right?",

Your question -- your -- your case of whether someone has been discharged or not just goes to whether there's been a violation.",
  "But in City of -- in City of Kenosha, of course, the Court went beyond the jurisdictional grant and it said that the definition of the term person in 1983 raised a jurisdictional question.",
  "But -- but maybe -- but that doesn't sound like a reasonable agreement. All you -- so you file one sentence saying this person violated title VII. Are you impliedly including all of the allegations of what constitutes a violation of title VII because if you didn't allege every particular element, it wouldn't be a violation of title VII? That's not how pleading works.",
  "That's true in a lot of areas. I think of admiralty. If there's an issue of admiralty jurisdiction that questions whether an injury is caused by a vessel in navigable water, you often have extended litigation over that jurisdictional question.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Schwartz. Now Mr. Joseffer.",
  "Interpreted section -- the use of the word person in section 1983.",
  "So City of Kenosha was just kind of a silly waste of time.",
  "1331 was applicable there as well. Right?",
  "I'm sorry. What have juries been determining?",
  "Right.",
  "But that's the -- that's a consequence of a determination that it's jurisdictional in any case. Right?",
  "I mean, if you had a case where you didn't dispute that the issue was jurisdictional and there had been a jury trial on the pendant State law claims, we'd still have to throw that out. Right?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Joseffer. Mr. Prendergast, we'll now hear from you.",
  "What other aspects of title VII do you think are jurisdictional?",
  "What's -- what's wrong with the rule? We're not dealing with article III here. What's wrong with the rule that if Congress doesn't put it in the jurisdictional section, it's not jurisdictional?",
  "It would make the future cases a lot easier to decide.",
  "Well, it's --",
  "Does it make a difference on the -- the -- does the categorization make a difference on the relevant time of the inquiry for the 15 employees? You have 16 employees when the discrimination takes place. By the time the lawsuit is filed, you've only got 14. Does it matter whether that's called jurisdiction or going to the merits?",
  "Even -- even if it's a question of jurisdiction.",

  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips, we'll hear from you.",
  "But --",
  "But the whole point -- at least I understand -- of Justice Breyer's question is that you have taken a step to make it more difficult for the mail to get through by insisting that the person be there to sign for it, and it's obviously more likely than not he's not going to be there. And if you had just used regular mail and dropped it off, I think more likely he would have gotten it.",
  "No. The purpose of certified mail is to make sure you know if it didn't get to the person. And you knew that and then you didn't do anything about it.",
  "Well, counsel, one thing you did -- your client did was provide notice by publication in a local newspaper.",
  "Why do you bother doing that?",
  "You don't -- you don't rely on that as in any way discharging your constitutional obligation to provide notice to the -- to the homeowner.",
  "But your --",
  "But your -- your position is, though, when you get the certified letter returned is you have no obligation to do anything further.",
  "Oh, you would get the whole -- you'd just get a little bit less because the cost of notice is borne by the purchaser and if they have to do a Google search or use one of these other services, it's going to add a little bit more to their cost, and you're just going to get a little bit less. It's not going to interfere with the administration of the program.",
  "For getting the property --",
  "-- for getting the property in this case, we're at 20 percent of its market value. It's -- it's worth another $500 to you.",
  "No, no, no. That's -- Mr. Phillips, property bought at -- at delinquent tax sales is usually bought at far less than its market value.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Feldman.",
  "Of course, none of this would have been sufficient if we were talking about your -- your client, the IRS. They do far more extensive effort to find the individual before they sell property for delinquent taxes.",
  "Well, which way is that -- I mean, the fact that he tried six times and he wasn't there should have told the State this isn't working.",
  "Well, but your position is they don't have to do anything.",
  "Well, Mullane said that we look to what a person who really wanted to find the person would do. A person who really wanted to find Mr. Jones and got the certified letter back saying, nobody is claiming this, would have done something more.",
  "Which -- which you agree does no good at all. Right?",
  "When is the last time you read legal notices in a newspaper?",
  "Have you ever done it?",
  "No.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Kirkpatrick, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "With -- with respect to the fact that your client did not alert the State to its change of address, is there anything in the record about whether that his separation was permanent or is that a gradual thing? I mean, did he not know if this was a permanent change of address or what?",
  "You may finish.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in No. 04-1581, Wisconsin Right to Life, Incorporated v. Federal Election Commission. Mr. Bopp.",
  "I thought your point was that it was not an issue after the election.",
  "Were you taking a position on this issue prior to the election time frame?",
  "Had you taken out advertisements prior to that time frame?",
  "Justice Souter.",
  "Does the -- does the FEC draw -- distinguish between sham ads and genuine issue ads?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Bopp. General Clement, we'll hear now from you.",
  "In McConnell against FEC, you stood there and told us that this was a facial challenge and that as-applied challenges could be brought in the future. This is an as-applied challenge and now you're telling us that it's already been decided. It's a classic bait and switch.",
  "Is there any other case that you can cite where we've upheld a facial challenge and then later said that an as-applied challenge was barred by our ruling on the facial challenge?",
  "Like Justice Stevens, I think that's a yes or no.",
  "What --",
  "Well, that's a very different question. That's interpreting the scope of Congress's power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The issue is whether it's limited to the constitutional violations or sweeps more broadly. If you conclude that it sweeps more broadly, it's not suggesting that an as-applied challenge can be brought by someone who's covered by the broader sweep. That's a very different question. Is there any First Amendment case where we've said this is facially valid and then said as-applied challenges can't be brought?",
  "Well, it would be like in any of those cases where you have a -- a broad prohibition and you say, yes, there may be situations where it's unconstitutional, but the statute is valid on its face. And then someone comes in and says, well, my situation is one where it's unconstitutional. We've never said, well, it's too bad because it's valid on its face, have we?",
  "So let's say you had an organization that every month of every year it took out an ad the first week of every month, and it said the same thing and it said, contact your Senators. This issue is important to us. And they do that every month. All of a sudden, their ad's nature changes because an election is -- happens to be coming up and it's illegal the month before the election, even though it was clearly something that they did without regard to the election.",
  "If we want to place an ad in October, the solution is to place an ad November through September, and then we're okay. And the only reason we're going to do it November through September is so we can do it in October?",
  "That's a pretty broad definition of a sham.",
  "But on an issue like this, the filibuster, it's the Senators who are doing it, and their ad referred to not only the Senator who was up for election, but the one who was not.",
  "That may be because the people who were doing the filibuster were the Senators. It's not -- it's not a surprising thing to link the Senators to that issue.",
  "The fact that it mentions both -- the fact that it mentions both Senators strongly suggests to me that it's concerned about the issue because one of the Senators wasn't up for election.",
  "Well, if you're trying to influence the Senators who are presumably or possibly in their home State during a recess, that's perfect timing to influence the Senators who are the ones engaging in the filibuster --",
  "-- without regard to whether they're running for election or not.",
  "I've lost track of it. Your -- your answer to Justice Breyer's hypothetical about Bread for the City and the hurricane and all that is that that would be an illegal ad?",
  "But both of those examples, of course, are quantities, and once you -- I think it was Holmes who said, once you admit the necessity of drawing a line, you know, you can always find something on one side or the other. It's quite different between $1,000 and $2,000 or 100 feet and 75 feet and advocacy with respect to an election and advocacy with respect to an issue. It's an entirely different quality of a distinction, it seems to me.",

  "But one reason you might want to adopt a narrower reading, though, is, we're dealing here with the preemption provision. It's one thing to say that, when you're talking about the SEC's enforcement powers, you adopt a broad reading; but it's quite another thing, when you're talking about displacing State law, that you would necessarily adopt the same broad reading.",
  "But there's a lot of - - I think our cases establish that a phrase like \"in connection with\" carries with it a lot of ambiguity. You don't know exactly how rigorous the connection has to be. I mean, a auto accident by a broker who's leaving his office -- he wouldn't be in the office if he weren't buying and selling securities. I mean, is that auto accident \"in connection with the purchase and sales of securities\"? No. And yet, you know, theoretically it could be. It's a -- there's a lot of ambiguity in determining how much breadth to give that phrase.",

It's \"in connection with a purchase or sale,\" maybe not of the holder's securities. But it's certainly -- the holder's claim wouldn't exist, but for purchases and sales that caused the price to go up.",
  "But what your clients want to do is cash in on the fraud. They don't -- their claim is that they didn't get to sell the stock at an inflated price to somebody who didn't know about the fraud. That's the damages that they want to collect. And that seems to be an odd claim to recognize.",

  "Mr. Dreeben, I understood you to say a short while ago that if it were executed before the triggering event, it would be invalid because there was no probable cause.",
  "No, you don't because then the warrant shouldn't have issued.",
  "Well, but the facts of the triggering event are not always going to be so clean, and in many cases they're going to require an exercise of judgment by the officer. I mean, if the triggering event is a, you know, delivery of a bale of marijuana or something and they see a big box coming in, they're going to have say, well, is that what they're talking about or is -- you know, is that it. And the point is under the Fourth Amendment that those types of judgments are supposed to be made by the magistrate and not by the officers on the scene.",
  "No, but there's no -- there's no probable cause until the triggering event. When -- when the triggering event takes place, you've eliminated the 16 others and you do know that it's -- it's -- there's probable cause. How is that different from this case?",
  "Well, that's not true. Maybe the -- maybe the person decides he won't accept it.",
  "So there are a lot more things than just the delivery. It's not entirely controlled by you.",
  "Could you elaborate just a little bit for me on why you think this case is different from Justice Scalia's hypothetical with the 17 people? Because my concern is there -- here you say once the triggering event takes place, then you do -- the probable cause comes to fruition or whatever. How is that different than his hypothetical?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Reichel.",
  "What else is there in this joined at the hip particularity requirement? The number of officers? Which officers, FBI agents or DEA or something else? I mean, you're -- you're adding to the text of the amendment, and I just wonder what else is added under your view.",
  "No. That's your argument. I'm just saying what else is joined at -- at the hip besides time. You say they don't say time. They say persons to be seized and place to be searched, and you say inherent in that is time. Well, what else is inherent in there?",
  "That's time. Is there anything else that's not written there that is part of that particularity requirement?",
  "Well, there's all sorts of, as Mr. Dreeben explained, reasonableness. It doesn't say how you enter the house, but if you suddenly go in with a -- with a tank, we might find that unreasonable. But that's not something that has to be spelled out particularly under the terms of the Fourth Amendment.",
  "It doesn't have to be spelled out in the warrant itself.",

  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Rapanos v. United States and Carabell v. the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Mr. Hopper.",
  "How do you -- how do you define a tributary?",
  "So what's your definition?",
  "I know what you object to, and I know that you think your client isn't covered. But I don't know what test you would have us adopt for what constitutes a tributary.",
  "Okay, but we still don't know what you're excluding. I mean, the Missouri is a tributary of the Mississippi, but I assume it's still covered.",
  "But if -- but your -- but your answer earlier to Justice Souter's earlier question was that if you dump the pollutants anywhere and they make their way to the navigable water, you're covered. Right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stoepker.",
  "Did we talk about a hydrological connection in Riverside Bayview?",
  "Can I get back to the question earlier? What is a hydrological connection? Is it enough if the water seeps through the ground and underground is connected with the navigable water, or does there have to be a ditch or -- or a culvert that you can see the water flowing through?",
  "Yes?",
  "Counsel, what -- what is the test that you would have us adopt for a significant nexus?",
  "By that, you mean either a ditch or underground seepage?",
  "Okay. So there has -- there has to be any -- and any hydrological connection works.",
  "Mr. Hopper won't like that, but for --",
  "You may respond briefly.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "General Clement.",
  "How do you define tributary?",
  "The tributary -- you say they're adjacent to a nonnavigable tributary. That's a -- a culvert, a ditch. Right?",
  "But in Rapanos' case.",
  "What about -- what about the other -- the other sites?",
  "But your argument assumes that the ditches that go to the other two sites are also tributaries.",
  "Well -- well, as you mention that, you cited subsection (7), and there's a -- what struck me anyway as a very interesting provision in there. It covers wetlands adjacent to waters other than waters that are themselves wetlands. Now, everything that you've said today and in your brief would lead me to think you would contend that wetlands that are adjacent to wetlands ought to be covered as well, and yet, the regulation leaves them out. And I want to know why do you think the regulation leaves those wetlands out.",
  "To me it -- it suggests that even the Corps recognized that at some point you've got to say stop because logically any drop of water anywhere is going to have some sort of connection through drainage. And they're -- they're stopping there, and I wonder if we ought to take that same instinct that -- that you see in subsection (7) and apply it to your definition of tributary and say, at some point, the definition of tributary has to have an end. Otherwise, you're going to go and reach too far, beyond what Congress reasonably intended.",
  "But that's true of the wetland that is adjacent to the wetland that is adjacent to the tributary, and yet, the Corps says we're not going to reach the wetland that is adjacent to another wetland.",
  "Well, but we didn't come up with the idea of wetlands next to wetlands. The Corps of Engineers has it in their regulations.",
  "So what do they mean by it?",
  "What -- what is an example of an insignificant nexus under the SWANCC test?",
  "No. There's no nexus there.",
  "They're isolated. There's no nexus. The -- the notion in SWANCC of a significant nexus suggests that there are some bodies of water or puddles that are going to have a nexus, but it's not going to be significant enough. We didn't just say any nexus. It said significant nexus. So what are you leaving out to give meaning to the test that we articulated in SWANCC?",
  "So if you have a wetland, you would say a wetland with a hydrological connection to a tributary of navigable waters through one drop a year is a significant nexus to the waters of the United States?",
  "One drop.",
  "Am I right that a tributary is not a defined term in the regulations? Right?",
  "Well, that's not really fair. The Petitioners, as I understand it, both concede the discharges that make their way into the navigable waters would be covered.",
  "And if you wanted a cite for the opposite proposition, you could cite subsection (7) of the Corps' regulations where they have no interest in wetlands that happen to be adjacent to other wetlands that are adjacent to the waters of the United States. If they act in the way that you've been postulating, presumably they'd want to cover those adjacent wetlands just as much as they want to cover the wetlands that are next to the tributary, but they don't.",
  "It doesn't -- it doesn't say that. It says other than waters that are themselves wetlands. It excludes all wetlands that are adjacent to wetlands that are adjacent to waters of the United States.",
  "You -- you put a lot of weight on the tributary question in your approach by giving up the hydrological connection. Your response is you don't need a hydrological connection because it's right next to a tributary. But for those of us who are having a little trouble with the concept of tributary, you don't leave us much to fall back on.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Hopper, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "You may respond briefly.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in S. D. Warren Company versus Maine Board of Environmental Protection. Mr. Kayatta.",
  "Mr. Kayatta, if I took a drum of water out of the river and put it in the garage next to the river for 5 years, and, 5 years later, came out and poured that drum of water back into the river, is that a discharge into the river?",
  "How is it different here, where you have the dam restraining the waters for a certain period, and then it's being released later, at a subsequent time? Why --",
  "-- isn't that also a discharge?",
  "Even though it's retained in a -- what -- an impoundment pool, or whatever, behind --",
  "So, you think it's a different case if it's not a continuous motion; in other words, that the water is released -- you know, it's released on the weekends, but, during the week, it has to build up in the -- you would draw a distinction and say there's a discharge, in that case?",
  "Counsel, you don't dispute that FERC could impose the same conditions that Maine has imposed in this case, as a matter of FERC authority.",
  "Could they even impose something in the condition to your hydroelectric power license saying, \"You must comply with State water quality standards\"?",
  "So, you're concerned about conditions -- I mean, as a practical matter, in terms of how the result in this case would change things, it's a question of whether FERC has to more or less accept what the State does, or whether FERC simply considers and decides whether it wants to impose those conditions.",
  "You would rather be regulated more aggressively by FERC than by the Maine Board of Environmental Protection.",
  "Does FERC --",
  "-- as a regulator, tend to give greater priority to power considerations, as opposed to local environmental concerns?",
  "But I don't understand, linguistically, why this isn't \"putting something into the water,\" to the extent the dam holds back and restrains the water, then it \"puts back into the water\" the water that it had held back.",
  "Here's -- I'm thinking of the Hoover Dam, and it's got these huge, you know, discharge points.",
  "And every now and then they let the water come out. Isn't that a discharge?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. General Rowe?",
  "Is there a --",
  "Is there a discharge if you have a simple waterwheel in the river? Is that a discharge?",
  "Yes, so it's a old hydroelectric plant, it uses a simple waterwheel. I mean, is that -- does that fit your definition of a \"discharge\"? In other words, it restrains the water temporarily.",
  "And then it releases it again as it passes by the wheel.",
  "So, if you put a waterwheel in a flowing river, under your definition, that's a discharge into the navigable water.",
  "But that doesn't -- but that --",
  "But that doesn't matter to your analysis. It's the one post, right? I mean, if you have just sort of a foot indentation on either side, would -- the flows, in -- under your view, suddenly becomes a discharge.",
  "Well, but --",
  "-- we're trying to --",
  "-- define --",
  "-- a statutory term that's going to apply in a wide variety of cases.",
  "Well, then -- but your focus -- in response to my question about what would constitute release, you focused on the fact of impoundment, a restriction of the flow. It seems to me that the ladle analogy that the Court has made part of the law of the land is -- refutes that, because if it's hold -- you're holding it up in the ladle, that's like an impoundment. You've separated it, to that extent, from the other body, and the Court said, when you pour it back in, that's not --",
  "-- that's not a discharge of a pollutant --",
  "-- and there was no dispute that there were pollutants, so it must mean it wasn't a discharge.",
  "But you --",
  "-- you don't -- you don't value it as much as FERC does, though, do you?",
  "I mean, isn't one way to look at this -- I mean, the concern is that your constituents probably have a higher priority and a greater concern with the environmental consequences of generating power, while FERC's priority is to make sure that we have sufficient power. And you're likely to weigh these competing uses in very different ways.",
  "I'm sorry --",
  "Thank you, General Rowe. Mr. Minear.",
  "Counsel, I was --",
  "-- surprised, in a case involving a FERC license condition, that no one from FERC signed on to your brief.",

  "Do you know what FERC's --",
  "Do you know what FERC's position is --",
  "-- in this case?",
  "Well, I'm sure of that, and it involves a reconciliation of --",
  "-- competing positions. Is there anything that FERC has issued that is illuminating with respect to their view?",
  "Do you agree that a State could adopt water quality standards that would, in effect, preclude hydroelectric power in the State?",
  "Would they do --",

  "Counsel, where -- where in the record is the testimony of the FBI agents that you were referring to?",
  "Where -- where do you think it says you have to overcome the prosecution's case?",
  "It's a -- it's a factor that's considered in weighing the admissibility and relevance of the third party guilt. They don't -- you don't have to prove and rebut and overcome, as you've said a couple of times, the prosecution's case.",
  "Well, you say you don't object to the -- the Gregory standard, and the Gregory standard is the one Justice Souter just quoted, raise a reasonable inference as to his own innocence. Now, how can you tell whether it raises a reasonable inference in a vacuum without regard to the evidence on the other side? If the evidence on the other side is -- I understand you dispute it in this case, but let's say unobjectionable DNA evidence that your client was the person there, and his third party guilt evidence is it wasn't me. How can you tell whether that creates a reasonable inference or not without looking at what's on the other side?",
  "No, not at all. What you're saying is that the evidence has to be -- the admissibility of evidence has to be assessed in light of the circumstances. If your claim of innocence is, as it may be in this case, that the DNA evidence doesn't show what you think it shows, fine, that evidence comes in. If the evidence you're trying to get in is somebody in the jailhouse said he heard that somebody else did it, and the -- and you don't challenge the DNA evidence that places your client there, then maybe that doesn't create a reasonable inference, while it might in a different case, depending on the nature of the prosecution's evidence.",
  "But that's the -- that's the problem. That's why this is a special category of evidence. It's not any evidence. It's third party guilt evidence because that's evidence that any defendant could try to introduce in any case. In any case, the defendant can say somebody else did it and compile whatever kind of evidence he can get, whether it's jailhouse informants or -- or whatever, where the person who did it was often somebody who's just recently died and -- and is not there to present an alibi of his own. In every case the defendant can come up with this evidence, and so you have a special rule that's designed to deal with that. And all, it seems to me, that the State court decision is saying, when you look at the prosecution's case, is if -- if the prosecution's case makes that an -- unreasonable under the Gregory test that you agree with, the reasonable inference, if it's unreasonable to suggest that somebody else did it, doesn't mean that you're guilty. You may have all sorts of other claims that you can make, but you just don't get to present that type of evidence because of the susceptibility of prejudice and the susceptibility of fraud and all that kind of stuff.",
  "You mean on -- in your case.",
  "What do you say in -- you cited us to footnote 8 in the court's opinion, and it says that your claims do not eliminate the fact that 99.99 percent of the population, other than your client and the victim, were excluded as contributors to the DNA evidence that was found. Do you -- is -- is the court wrong in saying that?",

  "Well, why would it be -- I mean, if it meets the standard for harmless, it suggests that it didn't make a difference, would not have been likely to make a difference with the jury, and therefore it could have been excluded in the first instance.",
  "Well, isn't that exactly what the rule is designed to prevent? In other words, you have no challenge to the DNA evidence, and yet you bring up some third party guilt evidence. And your suggestion just now is, well, the jury might think maybe there's not that much to the DNA evidence.",
  "In other words, it gets them off on a detour, distracts their attention from the evidence that is before them.",

  "-- their condition is very different, in a broad range of areas. They -- you give up First Amendment rights. For example, it's typical to have a condition of parole that you don't consort with known criminals or gang members. You -- often it says you must refrain from alcohol. Sometimes they say you can't go near particular places, if they think that's going to tempt you to return to a life of crime. Those are all First Amendment rights that are sacrificed while you're on parole. Why is this any different?",

  "No, but your point was that this is the core of the Fourth Amendment, and they're taking away all of the protection and leaving it to the unbridled discretion. And that turns out to be not the case. Under the law that authorizes the procedure, the California Supreme Court interpretation is that the Fourth Amendment provides protection against harassment or arbitrary and --",

  "Why is that? Doesn't that kind of beg the question? I mean, if we say he's got the normal Fourth Amendment rights, his -- I mean, the expectation-of-privacy analysis seems to me to be totally circular.",
  "You say he doesn't have an expectation of privacy, so it's not protected. Well, if we say he does have a -- if we say it is protected, then he does have an expectation of privacy.",
  "Well, Knights involved a situation where reasonable suspicion was required, so it addressed the problem that Mr. Long has of unbridled discretion. You still had to have an articulable reasonable suspicion with respect to the individual.",
  "Why -- and why was his expectation of privacy severely diminished?",
  "Because of the very practice that's being challenged here today, right?",
  "Because he saw something -- you -- he signed something that said, \"You're subject to searches.\" Well, that's what is at issue. It seems to me that it's -- I guess I've said it before, he's -- it's begging the question to say, \"You can do this, because he has a diminished expectation of privacy.\" How far do you push this? Can you have parolees come in and take a lie-detector test every week? Do they have -- do they have diminished expectation with respect to their Fifth Amendment rights?",

  "One that requires the court to raise it sua sponte, even if not raised by the State, correct?",
  "Well, it wouldn't --",
  "-- be an abuse of --",
  "It wouldn't be an abuse of discretion for him to suggest an amendment if he's got the opportunity to rule on the amendment later on. And then presumably the ruling would be reviewed for abuse of discretion.",
  "Well, then why doesn't that same standard apply to the decision of the Court to raise it sua sponte?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kise.",
  "Would it -- would it always be an abuse of discretion for the District Court to do this if the State wanted to reach the merits?",
  "There's no question of -- put aside a sandbagging case, there's no question of sandbagging, and that the -- the State just wants to litigate on the merits rather than on the statute of limitations.",

  "You were the Petitioner.",
  "You were -- you were the Petitioner.",
  "Well, if you're filing a petition, you have to have some expectation that you might end up here.",
  "So you think you're -- you're entitled to 100 percent under Arkansas law, but -- and I take it, that would be without regard to what the Federal law required. The Arkansas law can go beyond -- just looking at the assignment provision, beyond what the Federal law requires you do as a condition of participation in Medicaid. Correct?",
  "Well, if we disagree with you on that -- in other words, you're saying we don't even have to reach the anti-lien provision question. If we think the Medicaid condition only goes to the extent payments for medical care, then you would lose without regard to the anti-lien provision?",
  "Arkansas law, as you understand it --",
  "-- requires a -- a full -- full assignment of any expenses the State -- or full recovery of any expenses the State has incurred. It's not -- it's a debate whether Medicaid law requires that. And what you're saying is if we think the Medicaid law does not require it, you would lose without regard to any consideration of the anti-lien provision?",
  "Well, that's one of the issues, and I'm trying to understand. The Respondent's position is that the Arkansas law goes beyond what the Medicaid assignment provisions require. And I want your position on whether or not, if that's right, again without regard to the anti-lien provision, that you would lose. It seems to me that you can -- Arkansas can go beyond what the Medicaid law requires for reimbursement, if it wants.",
  "Okay. So if we read the Medicaid statute to require something less than what your position is here, then you lose.",
  "Okay. That's without regard to the anti-lien provision, or is it because of the anti-lien provision?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Millett.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Millett.",
  "Mr. Blair.",
  "And the Federal statute provides you, you think, with a defense to the State law claim.",
  "Why -- why was there Federal jurisdiction in this case in the first place?",
  "So -- so your view of jurisdiction depends upon the Federal defense.",
  "Is that -- and which of our cases say that a Federal defense supports Federal jurisdiction?",
  "Allows you to come into court if the claim that would have been brought against you would have been brought in Federal court, and the claim that would have been brought against you would have been under Arkansas law.",
  "Sounds like a defense.",
  "It still sounds like a defense to me, counsel, and I think it may make a difference if your argument relies on the anti-lien provision as a defense or perhaps relies on the -- the assignment provisions in the Medicaid statute. That's why I'm just trying to focus on whether it's the assignment provisions that limit what Arkansas can do as a matter of its own law, or if it's the anti-lien provision as a defense.",
  "Is there any reason that the Federal law would have to act as a limitation on the State law? In other words, if we read the -- the Federal law your way, is there any reason it would frustrate the Federal purposes for the State to say, well, we want to get all of the medical expenses? We don't just want to get the proportionate share of the recovery. That -- that's enough for the Feds, but we are also out State money and we want that State money. They can go further, can't they?",

  "Counsel, with respect to the contribution limits, what -- what makes this case different from the -- the Shrink PAC case from a few years ago?",
  "So you think it -- you think it's the dollar amounts that are involved?",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Sorrell.",
  "Counsel --",
  "Counsel, you -- you say in your brief -- I'm reading from page 13 -- that the record convincingly shows that the ties among donor groups and elected officials often determine the positions officials take. Can you give me an example of an official who took a position because of the ties to donor groups?",
  "So your position is that that official's official positions were determined by the donor groups, as you say in your brief.",
  "Well, your brief says determined. And did -- did you --",
  "So it should say influenced rather than determined.",
  "How many prosecutions for political corruption have you brought?",
  "Do you think that political corruption in Vermont is a serious problem?",

  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Wright.",
  "But I thought --",
  "-- when you look at the -- the record, Vermont would be the last place that you'd be worried about it. The political culture, as we just heard, is that it's easy to go door to door, and that's what the Vermonters expect. And it doesn't take an arms race to get on your feet and go door to door. And it seems to me that there's a real dilemma on the respondents' side of the case between justifying low limits by saying you don't really need money to run effectively and at the same time suggesting that there's a serious problem with too much money.",
  "Which is it?",
  "How do you -- how do you police that, though? Because an incumbent can -- has so many opportunities to go before the public that wouldn't necessarily be categorized as campaigning but as part of his or her official duties, while everything a challenger does is going to be credited against his account.",
  "You may answer the question.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bopp, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in 04-1544, Vickie Lynn Marshall v. E. Pierce Marshall. Mr. Richland.",
  "But you did file a challenge to the probate of the will, didn't you, in Texas?",
  "And wasn't the ground for that that it would be inconsistent with the inter vivos trust that you are asserting in the bankruptcy court proceeding?",
  "But -- but this case involves a lot more than convenience. It involves a substantial amount of assets that is either going to pass to one person under probate or is not going to be available for passing to that person because of the inter vivos gift. That seems to be more closely related to the core probate matters.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Maynard.",
  "Except if it's a will -- will-specific. In other words, you -- it seems to me you're in for a penny and in for a pound. You recognize the existence of this exception in certain cases, and then you argue against it by saying, well, Congress wrote the statutes broadly. The latter argument disproves your first point.",
  "With -- with new dicta of our own?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Maynard. Mr. Brunstad.",
  "So why isn't that, as Justice Breyer prefaced his question, an issue of preclusion rather than, as you frame it, an issue of jurisdiction?",
  "Counsel, I don't -- I don't see how the interference with the probate court that you're articulating is any greater than the interference in Markham. In Markham, it was a decision by a Federal court that these claimants were not going to claim under the will. Why is -- isn't that even greater than the interference you're complaining of?",
  "Yes, but she's not -- she's not even going after the assets in this case. She's asserting an in personam claim against the individual. Correct?",
  "The -- the only court I've heard of that can do that is the Federal bankruptcy court.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Richland, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in 04-1618, Northern Insurance Company of New York v. Chatham County, Georgia. Mr. Estrada.",
  "I assume it's -- I assume it's sort of a -- a case-by-case inquiry. In other words, the county could be an arm of the State for some purposes but not others.",
  "It's just a -- it's just a close textual reading of the Eleventh Amendment. Right?",
  "It says a State. It doesn't say county.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Himmelfarb.",
  "You don't doubt that a county could have sovereign immunity if it qualified as an arm of the State in a particular instance.",
  "Your -- your friend in the -- in the red brief, though, reviews a lot of old cases, suggesting at the time of the founding, that counties were not subject to suit.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb. Mr. Hart.",
  "That was -- in many of those cases cited in your brief, it was because the duties they were performing they were performing pro bono publico.",
  "And the doctrine extended immunity to them on that basis, not -- not as sovereigns.",
  "Well, I'm not sure that operating bridges at the time of the framing was a core sovereign function.",
  "There are an awful lot of private bridges.",
  "But the -- the court of appeals has said that you weren't asserting that you were an arm of the State.",
  "All that establishes is simply that if the State were operating this bridge and if the State were on the hook for any judgments and if the State had control over the people who were making the decisions, that there might be an issue of State sovereign immunity.",
  "The whole problem is that it's the county that's doing all that.",
  "Well, the State doesn't pay the damages.",
  "The State doesn't tell you how to do it.",
  "But that's a different question. The immunity looks to where the money is going to come from to satisfy a judgment. I don't think it looks to where the funding came from in the first instance.",
  "It's the claim on the treasury of the judgment that raises the sovereign immunity issues.",
  "It's not unusual that counties maintain and run bridges in your State, is it? I mean, that's --",
  "That's the normal --",
  "Then -- then how do we know it's a core dignity function of the State if they're -- the normal rule is somebody else does it?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hart. Mr. Estrada, you have 8 minutes remaining.",
  "You're -- are you suggesting that the -- the State would enjoy sovereign immunity in proprietary activities?",
  "But I would have thought, particularly when we're talking about the arm of the State doctrine, that the -- the nature of the activity is one of the key questions we look at.",
  "Maintaining bridges is one thing. You know, operating a for-profit activity would be something else.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in 04-1704, Chrysler versus -- DaimlerChrysler versus Cuno, and 04-1724, Wilkins versus Cuno. Mr. Olson.",
  "With respect to the claims that are before us. But there was standing below for the municipal taxpayers with respect to their challenge to the property taxes.",
  "Right.",
  "So, why isn't -- these -- why aren't the present claims brought under -- you know, within the same nucleus of operative facts, the same sort of supplemental jurisdiction that allows the Federal court to consider purely State law claims if they have jurisdiction of another related Federal claim?",
  "But just to get -- I mean, you don't dispute the standing of the municipal taxpayers on the property tax issue?",
  "Well, if it's an article III issue, I think that's always before us.",
  "Well, I was thinking if your -- if the argument is that the claims that you're concerned about today can be piggybacked onto the other ones, then we do have to consider whether there's a pig to piggyback them onto.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Cole.",
  "Do they have standing in State court?",
  "So --",
  "And what about the municipal taxpayers on the property tax claim that we were talking about earlier?",
  "Do they have standing?",
  "So, a tax -- just -- so, a taxpayer in Wyoming can't challenge the State tax, because his claim is too diffuse, but a resident in New York City can challenge the city tax, because it's not.",
  "Well, but it would be of higher value if they invest it in Ohio. I mean, that's all --",
  "Presumably, the Ohio legislators were not doing this irrationally.",
  "That -- in some sense, at the expense of the citizens in other States.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cole. Mr. Enrich.",
  "What was --",
  "Can I back you up just a bit before we talk about piggybacking? This Court hasn't held that municipal taxpayers have standing in this sort of situation, have they?",
  "So, if you want us to piggyback, we -- and if it is an article III question - - we would have to decide that issue before we can decide whether we can piggyback your current claims onto it.",
  "Right. And you agree that the --",
  "And you agree that the municipal taxpayer standing on the property tax question is an open issue before this Court. We have not had a holding on that.",
  "Well, then all the -- but all you're saying -- but you have to do business in the State with the lower income tax rate to get the advantage of the lower rate.",
  "Well, that --",
  "-- would seem to present the same Commerce Clause problem that you're posing for us today.",
  "Some States -- Counsel, some States have homestead exemptions to property taxes for people when they're buying homes in the State. That -- those would be invalid under your theory?",
  "Yes, but that --",
  "-- that person may have another piece of property in the -- in the other State.",
  "And he's not getting the benefit of this, because his homestead -- he lives somewhere else.",
  "But they're two identical pieces of property, and they'll say -- one say, \"You're going to be taxed at a lower rate if that's where you're living, if that's your homestead; but if you happen to live outside the State, you're going to get taxed at a higher rate.\" It would seem to be very similar to what you're challenging here.",
  "No, it's imposing tax on property in the State at a higher rate if it's not the person's homestead; in other words, if they don't live in the State.",
  "It's the same purpose. There's some place -- they want people to move in -- into the District here, for example, just like Ohio wants businesses to move in.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted. [Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the",
  "We'll hear argument next in No. 05-204, League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Smith.",
  "So your -- your statement that it was for one reason only means it wasn't for any discriminatory reason on the grounds of race or ethnicity?",
  "Which -- which motivation?",
  "How -- how does that make any sense to say that what you're objecting to is the consideration of race in one situation, but if it's compact and the predominant motive was the consideration of race, that doesn't bother you? That seems to me to be a back-door way to get into a more extensive judicial review of the compactness and based on racial considerations that are, under your view, the predominant factor in each case.",
  "So you can take race into account if it's compact as a predominant motive. You can't take race into account if it's not compact.",
  "As a dominant motive.",
  "Well, isn't it correct, though, that a result is -- focus on results is not sufficient if the challenge is an equal protection one and not a section 2 one?",
  "I'm talking about district 25.",
  "Well, that's why I asked earlier that your -- your statement that all of this was done with a political motive -- I wondered how that satisfied the equal protection requirement, not the section 2 requirement.",
  "Well, counsel, just take it in -- in an abstract way. If you think that the prior system has been gerrymandered by the party in power, are you saying that when that shift in power in the statewide offices changes, that the new party in power cannot redress the gerrymandering of its predecessor?",
  "Let me give you another parallel. Let's suppose that districts have been gerrymandered for racially discriminatory purposes for years. Can you take race into account in drawing new districts to remedy that racial discrimination?",
  "Well, there was no --",
  "Is that the reason these lines were not redrawn at the beginning of the decade, because the majority party sat on its hands?",
  "I thought --",
  "What was the percentage of the African American voters in the district as a whole?",
  "So that if you had a situation where it's 40 percent one group, 40 percent another group, and 20 percent where the 20 percent controlled who was elected by siding with one group or the other group, then you would say that that was an influence district for that small -- the smallest group in the district?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Smith. Ms. Perales.",
  "Does that undermine the assumption that there's -- they're voting as a bloc? 30 percent of the group is voting for one candidate. Is that sufficient to establish a voting bloc?",
  "Can I -- can I -- I don't understand -- I think your argument is at cross purposes. I mean, the one point -- and you're making the point that the Democrats do not vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic candidate. They voted as much as 30 percent for Bonilla. But the Voting Rights Act is concerned with whether or not a group voting ethnically as a bloc can vote for candidates of its choice. Well, if they're 30/70, it's not -- it's hard to think of them as having a clear candidate of choice. So what does it matter whether they're in or out?",
  "Yes, the percentage goes up, the percentage goes down.",
  "It depends on who's running against him. At the low point, there was a popular Hispanic candidate running against him in some of those elections. But it seems to me that the predicate for coverage under the Voting Rights Act that a particular group is being denied the opportunity to elect a candidate of its choice doesn't even come into play if you're right that the -- the vote is split over time, depending on the circumstances in a particular election.",
  "Well, then -- well, but then -- and this is why I say it's an argument at cross purposes. If you're right about that, then the assumption that the Hispanic voters are going to be voting Democratic is not one that was unfounded, which I thought was your -- your first point.",
  "It's not just the State that's saying it, though. You have a district court finding that ethnicity was not the predominant factor, that politics was the predominant factor. Maybe -- as Justice Scalia suggests, maybe they were right, maybe they were wrong, but the point was that it was being done for political purposes not for ethnic purposes.",
  "Is that -- and what relevance does that have? What provision of the Constitution prevents you from leaving a majority of one group in a district to create the impression that the district supports a particular candidate?",
  "That's what the Fourteenth Amendment was passed for, to avoid creating the impression that a particular group supports a particular candidate?",
  "And how many -- what percentage would they have shifted from making it look like a Hispanic opportunity district with about 51 percent to when it would actually be one? What percentage does it shift from being looking like one to being one, both above a majority?",
  "But what's the number?",
  "Is that your number? It has to -- anything short of 63, it's just looking like it? I mean, really, you're asking us to draw a very fine line between a -- in each case a majority Hispanic voting age district, but in one case, it's a constitutional violation and in the other case, it's -- it's required by the Voting Rights Act. So what is the magic number between 51 and 63?",
  "What's the number?",
  "So if this district were drawn with 60 percent, you would say that's just to make it look like a Hispanic district?",
  "No. So what's the number? It's -- it's somewhat more than 51 percent because you're saying that's a constitutional violation, and I want to know how many more it takes before it becomes what's required under the Voting Rights Act.",
  "I'm just trying to get a number. If you're asking us to rule on a constitutional violation, I'm asking to find out what the number is that changes it from a political nuance to a Hispanic opportunity.",
  "Would it have been better --",
  "-- would it have been better in your view if they had excluded more Hispanics so it didn't look like a Hispanic opportunity district?",
  "And -- and that would have been preferable. It would have been preferable to you if it was, say, 45 percent Hispanic rather than 50.8, or whatever it was.",
  "You may answer.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Perales. Mr. Cruz.",
  "And what do we look at to determine that? I know what we said in De Grandy, but I mean how -- I mean, you talk about the south and west Texas. I mean, on the other hand, 23 and 25 are actually not that close together. So how do we know that we should be looking at all the way from El Paso to the Gulf, as opposed to a narrower area?",
  "But I didn't understand Ms. Perales' argument to concern section -- district 25 at all.",
  "And why was that?",
  "Do you have a -- a section 5 argument with respect to district 25 as opposed to a section 2 argument involving district 23?",
  "Is it permissible for a legislature concerned with section 5 to take race and ethnicity in account -- into account in drawing a district?",
  "Go ahead. I'm sorry.",
  "Counsel, can I move you south and west again, back to district 23? How do we tell -- as redrawn, it had what? 50.8 percent. And I gather that that's not considered a Hispanic opportunity district because of lower voting turnout, registration, participation? How do we tell when something is being done to make it look like a Hispanic district and, instead, when it's being done for the opportunity of providing a Hispanic opportunity district if voter turnout and registration are increased?",
  "Jump in whenever you want.",
  "You're talking about district 25. Right?",
  "Why did they have -- why did have just 50.3 percent?",
  "They're doing that to make it look like whoever was elected had Hispanic support in that district? Is that --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cruz. Mr. Garre.",
  "That's not -- not including 23.",
  "When you say they drew, you mean the GI Forum proposal?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Garre.",
  "Mr. Smith, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Who was the -- who was the -- the candidate in that district after the district court plan?",
  "Well, didn't the district court say one of its criteria was preserving incumbency?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Smith. (Whereupon, at 3:00 p.m., the case in the",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Davis v. Washington. Mr. Fisher.",
  "Well, what about -- what if you -- what if somebody runs out of the -- the house? There are two people standing in the yard, a law enforcement officer and the next-door neighbor. She yells at the next-door neighbor, he's trying to kill me, and then he comes out. Is that covered by your rule? It's not to a law enforcement officer. It's to the next-door neighbor, but the law enforcement officer overhears it.",
  "Well, I thought that was -- I thought that was to determine if there were outstanding orders and warrants against the individual.",
  "But that's related -- that's related to sending people to prevent crime as opposed to gathering evidence to be used to convict.",
  "Well, they're not sending someone -- they're not sending someone to apprehend Mr. Davis. They're sending someone to prevent him from attacking his wife.",
  "Well, that's not -- that's not true at all. I mean, if -- if the -- the witness may be a good witness and compelling on the stand, they may have every incentive to bring her in in person. This is only addressed to the situations where the witness is unwilling or unable to testify.",
  "But Justice Scalia's question raises the -- the point. The reason these witnesses are not there is not because of anything that the government has done. It's -- it's the concern they have, the particular domestic abuse situation. It's not the government that is keeping these witnesses out. They're not relying on the 911 calls as a matter of preference.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fisher. Mr. Whisman.",
  "Counsel, your -- your position is not that anything that she says or anything anyone says in a 911 call is -- is consistent with the Confrontation Clause.",
  "So what is your -- what is your test? We have your friend saying any accusatory statement made to a law enforcement officer. What -- what is your proposal?",
  "Mr. Fisher tells us that's exactly what happens, that the 911 operator goes through the elements of the crime in a very structured way.",
  "And she's -- she's in ongoing -- the operator is in ongoing contact with the people she's -- the operator has dispatched. Right?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Well, maybe. I mean, it's easy to imagine a 911 call that doesn't fit your description. You know, the person is trying to get in the door. The call is -- you know, this is the fourth time. I keep calling and I've talked to you about this. You don't do anything. He's got to be locked up so this will stop. I mean, that's not -- that sounds more like testimony than an immediate call for help.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, you say focus on the emergency nature. Very little of what took place in the 911 call is emergency. He's beating me. He's jumping on me. Yes. What's his name? I mean, it's not like they'll send help if his name is Joe but they won't if it's Mike. It doesn't matter. Which direction is he running? That's not related to the emergency nature of the -- of the call.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Hammon v. Indiana. Mr. Friedman.",
  "But you are back -- as Justice Breyer pointed earlier, you're making the prosecution prove two crimes instead of one.",
  "Well, but every evidentiary problem, the -- the root of the problem is not the inability of the -- or the unwillingness of the primary victim to testify. I mean, that's what makes intimidation so hard to prove in these cases is because you have to get the -- if -- if the intimidation is successful, the witness to testify about the -- the crime is unavailable and unwilling to do so.",
  "But the -- the judge can't make that finding if the witness doesn't testify, can he?",
  "How's that? The prosecutor goes in and says, we think the defendant has intimidated the witness by saying he's not going to support her financially, he's going to leave, whatever, and -- and the -- presumably the -- the defendant says no -- no, and the witness isn't there. The judge says, well, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that he has intimidated her?",
  "Where -- where do you come out on the person running out of the house and yelling to her neighbor with the law enforcement officer standing by?",
  "It's not -- the statement is not to the law enforcement officer, but he or she overhears it.",
  "Doesn't.",
  "Is anybody -- is anybody working for the State a law enforcement officer?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher.",
  "A videotape -- a videotape of a crime scene is admissible. Right?",
  "No.",
  "But a tape recording by the same person who videotaped the crime scene, describing what he saw, you agree would be excluded.",
  "Well, but it's a -- it's a classic mixed motive case. We don't know when the officer is sitting down with her and asking the questions, whether his primary motive is to make sure the guy doesn't come back or if his primary motive is to help make the case against the guy. It's both.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gornstein.",
  "Of course, the Sixth Amendment doesn't use the word testimony, does it?",
  "And maybe that -- and maybe you're not a witness when you make the call, but when that same call is admitted into court, then -- then it strikes me that you are a witness.",
  "That's not the way the Court looked at it in Crawford.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Friedman, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in 04-473, Garcetti versus Ceballos. Ms. Lee.",
  "The court --",
  "-- the court of Appeals did --",
  "-- the court of Appeals specifically did not address the Mexican- American Bar Association speech. It focused only on the memorandum, correct?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Lee. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Ms. Robin-Vergeer.",
  "I think it's probably a bit much to say that the core of the First Amendment is internal employee grievances or speech. And I think the concern on the other side is that you may -- as a lawyer, you may have a view of what the -- what Brady requires. Your superior may have a different view. And just because that disagreement exists doesn't mean that you have a constitutional right to continue to voice your view when your superior has reached a different decision.",
  "Well, but you're just hiding behind the fact that they claimed that it wasn't in retaliation. Your assertion still puts them in the position of having to defend a constitutional claim on a case-by-case basis every time there's a disagreement between a subordinate and a superior about, as in this case, what Brady requires.",
  "There was a disagreement about whether or not his memorandum accurately reflected, in an appropriate way, what was at issue there. There was a disagreement about the content of the allegations.",
  "Is that because --",
  "-- they're addressed -- is it -- they're addressed under State and Federal whistle-blower laws, or --",
  "But if --",
  "-- none of that were true -- if none of that were true, he could still file his complaint. Presumably it survives a motion to dismiss, and it goes at least to summary judgment. And that's true in every case of a disagreement between a subordinate and a superior.",
  "Well, that --",
  "-- was my point earlier. They can't make short shrift of those cases, because they're not going to be thrown out at the pleading stage. They're going to have to progress at least to summary judgment, probably in every case in which an employee is terminated, because now one of his defenses against termination is, \"You're violating my First Amendment rights.\"",
  "But that's not --",
  "-- the context in which this law developed. It developed, originally -- if you were a public employee, you did not have free- speech rights as a citizen. As Justice Holmes said, you know, you might have the right to speak, but you don't have the right to be a policeman. So, the \"as a citizen\" part didn't come out of happenstance.",
  "It was recognizing that when you are speaking \"as a citizen,\" First Amendment rights.",
  "Sure.",

  "Thank you --",
  "-- Ms. Lee. The case is submitted. [Whereupon, at 2:00 p.m., the case in the",
  "We'll hear argument first today in 05-128, Howard Delivery Service v. Zurich American Insurance Company. Mr. Strain.",
  "Can I get you to step back just -- the presumption that you began with. What -- what's your strongest authority for that? The first thing you cite in your brief is a dissenting opinion of two justices.",
  "Nathanson is the -- you cite the dissenting opinion for this proposition?",
  "And that's clearly covered.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Strain. Mr. Verrilli.",
  "So that if an employer decides to -- because his employees have had a good year, he's going to put in a new parking lot for them -- he -- his plan is to have a contract with a paving company to pave the parking lot. Are the payments under that contract's contributions to an employee benefit plan?",
  "It seems like the consequence of your theory though --",
  "But -- but providing for workers' compensation through insurance, rather than through self-insurance, is also not on the list.",
  "Well, sure, if they have a contract, as part of their -- part of their contract, they get the bottled water, that's -- that's easy to see why that's covered. But the -- the question is when it's not. It's just something that the employer does in the course of his business that has -- that benefits both his business and his workers.",
  "You couldn't have the plan without the bond, just as here you wouldn't have a plan without the insurance policy. It's just a different way of paying for the same thing.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, your -- your friend's argument about the interrelation between (a)(3) and (a)(4) seems like a compelling one. What is your answer to that?",
  "Counsel, much of your case hinges on the assumption that Congress incorporated the ERISA definition into the bankruptcy code. What -- what is your strongest evidence for that?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Verrilli. Mr. Strain, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Strain.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Fernandez-Vargas versus Gonzales. Mr. Gossett.",
  "Wouldn't it be the same result if Congress decided, for example, to take away one of the available methods of seeking discretionary review, just saying, \"We're not going to have that available anymore\"?",
  "But that would be --",
  "-- a pretty easy case, wouldn't it? I mean, if you have a mechanism saying some -- an alien in this position can apply for, you know, this type of relief, this type of relief, or another, and they say, \"Well, we're not going to allow this type of relief anymore. We're going to change those\" -- was -- that's a pretty easy case, under Landgraf, isn't it?",
  "Well, that's an --",
  "-- that may be a reasonable inference, but I think it's a real stretch to say that it \"clearly establishes.\" When you're talking about a statute, and you say something's \"clear,\" you want to be able to point to actual words.

  "I don't see how that undermines their point that when Congress wants to specify that something \"shall apply prospectively only,\" as they quote, \"only with respect to entries occurring on or after a date,\" they spell it out. And they did not similarly spell it out in the provision on -- that you suggest is prospective only.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gossett. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "Well, but your point, though -- I mean, someone illegally reentering at that time might not have had a reasonable expectation of the availability of discretionary relief. On the other hand, someone in the -- a petitioner's position, after all that had happened, did have a fairly good case under those provisions that were no longer available.",
  "Well, and someone entering says, \"Well, obviously, if I'm detained the day after I enter, I'm not going to have a very good case. On the other hand, if I'm not, and I happen to make a life here, and I'm here for 20 years, and I get married and I have a child, I'm going to have a strong case,\" and he's going to -- he's willing to take his chances.",
  "That --",
  "That person has not illegally reentered the United States? He's gone back, but he did illegally reenter the United States. He wouldn't be covered by the same provision that we're talking about?",

  "Thank you. Mr. Himmelfarb, we'll hear now from you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb. Mr. Feder.",
  "Yes it is. Because the whole -- one of the reasons you have reasonably short time is that you get the witnesses there, they remember it. If you have to file within 15 days with the prison, the prisoner does that, the guard is there, \"Do you remember what happened?\" \"Yes. This, this, and this.\" \"Who else was there?\" \"These people were there.\" You wait 3 months, the prisoner files a complaint, they ask the guard, \"Do you remember?\" \"Not really. It was 3 months ago.\" \"Who else was there?\" \"I'm not sure.\" Then he has -- you know, the evidence against him is much weaker when he files his claim in Federal Court.",
  "No, the point is that if he complies with the time limit, it's going to hurt his claim; therefore, he doesn't want to comply with the time limit.",
  "Well, you were suggesting that the prisoner had no incentive not to comply and go through the State grievance procedure. And it seems to me that the reason you have the short procedures are to maintain a fresh record that more accurately reflects the truth, and, since Congress was acting against the backdrop in which they thought there were too many frivolous cases, they thought that might be one way to limit those.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Feder. Ms. Perkell, you may have a minute for rebuttal.",

  "Well, that's why I thought your answer would have focused on that rather than the security concerns, is that you take away what it is they want the most because that's most likely to result in them conforming their behavior so they can get it back.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Rovelli. Mr. Marcus.",
  "Where do you draw the line? I take it somewhere -- you couldn't deprive them of food, if that would get them to -- to conform. Justice Souter was asking about marriage. I mean, how do we tell when -- when you can deprive someone of something they -- to modify their behavior and when it goes too far?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Marcus.",
  "Mr. Krakoff.",
  "Mr. Krakoff, what -- I take it you wouldn't have any objection to terminating of television rights, for example. If prisoners have the right to watch television, they misbehave, the penalty is no television. Is that all right?",
  "What other alternatives would you have the prison administrators rely on? You have an incorrigible prisoner who's misbehaving. He won't behave. They go through every -- he gets up to level -- level 2. What -- what should they have done instead?",
  "I'm sorry. What should they have done instead? Let's say he gets out of the prison 1 hour every other day. Should they have taken that hour out? I mean, not out of the prison. Out of his cell. Should they have taken that hour away, or what -- what other options do they have?",
  "Right, and I want you to tell me --",
  "I would like you to tell me what else they should have done. Why is that wrong?",
  "And none of that worked. Right?",
  "So your answer to my question is there's nothing else they could have done, but they shouldn't have done this because this wasn't going to work either.",
  "Well, then now you're giving -- now you're making their situation worse because they tried to make your client's situation better. I mean, yes, they could -- maybe they could prohibit religious journals as well, but they -- for various reasons, they decided not to do that. Maybe they could have eliminated legal materials as well, but again, they decided not to do it. They take a more circumscribed approach. So I'm not sure it's a very effective response to say, well, they let religious materials in and that can be used as well.",
  "So if visitors -- if there's a security issue with visitors to the prisoner, you're saying you can't prohibit visitors because if you allow the lawyers to come in, because they're visitors too?",
  "Well, but it wouldn't undermine the security rationale just because you have some exceptions where there are other countervailing interests that might outweigh the security concern.",
  "And once you're in that situation already, as these prisoners are, and they're still not conforming their behavior to the prison rules, you have a limited number of options for trying to get them to do that, and your response to my first line of questioning was that there's nothing else you can think of that they could do.",

  "But 62(a) gets to the reinvestment of the illicit proceeds in a -- in an enterprise, and here you have the opening of the facility right next -- not right next door -- nearby the other facility. And it seems to me all they have to show is that the proceeds used for that were illicitly procured.",
  "But it's not --",
  "I think the reason Justice Breyer's test is a little more administrable than you're willing to admit is that it's not a You're asking where the predicate act is directed, and if the predicate act is directed to lowering the -- the that's one thing. If the -- the predicate act is directed to, you know, blowing up the other firm's warehouse or -- or, you know, something like that, it's a different matter altogether.",

  "They're -- they're one more step removed. I don't know if they're one step removed. I mean, if there were no allegations of that there are two competitors there and the one underpaid its taxes, is your case still viable?",
  "So it doesn't depend on motive or targeting or anything at all. It just depends on the fortuity of there being two competitors in a particular area.",
  "Well, you've cited the Solicitor General's brief --",
  "-- earlier. The Solicitor General says it's inherent in the concept of proximate cause. In the absence of reliance, you don't have proximate cause.",

  "Can I get back to the -- the Barnes case that Justice Scalia asked you about? Is it a possible distinction of that case that that involved a contingent fee arrangement, and in other words, the lawyer's labors generated the -- the asset, while in this case, the claim depends upon the -- the contractual provision?",
  "Well, you may not -- you may not rely on the distinction, but I would have thought your answer might have been that the lawyer had an equitable claim apart from the contractual provisions so that when you enforce the contractual provisions, Justice Holmes would have thought of it in equitable terms, while here, there's no equitable claim apart from the particular provisions of the contract.",
  "But why is that? I mean, we spend a lot of time with these old English cases. Why -- why did Congress -- it seems an arbitrary line.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stris.",
  "Well, if I can just stop you there. Your -- your friend on the other side subrogation in this sort of situation, or if it does allow it, subject to the make-whole doctrine.",
  "Well, instead of looking for an equitable counterpart, this is an action for money you think is owing to you under a contract. Why isn't that a classic form of legal relief?",
  "So why did you cite the contract in your complaint?",
  "Is your claim subject to the equitable doctrines or subject to the legal contractual claim?",
  "Counsel, it seems to There's an easy answer to Justice Stevens and to Justice Scalia, and it's that we get all the money first because that's what the contract says. But you can't give that answer because then it starts to look like a legal claim. Instead, you get mired in all these obscure equitable doctrines because you're -- when there's a simple answer there in black and white, but it's in the contract. And as soon as you say that, it starts to sound legal rather than equitable.",
  "Your theory is that your argument would be exactly the same if you did not have this provision in your contract. It's an equitable claim. It's an age-old subrogation right. You just sue in equity saying, look, I paid the medical expenses, I'm entitled to it. You don't need the contractual provision at all. equity independent of the plan, but (a)(3) does have that language that you seek appropriate equitable it might be missing if we were just out relying solely on what exists in equity, separate from the plan. That is why the plan memorializes these rights. It was Congress' intent that we write the terms into the plan so that people can be given notice of what is there and they can accept it. They can understand what is in the plan. And as long as our plan is consistent with -- and we believe it is -- in seeking what is appropriate equitable relief, then we think that the courts have authority to hear these claims. And really, there's a lot that's been discussed here, but the question that has been presented to the Court is really only does (a)(3) authorize these types of claim. The answer to that is clearly yes, and in asserting that a court should have enforced or should have looked at various equitable defenses, we think that's merely a concession that our claim is equitable in nature and that in asserting these various defenses, that -- that the courts of appeals have unanimously thus far rejected, the Court correctly decided all of those issues in -- in evaluating the -- the balancing of Congress' intent in play, allowing plan sponsors to have a lot of deference and leeway over how plans are designed and then enforcing them under (a)(3) in seeking equitable relief. And we believe that the Fourth Circuit properly evaluated that and that the court's judgment should be affirmed.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Coleman. Mr. Feldman.",
  "How is this -- to go to your first point, how is this specifically identifiable? No court has said that there's this -- you only want the medical expenses, and no court has said there's this much for medical expenses. You have to figure out how much of the recovery is allocable to medical expenses. In fact, already did that. They cut out some percentage for attorney's fees. It's far removed from the traditional sort of res that we deal with in equity.",
  "So we -- how enforced? I mean, if you're enforcing a contract, you do that legally not equitably. And if you're enforcing a contract and you're seeking normal contractual damages of various sorts, you equity always enforced contracts. They would enforce its equitable liens that were created by contract. For example, in the case of Walker against Brown, which was not an attorney's fees case -- by the way, on -- in Barnes against Alexander, which was an attorney's fees case, nowhere in the decision does the Court rely at all on the fact that this had anything to do with any special rule that applies to attorney's fees. But that, in turn, relied on the prior case of Walker against Brown in which -- just involved an equitable lien that was created by contract and that a party was trying to enforce. And the Court quoted Pomeroy's Treatise. Now, Walker was decided in 1897. Pomeroy's Treatise on Equity, quote, every express executory agreement in writing, whereby the contracting party sufficiently indicates an intention to make some particular property, real or personal, or fund therein described or identified as a security for a debt, creates an equitable lien upon the property so described. this case were a weak case on -- on liability and it was settled for $60,000? What would happen to your",
  "Are these claims subject to the qualifications that go along with the equitable lien, the make-whole, whatever the applicable rules are?",
  "So that wouldn't",
  "So what if the plan said -- you know, this is an insurance company. They don't like litigation -- we are subrogated to double whatever the medical expenses are that we contributed? That's our recovery. It's an equitable claim, but it's going to be enforced according to the terms of the plan.",
  "But you would still call that an equitable claim?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Stris, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stris. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in two cases, Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon and Bustillo v. Johnson. Mr. Gartlan.",
  "But I thought that the argument on the other side is that those references in the secondary sources and in the document itself are meant to make clear that if the individual detainee does not want contact with his consular officials, for example, in a case where he might be seeking asylum or something like that, that it was, as you said earlier, his decision and not necessarily that there was to be a departure from the norm in international -- the international context where treaties are between the sovereigns and don't confer enforceable rights on individuals.",
  "Right. So the -- that's what the different countries, the signatories, are supposed to provide, and if they don't, that's a matter to be taken up bilaterally between the countries involved and not necessarily an individual enforceable right.",
  "But do any of our treaty partners apply the exclusionary rule to violations of this?",
  "We didn't even have it then, did we?",
  "And that -- that's when the convention came into effect?",
  "Well, if it doesn't --",
  "Why don't you go ahead?",
  "So -- so if the treaty doesn't say suppress, what authority does a Federal court have to direct a State court to exclude evidence?",
  "Supremacy Clause gives effect to the treaty. You just told me the treaty doesn't require suppression.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gartlan.",
  "Mr. Stancil.",
  "Well, Miranda gives you the same, you know, right to -- to reach a counsel, a right to remain silent, and yet, if your lawyer doesn't raise a Miranda violation in trial, it can be waived.",
  "Why should this be elevated to a special status beyond that?",
  "Well, that's true about the right to remain silent or any other rights that are very much the rights of the defendant, not the rights of the counsel, but they're exercised in consultation with the counsel, and if they make a determination not to contact the consul, then that's a decision that counsel made, and if it's ineffective, there are remedies for that. I'm not sure how it's different than the right to remain silent.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stancil. Ms. Williams.",
  "So State -- you don't have any problem with State judges being enlisted as officers to execute Federal treaty obligations on behalf of the State Department or someone?",
  "Of course, he doesn't have to answer that.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Williams. Mr. Thro.",
  "There was a State collateral review?",
  "Is -- is a defense counsel a competent authority under the treaty for the purposes of notifying the accused?",
  "You know, that's kind of a tough position to put the lawyer in. If he's not a competent authority for notification purposes and he makes the judgment that, you know, I don't think it's going to do any good to notify the consulate, wouldn't he be better advised not to tell his client about it? Because if he does, then it's, I guess, harmless error that the State hasn't notified him, and if he doesn't, it's kind of an ace in the hole. You see how the trial goes, and at the end say, by the way, the State never notified my client.",
  "It's kind of like a speedy trial claim. Right? I mean, if the lawyer knows he has a right to a trial within a certain number of days, and he doesn't -- it's not his obligation to notify the State. He just kind of watches the clock and lets the clock run out, and then he has a claim based on that. Right?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Thro. Mr. Garre.",
  "Are there any countries that recognize individually enforceable rights under this convention overseas on behalf of American citizens?",
  "If they don't -- if they can't ask him -- I mean, I assume many foreign nationals are detained fairly close to the border, and if you start saying, well, my first question is, are you a citizen or not, you've got to give Miranda warnings first saying you don't have to answer any question that might incriminate you.",
  "It's kind of a catch 22.",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stancil, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "But it refers to his rights, to make it clear that the consular office does not have the right to contact him in the situations where he would prefer not to be contacted by his consul.",
  "Well, 1983 is a good example. If you have a -- a treaty between a State and the Federal Government, a Spending Clause provision, that says you've got to spend the money this way, give certain rights to the individuals, we don't always automatically hold that the individuals have enforceable rights even under 1983.",
  "It said his rights in Gonzaga v. Doe, which dealt with the student privacy rights act, and we held -- and the -- we -- the Court held that that was -- did not give rise to individually enforceable rights.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stancil.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in eBay v. MercExchange. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Well, but -- but the exercise of discretion is channeled over time, as -- as judges apply it in -- in similar cases. You're not suggesting that in a typical run-of-the-mine patent case, no special considerations, it would be wrong to say that in those cases you typically would grant an injunction?",
  "Well, but he said other things too, and one thing he said is, I don't like business method patents very much, and so I'm not",
  "Do you think that was",
  "He said there's a growing concern over the issuance of business method patents.",
  "Is that an appropriate consideration to take into account in determining whether to grant an injunction or not?",
  "Well, then he went on and he said --",
  "-- another -- another consideration is that this patentee does not practice its patents. But, I mean, isn't that just saying he's, inventor and the way he's going to market his discoveries is by getting some firm that basically",
  "And if he's denying that inventor, you know, the -- what he'd give to Bell Labs -- or whatever Bell Labs is these days -- that does practice the inventions --",
  "Why should we -- if I can get back to one of the factors. Why should we draw a distinction between the -- the sole inventor who needs a patent speculation firm to market his discovery and -- and somebody else? Why -- why should he lose the leverage of the normal injunction and have substituted for that a duel of experts over what a reasonable royalty should be?",
  "Can I -- maybe I don't understand what it means to practice the invention. If -- if I -- does that -- if -- if I invent something, you know, a new -- better way to make a car engine work and I want to sell that to somebody, that's -- you'd say that's not practicing the invention because I don't build cars?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.",
  "You don't think Mr. -- you don't think Judge Bryson forgot about the four- factor test, do you?",
  "Sure. And -- and he was just reflecting the reality that in a typical case, to do is edit his opinion and stick in this formulaic paragraph about there are four factors and here they are.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, that's what struck me as odd there. Footnote 27 says that's a basis for staying the injunction. It seems to me if it's a basis for staying the injunction, it's a basis not to issue one in the first place.",
  "I'm curious about your nonwillful infringer. You're devaluing the value of a particular patent by denying the injunction simply because the people who infringed it weren't willful, and I wonder why that makes sense.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Minear. Mr. Waxman.",
  "We also know by now that the patent office has rejected all of the claims",
  "Is that a factor that a district court could take into account in deciding whether to issue an injunction?",
  "Say the injunction court say, well, the patent office staff has rejected every claim of this patent, and I'm going to take that business?",
  "Mr. Waxman, you mentioned, in -- in responding to the suggestion that we're dealing with a troll, you described -- what exactly is the invention here?",
  "Electric. I mean, it's not like --",
  "-- the district court mentioned. The exact parameters of when it was going to be infringed and when it wasn't were amorphous. And so isn't that a factor the district court can take into account in deciding whether to issue an injunction because it's going to be hard to issue an injunction to define exactly when it's going to be violated and when it's not?",
  "I may not be a displaying pictures of your wares on a computer network and, you know, picking which ones you want and buying them. I -- I might have been able to do that.",
  "Well, but the patent on what grounds.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Mr. Phillips, you have 6 minutes remaining. I realize I'm the only thing standing between you and lunch, so I'll try to be brief at this point. the record, this is in the joint appendix and the court of appeals at A6523 -- 62523. That's the proposed permanent injunction, and I won't purport to read the whole thing, but it starts off with anything directly or indirectly, and it goes on for three pages. It is, I think, fairly characterized as a very broad injunction. The -- I think it's important, after Mr. Waxman's challenge to the conduct of eBay in this case, to -- to recognize that willfulness in the patent context has a meaning different from willfulness in any other context. And it is recognized that we're talking about simply a failure to satisfy a duty to check out and find a lawyer's opinion that a particular infringement has not taken place or that the patent is not valid. And when you do that, you of course incur the risk that you will also waive your attorney-client privilege. So there's a risk to it. And that's the willfulness that we're talking about here. With respect to the notion of stealing this patent, let's go back to what the district court the defendants maintain that their success did not arise from the use of anything contained in the patents offered no business or engineering guidance which the defendants could copy, and this court agrees with that. That's not the kind of bad faith or willfulness -- it's the reason why the court didn't grant enhanced damages. It's the reason why the court didn't grant attorney's fees in this particular case, and it doesn't provide a reason for simply jettisoning three out of the four factors that ought to be applied in the traditional -- in the traditional test. And, Justice Breyer, you asked the question, what are you going to do with a situation where you have the embedded patent and you have the case like this one where we're going along with our process and we've got our source code and we've done all of the hard work, and they go along and come up with some sort of more vague idea and show up at our doorstep and, one, claim that we've got to stop doing what we're doing, or, worse in other cases, we're going to find situations where it's embedded in a manufacturing process. Mr. Waxman says, well, in that situation equity will step in. Not so under the Federal equities kind of a consideration, and that's irrebuttably presumed to favor the plaintiff under the Mr. Chief Justice, I know, as well as you know, that Judge Bryson understands the four-factor test and the abuse of discretion standard. And what he did in this case was to go through each of the findings of the district court with respect to the use of the -- of the licensing arrangements, the failure to commercialize this, not being in the business, and said, does any of these rise to the level of the kind of public interest concern that is the only legitimate consideration this court will use in deciding whether or not the district court can justify not granting an injunction in a particular case, instead of what is clearly the traditional approach of equity, which is to say, look at the -- the primary two issues, you know, the flip side of the same thing, so I'll just treat it the one way. Are money damages adequate in the specific case? That's the fundamental question that equity asks. That's the fundamental question that the district court found to be satisfied in this case. Money damages will get the job done. The right to exclude will be adequately protected by enhanced future. Beyond that, nothing more is required. That's the kind of decision that a district this entire litigation is uniquely suited to make a judgment. That judgment is entitled to respect on a classic abuse of discretion standard. The court of appeals long ago jettisoned that approach, and the time has come for this Court to say no, that's not what this Patent Act requires. The Patent Act says the right to exclude is important, but it's only protected by the principles of equity under section 283. That wasn't given here. We urge you to reverse the court of appeals. If there are no further questions, thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company v. White. Mr. Phillips.",
  "It has been endorsed by the EEOC, though.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Garre.",
  "Counsel, in -- in the absence of any suggestion that the collective bargaining process is also infected with sex discrimination, why can't we rely on that process to give some basis to the job descriptions? In other words, forklift operator was not a separate job from rail yard employee, and if the union wanted to make them separate jobs, they could negotiate that, but they didn't. So why -- why do we regard that as a material change when you're doing one part of a job as opposed to another part of a job?",
  "Well, but the difference there is that's an employer unilaterally. We don't have that here. The employer is dealing with the union. If the jobs really were that different, the union would categorize them differently and negotiate for that.",
  "Doesn't your approach require an employer to keep shuffling the employees around so they don't get a sort of adverse possession of particular types of job responsibilities?",
  "With respect to the suspension, what -- what if she had been -- during the process of investigation, she had been allowed to stay on the job with pay? In other words, the facts are the same. It's just that the -- the sort of stay process works the other way and she's not relieved until the end of the company's investigation. Is the initiation of that an materially adverse employment action?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Donati.",
  "What if she'd been operating the forklift for only a week and then she was reassigned? Would that still be discrimination under any standard?",
  "Counsel, you said earlier that the act -- one of the protections against trivial charges was that the act had to be the act of the employer. If the employer sets up a review system in which the final act of the employer is the decision, why is a preliminary charge, initial suspension, review -- why are those also considered acts of the employer?",
  "What does that mean, it was not covered by the collective bargaining agreement? Presumably you paid -- the person who did that was paid wages pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.",
  "Right.",
  "Your position is that it would be an -- it would be a covered employment action even if none of that were true, she didn't lose pay, she didn't lose benefits, so long as there was the initiation of the disciplinary action. You regard that as sufficiently adverse under 704.",
  "Other than eligibility for punitive damages.",
  "What -- what if she operated the forklift usually 3 out of 5 days, and the other 2 days was pulling up the rail ties and -- and the shift was now she does -- operates the forklift 2 out of 5 days and 3 out of 5 days she's pulling up rail ties? Is that materially adverse?",

  "The assumption of the hypothetical is, I take it, that the Washington State judges would deliberately violate our holding of a matter of constitutional law in imposing the enhancement.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Millett. Mr. Link.",
  "Counsel, you asked for an instruction on the lesser offense of aiming a firearm. Under that provision of Washington law, does the firearm have to be operable as well?",
  "So you ask for an instruction assuming that the firearm at issue in this case was operable.",
  "But if the firearm were not operable, you would not have been entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser offense of aiming a firearm. Correct?",
  "Counsel, what your trial counsel said was that the -- I'm quoting from the joint appendix, page 30 -- the allegation and the basis on which this case was tried was under the theory of firearm. It seems inconsistent with your representation that nobody had an idea that they were trying this under the theory of a firearm.",
  "Ms. Millett tells us that that only applies on remand under -- under the Hughes case.",
  "Well, doesn't -- isn't that true in Neder as well?",
  "Well, but the special verdict form still was.",
  "And do you know if the information went to the jury in this case?",
  "Well, the other way of looking at it is it's based on trying to understand what the jury meant when it said deadly weapon when the only evidence of a deadly weapon they were presented was a firearm.",
  "And in Neder, even if the jury had been asked to rule on materiality, it could have decided not to rule according to the evidence. The same argument applies in Neder.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Whisman, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "And those are the sort of considerations that can be taken into account under harmless error analysis. Right? The absence of notice, the prejudice. I would have put on this evidence if I had known I was accused of using a handgun.",

  "We'll hear argument first in United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Well, but what if -- just to take an example, let's suppose there are two possible defenses you could raise, entrapment and that you didn't do it. And one lawyer wants to argue entrapment and the other wants to, you know -- the one that you want is the one who said we'll argue you didn't do it. Don't you have a right to have a lawyer present the defense along the lines you want presented as opposed to having to take another lawyer that is different than your choice?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, did I understand your brief to suggest that the -- I understand your main burden is to overturn the idea of automatic reversal.",
  "But if there were a standard, is your standard of prejudice the same as under Strickland, or is it a different standard?",
  "That's the right of assistance of counsel for his defense. Right?",
  "Not for the fuller expression of his autonomy.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Mr. Fisher.",
  "You would require -- if -- if a defendant is on his second choice and he's filed an affidavit saying, you know, the guy did a great job. I can't think of a way he would have done anything differently. I was convicted. I'm perfectly happy with his strategy, but I didn't get my first choice. You would still require reversal of the conviction in that case.",
  "And -- and if -- if he were not able to afford a -- afford an attorney and one were appointed for him and that lawyer were incompetent, that client would still have to show prejudice. But in your case, you don't have to show anything at all.",
  "Does a -- someone relying on appointed counsel have the same right? Why can't he say to the first person who comes through the door, you know, I've got a -- I'd like to see the others before I make a choice?",
  "Why not?",
  "How many lawyers -- you're talking about a very refined assertion of a constitutional right. I mean there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of lawyers, and what you're saying is that if he doesn't get choice one, choice two is just not going to do, no matter how close, no matter how similar their approaches are going to be. It's not like he's, you know, wants a Rolls Royce and he gets a -- you know, whatever -- a Yugo or something. He could choose, you know, the next best out of hundreds and hundreds of thousands.",
  "Well, why not?",
  "Well, why not in the case of an acquittal? There's still a violation of the Sixth Amendment. Maybe you don't have an appeal, but you have a 1983 action. Right? Because your constitutional rights have been violated because, although you won, you didn't win with the counsel of your choice. And if -- your personal autonomy interests have been quashed.",
  "It wouldn't be harmless under your theory because your theory is that this is giving expression to your personal autonomy. It's not simply for your defense. If it were harmless, it would say that it's totally wrapped up in the defense. But there's another constitutional interest under your theory.",
  "Counsel, I suppose this -- this right applies on appeal as well. Right? Somebody says, I want Mr. Fisher to argue my case in the Supreme Court. I don't want anybody else. And -- and yet -- and we get motions for admission to our bar pro hac vice. If we deny one of those, does that violate the Sixth Amendment?",
  "That -- that happens all the time. That happens, for example, in the case of incompetent counsel. There's a right to -- to competent counsel. If you -- if that right is violated, the defendant still has to show prejudice --",
  "-- before he'll get relief.",
  "Some of the --",
  "Some of the concerns about the evidentiary presentation were addressed by the Seventh Circuit and are the reason they adopted a -- a lesser standard than the prejudice standard in -- in Strickland. Why isn't that adequate to meet those concerns?",
  "Well, but then you wouldn't -- I'm sorry to interrupt you. But at that point, the defendant would be well advised to go ahead with trial with his second-choice lawyer. Right?",
  "Take his chance and then if he -- if he loses, he gets automatic reversal. So why would he do mandamus?",
  "In the government, you're including the court in that.",
  "That's not always true in a Strickland case. It's often the court that's making the mistakes that the lawyer should have objected to and was incompetent in not doing so.",

  "-- the -- the argument you're making is really one of invited error, and I'm not sure it even applies on these facts. I mean, the -- the defense lawyer didn't, as you hypothesized in one of your answers, say something to the effect of don't worry, you don't need to make any findings of the ends of justice or anything like that. He just said I'm waiving my speedy trial rights, and that may mean he's not gong to argue, you know, that the ends of justice don't justify it or whatever. He's just saying I don't have any objection. Maybe he assumed that the judge would go on and say, okay, I'm making the findings required by subsection 8(a).",
  "Why do you -- why do you put that in a separate category? It's kind of unusual for Congress to put that type of a requirement in the statute. They could have normally -- I suspect they normally would write it. You know, you -- you -- they're excludable only if the court finds in the interest of justice. But they went further and they said if the court sets forth orally or in writing in the record of the case. I mean, they set it forth as a separate requirement. I don't know that we can give it sort of a second-class status.",

Some think they should; some think they shouldn't. And somebody suggests a compromise. The compromise is we won't put it in the statute, but we'll put it in the report and we'll let the courts figure it out. What should happen in that situation?",
  "Well if that's not this case, what in the world prevented the conferees from putting something as important in this context as expert fees, as I understand it, probably more important than attorneys' fees -- what prevented them from putting that in the statute if that clearly was their intent?",

Your position is that if this same scenario had taken place in 1988 as opposed to 1986, that your position would not be the same.

  "Why is that, Counsel? Let's suppose that the -- one of the cases that come up is a language difficulty. The individual -- maybe he's not in uniform -- identifies himself as a police officer. Could the State have a rule that, \"We are not going to allow evidence of language concerns,\" that the individual didn't speak English, and the officer said, \"I'm a police officer,\" so he didn't know, when he shot him?

  "But those are the only two.",
  "So this would be a pretty unusual creature that you're asking us to sanction.",
  "But the reason is there are two separate questions. They just happen to be identical. But I mean, the State court isn't going to worry about whether removal is appropriate or not. It doesn't have to answer that question, but it may well have to answer the question whether it's preempted. It happens to be the same analysis, at least under a reading of the statute, but that doesn't meant that you -- that just because a review of the removal decision -- the remand decision is -- is precluded, that review of the preemption decision is precluded.",
  "Counsel --",
  "Counsel, if you -- on the removal question, if there's a dispute about whether it's a covered class action, dispute about the number of people involved, the dollar amount, I take it that is litigated at the jurisdictional stage?",
  "Okay. But you say that when it gets to whether it's a -- there's a -- involving a covered security, for some reason that can't be litigated at the jurisdictional stage.",
  "I'm sorry. No or yes? That that is not litigated at the jurisdictional stage?",
  "Why is that? There -- it's the same clause. What you can remove is a covered class action involving a covered security. So why do we have such different approaches to the different prongs?",
  "Right. And --",

  "Well, it says what can be removed is the covered class action involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection (b).",
  "Why would it have done that? That would have been a waste of time. I mean, you just say, as set forth in subsection (b). You're saying if they had repeated subsection (b) there, we'd have -- the case would come out the other way?",

  "Is that a sufficient basis for them to have gone into the backyard and proceed from there?",
  "They're just shouting. There are five people in the house shouting. It's 3:00 in the morning or whatever. Is that -- is that enough?",
  "Doesn't yelling so loudly you can't hear police knock at the door at 3:00 in the morning suggest that violence is at least imminent or may well be associated with what they're hearing?",
  "Any kind of assault. I gather it's an assault if you're just sort of a couple of guys pushing each other back and forth.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General McNulty.",
  "So if there were no punch in this case, would they have had a sufficient basis? 3:00 in the morning, loud shouting. Can they conclude, based on their experience, that's likely to escalate into violence and enter on that basis?",
  "Well, counsel, let's suppose you have a police officer who knows there's evidence in this house, but he doesn't have probable cause to get a warrant. And he also knows that the family is going to be reenacting the murder scene from some movie as part of the family reunion. And so he's there just at the time where the -- in the scene the one guy says, and now I'm going to kill you with this knife, and he says, ah, and he goes in. Now, subjectively we know that he has no basis for fearing violence, but a reasonable officer on the scene, hearing somebody say I'm going to kill you with this knife, would have a basis for entering. So under your test, is that entry permissible or not?",
  "Really.",
  "Oh, no. He knows. He knows. He heard this is what they do at the family reunion. They always reenact this.",
  "So he knows that there's no -- well, but that's the difference here between looking at the subjective motivation or what an objective, you know, officer would understand.",
  "Right.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Studebaker, we'll hear now from you.",
  "But they still didn't stop. I -- I read somewhere in the facts that only gradually, as each participant in the melee became aware of his presence, did they sort of stop. It wasn't that as soon as he entered, everything quieted down immediately.",

  "Couldn't they have gotten all -- wouldn't he have been able to testify to all of that without even entering the home?",
  "Well, not by you.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gray, you have 6 minutes remaining.",
  "Counsel, you have -- you have two questions presented. The second is whether this was sufficiently -- sufficiently exigent to fall under the exigent circumstances. But the first was whether the test should turn on the officer's subjective motivation. I haven't heard much about that this morning. How is that presented on these facts?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in 04-1170, Kansas versus Marsh. General Kline.",
  "Do we know that as a fact?",
  "Do we have a return of a verdict saying, \"We find these factors in equipoise\"?",
  "So, what we have is a situation where this is a theoretical possibility under the statute.",
  "Not a situation where this is what the jury has said.",
  "We're not talking, just -- we're not talking about a numerical equipoise. I -- there's three aggravators and three mitigators, in equipoise. And the -- presumably, the individual jurors can give what weight they think is appropriate to the mitigating factors. They can find all three aggravators met, and say, \"Well, I still think, under factor 18, that mercy ought to outweigh death.\"",
  "Of course, they have unfettered discretion with respect to the mitigating factors, don't they? Under --",
  "-- under factor 18, any other circumstance which they find serves as a basis for a sentence other than death.",
  "Thank you, General Kline. Ms. Woodman.",
  "But --",
  "But how realistic is that as a possibility when you're talking about abstract concepts as mitigating factors, like how much mercy should be shown? I mean, do you really think there's any juror who's going to say, \"All right, I'm giving -- I've found the aggravating circumstance that he killed two people, and I've found the aggravating circumstance that it was particularly heinous to slash the throat and leave the toddler to burn. But I also think that mercy ought to be shown. But, you know, it just happens to come up to exactly the level of the aggravating circumstances. So, I'm stuck. I don't know what to do.\" I don't think that's the way jurors would react. They either think that the need to show mercy or, the one before that, that he's a talented artist, outweighs the fact of the aggravating circumstances, or it doesn't. I just think it's an unrealistic supposition. And there's nothing in the statute -- they don't get an equipoise instruction. So, how -- I mean, is there any reason to think that jurors do come to that balance between such inchoate concepts in the first place?",
  "I think your --",
  "I think your analogy took away what I would have regarded as the basis for my question. I think it may well be true that people have difficulty deciding between two portraits. I'm not sure people come to the sense that someone who's guilty of allowing a 19-month-old to burn to death and slashing the throat of her mother thinks it's equally balanced when they're inclined to show mercy, for whatever reason. It seems to me they either make a determination that the circumstances of his upbringing, emotional instability outweigh the responsibility for what they had found to be aggravating factors, or they determine that the aggravating factors outweigh the fact that they may show mercy for other basis. I just -- I can see thinking two portraits are indistinguishable. I just don't see a juror functioning and saying, \"I just can't decide whether to show mercy or to convict for death.\" And they're equally balanced. I understand the idea they may debate it with the other jurors, but, to come and say, \"You know, I just can't decide,\" it seems to me that the -- particularly since they can put as much weight into the mitigating factors as they want -- they can say, \"I want to show a lot of mercy,\" they can say, \"I want to show a little bit of mercy\" -- but to say that, \"I want to show just enough mercy that is exactly balanced,\" I don't understand that.",
  "But the verdict that the jury returns is a verdict of death. They do not return a verdict saying, \"We're in equipoise,\" and then the death sentence is imposed by operation of law. The verdict imposed is, \"We do not find -- we find these aggravating circumstances. We find they're not outweighed. And, therefore, we sentence the defendant to death.\"",
  "So, how is it --",
  "-- how is it -- is there any question about how it's going to come out when they take it up again?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Woodman. General Kline, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, General Kline. The case is submitted. [Whereupon, at 1:54 p.m., the case in the",
  "We'll hear argument next in 05-200, Empire Healthchoice Assurance v. McVeigh. Mr. Shelley.",
  "But this is a fairly indirect way of establishing a Federal cause of action. I mean, it -- it's a preemption provision. Why isn't it reasonable to assume Congress thought there was no need for a Federal cause of action? Because it's a contract action. State courts handle those every day, and they assumed they'd be handled by State court.",
  "I noticed you referred in your brief to the Jackson Transit line of authority. Do you know how many times Jackson Transit has been cited in the last 20 years by this Court?",
  "It's not been cited. I think it's never been applied and it's not been cited once in 20 years. So what's the line of authority?",
  "We're not talking about the contract between you and the Federal Government. We're talking about some other agreement between you and an individual employee.",
  "Well, that may give rise to a separate agreement, a related agreement, if you will, between you and the employee. But it's not -- it's not a -- you're not the Government. The employee is not the Government, at least not for these purposes. So why is it a Government contract?",
  "So if the Government says -- Congress says, we think OPM should have a recreation center for its employees and it should have all these things, and then OPM enters into a contract with a company that runs recreation centers -- okay -- that's a contract with the Government. And then that entity enters into a contract with somebody else to supply the basketball hoops. Would you say that that last contract is a Government contract?",
  "Yes.",
  "Even if the provision -- even if at some point Congress said, and besides, you know, the basketball hoops should be -- you know, made in America as opposed to somewhere else and, you know, specifies the terms of the subcontract.",
  "Could you -- following up on Justice Ginsburg's question, could you intervene asserting rights of subrogation in the underlying tort suit that your covered beneficiary brought in State court?",
  "Well, wouldn't it be more efficient for you to intervene in the pending State suit and get it all resolved at once rather than waiting until your beneficiary gets a recovery and then starting a whole other Federal suit over this somewhat subsidiary subrogation point?",
  "Well, at that point, you'd be able to assert your argument under the Federal preemption provision that says, in my view somewhat surprisingly, that these contract terms preempt State law.",
  "That would have been a good time for them to say we want a Federal -- Federal court jurisdiction over these causes of actions if that's what they had in mind, but they didn't do that.",
  "Oh, there sure was. For those who like to look at the legislative history, the House report said that -- again, it's very curious language. It said, this change will help strengthen the case in favor of Federal jurisdiction, or something like that.",
  "Well, since when is Congress trying to strengthen -- they either decide it's going to be Federal jurisdiction or not. They don't try to make arguments.",
  "Is --",
  "Is there any comparable situation where a contract between two private parties has the effect of preempting State law? Suppose all you have to do in your service benefit plan is agree with your beneficiaries that in the case of subrogation, you're entitled to, you know, 10 times actual damages, if they don't pay up right away or something like that. And -- and that would override all sorts of State law. You could specify you're entitled to interest at 20 percent and that would preempt State usury laws?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "Isn't there -- isn't that a big leap? I mean, even if we agree with you that there are Federal rights and duties, is it irrational for Congress to determine, since they arise in a normal breach of contract action, we're going to assume they're going to be brought in State court? The cause of action is for breach of contract that every State recognizes.",
  "But wouldn't it have been the easiest thing for Congress to say, as it does countless times when it creates Federal rights, that Federal courts have jurisdiction to enforce these rights? And they didn't do that here.",
  "Well, ERISA has a very clear preemption provision too, and that's generated a fair amount of work for us.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan. Mr. Stock.",
  "And I suppose that the preemption provision would apply equally if this were brought in State court or Federal court. Correct?",
  "But -- but the preemption provision, at least with respect to the rights of Empire, would ensure uniformity. In other words, if the contract terms preempt State law, then any impediment to recovery by Empire that varies from State to State would be overridden.",
  "No, I understand that. But to the extent people are concerned about disuniformity from the point of view of the Federal recovery, the preemption provision is going to apply whether this action is in State court or Federal court.",
  "But the only question that we're considering today is whether or not Federal question jurisdiction exists to authorize bringing this suit in Federal court.",
  "Well, they've already said that. I mean, there would be Federal jurisdiction there because the Federal Government would be a party to the case. Right?",
  "Thank you very much, Mr. Stock. Mr. Shelley, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "I wonder if you could focus on one question for me. If you have a State law cause of action and the law to be applied to some aspects of that cause of action is Federal law, is that sufficient to establish Federal question jurisdiction or not?",
  "Counsel --",
  "-- the -- the Grable case said, though, that the Federal question had to be a necessary element of the State law cause of action. That's not always the case in these cases, is it?",
  "It's only -- the -- the Federal question comes up only on issues of preemption. They may or may not be presented in a particular case.",
  "Well, that kind of -- that begs the -- that's not the question I asked and it sort of begs the question. I mean, you have the State law cause of action to enforce your contract claim, and if there's some State law that's asserted against you that's inconsistent with the contract, then you have the Federal question issue. But that's the only Federal question I see in the case.",
  "My hypothetical that I started with was assuming you have a State law claim, a State law cause of action. So do you have any authority other than Grable for the proposition that a State law cause of action which -- in which the law to apply may or may not turn on Federal law in particular aspects presents a Federal question?",
  "Thank you very much, Mr. Shelley. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Dixon v. United States. Mr. Jett.",
  "What do you do with Martin against Ohio?",
  "Well, there may be -- there may be crimes where duress would vitiate an intent element, but there may be other crimes where it wouldn't. And -- and I don't understand your argument to be -- is it that in every case duress negates an element of the crime or only in some cases?",
  "Well, counsel, under your view, how -- how is the Government supposed to prove a negative in every case? How are they supposed to prove the absence of duress?",
  "But that's something that -- but self-defense is something that's often a -- a factual element that you can discern from the circumstances of the crime. The -- the other guy had a gun, you know, that sort of thing. So if it's going to be presented -- so it's something that's within the control of either side. Duress is something that in this case the Government would have no reason to suppose that it was even implicated until it's raised, and then they have no way of getting at what the particulars are because they're all within the control of the defendant.",
  "But I thought the gist of her duress defense was not that she was under duress when she was purchasing the guns, but that she had reason to believe that her children were being threatened by accomplices or associates of -- of this -- this individual. And there's nothing in the facts of the -- the scene that would lead the Government to have any access to that evidence.",
  "What about a defense that I was on drugs and -- and didn't know what I was doing because of that and couldn't form the requisite intent? Does the Government have to disprove that as well?",
  "How is the Government -- how would the Government do that?",
  "A person just says, I was -- I was on, you know, PCP or whatever and -- and I couldn't form the requisite intent.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gornstein.",
  "So there may be cases where the nature of the mens rea required would require the Government to disprove duress.",
  "The sort of crimes where -- where your culpability depends on your motive. Right?",
  "It would be an easy example.",
  "What about a -- you know, a hate crime, a bias crime, you know, an act of violence done with a particular motive or intent? And the -- and the suggestion is I didn't do this because of a particular motive. I did this because they had a gun to the head of my children.",
  "Before you get there, what -- roughly speaking, how much of the Model Penal Code has Congress enacted into the criminal --",
  "Some judges too. Right?",
  "When was this -- the underlying statute at issue here enacted?",
  "Well, would we -- would our -- would our nose count be today or would our nose count be when the criminal statute was --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Jett, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Jett. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Mohawk Industries v. Williams. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Well, unless somebody raises it. Unless somebody raises it below to preserve it for the rehearing en banc or -- or some other way.",
  "So -- so that if you charged --",
  "So that if you charged the workers, you know, $10 for their fake ID cards, you think that would be a different case.",
  "Because there, that's -- there, you -- you -- there's a separate enterprise basically selling ID cards, and that's not part of Mohawk's business. But if you're just hiring them the way you hire other employees, illegally as it's alleged, that's Mohawk's enterprise if there's some separate illegal activity?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Foster.",
  "There may be no dispute about it, but it does seem kind of strange to encompass them under the term individuals when the same statute uses individuals and corporations separately.",
  "Well, it's not defined in the statute, but the prior list in the same sentence says individual, partnership, corporation. So you'd assume whatever an individual is it's different than a corporation or they wouldn't have had to say corporation again.",
  "What is there different about your proceeding to treat this as a RICO enterprise that isn't covered by normal corporate criminal conspiracy law? What does RICO add here?",
  "So they hire more than one person.",
  "How is that different than a normal contractual relationship that a corporation is going to have with any number of suppliers, vendors, agents?",
  "No, but I'm trying to see what RICO adds to the normal conspiracy law --",
  "-- that would otherwise be applicable. So we're assuming that the arrangement is there and that they're engaging in illegal activity.",
  "But Congress didn't -- to be fair, Congress did not enact RICO because it was concerned that criminal conspiracy law, applied to corporations, didn't adequately touch interstate commerce. The whole point is that they had something significantly different in mind, and your allegations in the complaint seem to be fully met by application of criminal conspiracy law.",
  "I'm trying to give you a chance to explain why this looks like RICO rather than just criminal conspiracy. And you've come up you said interstate commerce. There's got to be more than one. Well, none of that really suggests a distinction. What -- what is it that makes this a RICO case rather than just a criminal conspiracy case?",
  "There's a pattern because they hired more than one.",
  "Thank you, counsel. And Mr. Stewart.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Hill v. McDonough. Mr. Doss.",
  "Well, that probably will be what will be alleged. Of course, you don't know when -- at this proceeding, we have no idea, if we rule in your favor, what alternative the State is going to provide, and I am willing to bet whatever that alternative is that it will be subject to a challenge under a new 1983 suit. There would be no claim preclusion if you didn't know what the alternative was at this point. Right?",
  "Would it be -- if -- if in the future, if States specify the method of execution in the sentence, then you would not have a 1983 action. Is that correct? Because you would then be challenging the sentence, and it would have to be brought under habeas.",
  "Well, you -- you alleged in your complaint -- I'm looking at footnote 3 -- that you assumed they were going to follow the same protocol as in Sims.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Snurkowski, we'll hear now from you.",
  "Counsel, I would have thought your -- your answer to the line of questioning earlier was that the reason that the Petitioner has to come up with this -- an alternative is that otherwise it's plausible, at least, to suspect the reason he's bringing the action is as a challenge to the execution itself rather than the particular method. And that if it's a challenge to the execution itself, it has to be brought under habeas. If it's just a challenge to the method, it can be brought under 1983. If he's unwilling to say there is a valid method, then it starts to look like a challenge to the execution that has to be brought under habeas.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam, we'll hear now from you.",
  "And presumably there's some range between most humane and what's cruel and unusual. Right?",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, several of the emergency death proceedings we've had involving this question, the district court judges have assumed that it could proceed under 1983 but then denied relief because it was brought on the eve of execution, as this one was. Is that option available to the district court in this case if it's sent back?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Doss, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Do you think there was adequate time for the district court to fully consider the evidence you intended to present and consider your claim and still proceed with the execution that was scheduled?",
  "You filed your case 4 days before the execution.",
  "The Sims protocol was there as a matter of public domain. You said in your complaint yourself, when you didn't get any information, you said, well, I assume they're going to follow Sims. Why wasn't that assumption valid 3 months before, 6 months before, or a year before?",
  "No. You alleged the exact opposite in footnote 3. You said when they stonewalled you, we assumed they were going to follow Sims.",
  "Finish.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear reargument this morning in Hudson v. Michigan. Mr. Moran.",
  "So wouldn't it be more accurate to say that it's protected the right to be free from unreasonable entry as opposed to unreasonable search and seizure?",
  "Mr. Moran, how -- how long do you think the officers had to wait before they could have entered?",
  "Yes.",
  "What would -- if they had done that, what would have been different from what happened in this case?",
  "Why do you presume that? Someone sitting in a chair with gun -- with a gun and the drugs you say would have gotten up and said, oh, it's the police. Let's see what they want?",
  "Isn't a good sign of what might have happened what actually happened when the police came in, which was there was an effort to hide the evidence?",
  "I thought -- where -- where were the drugs found?",
  "Where was the gun found?",
  "In the chair?",
  "Is there any reason to suppose that if the officers had waited 15 seconds instead of the 3 to 4, that they wouldn't have found the same evidence?",
  "Well, the only -- the only reason they wouldn't have found the same evidence, I take it, is if they -- if -- if the defendants had had additional time to dispose of it.",
  "That's not true. There are cases where the violation of the knock and announce rule gives rise to evidence that may be admitted and that would presumably be excluded if you can show that the seizure is related to the violation. The problem here is that the evidence that is being suppressed, as -- as you've suggested, that there's no question that it would have been available if the officers had waited 15 seconds as opposed to 4 seconds.",
  "The Solicitor General hypothesized one in the amicus briefs. If somebody -- you know, they -- they burst in and someone screams, you know, run away, it's the police, that excited utterance caused by the absence of a knock and announce would presumably be related to the violation and could be suppressed. That doesn't mean that the gun and the drugs that are found in the room is in the same category.",
  "What it is is recognizing that if there is a fruit of the illegal act, it is suppressed so that there is a cost to the illegal act. What it's saying is that not everything that happens after the illegal act is a fruit of the illegal act.",
  "I'm sorry. A particularized showing of what?",
  "I'm vaguely recalling cases from the court of appeals in the D.C. Circuit that accepted a presumption that if there are drugs around, there are likely to be firearms around. Are you saying that that's inconsistent with the Richards decision?",
  "But those doctrines that you're talking about would be overridden on the hypothetical that you want us to be concerned about. In other words, you're saying if you don't suppress the evidence, there's going to be no incentive to comply with the law. So they're going to deliberately violate the law. Well, if they're deliberately violating the law, qualified immunity isn't going to help them very much.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Moran. Mr. Baughman, we'll hear now from you.",
  "Isn't that an example where there's a violation of the Fourth Amendment that is brought up and yet suppression is not the --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Baughman.",
  "Mr. Salmons.",
  "There's no doubt in here that an invasion of the home was authorized by the warrant. Right?",
  "The interest we're talking about is not the sanctity of the drawers. It is 10 seconds that the officers should have waited additionally, according to the -- to your brother.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Salmons. Mr. Moran, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "You think there -- you think there was a violation of the knock and announce rule in this case. Correct?",
  "So you draw a distinction between two cases? If they illegally entered and they suddenly said we waited 4 seconds, it was supposed to be 15. They say, never mind. They go back out. There's another knock. They wait 15 and they come in. Then it's all right. Correct?",
  "Okay. But you're saying it's a world of difference if, when they go in and enter and they say, we should have waited 10 more seconds, we're the police, we're here to execute a search warrant, let's count to 10, then all of a sudden, it's invalid from there on. Those are the -- they're two different cases in your mind?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Ayers versus Belmontes. Mr. Johnson.",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, that's what they were told, right? They're instructed that the mitigating circumstances, including factor (k), are merely examples, right?",
  "This Court, in Payton, said that it was not unreasonable to conclude that evidence of remorse extenuated the gravity of the crime. So, why wouldn't an instruction to the jury along the lines of Justice Stevens's hypothetical have been perfectly constitutional as extenuate the gravity of the crime that's interpreted in Brown versus Payton?",
  "The prosecutor didn't object to any of this mitigating -- mitigation evidence that was submitted by the defendant, did he?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Multhaup.",
  "Why does that --",
  "Why does that matter? Because the jury was told that the factors were merely examples of the mitigating evidence they could consider.",
  "It probably didn't fit into factor (h), either, but it doesn't matter.",
  "Before you move on, Counsel - -",
  "-- don't you - -",
  "-- don't you have to address the Teague question a little bit? You -- you're entitled to this new rule adopted by the Court of Appeals only if it was dictated by precedent at the time the judgment became final. Isn't that kind of a hard argument to make in light of our subsequent decision in Brown v. Payton?",
  "Of Boyde? It's straightforward application of Boyde?",
  "Well, Penry was considerably tightened by the subsequent decision in Graham versus Collins, though.",
  "No, I know Payton was an AEDPA case, but it, nonetheless, concluded that it was not unreasonable for the California Supreme Court to read instruction (k) in a way that allowed this evidence to be considered. And I would have thought, if it was not unreasonable to have that reading, that the contrary reading that you're proposing, and that the Ninth Circuit adopted below, could hardly be said to have been dictated by existing precedent.",
  "Because if it was - -",
  "-- because, even if incorrect, it was, nonetheless, reasonable. And I'm just having trouble understanding how, if a contrary position is dictated by precedent under Teague, a reading 180 degrees the opposite of that could be regarded by this Court as reasonable.",
  "Well, I - -",
  "Graham didn't win his case.",
  "Well, there is no evidence on that question presented, right? The reason that the possibility of psychiatric treatment couldn't be considered is because neither party had put evidence on that question before the jury.",
  "No, no. It's a question of what mitigating evidence was put before the jury. The jurors couldn't consider that, because it was the -- quite proper for the trial judge to say, \"You can't consider that, because there was no evidence on it.\"",

  "Mr. Kester, would it - -",
  "-- would it -- would your position be different if the contract contained a specific -- the license -- a specific provision specifying that the licensee may not sue?",
  "You -- do you think such a provision would be enforceable?",
  "Well, let's look at what might be a matter of jurisdictional law. I take it, from your position, there's nothing preventing Genentech from suing, either, is there? In other words, to establish the validity of their patent.",
  "Against licensees?",
  "Oh, but the patentee would just say, \"Look, we have a license. I think the patent's valid, and you owe me a dollar a unit.\" The licensee said, \"Well, I don't think they're -- it's valid, so I owe you nothing.\" And they settle on a license for 50 cents. Why can't the patentee say, \"You know, if I get a judicial decision establishing that the patent is valid, I can charge a higher license, either when this agreement expires or for other licenses\"?",
  "I'm trying to see how far you want -- are willing to push your argument that just because there's been an agreement, or perhaps even a settlement, that that somehow or another doesn't moot the controversy, the underlying legal dispute. And it -- I gather your answer to me is that Genentech, or a patentee, can sue, even though they have an existing -- they're getting royalties from the licensee, they can still sue the licensee.",
  "So, there's no way, I - - under your view, that a patent holder can protect itself from suit through any license arrangement or any agreement of any kind.",
  "-- think - -",
  "-- if you don't think - -",
  "Well, then why are you paying it, if you -- if you don't think you owe it?",
  "Because of the threat of treble damages - -",
  "-- and injunction.",
  "If we're trying to figure out where the public policy is here, why don't we give some weight to those congressional enactments that obviously fortify the strength of the patent? In other words, Congress passed these provisions providing for treble damages for attorneys' fees. And - -",
  "-- and to respond that there's got to be a public policy to counterbalance that, Congress can always do that, if it wants; but it didn't - - it thinks that you need these provisions to protect the patent holders.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kester. Ms. Maynard.",
  "How do you ever end these things? Let's say they have this dispute, they bring the litigation, and they settle it. They're saying, \"Okay, we're going to settle it. Instead of paying a license fee of 50 cents, it's going to be 40 cents, and we'll go on.\" Then they can sue again, I take it.",
  "Can they settle that, by the way? Is it all right to settle it, or is -- that interfere with the policy that patents have to be open to challenge?",
  "Either one.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, I think you overread Pope. All Pope said was that they're not going to grant specific performance. In fact, they've said, \"Whatever you may think of the policy here, we don't - - specific performance calls on the equitable discretion, and we're not going to do it.\" But, I don't read Pope as holding that the clauses are otherwise unenforceable. In --",
  "-- other words you're maybe entitled to damages. And that may be measured by the license fee that you agreed to pay.",
  "Well, you don't think that matters, though, do you? I mean, even if they all agree there's no dispute about what the license agreement means, your position is still the same, right? There is an Article III controversy because they challenge the validity of the patent?",
  "Is - -",
  "-- that always the case? I mean, could -- can you enforce a license agreement based on an invalid patent? You thought it was valid -- parties had a dispute about it -- whether it is valid. You entered into agreement, say, \"Well, let's split the difference. We'll -- you know, 50 cents rather than a dollar or nothing.\" It's determined that the patent is invalid. Can the patentee then still say, \"Well, you still owe me the money. We've, kind of, cut -- split the difference. That was part of the agreement\"?",
  "Well, but that -- it's been pointed out that was pursuant to an injunction.",
  "Do you think - -",
  "Do you think there would be a case or controversy if Genentech were suing to establish the validity of its patent?",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Mahoney.",
  "Well, isn't there - -",
  "-- true adversity? I thought the assumption underlying the -- everybody's hypothetical is that, if the patent is determined to be invalid, that the license -- then the license agreement is also invalid. Is that -- is that right?",
  "Can you -- can you - -",
  "-- can you collect - - can a patentee collect license fees based on an -- patent that has been determined to be invalid?",
  "It would - -",
  "It would be pursuant to the agreement.",
  "Collective - -",
  "Even if - -",
  "-- the royalty agreement says, you know, \"We have a dispute about the validity of this patent. We don't know. We disagree. And so, we've entered into a compromise royalty rate that reflects the uncertainty.\" But once it's determined to be invalid, the license fees are not collectible.",
  "I thought your argument -- I'm sorry.",
  "What about the fact that it's under protest?",
  "Well, their concrete right is, as I thought you conceded earlier, that if the patent is declared invalid, they will not owe license fees.",
  "Well, that's what - -",
  "-- a declaratory judgment action does, though, isn't it?",
  "Ms. Mahoney, you argue, in the alternative, that we should dismiss it on the basis of equitable considerations under the Declaratory Judgment Act. We can't reach that argument unless we rule against you on the Article III question. Is that right?",
  "We would have to be assuming that we had jurisdiction, wouldn't we?",
  "Under Article III?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Mahoney. Mr. Kester, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "But was it raised before the Federal Circuit?",
  "Yes.",

  "We'll hear argument next in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications. Mr. Fisher.",
  "In your answer for why they can't, Justice Souter's comment is a classic, this is what administrative agencies do all the time in typical rate regulations. They make a determination that utility shareholders have to bear this cost. The rate payers can bear this cost. And at the end of the day, it is a determination that a rate is reasonable or unreasonable. And it seems to me that that is just what is involved here. I don't know why their determination about how to allocate who has to collect the rates, and whether they can pass them on or not makes it an impermissible interpretation of what's unjust or unreasonable under 201.",
  "When you say it was always thought of as being triggered by 276, did the FCC reference 201 in issuing its determination that a failure to follow these regulations was unjust and unreasonable?",
  "It doesn't cover certain practices in connection. It covers all practices in connection.",
  "So you are saying that, putting aside 276, it would clearly be impermissible for the FCC to say one way that long distance carriers provide service to their customers is when those customers use pay phones; and, therefore, we're setting up this rate regime in connection with that service. You would say that would be outside the scope of 201(a)?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fisher. Mr. Englert?",
  "Well, but reasonably criticized for it. I would have thought your answer would be unjust or unreasonable has, for generations, been given a very expansive reading. And you don't need to say that the FCC has to do what typically I would have thought was a job for a court, which is to determine whether there's a private right of action to bring its action within a boilerplate term like unjust or unreasonable. I would have thought the contact point was what I was talking about with Mr. Fisher earlier, which is whether or not this is such communication service under 201(a), which is -- which is, again, I suppose, something that the agency gets deference on. But it would seem to me, that's where the limitation would come.",
  "Well, I think that's right, but that's also why I guess I don't regard it as particularly helpful that the FCC opines on what the consequences of its determination that something is unjust or unreasonable under the statute are, with respect to a private right of action.",
  "I saw that argument. I have to say I don't understand it. Why is it so difficult? I get a bill every month that easily sorts out which are interstate and which are intrastate.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Englert. Mr. Feldman?",
  "Do you have a position on whether or not Chevron deference is owed to the Commission's determination of whether or not their action creates or gives rise to a right of action?",
  "There are two different, it seems to me, two different Chevron questions. The one is the deference on its interpretation of what's unjust and unreasonable. The other is the question of whether or not they have anything to say about whether that means there is a private right of action in court.",
  "But it's never gotten deference, at least I guess from this Court, on whether or not there is or is not a right -- whether there is a right of action to enforce its regulations.",
  "So you would have a different position here if 276 said something like, we think there ought to be more pay phones; in order to promote investment in pay phones, we're going to have this scheme. In other words, it has nothing to do with whether it's fair or not, it's a subsidy. Then you'd say that could be something that's not covered by the \"just and reasonable\" provision?",
  "That's not true. You can say that this is a way you make a lot of money from your customers that you wouldn't otherwise make, because if there wasn't a pay phone there, they wouldn't be able to use your service.",
  "What about the cell phone example?",
  "But you don't know, the cell phone holder may be right next to the pay phone or he may be across the country.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fisher. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorrell. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Mr. Phillips, I may be lost a bit here. But I mean, which -- I'm looking at the instructions that were given. And it seems to me it is hard to take issue with the instruction on the railroad's part because it tracks the statutory language. The statute says in whole or in part, and the instruction says in whole or in part. So if you're pushing the doctrine of equivalence, your objection seems to be to the directly contributed language with respect to the employee, the plaintiff. Now, but doesn't directly contributed, isn't that a typical proximate cause instruction?",
  "Right. But on the other hand, you're also arguing in favor of proximate cause. You are saying Rogers didn't change proximate cause.",
  "So you would have us announce a decision on the doctrine of equivalence without saying which way it should be made equivalent? Raising the railroad's standard or lowering the employee's?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Ms. Perry? ON BEHALF OF THE Respondent",
  "Well, doesn't there have to be a doctrine of equivalence when you're running a comparative negligence regime? Because, you know, you talk about the plaintiff's negligence causing the harm to a certain degree and the defendant's negligence causing it to a certain degree. And if you're not dealing with apples and apples, it seems to me you can't conduct the comparison.",
  "Right. But we're talking about comparative negligence here, where there's negligence on both sides. And I just don't know how you say one party's 20 percent -- contributed 20 percent to the harm and the other 80 percent, if you're using different causation standards.",
  "You don't have any conceptual difficulty with adding in whole or in part to instruction 13, which is the employee's instruction, because it's comparative negligence. It seems to me that necessarily implies in whole or in part. If you can reduce his recovery because he's in part negligent, what would be wrong with saying in whole or in part in instruction 13?",
  "No, no. I thought Justice Souter's point was that taking it out of the railroad's instruction might cause confusion because of it. But I don't see how adding it to both of them when you're dealing with comparative negligence, and it's necessarily the case that partial negligence on either of their parts can enter into the verdict, I don't see how that can be confusing.",
  "You can answer it.",
  "Under that scenario, then, what objection could there be to a recognition that the negligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the accident?",
  "But that's what Justice Souter has identified, right? That's not because they're adopting different standards.",
  "Well, you just told me, a good reason for not putting in whole or in part in instruction 13 is because it doesn't make sense, the whole part doesn't make sense with contributory negligence. That's a good reason not to put it in Section 53 either.",
  "You don't have to say that. I mean, you know, when in doubt, we ought to follow the words of the statute. And so whole or in part makes sense with the railroad, but directly doesn't appear in Section 53. Why don't we just -- why shouldn't the instruction just say, \"such negligence of the plaintiff contributed to cause his injury.\" It's not going to be a complete bar because we know the immediate -- the next instruction talks about reducing the award by the amount of the negligence. Why wouldn't that be preferable to introducing extraneous terms?",
  "Well, no, but he requested that the instructions be the same, and the directly is what causes the problem, and directly doesn't appear in the statute.",
  "Do you think they raised an objection based on the doctrine of equivalence?",
  "That's what Rogers might have said, but the statute doesn't say anything about slight cause. It only says in whole or in part.",
  "Why isn't \"in whole or in part\" simply the logical corollary of introducing comparative negligence? Why do you have to read that as departing from proximate cause, instead of simply recognizing that under 53, negligence on the part of the employee can reduce recovery which -- without barring it?",
  "That's why you don't have \"in whole or in part\" in 53, not because they wanted to depart from proximate cause there, but because, as Justice Stevens pointed out, you wouldn't have it in whole or in part.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Perry.",

  "Well, it sits to decide whether people should be indicted, and yes, they're supposed to determine whether there's probable cause, but historically a significant role for the grand jury has been not to indict people even though the Government had the evidence to indict them.",

You talk about essential facts and material - - I mean, the statute makes it a crime to intentionally attempt to enter the United States having previously been deported and all that.

  "Counsel, the thing that concerns me about your case is that California's system looks a lot like the Federal system after Booker. We haven't addressed the issue or had a case involving review of reasonableness for upward departure. But at least as the circuits have said it, in a federal case, the district judge imposes a maximum, doesn't give any reason for departing from what the guidelines might suggest is a reasonable middle ground, he may be -- I think in most circuits, that would be reversed. Same here. If a California judge imposes the upper tier but doesn't make any findings, that's going to be reversed. But if a federal judge gives a statement of his reasons, you know, a vulnerable victim, or an offender likely to offend again, whatever, under most circuit law, that's going to be upheld. Here, if the California judge does that, that's going to be still struck down under your view. You talked about Blakely and Apprendi. But how does this system look to you under Booker?",
  "Under California, they're advisory anyway. I mean, even if the judge makes the necessary finding to get up into the higher tier, he doesn't have to impose the higher sentence, he can impose the lower one.",
  "My point is if he makes a finding that justifies going up to the higher term, 16 years in this case, he doesn't have to impose that higher term, he can go back to the middle term.",
  "So the only part of the California system that creates a problem is this -- the one sentence in the statute that says the judge shall impose the middle term unless he makes a finding.",
  "So that if we rule in your favor, the great benefit for criminal defendants in California will be that judges can now depart without making a particular finding, they can increase the sentence even though they do not find an aggravator within the limits of the California system.",
  "Doesn't the decision in Black suggest the Supreme Court thinks that would be the result? The California Supreme Court?",
  "I thought that -- it looked to me that's what they were trying to do in Black. I mean, in a way, it is kind of the -- the Black opinion, the day after, if this Court were to agree with you, and the California Supreme Court issued a decision looking a lot like its decision in Black, that would be perfectly valid. In other words, saying that judges can depart within this whole -- just like Booker, they can depart within this whole range, and we're going to review their determinations for reasonableness. They don't have to impose the middle sentence, they can impose a higher sentence, and we will review it for reasonableness. That would be perfectly all right.",
  "But what they said was judges can impose a sentence in either of the three -- any one of the three tiers, and we are going to review it for reasonableness. And if they don't make findings, it is going to be unreasonable, right?",
  "The protection that criminal defendants now have, that they cannot be sentenced to a higher term unless the judge makes particular findings, will then be no longer applicable.",
  "So that now the defendant will have the protection of his jury determining his guilt, will not only have to know the evidence of his guilt of the crime, but also know why he's likely to re-offend in the future, things like he used a firearm, all the bad things that will increase his sentence and might affect how the jury views the issue of guilt in the first place.",
  "And are there a half a dozen jury trials in each -- for each of those various aggravating factors that now have to be tried to the jury?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gold. Mr. Laurence.",
  "I'm sorry, before you -- could you tell me where the court rule you're talking about is set out?",
  "How many cases would have to be resentenced if we were to reverse in this case?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Laurence. Mr. Gold, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Well, Rule 4.410(b) says that the sentencing judge should be guided by the criteria in these rules.",
  "We have to conclude that the California Supreme Court has misread California law to agree with you, don't we?",
  "I mean, I see 1170(b). And I understand your argument, but when I read the California Supreme Court opinion in Black, it says, well, this is what it means. It doesn't seem to be what it means, but they get to interpret it, don't they?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gold. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Carey versus Musladin. Mr. Ott.",
  "We're looking under AEDPA at an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. What do you do in a situation where you think the state court has incorrectly articulated Supreme Court law, but nonetheless reached the correct result? In other words, correct understanding of the established Supreme Court law would have led to the same result as their incorrect articulation of it.",
  "Right. My hypothetical, and we'll debate later whether it is this case or not, is let's say that the state court wrongly articulates Supreme Court law. But under the correct articulation, it leads to the same result. What happens in that case under AEDPA?",
  "It misarticulated them. I guess the question of application is -- I mean, I assumed they reached what we would regard as the correct result under the correct standard, they just articulated the wrong standard. Your answer, I take it, is that it would then be reviewed without AEDPA deference?",
  "You don't need to establish that rule, do you? You just need to establish that what the Supreme Court determined was not an unreasonable application of this Court's law?",
  "How different is it from the victim's family sitting in the second row behind the prosecution every day of the trial? And I mean, I'm -- the hypothetical correctly focuses on the question, at least for me, of whether or not you can have specific applications of general rules that are clearly established. I'm just not sure your agreement with it is advisable because it seems to me that simply having -- how many people have to wear these buttons? One person shows up with a \"Hang Musladin\" button, does that mean it is a mob-dominated trial?",
  "All right.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Ott.",
  "Mr. Fermino?",
  "I don't understand your point about the state court focusing on Norris. The question under AEDPA is still whether or not it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.",
  "To wear any buttons? It says, \"Fair Trial.\"",
  "I mean, most -- I don't think -- a typical jury will understand that the victim is going to have a family, and they're going to be sorry that he's dead, and they might be there at his trial. And they may not like the person accused of murdering their son. That is not -- that is sort of like in every case. That's not -- the buttons don't seem to add much to what the jury will derive from seeing the family seated behind the prosecution bench.",
  "So what about -- what if the issue was mourning? The trial is being held and the families appear and they're all in black because they're still in mourning. Does that violate this clearly established rule?",
  "No, my question is under AEDPA, if the state court said, you know, I'm not going to keep the family out even in mourning, that would violate the clearly established rule that you've just articulated?",
  "You don't want to put your -- hang your hat on the \"contrary to\" prong, though, do you? Your argument, I thought, was an unreasonable application argument.",
  "Well, but, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, we've never even had a case involving spectators. So it's not contrary to clearly established law. We have cases stating the general principle on which it relies, so maybe it's an unreasonable application. But \"contrary to\" seems an awful stretch.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fermino.",
  "Mr. Ott, you have one minute remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Ott. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Osborn v. Haley. Mr. Grant.",
  "But the actual statutory language refers to acting within the scope of employment at the time of the incident, and so a certification based on the view that at the time of the alleged incident, he was acting entirely within his scope would seem to be within the language of the statute.",
  "Well how is it -- I mean, that line is awfully difficult to draw. You assert he didn't do it versus something else. But it's easy, let's say it's an assault case and the person says, you hit me, and the person says, well, it was entirely an accident; I was gesticulating with my hand so it wasn't, wouldn't have met the requirements for the tort. Now, are they denying the incident in that case?",
  "But it's not just a characterization. If it's something that has, for example, a mental element, the plaintiff can assert, you did that with malice aforethought and the defendant can say, no, I didn't. Now, is that a characterization or is that a denial of the incident?",
  "It's not for deciding whether removal -- I thought the statute says that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive with respect to removal.",
  "Well, what does it mean to say that the certification is conclusive with respect to scope of employment for purposes of removal if it doesn't mean that it's conclusive, if you're going to have judicial review that is going to address the question of removal as opposed to the validity of the certification on the merits?",
  "So you're saying it's only conclusive if it's right?",
  "There is at least considerable tension with 1447(d), though, and 2679(d)(2), in that that specifically says that for purposes of removal, the Attorney General's certification is conclusive. And it doesn't, if you look at 2679, it suggests, you'd think that case would proceed in Federal court rather than be immediately remanded without the availability of review.",
  "This is a different type of jurisdictional statute in that there is concern on Congress's part here to provide a Federal forum for the adjudication of whether something is within the scope of a Federal employee's duty. It's not inconceivable, but it would seem illogical to specifically provide for review of that determination but then have that review take place in State court rather than Federal court.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Grant. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.",
  "So what if the Attorney General certifies and removes a case in a criminal case, a case clearly not within the statute? What happens then?",
  "No, no, on the procedure, he follows the procedure meticulously; it's just wrong. It's a criminal case. The statute says he can do it in a civil case. On the other hand the statute also says that his certification is conclusive.",
  "Yes, this one is a civil one and that's a criminal, but I'm just trying to understand how broad your argument that this is not subject to further review goes.",
  "Well I thought your analogy to Willingham was a strong one until you go back and read the statute. Willingham is a very different statutory predicate. It's acting under color of law. This is much more specific. At the time of the incident, he was acting within his scope, so I'm not sure the analogy holds up.",
  "But yet that would be a good argument if the statute said the Attorney General can certify that the employee did not do anything outside the scope of his employment, but it's phrased in the affirmative. He has to certify that he was acting within the scope of his employment.",
  "But what happens in a case where the certification is clearly wrong? I mean, you get into a fight with your neighbor. It's got nothing to do with your employment at all but the Attorney General certifies that it does. You know: \"They are always thinking about your cases. You must have been thinking about it at the time.\" That certification goes into the district court. The district court looks at it and says this is ridiculous, throws it out, then that State law assault case proceeds in Federal court?",
  "Well, they wouldn't have discretion in that case, though, because the statute says the Attorney General's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal.",
  "I thought maybe your answer, one alternative answer, would have been that you can't remand the case but you can still dismiss it.",
  "It would still be conclusive for purposes of removal, but it doesn't mean it's conclusive for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction.",
  "Well, the jurisdiction wouldn't depend on that. Justice Ginsburg's point that there's more than pendent jurisdiction here I take it is because these are not separate State claims appended to what you thought was a Federal claim. This is the same claim that you initially thought was a Federal claim and then it turned into a purely State law claim, and that may be analyzed quite differently for purposes of jurisdiction.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Grant, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Well, there was nothing expressed about Thermtron, and yet we recognized an exception there.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Grant. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton. Mr. Andre.",
  "Well, we know under the statue they can dismiss a case because it's frivolous, right?",
  "Regardless of the substance of the claim on the merits, if you know that you've just ignored the exhaustion requirement isn't that a frivolous claim?",
  "But Rule 8 and the normal rules weren't addressed to the unusual situation under the PLRA where the district court has an affirmative obligation screen on its own before the defendant even gets involved. So if in fact, just to follow on Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, 80 percent of the cases have this exhaustion problem, why isn't this a reasonable means of facilitating the screening obligation?",
  "Well, but you just told me earlier that if it was a case in which exhaustion is required and not done that would be a frivolous claim, and the statute does refer to frivolous claims. So the district court or the Sixth Circuit has just said, we know that in a large number of cases they are going to be frivolous because they have ignored the exhaustion requirement, and we just want to try to find out which those cases are to fulfill the screening obligation, which takes this out of the normal Rule 8 type of case.",
  "You talk about the lack of statutory direction on the first two points but there is a very explicit statute on the third question. It says no action shall be brought until administrative remedies are exhausted. And yet you say the action should be allowed to be brought even if there are unexhausted claims in the complaint.",
  "This is a very different statutory scheme. This is designed to address the problem of an overwhelming number of frivolous complaints that result in the fact that meritorious complaints can be overlooked. We've got a haystack in a needle problem here. And if you allow the action to continue, that doesn't do anything to reduce the number of filing of claims that as you say should not have been brought.",
  "Well right, but you provide under your approach no incentive for the prisoner to leave those claims out. Instead what, a screening function turns into an editing function. The district court is supposed to just excise out the unexhausted ones but allow the exhausted ones to continue.",
  "How many prisoners pay the filing fee in the first place?",
  "They are not entitled to IFP status?",
  "Is that a draconian rule, do you think? You have to have three actions dismissed before you have to pay the filing fee?",
  "And the other incentive is if you adopt your rule, the incentive on the prisoner is to put in every possible claim, even if it is not exhausted because maybe it will get through, maybe it won't. And if it doesn't get through, no harm. He doesn't even have to pay another $50.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Andre. Ms. Olivieri.",
  "One reason to require total exhaustion is because, I would assume the prisoner may get sufficient relief if the claims are exhausted, that he doesn't feel the need to go forward with litigation. But I guess that's only true if the exhausted claims are still alive, and how many, when we're talking about unexhausted claims, are those typically claims that are not going to be available or are they claims that may generate relief once there is exhaustion?",
  "Counsel, you've mentioned in your brief that there has been a change in the Michigan grievance policy with respect to naming individuals. What is the consequence of that change for our ability to address that claim?",
  "I thought one of the objections to the Sixth Circuit rule from your friend was that this requirement of naming the individuals came out of thin air. And now we have that requirement articulated in the grievance policy. Does that make a difference?",
  "Did the Sixth Circuit have the current Michigan policy before them when they made their decision?",
  "Thank you, Counsel.",
  "Mr. Andre, you have five minute remaining.",
  "How is that? The prisoner is the one who presumably knows best whether or not he filed a grievance or not.",
  "This seems to me to be a stretch to say that the prison, which has how many prisoners under their jurisdiction, is in a better position to know in individual cases, an individual prisoner, what this prisoner did or didn't do with respect to the grievance process. Surely the prisoner is in the best position. He knows what he did or at least what he is going to allege.",
  "With respect, with respect to the naming of the individuals, is that claim moot because of the change in the policy?",
  "I thought your main argument before was they invented this requirement without any basis, but now it's an actual requirement in the grievance procedure.",
  "Future prisoners now do have fair notice because the grievance procedure says name the individuals, dates, names, places, names of all those all involved.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Philip Morris v. Williams. Mr. Frey.",
  "And when you do that, counsel, aren't you punishing the defendant for the harm to others? You're going to award a higher multiple with respect to the damages - -",
  "-- based on the conduct to others. Why wouldn't a normal juror think - -",
  "Excuse me. Why wouldn't a normal jury view that as punishing the defendant for the harm to others?",
  "Mr. Frey, I suppose your theory here depends on the nature of the underlying tort, I suppose, in that there are, you argue, defenses that might be available with respect to other, other individuals who are harmed.",
  "So this argument wouldn't apply in a case if the underlying tort weren't susceptible to those sorts of defenses.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frey. Mr. Peck.",
  "-- you object to in this instruction. I mean, and I thought our cases clearly established that you can consider the harm to others in assessing the reprehensible nature of the conduct. You don't disagree with that?",
  "On the other hand, you cannot -- on the other hand you cannot punish the defendant for those harms particularly in a case where the defendant might have defenses available with respect to those others. So I understood what the instruction sought to do is simply try to draw, it's a fine line but the reason it's a fine line is because of our prior cases, and it tried to draw that distinction between assessing reprehensibility and punishing for harm to others.",
  "Well, because the instructions indicate and juries often do this that punitive damages are certain multiple of the compensatory damages, and therefore that's what they are saying. In determining what that multiple should be you consider whether they have harmed others. And this instruction would make all the difference to the world in terms of what lawyers are going to be arguing about. If you're allowed to punish for harm to others, you say, well, there is however many, a thousand other people in the plaintiff's position, so a thousand times would be perfectly reasonable but you wouldn't say that the conduct is a thousand times more reprehensible. There is a more, there is a more natural limit on the multiple when you get this kind of instruction.",
  "One way to look at what it meant is what you argued below, I'm looking at the joint appendix page 199(a), the plaintiff's counsel in Oregon to the jury: \"How many people do you see outside driving home smoking cigarettes?\" Now, that type of argument is perfectly appropriate to assess reprehensibility. On the other hand, with the instruction that was offered the defense counsel could have warned the jury keep in mind you can't punish for those other people. We only have one plaintiff before us and we are assessing the reprehensibility with respect to that plaintiff. But without the instruction you're allowed to argue how many people do you see in Oregon smoking cigarettes?",
  "That has no relevance to the question of the extent to which the defendant is being punished, does it?",
  "Well, if they can understand that distinction, why wasn't the defense counsel entitled to argue to the jury just as you argued, you can consider the harm to others in assessing reprehensibility, why couldn't the defense counsel say, but, you can't punish for the harm to others, if as you answered to Justice Alito, a jury can understand that distinction?",
  "So you think it would have been, putting aside what they proposed, if they had proposed an instruction that said, you may consider the harm to others in assessing how reprehensible the conduct is but you may not punish Philip Morris for the harm to others, you would have had no objection to that instruction?",
  "Can I make, just to get the ground rules here, you're not asking us to reconsider either State Farm, BMW, any of our punitive damages precedents?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Peck. Mr. Frey, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frey. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear arguments next in Lawrence V. Florida. Ms. Bonner.",
  "It would presumably, though, be limited in some ways. For example, if the application for state post-conviction relief raised arguments under state law, those would not be a proper subject of a petition for certiorari.",
  "Of course, the other way to read the language is that the state application is final -- otherwise you couldn't file the Federal petition for certiorari, and that petition may affect what happens with your application for state relief, but the state application itself is final and over.",
  "Well, it has to be final before you can file a petition for cert.",
  "So what about the argument raised by your friend that exhaustion doesn't require filing a petition for certiorari, that the state procedures are considered fully exhausted upon the final decision in the state court and that it makes sense to treat this, this 2244, in a parallel way with respect to the exhaustion requirement?",
  "How do you know what is pending with respect to when the state defendant, movant, doesn't file a petition for certiorari? Is that - -",
  "Is the state post-conviction application still pending on the 90th day?",
  "Well, anybody who wants the additional time -- this law was passed to prevent people from delaying. But anybody who wanted to delay would then have to file a cert petition, I assume?",
  "But if you filed - - so you say you get 90 days whether you file or not?",
  "But if you want the additional time that it takes for an opposition, for waiver of response, for this court to dispose of it, then you have to file a petition for cert?",
  "Right.",
  "You know, what about 2244(D)(1)(a) where Congress referred expressly to the time for seeking direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review? Your reading of D(2) is that that's what they meant when they said the state application was pending. The state application or the time for seeking review of the state application, and in -- just in just a few sections above that they expressly said that shouldn't we read pending in a different, different direction?",
  "Well, they would have just said during the time of the application for state post-conviction, or the expiration of the time for seeking review of it.",
  "But in what sense is it an application for state post-conviction review when it's pending before us? We are considering a claim that the state erroneously decided a Federal question - -",
  "-- but it's not an application, it's an application for our review, not state post-conviction review.",
  "Do you have any, I suppose this, we ought to know better, but how long the average disposition time is for a petition for certiorari in a case like this?",
  "No. From the time of, I suppose the pertinent question would be from the time of final state, final state judgment, eventual filing for petition for cert, opposition, waiver, our disposition? Presumably, probably five or six months?",
  "Well, why don't you take, let's just if say you take 90 days, and you get - -",
  "And you get a two month extension.",
  "Then you get another month for the opposition depending on what circuit you're from for the extension. Get another month for the opposition, at least two months, month and a half, for us to dispose of it. It probably comes out to about six months.",
  "Now I guess -- my question is, in a law that imposed a one-year statute of limitation, is this an implicit additional, I realize it's a question begging to some extent, but implicitly an additional six-month period would strike me as odd.",
  "Well, the reason that's tolled is because it's designed to encourage the exhaustion of the state procedures. This additional period is when it's pending, not before the state but before a Federal court.",
  "Any -- any statistics on how many petitions for cert from state post-conviction collateral review are granted? In other words, if we are talking about an additional six months in every case, how many of those are actually granted?",
  "No, but if the state is petitioning for cert it means you've won.",
  "So presumably you're not looking forward to further - -",
  "Assuming you make the same argument you make on questions 2 and 3 about the availability of equitable tolling.",
  "I would be very surprised if the court found you were out of time because the state had filed a petition for certiorari.",
  "And have it granted.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kise.",
  "It's the application that is not subject to review. We review the state court judgment, not the state application, correct?",
  "You're worried about winning in the Supreme Court.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kise. Ms. Bonner, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Records don't have to -- typically are not filed with the petition for cert. So the record would be back in the lower court.",
  "Just to be clear, it is your position that to get -- you think everyone's entitled to the additional 90 days whether they file or not.",
  "To get the additional time for an opposition that would be considered here, you have to file the petition for cert. In other words, if you don't file after the 90th day it's no longer pending.",
  "Okay. So then why wouldn't the result of your position be that every person who is denied state post-conviction relief is going to file a cert position to get the additional time?",
  "Wouldn't that lead to that result? If Congress was concerned that people were stringing out the time before they seek habeas, one way to string it out under your reading, but not under the state's reading, would be to file a petition for cert.",
  "I'm sorry. What's the trigger?",
  "Yes. When they wanted to include the 90 days, they said the expiration of the time for seeking review. They did not say that in (d)(2).",
  "I mean, if the defendant had no incentive to delay, why did Congress think it necessary to impose the statue of limitations? They did that because they thought people were stringing out their -- and they were applying for Federal habeas after too long of a delay.",
  "Thank you, Miss Bonner.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Whorton versus Bockting. General Chanos.",
  "I take it from your presentation you think we do have to go through the Teague analysis. We can't just rely on 2254(d)(1)?",
  "Well then, what do you do about 2254(e)(1), or I guess (e)(2), which seems to suggest at different rule if a case is made retroactive?",
  "Now, my point was that looking at (d)(1), it says is the decision contrary to established law. And I would have thought that if it's a new decision it's clearly not contrary to established law.",
  "But on the other hand, you look at (e)(2) and it says here's what you do if you're applying a new decision that's that been made retroactive. So I would have thought that meant you can't say simply because it's a new decision it won't apply.",
  "Thank you General Chanos. Mr. Gornstein, we will hear now from you.",
  "Since you barely cite AEDPA, I think you assume we need to reach the Teague question before the AEDPA question.",
  "It is law that is applied in Federal court, though. I assume you have an interest in that.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Ms. Forsman?",
  "But Ohio versus Roberts was not overruled because of a judgment that it was not doing a good enough job in assessing reliability of these statements. It was overruled because of a judgment that the Founders wanted there to be cross-examination.",
  "You had the opportunity to challenge those findings under the Roberts regime in state court?",
  "That's not -- the state has to result -- the state -- it's adjudicated on the merits in state court and results in a decision that was contrary to clearly established Federal law.",
  "So it seems to me that the question is what was the law, what was the clearly established law at the time of the state decision.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Forsman. General Chanos, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "You can finish your sentence.",
  "Particularly if it is Justice Harlan you're quoting.",
  "Thank you, General. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation. Mr. Donahue.",
  "That's a disputed point, I gather, central to the case, whether or not the regulations measured PSD emissions through that device rather than the hourly emissions.",
  "That's an audacious statement.",
  "If the regulations are ambiguous, then the agency can interpret them in different ways and can change its interpretation over time. Of course, what your friend argues happened here is that the agency changed its interpretation in the context of an enforcement program. Now accepting that premise, what is the -- what should Duke have done when that interpretation was changed in an enforcement program?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Donahue. Mr. Hungar.",
  "Should a challenge to that have been brought in the D.C. Circuit at that time, or would you have argued that's too late?",
  "Well, presumably Duke could say, we looked at the Reich memorandum and we were following that and all of a sudden this new 1988 thing came up and they are surprised by that. Now you're saying it's already too late because somebody else challenged it in 1980?",
  "To be fair to them, that very same argument was more a product of the Fourth Circuit than of Duke. They had a somewhat different approach before the Fourth Circuit and then the Fourth Circuit came up with this insistence on the parallel construction.",
  "In the midst of the enforcement action that's being brought against them by EPA? What's supposed to happen in the enforcement action, if that's the vehicle through which EPA is implementing its new interpretation - -",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hungar. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Just a pause, under your view or the Fourth Circuit's view? If you read Judge Tatel's opinion in New York versus EPA, he suggests -- suggests, he says that EPA adopted different interpretations of modification from the outset. And so if what you are saying couldn't have been challenged, was the Fourth Circuit's view, that may not be accurate. But if you are saying what couldn't have been anticipated was the argument you actually made to the Fourth Circuit, that might be a different story.",
  "Your answer is you are not relying simply on the general principle. It is not just that they used the word modification in one place and the word modification in the other. It's that in the latter place, they said modification as defined in the first place.",
  "Could you explain to me again why this isn't a 307(b) problem? You said this is an action by the administrator?",
  "You can't challenge in the D.C. Circuit the administrator's interpretation that led to the enforcement action?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Donahue, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Major -- when you say the statutory term, you mean \"modification\"?",
  "So then why weren't those proposed regulations saying just that, adopted?",
  "That's a tough sell, isn't it? I mean, the idea is you propose regulations saying major modification means modification. Those regulations are not adopted, and then the industry is supposed to be on notice that that's still what you mean?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Donahue. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Wallace versus Kato and Roy. Mr. Flaxman.",
  "Well, but he did not know that for years later. I mean, they don't have to bring a prosecution immediately. They can wait until the day before the statute of limitations runs.",
  "Well, then they can wait a long time.",
  "But the point, the whole point of Heck was to avoid 1983 becoming an end run around habeas. But here you don't have that problem because you don't have any available relief under habeas under Stone versus Powell.",
  "Yeah, it would require overruling our cases that say for tolling, your borrow state law - -",
  "So then you deny the officers the purpose you have for the reason you have statutes of limitation, which is repose. They are going to wait ten years instead of the two years to find out if they are going to have to answer any claim for damages.",
  "But he's never going to know, in the case where there's no statute of limitations, he's never going to know when his criminal case is going to be over because he may never know when it's going to start.",
  "So what happens if he files a suit after one year and then after one year and 350 days he's prosecuted? His action accrued but then it didn't accrue?",
  "So his action accrued and maybe it's even over, but then it turns out when they bring the prosecution, it should have never have been brought because it never accrued.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Flaxman. Ms. Solomon.",
  "I suppose it would make a difference to the officers, a principle of equitable tolling. They don't know if they're going to be sued for 10 years, 12 years, however long. Under an accrual rule with a stay, they know whether they're going to be facing a civil action or not.",
  "They're not going to waste a lot of time figuring out whether to grant a stay or not when you have a criminal prosecution pending in state court. I think in most cases -- I mean, it's not like they're looking for cases. They're going to say in most cases: Stay granted, come back when this is over. They don't have to be -- unlike perhaps the situation with an equitable tolling rule, it doesn't matter whether they're precisely right or wrong. I mean, if it's close enough just stay it, and it doesn't seem to me there's much prejudice from that.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Solomon. Mr. Flaxman, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Marrama versus Citizens Bank of Massachusetts. Mr. Baker.",
  "Mr. Baker, as I understand it subsequent to the grant of certiorari in this case, your client filed for relief under Chapter 13 and that relief was denied. You're now seeking under - - your petition seeks a conversion to Chapter 13 and I guess I wonder what relief is still open to you.",
  "What relief is open to you in this case? In other words, you're trying to get a conversion to Chapter 13. Subsequently, you've tried to apply for relief under Chapter 13 and that's been denied. Why isn't the case moot in the sense that that relief is not available to you now?",
  "When cases are reconverted to Chapter 7, is that typically done before or after the filing of the Chapter 13 plan?",
  "Creditors -- under Chapter 13 one of the prerequisites to approval of the plan is that the creditors get at least as much as they would have gotten under Chapter 7, right?",
  "So presumably the creditors might want to see what the Chapter 13 plan looks like themselves.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Baker.",
  "Mr. Brunstad.",
  "Under -- you think 105 is an affirmative grant of power?",
  "105(a) is much more limited than that. It is only if you take the second clause of that out of context and quote it, as has been done, that it looks like an affirmative grant. It says: \"No provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from taking sua sponte other action.\" That's a much more limited, narrow provision telling you not to imply a negative pregnant from a requirement that a particular party raise an issue. I -- as a source of sweeping powers to, to basically act as a roving commission in equity, I think that's a mis-citation.",
  "What do you do about the different structures, wording between 706(a) and 706(b)? I mean, this provision says debtor may. The other provisions say that a debtor may ask a court to order, and it suggests a difference in who has the primary responsibility, whether it is a motion of the Court or whether it is an independent action.",
  "So you think under those other provisions the court doesn't have this inherent power or the implicit power from 105(a) that you're arguing for here?",
  "If you, if given that the court has express statutory authority to reconvert from 13 back to 7, why should we take the leap of conferring inherent equitable authority to do something, when the statute addresses it in a much more specific way?",
  "Well, maybe, maybe not. I mean, they convert. He comes up with a plan under 13 that looks better to creditors. I mean, just because there's fraud that offends the court and prompts it to take action prior to conversion doesn't mean that that's going to be the same situation after conversion.",
  "Even if it might injure the creditors.",
  "What limitations would you recognize on this inherent authority to take action? Where do they come from?",
  "The sense it makes is that that's what the statute provides, and rather than relying on this alleged inherent power that apparently is not boundless, and that the bounds of which will have to be articulated in case after case after case, the statute provides a very clear mechanism to address the issue of fraud which allows him to reconvert it back to Chapter 7 promptly.",
  "Well, I still haven't gotten an answer, I think, on what the prejudice is. Who is prejudiced by the procedure set forth in the statute? The conversion takes place. The judge then says, because of this fraud, I'm going to reconvert it to Chapter 7. Who suffers under that? You say sit idly by, but I don't see the long passage of time.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "We'll hear from Ms. Blatt first.",
  "Ms. Blatt.",
  "Well, what are the odds that that's going to happen if you have a judge who's exercised enough by the fraud to exercise inherent authority to deny relief? He's not going to let it languish under Chapter 13.",
  "Well, why wouldn't that trustee recommend to the bankruptcy judge that he reconvert it to Chapter 7?",
  "I wouldn't call it a right to convert in bad faith. If it's a right, it's a right to convert despite the allegation of bad faith. It's not a right to convert in bad faith. No one is arguing for that.",
  "What about the idea that the debtor can come in and say under 13, look, whether the facts bear this out in this case or not, I've got a job now. I can pay off my debtors -- my creditors according to this plan, and, as the statute requires, the creditors get more under 13 than under under 7. That's a benefit to everybody.",
  "And he says, I'm sorry about that bad faith business.",
  "If the statute didn't provide that a Chapter 13 plan could be reconverted to a Chapter 7, would the court have the inherent equitable authority to do that?",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, what about the difference in language under 706(a) and the other provisions? 706(a) says the debtor may. The other provisions call for action by the court, which suggests at least that the authority to convert is greater under 706(a).",
  "I guess I've been assuming -- but the eligibility under Chapter 13 even under the present case is a present day question, right? In other words, we don't go back and see if he was eligible for Chapter 13 when the conversion was denied? The question would be whether he's eligible now?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Now, Mr. Baker.",
  "I'm sorry. You have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Baker. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Burton versus Stewart. Mr. Fisher.",
  "I'm not sure I understand that. I mean, we have not held, for example, that the fact of a prior conviction is something that has to be submitted to a jury under Blakely. Why, if you're determining that sentences run consecutively, isn't that just the same as looking at a simultaneous conviction and saying they're going to run consecutively?",
  "So you'd have - -",
  "And you're saying that that extra finding can't simply be that this is a conviction for a particular serious crime that's going to go unpunished otherwise?",
  "So under this system if you had a regime where if you're convicted of murder and you've been convicted of rape before that, you get an enhanced sentence beyond the normal murder sentence, that would not contravene Blakely. But if you're convicted at the same time for rape and murder and those two sentences run consecutively, you say that that does violate Blakely.",
  "So you think Blakely was not a new rule but Booker was?",
  "This argument, this argument assumes that we rule against you on whether or not it is a new rule.",
  "Don't you have - - don't you have to address AEDPA before we get to that question?",
  "In other words, it doesn't matter it it's a watershed, I guess it is a point of argument, but it is not clear that it matters whether it is a watershed rule if you read AEDPA 2254(d)(1) by its terms.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fisher. Mr. Collins.",
  "It doesn't matter - - I'm looking at joint appendix page 34, date of judgment of conviction, he puts in December 16, 1994.",
  "Where does it say a new judgment was issued in March of '98?",
  "Oh, I thought you meant it was in his petition.",
  "And further, I thought you told me that the petition goes on to indicate that the conviction while affirmed, that the sentence was reversed, looking at 9(b) on joint appendix 35.",
  "Which in other words, he details in the petition the subsequent history that would have resulted in a new judgment.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Collins. Mr. Roberts?",
  "Mr. Roberts, do you have a position on whether we have a successive petition problem here?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fisher. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in James versus United States. Mr. Crawford?",
  "But in Florida, that would be burglary itself, right, because it covers the curtilage around the house?",
  "Right. And we don't even have to ask whether that presents a serious potential risk under the statute, right? Because, if burglary is identified as -- a predicate offense without the need to resort to the definition?",
  "Specifically deleted or didn't - -",
  "That's quite different than specifically deleting it. In other words, it was never there in the proposal.",
  "So, do I understand your submission to be that putting a ladder against the side of a house to attempt burglary, starting up the ladder, that that generically does not pose a potential risk of physical injury?",
  "We understand from your friend on the other side that an overt act toward fulfilling the attempt is required under Florida law. In other words, it's not just enough to have burglary tools in your house.",
  "You've got to take an affirmative step toward accomplishing the burglary.",
  "Do you think that, is conspiracy to commit burglary a crime that poses a serious potential risk as burglary does?",
  "Doesn't that seem like a fine line? I mean, if you're sitting around with your coconspirator planning it you can be covered under this provision, planning a burglary. But if you actually get out there with the burglary tools, you put the ladder against the door and you start up the ladder, that somehow involves less of a potential risk of physical injury?",
  "You think the Eleventh Circuit is wrong?",
  "You don't have any doubt that, at least with respect to two of the other named crimes, attempts would present a serious potential risk? In other words, attempted arson or attempted use of explosives? You concede those would be covered, don't you?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Crawford. Mr. Marcus?",
  "Don't believe it for a minute.",
  "Why do you look at the risk of burglary and then view attempt as a sort of lesser included offense? I mean, attempts themselves have their own independent risk of physical injury. Obviously, if you've got a ladder up against the side of my house and you're halfway up and I come home, there's a risk of injury there, even though there's no - - regardless of whether the person gets into the house or not. And I think perhaps there's even a greater risk of potential -- greater potential risk of injury with respect to attempts because they don't succeed. Why don't they succeed? Because something interrupts them. And what interrupts them, it may well be the home owner. So I don't know that you have to look to sort of attempt as a lesser risk than the burglary itself.",
  "I would suppose the unsuccessful burglar poses a greater risk of physical injury than the successful burglar.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Marcus.",
  "Mr. Crawford, you have four minutes.",
  "It's different when you're dealing with an escapee or someone who has visitation right and then doesn't report back and qualifies as a escaped felon from prison. That's quite a bit different from an arrest in a normal situation.",
  "No. There's a greater -- I had this case in the D.C. Circuit. There's a greater degree of potential when you're dealing with someone who's escaped from prison than with someone else who's being arrested. Of course there's always the potential, but the judgment was that there's a greater degree of potential when you're trying to apprehend someone who's escaped.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Crawford. The case is submitted.",
  "Now we'll hear argument in 05-1382, Gonzales versus Planned Parenthood Federation of America. General Clement.",
  "And I gather your submission is that we can tell who is setting out to perform which, by the dilation protocol. Those were the record references that you gave earlier?",
  "Thank you, General Clement. Miss Gartner.",
  "Do you -- I think this question was asked earlier, but I want your position. How often does the vertex delivery occur in a D&X procedure? I - -",
  "I understood the statute here to apply only when the, in the words of the statute, that the partially delivered infant is killed after passing the anatomical landmark.",
  "So we just say your hypothetical about extraction of the leg it seems to be would not be covered by the statute.",
  "Where does the government concede that in a standard D&E the living fetus is extracted past the anatomical landmark?",
  "I thought that was -- I thought their position was that that was not the standard D&E.",
  "I thought their answer on that was that sometimes the D&E procedure will lead to a D&X procedure, but that the requirement of deliberately and intentionally removes those situations from the scope of the statute.",
  "Prior to demise?",
  "My concern with your argument is it's not just the anatomical line. The statute, I guess the Solicitor General referred to this as the multiple mens rea requirement. It's not simply the extraction to a particular anatomical landmark but with the purpose of demise at that point. So, if in the typical D&E the demise is going to be accomplished before extraction passed the anatomical landmark. It wouldn't be covered by this law.",
  "What about the Solicitor General's reference with respect to the differing protocols on dilation which suggests a different intent going into the procedure for the D&E and D&X?",
  "Why would the doctors in that case propose that option to their patients?",
  "Well, what -- what are the psychological reasons?",
  "Well is there a difference between, in your view, in the constitutionality, marginally safer and significantly safer? In other words, I take it we don't, you obviously were here for the discussion in the prior case. We don't have evidence on marginal significant. And do you think it matters; if in fact it's a marginal difference in safety, does that, is that still enough to override Congress's interests in this case?",
  "Well, do we just look at the averted harms, or -- or do we, or Congress, also look at the incidence of the averted harms? Is it a theoretical -- is it a theoretical inquiry or is it to some extent a quantified inquiry?",
  "If -- if the woman can take into account the impact on the fetus at a certain point in time, and your option, as you said some physicians give, of fetal demise prior to the procedure, why is that beyond the scope of things that Congress can take into account?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Gartner.",
  "General Clement, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, General Clement. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in case 05-380, Gonzales v. Carhart. General Clement.",
  "General, do you understand the scope of this statute to be different than the scope of the statute at issue in Stenberg, focusing in particular on the deliberate and intentional language?",
  "Thank you, General. Miss Smith.",
  "We have no evidence either in the record before the Court or Congress as to how often that situation arises?",
  "We'll give you an extra 30 seconds. Proceed.",
  "I guess that gets back to the point earlier. I mean, do you agree with the discussion earlier that this act is not going to prevent abortions?",
  "What degree of marginal impact on safety do you think is necessary to override the State's interest? I mean, if you have complications under the D&E procedure in say 10 percent of the cases, complications under D&X in 9.99 percent of the cases, is that marginal benefit in safety enough to override the State's articulated interest?",
  "But I thought your submission earlier was that we don't have any record evidence about how often the complications arise, so it's hard to get a handle on exactly what the difference is in terms of safety under your submission.",
  "I thought the evidence was that you're looking for a different degree of dilation if you're intending to perform D&E than if -- and you're looking for a greater degree if you're intending to perform a D&X.",
  "Is your submission that there aren't different dilation protocols if you're intending a D&E and if you're intending a D&X, they're the same?",
  "Do you think the, on the same issue I think, that the addition of the deliberately and intentionally language in the congressional act addresses that concern?",
  "Could I ask you just one thing?",
  "The statute, of course, refers to both feet first and vertex deliveries. How common is the vertex delivery in the D&X?",
  "And in giving your arguments toward the safety benefits of the D&X, I couldn't understand why they wouldn't also apply to the total delivery of the fetus in a vertex delivery situation.",
  "Well, my understanding is that the vertex, the skull and head are already outside the mother.",
  "And the objection in the feet first is that you want fewer instrument passes and so on.",
  "But in that case, it's not the skull itself that is preventing the delivery of the fetus.",
  "So your arguments about why the D&X is safer than feet first, wouldn't that apply in the case of total delivery of the fetus as well? In other words, if you want as much of the fetus intact and out as possible, why wait, stop it halfway? Wouldn't the safety argument suggest delivery of the fetus?",
  "In the case of a vertex delivery, where is the obstruction?",
  "Can I just follow up on that?",
  "I don't understand that. In other words, the fact that it's not the safest procedure does not itself constitute an undue burden? In other words, under Justice Kennedy's hypothetical - -",
  "He said that the State can prohibit something even if it is the safest procedure, and your answer was so long as it doesn't - -",
  "-- pose an undue burden. And I was just following up to say that so, in some circumstances, prohibiting what you regard is the safest procedure does not itself constitute an undue burden.",
  "Thank you, Miss Smith.",
  "General Clement, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, General. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Ledbetter versus Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. Mr. Russell.",
  "So if 15 years earlier a discriminatory decision was made to give a pay raise of 4 percent rather than 5 percent, and that over the 15 years became the basis with other raises, you think you can challenge the discrimination 15 years later and say well, this was discriminatory because 15 years ago I didn't get a raise and that, carried forward, had a ripple effect into the current 180-day period.",
  "Well, Congress could have specifically provided for the Equal Pay Act rule under Title VII, but it didn't do that.",
  "I suppose all they'd have to do is allege that sometime over the past -- I mean, it doesn't have to be 15 years. It could be 40 years, right -- that there was a discriminatory act, in one of the semi-annual pay reviews I was denied this, a raise that I should have gotten. It may have been 20 years ago. It may have been 40 years ago.",
  "Why is that if they just discovered it? I just learned about what happened 30 years ago at this company and it's -- I filed right away. There's no laches.",
  "But then they have to go back and litigate what happened 30 years ago.",
  "That's not your theory. I mean, if it happened once 20 years ago you have a case that you can bring, isn't it?",
  "You've got a memo that says we're going to pay, 20 years ago, we're going to pay males this much and we're going to pay females this much, and she says that obviously affected my pay over the ensuing 15, 20 years.",
  "And it's not enough presumably for somebody to come in and even up everybody? I mean, if you see that the women are making 20 percent less than the men you don't escape liability by paying everybody the same going forward, because perhaps if nondiscriminatory decisions had been made the women would have making 20 percent more than the men. You have to go back and revisit every pay decision or you're exposed to liability for current pay.",
  "Why is that true? I mean, it depends. I suppose it may be harder for the company to mount a defense over time, so it may be to her advantage to wait.",
  "Lorance?",
  "Thank you counsel. Mr. Nager, we'll hear now from you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Nager. Mr. Gornstein?",
  "Let's say it's the same person who made the decision. You know, five years ago he said I'm giving a 6 percent raise to men, I'm giving a 3 percent raise to women, and then he decides that's illegal, and so from now on everybody is going to get a 4 percent raise every year if you meet certain standards. Is that ongoing discrimination or is that a neutral thing, that he doesn't have to take into account the past discrimination?",
  "Even though he knows that it carries forward the illegal discrimination?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Russell, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "You can equalize pay by lowering others. You don't -- raising the discriminated-against class is not the only way to equalize pay. So I don't see how cost is a justification for continuing the disparity.",
  "Under Title VII you can equalize either way, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Bell Atlantic Corporation vs. Twombly. Mr. Kellogg.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kellogg. Mr. Barnett.",
  "But Justice Stevens's question was that the allegation was that after that date they agreed not to compete. That states -- that states a cause of action under the Sherman Act, doesn't it?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Barnett. Mr. Richards, we'll hear now from you.",
  "But where does it set forth agreement?",
  "Temporal, geographic, the identities, but where does it set forth anything evincing an agreement other than the allegation of parallel conduct?",
  "Do you have any, is there an allegation of an agreement apart from the parallel conduct?",
  "And what does that consist of?",
  "So it states - - would it state an antitrust violation if had you a grocery store on one corner of the block and a pet store on the other corner of the block and you say, well, the grocery store is not selling pet supplies and they could make money if they did, therefore that's an antitrust violation?",
  "That's all the facts that are alleged.",
  "So then when we get back to the paragraph 51, let me start with your statement at the bottom half of that paragraph, that plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that they have entered into a contract, is a conclusion based upon your prior allegations, it's not an independent allegation of an agreement. It's saying because of this parallel conduct, because we think it's contrary to their self interest, therefore, they have agreed.",
  "But it's a statement of a conclusion based upon your allegations that precede it.",
  "It's not a statement that independently there apart from all of this, there's an agreement.",
  "But how do you tell? I mean, companies get proposals all the time. Here's a way you could make more money. You could all enter the market in some foreign country. The people decide, I mean, life is short and they've got certain objectives, and they don't have to do everything that an economist might think is in their economic self interest. I mean, what is the limiting self interest to that?",
  "Is it an adequate response for the executive to say, I'm a little risk averse, I want to see how things work out over the next five years. They keep changing the laws, the regulatory environment. That's why I didn't jump in and compete?",
  "But you don't think you have to prove that either? I mean, you don't think you have to prove anything more than what you've alleged in the complaint about the background context, the parallel conduct?",
  "Well, how would it be focused if you're talking about whether it's in their economic interest? You would have to say why, why didn't you enter into this particular realm of competition and they would say, well because we were doing other things. We had other areas that we were focusing on. And they would have to document all that to your satisfaction.",

In hindsight everybody says, I could have thought of that; and that you need -- if you don't have the sort of constraint that their test imposes, it's going to be too easy to say that everything was obvious.",
  "You don't have a motive to answer that question right away.",

  "It adds a layer of Federal Circuit jargon that lawyers can then bandy back and forth, but if it's -- particularly if it's nonexclusive, you can say you can meet our teaching, suggestion, or motivation test or you can show that it's nonobvious, it seems to me that it's worse than meaningless because it complicates the inquiry rather than focusing on the statute.",

  "Exactly.",
  "Well, that's because the Federal Circuit's approach focuses narrowly prior to our grant of certiorari, allegedly more flexibly after, on prior art, as opposed. To I would say common sense. And so they say we have to find something in prior art to show that this was non -- that this was obvious.",
  "And just -- what makes it nonobvious is that it's attached to a nonmoving piece?",
  "But just to follow up from Justice Stevens' question, what makes this nonobvious is the decision to place the electronic control on a part of the car that doesn't move?",

  "Well, it's a little different here in that in the Brooke Group cases, of course, the alleged anticompetitive conduct was pricing too low, which has at least a direct benefit to consumers either in the short term, certainly in the short term, and arguably in the long-term as well, while here that is not the form in which the anticompetitive conduct, that's not the form the anticompetitive conduct takes. So isn't that a reason not to think that we should apply the Brooke Group test to this situation?",
  "Have we ever identified that as a benefit that the antitrust laws try to achieve, people get higher prices for what they sell?",
  "So in Brooke Group, we said it's a benefit when prices are low to consumers, and in this other case we said it's a benefit when prices are high to suppliers.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Pincus. Mr. Shanmugam.",
  "Would you describe the hypothetical Justice Stevens posed to your, your brother, would you describe that as just aggressive bidding? Aggressive is, you know, it's kind of a good term when you're talking about competition. But what if it's purposely bidding higher than you know your rival can afford?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Shanmugam. Mr. Haglund.",
  "What about the fact that the woodsmen in Justice Breyer's story are rational actors as well, and they don't have to be geniuses to realize that they are in a better shape having two buyers rather than just one. So maybe they forego the extra 50 cents a log, or whatever -- tree, it is in the short term and sell enough to keep the other company in business? I mean they can make that decision themselves. Or they can make the decision as rational actors that they are better off having more money that they can then use to buy more alder saplings that they can plant for the future. And either way it benefits the consumers.",
  "Well if he is, if he is that rational and foresighted, why isn't he rational and foresighted enough to know that he ought to be selling some to the other, the other processor even if that processor is not bidding as much?",
  "So then, would you be entitled to a remand on that or not, given that you withdrew that instruction?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Haglund. Mr. Pincus, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "You can finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Pincus. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in 05-1120, Massachusetts versus Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Milkey.",
  "Do you get the benefit of that broader allegation in establishing your standard? In other words, if you've challenged EPA's refusal to apply a particular level of greenhouse regulation to a particular model of car, can you say, well, they're following the same approach to a coal powered -- coal fueled power plant, and so we get to establish a broader injury? Or, aren't you limited to the specific legal challenge you're raising here?",
  "Don't you have to show injury from their decision here? The fact that other people, or you presumably as well might be injured by their decisions that you are not challenging here, that doesn't help your standing here, does it?",
  "Those affidavits talked about the fact that if the government starts to regulate, the technology is going to change, if the technology changes, other governments will adopt it, and all that, and that strikes me as sort of spitting out conjecture on conjecture, the sort that we disapproved of.",
  "Same argument if the automobile emissions were 1 percent contributors?",
  "How is that consistent with our taxpayer standing cases where the argument is that a taxpayer doesn't have standing to challenge an illegal expenditure as a general matter simply because his contribution, the benefit that he's claiming is so small and so widely dispersed?",
  "That assumes everything else is going to remain constant, though, right? It assumes there isn't going to be a greater contribution of greenhouse gases from economic development in China and other places that's going to displace whatever marginal benefit you get here.",
  "Not if your harm is the alleged loss of coastline. Not necessarily. It depends upon what happens across the globe with respect to greenhouse emissions.",
  "What's your strongest case from this Court to support your standing allegation?",
  "Laidlaw was a specific citizen suit provision, wasn't it?",
  "So doesn't that make it somewhat analytically distinct from this case?",
  "Moving from your authority argument to the exercise of authority, the clause 202(a)(1) requires EPA to prescribe standards which in their judgment cause or contribute to air pollution reasonably anticipated to endanger public health. And they say they haven't made that judgment yet, so they're not in violation of that statutory command.",
  "Let's say the first day this law is passed, there are a lot of air pollutants that come out of motor vehicles. I mean, is EPA immediately in violation of this statute if they don't issue emissions regulations for every one those air pollutants on day one?",
  "And presumably the principle that they want to deal with what they regard as the more serious threats sooner. They want to deal with lead first and then they want to deal with other stuff. I mean, what is the -- when did they -- I guess -- move into an abuse of discretion in not exercising a judgment with respect to a particular pollutant?",
  "That's not all they said. I'm looking at A-85 and they said establishing emissions now would require EPA to make scientific and technical judgments without the benefit of studies that are being developed to reduce the uncertainty in the area. That's different than saying they disagree with the regulatory approach.",
  "There's a difference between the scientific status of the harm from lead emissions from vehicles that -- when you have lead in the gasoline, to the status, the status of scientific knowledge with respect to the impact on global warming today? Those are two very different levels of uncertainty.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Milkey. Mr. Garre.",
  "-- it is not a mathematical question, right? I mean, you would -- it's that you would -- what is the number? What's enough? 10 percent? 15 percent? Presumably, there's more to it than the percentage of emissions attributable to be this particular - -",
  "Just because there's no standing to challenge an agency's decision doesn't mean the agency can't regulate that particular area, right?",
  "They can't compromise the requirements of Article III.",
  "Let me understand your answer to Justice Stevens' question. If EPA made the judgment under the statute, you think they would have had the authority?",
  "I thought you had a Brown and Williamson argument that EPA was precluded.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Milkey, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "What they said was until more is understood about causes, extent and significance of climate change and the potential options for addressing it, we believe it's inappropriate to regulate these emissions.",
  "That strikes me as saying they think there is too much uncertainty for them to act.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in 05-1342, Watters v. Wachovia Bank. Mr. Blanchard.",
  "Why did they do that? What's the advantage to them having that subsidiary rather than doing this directly?",
  "So mortgage subsidiary could possibly get into some trouble that the bank wants to protect itself from and not have -- they have a certain number of assets that are subject to liability in the subsidiary, but they would -- otherwise they'd expose the whole bank to those liabilities?",
  "You're not seeking visit -- \"visitorial,\" is that the word?",
  "You're not seeking visitorial rights with respect to the parent bank.",
  "You're not arguing that because you need to see more about the mortgage subsidiary you need to see what the parent is up to?",
  "Okay.",
  "Their argument, they haven't argued -- I realize this was a hypothetical, but they haven't argued that the subsidiary should be treated as a national bank. They're arguing that they're entitled to say that the same preemption that applies to the national bank applies to the subsidiaries.",
  "Presumably, if they said it's treated as a national bank they would lose the benefit of the separate corporate existence when it came to issues of liability. If they said this subsidiary is a national bank, then presumably the separate corporate existence they're seeking to take advantage of would be obliterated.",
  "And if they don't want to, they don't have to set up a separate subsidiary, right? They can do this business directly as a national bank and they're not going to be subject to any visitation?",
  "Right. And I would have thought your answer to Justice Breyer was yes, that they get to regulate to the extent they want to, and the state does, and if there's a conflict, the federal regulation will prevail, but what's the problem here is that they're issuing a categorical regulation saying the state can't regulate at all.",
  "Their position is not that it only preempts in cases of conflict. Under 12c apart, 7.4006, it says, state laws apply to national bank operated subsidiaries, which is what we're dealing with here, to the same extent that those laws apply to the parent national bank, which is to say not at all.",
  "So it's not a case of conflict preemption. They're trying to preempt state law whether it conflicts or not, right?",
  "Or environmental regulation where just because the Federal EPA doesn't take a particular action against a polluter, doesn't mean that the state can't take action against the polluter.",
  "So if the Federal U.S. Attorney prosecutes, decides to prosecute someone for manslaughter, the state can decide that's not an adequate enough response and prosecute them for murder, right?",
  "You better hurry then.",
  "But you have a subsidiary that's in the mortgage lending business that presumably competes with other companies in the mortgage lending business that are not associated with national banks, and you're claiming an immunity from the regulation that their competitors are subject to. Is that right?",
  "And that's fine, and they have an express provision in 48 -- 484(a) that says they're, they're exempt from regulation. The question is whether a separate subsidiary that is not a national bank that competes with other mortgage lending companies is immune from the regulation that those other companies - -",
  "Justice Breyer's questions were pointing out, to the extent your regulation -- the Federal regulation of your subsidiary conflicts with the State law, that regulation is going to prevail. The question is whether or not you are immune from State regulation across the board - -",
  "One of those laws might be, I mean, let's say they have a law, when you're issuing a mortgage to a consumer, you have to give them a disclosure about how much they're going to end up paying over the life of the loan and all that. And they require that of anybody who issues a mortgage in Michigan. Could that law be applied to your subsidiary?",
  "Isn't -- isn't your friend correct then? You are really trying to have your cake and eat it, too. You're saying if we did this without a subsidiary, we wouldn't be subject to that. But you want to be able to operate through a subsidiary and yet not be subject to the same rules that apply to other people.",
  "What authority do you have for the proposition that when then Federal law says subject to the same terms and conditions that they're referring To State regulation as opposed to the same Federal regulation that applies to the national banks?",
  "Was 7.4006 issued pursuant to -- what did you call it, GLBA?",
  "Yes. Or did it predate that?",
  "How does it conflict with Federal banking authority for the State to audit the books of the mortgage subsidiary?",
  "Take my earlier case about the consumer disclosure. Michigan has a law, I assume, that any mortgage lender has to tell the consumer all this information. Would that conflict with the authority of a national bank?",
  "So you think any regulation would conflict with the national bank status?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Long. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "It's field preemption when it comes to regulation. Yes, if the bank is sued the normal rules of contract are going to apply for enforcing a contract. But you're claiming field preemption with respect to regulation, correct?",
  "State laws generally -- State agencies generally don't regulate national banks at all, right?",
  "That was an effort of the State to prohibit the national bank from engaging in the activity, correct?",
  "That's an obvious case of conflict preemption. Here we have a question of whether or not the State can regular the operating subsidiary to any extent.",
  "Why should we assume that they wanted to preempt state laws to that extent.",
  "Is there any aspect of state law, including liability limitation, that they want to take advantage of by establishing a subsidiary chartered under state law, Michigan or another state, and yet they're claiming immunity from all other state regulations?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Blanchard, you have a minute remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Blanchard. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number 1. Mr. Korrell.",
  "But the lawsuit was originally brought by a corporate entity, correct?",
  "Not by individual parents.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Clement.",
  "Counsel, if I could get back to Justice Kennedy's question earlier, how do you distinguish decisions like citing magnet schools, clustering, from the consideration of race in this case?",
  "You can answer in this case, General.",
  "General?",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Madden.",
  "Does that make a difference? What if you adopted a plan that insisted on a more or less rigid 60-40 ratio at every school and assignments were made on that basis. It was not a follow-on to a choice system.",
  "Would that be unconstitutional?",
  "The same -- the facts are otherwise the same, except you conclude that private choice contributes to further division rather than integration and so the assignments are made on a 60-40 basis.",
  "I still don't have your answer. Is strict assignment 60-40 without regard to choice constitutional or not?",
  "And how does this not present narrow tailoring problems if -- if the - - when you get to the fact of choice, the sole criteria at that level is the same as would be the case in a 60-40 assignment.",
  "One of the, one of the factors our prior cases looked to was whether the plan has a logical end point. What is the logical end point in this plan?",
  "Nothing under the plan requires that, does it?",
  "You don't defend the choice policy on the basis that the schools offer education to everyone of the same quality, do you?",
  "How is that different from the separate but equal argument? In other words, it doesn't matter that they're being assigned on the basis of their race because they're getting the same type of education.",
  "Even though in the individual cases the students, including minority students, and I gather 89 to 100 of the cases are being denied admission on the basis of their race?",
  "They are being denied admission to the school of their choice?",
  "But the reason that our prior tests have focused on individual determination is that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to ensure that people are treated as individuals rather than based on the color of their skin. So saying that this doesn't involve individualized determinations simply highlights the fact that the decision to distribute, as you put it, was based on skin color and not any other factor.",
  "Well, you're saying every -- I mean, everyone got a seat in Brown as well; but because they were assigned to those seats on the basis of race, it violated equal protection. How is your argument that there's no problem here because everybody gets a seat distinguishable?",
  "There's no effort here on the part of the school to separate students on the basis of race. It's an assignment on the basis of race, correct?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Madden. Mr. Korrell, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education. Mr. Gordon.",
  "Do you have a claim for damages as well.",
  "With respect to this plaintiff?",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Clement.",
  "Whatever it takes.",
  "General Clement, do you know how Joshua would have been assigned prior to the establishment of unitary status in this case?",
  "You don't know whether that would have been the magnet or the so-called resides school or somewhere else?",
  "Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Mellen?",
  "So your arguments do not depend in any way on the prior de jure segregation?",
  "There were questions earlier about the status of the particular plaintiff. You're not challenging standing or raising mootness, are you?",
  "In a time horizon longer or shorter than the 25-year time horizon that was discussed in Grutter?",

  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in 05-1272, Rockwell International Corporation versus United States. Ms. Mahoney.",
  "It wouldn't have to have anything to do with pondcrete at all. The statute just says the information on which his allegations are based. They don't say the allegations that eventually give rise to a recovery.",
  "That's one way to look at it. Another way would be you would allow a relator in a situation who alleges a particular fraud that causes the government to examine the books and uncovers a different fraud to recover on that basis. It's an unusual situation to have a jurisdictional prerequisite determined only after the case is over.",
  "If you only show that it's wrong at the end, you still say that they should be thrown out.",
  "Well, his allegation was that this, the design is not going to work.",
  "That's not an allegation that's -- I mean, it is either true or it's not true. The fact that you find out after he's left, after he's been terminated, that it doesn't work, I don't see how that should affect the validity of his allegations.",
  "They were certifying their compliance with the applicable laws - -",
  "-- based upon their pondcrete design.",
  "The whole purpose, the whole purpose of this legislation is to ferret out fraud on the Government. I mean, if he makes an allegation that this design is not going to work, the pondcrete is not going to work, and the Government, prompted by his lawsuit, investigates it and finds out that because of human error they're not making it the right way, even if the design does work, he get no credit for that?",
  "Well, what about the hypothetical? Are you suggesting that in a situation like that -- -we'll talk about whether the facts comport with it later -- but in a situation like that, he's not entitled to share in the recovery that the Government eventually receives?",
  "You would, you would change that to say direct knowledge of the information not on which the allegations are based, but on which recovery is eventually -- eventually ordered?",
  "Identified them all?",
  "They've identified them all already?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Mahoney. Ms. Vullo.",
  "But it is worse than that, though. This information was not even provided to the government, which the statute requires. He not only has to have direct and independent knowledge, he has to voluntarily provide that to the government. And I understand that the Tenth Circuit, to have relied solely on the document at joint appendix page 605, that's the only thing he provided to the government. And all it says is that this design will not work. There are a lot of things that don't work, but that doesn't mean there's fraud on the government. You don't know if they're going to fix it, they're going to change it, use a different design, not make a claim based on that design. Why is that enough to satisfy the statute?",
  "But he has to -- if the information that he provides isn't direct and independent information of the allegations, it would seem that the statute is not satisfied.",
  "I don't want to get off my question here but did you -- do you agree that this page JA 605 was the only information that he provided to the government?",
  "Well, maybe I'd better phrase it differently. Do you agree that that is the only information on which the Tenth Circuit relied?",
  "Well, but this -- he has to provide this information before filing an action.",
  "I would have thought the allegations referred to the public disclosure. It talks about public disclosure of allegations, and then says he has to have direct and independent knowledge of the allegations. So I would assume that's the important linkage.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Vullo. Mr. Stewart?",
  "What do you mean by connected? Is it -- I got -- I'm getting the sense that you think it's enough that he says, look, Rockwell is just lying to the Government in this area, and you say well -- what if what if you added a count in your complaint when you intervene on tax fraud? You found out also that they didn't pay taxes. Would he be able to recover for that, because, you know, if they're going to lie about pondcrete they're going to lie about taxes. Is that sufficiently connected?",
  "And it doesn't matter to you if he just, if he's completely wrong? Let's say he says -- you have special interrogatories to the jury and his allegation has always been the pondcrete's going to fail because you're putting in the wrong kind of cement. And it turns out it has nothing to do with that at all. The jury says, no, that's not the reason it failed, it failed for another reason. Is that a sufficient connection?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Ms. Mahoney, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you Ms. Mahoney. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in case 05-1629 Gonzales versus Duenas-Alvarez. Mr. Himelfarb.",
  "Well, the only thing that the Ninth Circuit held was that the definition of a theft offense in California is broader than the generic definition of theft. All of these arguments that are being discussed are ways in which that particular ruling is supported. I don't know why they wouldn't be considered subsumed under the Ninth Circuit's decision.",
  "Counsel, you're ahead of me, and I'm still back on the last question, but I take it your rationale for not reaching these other grounds would also apply to your argument that whatever the categorical definition, that this defendant was convicted of an actual theft offense, looking at the charging documents. That wasn't a basis for the Ninth Circuit's decision either.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb. Mr. Meade.",
  "Your friend began his argument by saying you don't defend the decision of the Ninth Circuit below on aiding and abetting. Is that correct?",
  "I know the judgment, but you focused at least primarily on other grounds than the one on which the Ninth Circuit relied. Is he correct that you concede that merely because the statute extends to aiders and abettors that is not sufficient to take it out of the categorical treatment?",
  "That was the third reference to the Model Penal Code, so I have to ask. No one's enacted the Model Penal Code, have they?",
  "Would you describe the Model Penal Code as closer to restatement or aspirational in terms of its reflection of the existence of general law?",
  "Is that what joyriding is? That when you're done with your joy ride, you return the car where you picked it up? I thought they just abandoned it wherever you happen to be.",
  "What's the joy in that?",
  "Do you understand that point to be what the Ninth Circuit relied on?",
  "So if we decided on the question, the aiding and abetting question, they did decide this would available to you to argue on remand?",
  "Because you presented it to the Ninth Circuit below.",
  "Well, they say you cannot be convicted as an accessory unless you are charged as such, and that the documents show he was charged as a principal.",
  "Well, the Government -- it is not only that. The Government has authority going the other way. People versus Prado, \"in the absence of a statute, an accessory after the fact must be indicted and convicted as such.\" If you look at this information, it's clear that he's not being indicted as an accessory after the fact.",
  "Has anyone ever been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact to joyriding?",
  "But if no one has ever been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact for joyriding, we'd really have to go out on a limb to construe this charging document which charges him as a principal as actually meaning to charge him as an accessory after the fact, wouldn't we?",
  "Your argument isn't limited to theft offenses, correct? That would cut across all of these areas in which the federal law refers, in which a Taylor analysis would apply?",
  "It would mean we could not rely on the categorical approach in almost any of those cases?",
  "Yeah, the categorical approach.",
  "Yes, sir.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Meade. Mr. Himelfarb, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Certainly.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in United Haulers Association versus Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority. Mr. Tager.",
  "Well, but you don't even have to get into the theory. What happens in a lot of municipalities of course is that they decide, well, we're going to run the waste treatment facility and we're going to tax the people in the municipality to support it and the service is going to be free. Now, is that a violation of the Commerce Clause?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, so, you say formalistic as if it's a bad thing. But the, the distinction, say in the First Amendment, if the private contractor the day before the municipality bought the facility for a dollar had fired an employee because of his or her political views, you wouldn't argue that that is state action just because the next day it was going to be controlled by the public entity. And yet the next day, that type of action would be subject to First Amendment scrutiny. It may be a formalistic distinction but in many areas of the law it makes all the difference.",
  "It is kind of formalistic on the other side because you, I thought you agreed that if the municipality did it through tax revenues and there was no formal flow restriction and yet it only made sense to dump your waste at the free facility, you seem to suggest that would be okay.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cahill.",
  "Call it a cable TV franchise fee. I mean, isn't that the way municipalities used to make a lot of money? They charged outrageous amounts to give the cable franchise and then grant a monopoly in exchange.",
  "To get back to the public-private distinction, what is the answer to Mr. Tager's point that that's difficult to -- what if you have a 50 percent publicly owned, 50 percent privately owned company? Is that covered by the Commerce Clause cases or not?",
  "So then, the Commerce Clause would become the vehicle by which we would develop federal law about what's appropriate for municipal governments to do and what's not appropriate? We could decide it may be appropriate to run waste facilities but not to run milk pasteurization. I don't know how we would do that.",
  "Well, if we accepted that argument, we would treat the public services just like we treat, you know, the legislation favoring private companies. You're the one that's arguing for special treatment based on public ownership.",
  "But the whole point is these are not unique. The whole point is there are private companies that provide these kinds of services. Maybe water, maybe electricity, maybe those are or are not unique. But you can't say that this is a unique service being provided by government.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cahill. Ms. Halligan.",
  "Well, there is an allegation that you charge above market rates to pursue particular economic goals that the municipality has.",
  "If only facilities on your side of the case that are traditional municipal services, but then this seems to be at the borderline. I mean, on the other side, they have the hamburger cases or the milk processing cases. How do we decide whether this is one of the traditional governmental services, the police, the prisons, whatever, or is it one of these that looks more like regular market participation?",
  "Where do you, where do you come out on the 50-50 facility?",
  "Well, I thought you said earlier motive was not the test, in response to I think it was Justice Alito.",
  "Thank you. Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Tager you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho. Mr. Waxman.",
  "There's no sense in which it's redundant, though. It would have been the first piece of paper that this Court would have seen in the matter.",
  "I have a more basic question, whether we had a case or controversy to start with. This is kind of an intramural dispute between two Guamanian officials about what Guam's position should be with respect to the Organic Act and I'm wondering why that's a justiciable controversy under Article III. The cases you cited in your petition all involved on its - - only facially intra -- interbranch disputes within the Federal Government; but the agencies in those cases always -- were representing a real party in interest. United States versus ICC, the ICC was actually the railroad in whose favor the had commission ruled. Why shouldn't we just let Guam figure out its position on its own and then when a private party with standing challenges something then we'll have a case or controversy.",
  "Oh, no. Guam - - presumably, some state courts issue advisory opinions. We don't -- that's their business. It's just a question of whether we have jurisdiction to address the question in that context.",
  "Now Mr. Waxman, we've taken a fair amount of your time before you got to the merits. So we'll give you a couple of minutes for rebuttal. Why don't you answer that.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Ms. Brinkmann?",
  "Isn't that subject to gamesmanship? Parties that are out of time in this Court going to a lower court and saying well, just vacate and re-enter, and then I can start all over again? We've discouraged that.",
  "But don't you know that your interpretation reads the word tax out of this statute? I mean your position would be exactly the same if it just said 10 percent of the value of the property in Guam.",
  "With respect to much of the tax exempt property, that could be changed by the legislature as well.",
  "And what was the appraisal practice? I mean, in a lot of these jurisdictions you have appraised value that turns out to be 30 percent of the actual market value.",
  "But doesn't it - - who is this provision designed to protect, just the Guamanian taxpayers or Federal taxpayers more generally?",
  "If the Guamanian government runs a deficit, where is the difference made up from?",
  "I know that any taxes from Guam are returned to Guam. Are additional tax revenues given to Guam other than those that are derived from Guam?",
  "So that if the Guamanian Treasury runs into difficulty, it's made up not just by Guamanian taxpayers, but by all Federal taxpayers?",
  "Yeah, but you talked about this as the deference we owe to the Guam Supreme Court. This is a Federal statute, right? This was passed by Congress.",
  "Does that apply to all the provisions of the Organic Act? I mean, there are provisions there addressing the jurisdictional issue that we are considering here as well. Do we defer to the Guam Supreme Court's view on that?",
  "That's fine.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann. Mr. Waxman, we'll give you 3 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in 05-1575, Schriro versus Landrigan. Mr. Cattani.",
  "Justice Souter's question highlights an ambiguity in this Ninth Circuit opinion, for me anyway. Do you understand the hearing that they directed to be on the waiver question, or is the hearing that they directed on the alleged mitigation evidence that he now wants to present?",
  "If he wants, if he wants a hearing on that, we'd have to reverse the Ninth Circuit, right? Because the Ninth Circuit held that he didn't waive - -",
  "-- this claim?",
  "The part of the opinion that Justice Alito quoted on page A-17.",
  "That's not what I understood his argument that he wants to raise to be. In his affidavit, it is a different argument. It is the biological component of violence. \"Look, my grandfather was convicted, my father was convicted,\" and so the mitigating evidence he wants to present at sentencing that is I'm biologically predetermined to commit crimes.",
  "That -- which is certainly an ambiguous argument to present in mitigation at a sentencing hearing.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Verrilli.",
  "And is it just an evidentiary hearing on his biological pre determination to commit violent crime or an evidentiary hearing on the waiver question?",
  "Well, why did -- the court on page A-17 ruled that there was no waiver. So why would they then send it back for an evidentiary hearing on waiver?",
  "Well, but the prior paragraph says it's because of the history of his biological grandfather, biological brother, and biological child. That suggests to me it's a genetic claim and - -",
  "Well, but he knew about that. He knew about that mitigating evidence at the trial because his biological mother was there.",
  "How could that be helpful to him if he doesn't allow his biological mother to testify about drug and alcohol abuse? What use would the expert be if the potential predicate - -",
  "The defendant would have been happy to have his biological mother talk with the expert, but was unwilling to have his biological mother say the same thing in court?",
  "Counsel, do you think it's possible to have a valid waiver of the presentation of mitigating evidence or is it always possible that some additional evidence would come up and you say, what if I had known that, I wouldn't have waived it?",
  "You can't give a yes answer to whether it's ever possible.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, he certainly understood that. He said if you want to give me the death penalty, bring it on, I'm ready for it. The purpose of mitigating evidence is to prevent the imposition of the death penalty. He says bring it on.",
  "Why isn't the type of documentation that would be sufficient? He understands what the consequence of not putting mitigating evidence on is going to be.",
  "What is established? That you've satisfied (e)(2)?",
  "Why, because you satisfy it or because it doesn't apply?",
  "I'm sorry, you'll just have to bear with me.",
  "So you're saying you satisfy (e)(2)(A)(ii), because there's no lack of diligence. Don't you also have to satisfy (e)(2)(B), which is to show that no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty, in other words words subject to --",
  "What do you do with -- following up on Justice Kennedy's question, the dissent took the position in the Ninth Circuit that the mitigating value of any proven, quoting A-24, \"genetic predisposition to violence would not have outweighed its aggravating tendency to suggest that Landrigan was undeterable and even from prison would present a future danger\"?",
  "That was presented in the State court proceedings.",
  "The biological mother's abuse of alcohol and drugs.",
  "So you think the State trial court had no familiarity with fetal alcohol syndrome?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Verrilli. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in case 06-102, Sinochem International versus Malaysia International Shipping Corporation. Mr. Castanias.",
  "That's not an exercise of law declaring authority on the merits?",
  "In other words, the district court didn't hold that it didn't apply?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier?",
  "Can a district court do both? Can it say I've reached personal jurisdiction, I conclude that I, we do not have jurisdiction over this case? And in the alternative be dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds if it turns out we do?",
  "But not if there's, I presume, if there's an appeal.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Higgins.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Higgins. Mr. Castanias, you have 9 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in case 05-1508, Zuni Public School District, et al. vs. Department of Education. Mr. Van Amberg.",
  "You're not certain about the hypothetical but you're certain about the statute, aren't you?",
  "Doesn't, doesn't subsection b(ii) address outliers? I was surprised there wasn't more discussion of that in the briefing and maybe it's, it's because of some reason I'm unaware of. That says that the Secretary in making this determination can take into account particular types of LEAs where there is extra, additional costs. I would have thought for example if you had a very small LEA with only 20 students and the cost is particularly high because you don't have economies of scale, that you haven't -- that would, could be knocked out for that reason. Is that not how that works?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "What's the case that says \"unambiguously foreclosed\"?",
  "You begin with an argument that directly cuts against your position. They knew how to do it under the -- I assume you're referring to the education finance and incentive grant program?",
  "Well, they did it there, they didn't do it here. To me that suggests the opposite of the inference you're trying to draw.",
  "Which they did not say in this act.",
  "But for different purposes. In the one case, in this act we're worried about an extensive Federal presence that has an effect on the tax base available for schools and under the EFIG program it's an entirely different question of equalization.",
  "Well, maybe let me ask it directly. If they could so easily just say we incorporate the Secretary's regulation in EFIG, why didn't they do it here?",
  "They instead went to the trouble of mimicking part of the regulation, but not mimicking the appendix, which is where your calculation methodology is.",
  "Can I ask, is there a difference legally between a regulation and an appendix to the regulation?",
  "But you say \"incorporated,\" though. What it did was it took the language and it did not take - -",
  "No?",
  "In the EFIG statute?",
  "But in this statute the regulation says look to the, look at the appendix. Congress as I understood when it enacted our statute, it took language from the regulation; it didn't take the part that said look to the appendix.",
  "And it didn't do that here?",
  "I have a conceptual difficulty, and it may be my limitations with the way you do it. You take students and you assign a per-pupil number to each individual student.",
  "But I would have thought the per-pupil concept only makes sense if you're dealing with LEAs. They have a per-pupil number because they've got a bunch of pupils. You take individual students, and you know for example in that school district you don't spend the same amount of money on the kindergartner that you spend on the eighth grader. And yet, you give the kindergartner a per-pupil number and the eighth grader a per-pupil number that is the same. It's an artificial association. It makes sense to speak of per-pupil numbers when you're referring to the LEAs because they have so many pupils, they get so much money, you can do the calculation. It doesn't make sense to say, you know, John Smith the kindergartner has a per-pupil expenditure of a thousand dollars. He may have $200 and the eighth grader 2,000, so why are you creating this artificial association and then using, using that methodology?",
  "And it's only -- the reason is to rank them if you have an entity that has a swath of students, the district, that's the way it should be ranked. When you're ranking it by pupils, maybe if you ranked them by pupils and you have the actual numbers of course, which nobody does, your methodology would make sense.",
  "No - -",
  "Well, because it's an absurd hypothetical. What is the - -",
  "What is the smallest number of districts, what is the smallest number of school districts in a State?",
  "Which State has one school district?",
  "In the, in the hypothetical you posed why couldn't the Secretary address that disparity under (b)(ii)? In other words, the school district which has only 57 students, it seems to me could be taken out of the calculation under (b)(ii), and then you would be dealing only with more representative school districts, not the special case of the particularly isolated school district or whatever.",
  "Why do you have to do that? Why do you have to do it first? It says you can take into account this -- extent to which the program reflects additional costs in particular districts.",
  "Wouldn't the statute have told you, though, to, to disregard pupils according to the ranking? It does tell you to disregard LEAs, which suggests the ranking -- at least to me, that the ranking ought to be of LEAs and not pupils.",
  "I would have thought your office had answered that question in countless briefs where it tells us to be guided by the language of the statute and not some unexpressed intent.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Manasevit.",
  "Isn't it -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "No. No. See, that's my conceptual difficulty. It is only per pupil when you're dealing with an aggregation of the pupils. If you're going to break it down pupil by pupil, which is what you do, you don't have a per-pupil number associated with each pupil. You have a number. Nobody knows what it is because nobody knows how much you spend on each individual. We know how much you give to this district, and therefore, the district has a per-pupil number, and therefore, I would have thought a reference to per-pupil numbers suggests you're grouping according to district.",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Well, that must not be right, because otherwise we wouldn't have any disparity to worry about equalization in the first place. Right?",
  "Don't you think Congress, if Congress is concerned about the, in this provision, about the impact of the Federal presence, and your reading prevents the money that Congress meant to go to those particular districts from actually reaching the districts, I mean, wouldn't we be inclined to read it the way that, let the money get where Congress meant it to go?",
  "Well, sure, but then the question is whether the State can consider it when they're figuring out how much money to give it. So in effect it's diverted.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Van Amberg, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in 05-1589, Davenport versus Washington Education Association, and 05-1657 consolidated, Washington versus Washington Education Association. General McKenna.",
  "Thank you, General. General Clement.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. West.",
  "And I thought that approach was exactly what we held was required in the Street decision, the International Association of Machinists versus Street, so that you can't get around this requirement by saying, oh well, we'll use the objectors' funds for collective bargaining and we'll use the others for that.",
  "Doesn't that objection apply whether it's opt in or opt out?",
  "Why isn't that a content-based restriction? You've got to look at it and see if it's germane.",
  "That's the argument that the State Supreme Court in footnote 6 expressly said you did not raise.",
  "Well surely, they get to make that decision, don't they? Under the statute, it's their decision whether or not -- you don't get to say, well, this is in your interests, or whether you'd want to spend the money or not.",
  "Well, you're free under this system to send them the same sort of materials you send about your PAC and say we do all sorts of good things with the money from people who opt in, you should opt in.",
  "But you want to do it without giving them that opportunity.",
  "Thank you, Mr. West. General McKenna, you have 7 minutes remaining.",
  "Well, do you see an underlying constitutional problem as to non-election expenditures that are still political expenditures?",
  "Didn't we take one in Abood?",
  "Didn't we take a position in Abood?",
  "I suppose the way the statute works, you have to opt in for the election expenditures, but you have to have a right to opt out for other non-germane.",
  "Is it content? I mean, it doesn't say which way you're trying to influence the election.",
  "Thank you, General. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in 05-1429, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company versus Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Mr. Brunstad.",
  "Now, in that case, are you saying that routinely the lawyer recovers fees in the bankruptcy case even if the debtor, the debtor was insolvent? And we're assuming insolvency in the hypothetical, although it may not fit this case.",
  "Well, there may be no briefs from them because it isn't the question on which we granted cert, is it?",
  "Thank you, Counsel.",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz.",
  "I'm not sure I agree, Counsel, that the Fobian rule is both narrower and broader than the question you try to present. For example it applies to the claims of a secured creditor for attorneys fees on a secured claim as well.",
  "Why -- it doesn't?",
  "So if you're an oversecured creditor with a claim for attorneys' fees arising under solely issues of matters of Federal bankruptcy law, the Fobian rule doesn't prevent that?",
  "Well, not everyone. I'm not clear on it.",
  "If it is a rational predicate, we might have expected to hear about it in the opposition to certiorari.",
  "No, it's an ambush and it is smuggling in the sense we don't have a court of appeals decision one way or the other on that question, do we?",
  "And if that's true -- and the reason for that I suppose is that doesn't impair the rights of the general creditors at all.",
  "No. It's quite unlike the situation, for example in Timbers, where had you in 502 a disallowance of post-petition interest. There is not in 502 a disallowance of attorneys' fees.",
  "Counsel, your brother in his reply brief said that no court of appeals has endorsed your theory, and I -- earlier you told me one had. Which one in particular?",
  "So you really want us to reach out and decide a question that's not presented when there has been no holding of the court of appeals one way or the other on the issue?",
  "If you thought the Fobian rule was wrong, you could have said that.",
  "That's an added complication. There's another case on which the Ninth Circuit's based its decision in your case, DeRoche. Your proposed solution here doesn't address the issue in DeRoche because there it's the debtor that's seeking attorneys' fees.",
  "So we still have to decide the Fobian issue. And your failure to defend it here means that we're going to have to decide in on that inadequate record. If you have mentioned that in an opposition to certiorari, perhaps we would have granted cert in the DeRoche case and had an argument about the rule that we have to decide.",
  "Your friend says it's more favorable to say the claims are unimpaired.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Brunstad, you have eight minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in 06-84, Safeco Insurance Company versus Burr, and 06-100, GEICO General Insurance Company versus Edo. Ms. Mahoney.",
  "So that if you're the CEO of your company, and a lawyer -- Federal counsel comes in and says we've got a real issue under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I need to brief you on that, we need to make an important decision about whether we are complying, you say I don't want to hear about it, I don't want to know about it. That would not be willfully violating the statute?",
  "So it doesn't have to be actual knowledge?",
  "Well, just because an issue is one of first impression doesn't mean there's a high degree of uncertainty. The statute may be clearly addressed to that issue. It hasn't come up before.",
  "First impression.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Millett.",
  "Correct me if I'm wrong. You think if I have an insurance policy, I'm paying a certain rate, they look at my credit report and they say, you know, good news, we're going to lower your rates, that's an adverse action because they might have lowered the rates even further if they had notified me about the credit report and there were some errors in it?",
  "Right.",
  "So if they lower, if they lower the rates, you still say that that fits the meaning of adverse action because they might have lowered them further if the information hadn't been erroneous?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shorr.",
  "Counsel, even if you're right about the standard, how can you suggest that it's willful here when you have no judicial construction, you have no administrative construction, you have the statutory language that at least the questions this morning have suggested is not perfectly clear? How can you suggest that the action of the companies on this case even under your standard was willful?",
  "So if we don't agree with you on that, you would lose on the application of the willfulness standard?",
  "In other words, your, your, your conclusion that this was a willful violation depends upon your assertion that the statute is perfectly clear?",
  "You're talking about the Ball letter?",
  "That wasn't even binding on the commission, so why would that be regarded as authoritative?",
  "But this is not an antidiscrimination provision. It doesn't say anyone who discriminates in the setting of race has to send out letters. It requires an adverse action. It requires an increase in the charge.",
  "Don't you have that right independently, though, every year to look at a copy of your credit report?",
  "When you say you look at the increase with respect to the best credit rate, why is that? Why wouldn't you look at it relative to say the average insured who walks in the door?",
  "I don't understand what pertinence that has to my question which is, why do you get to pick the best credit report as the baseline from which you would measure your hypothetical increase?",
  "Who's GEICO? I mean, you're talking about particular lawyers at a particular level, an ongoing debate about what this law means. If you get one lawyer who says, you know, I think you could read it this way, does that mean that GEICO reads it that way?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Miss Mahoney. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in 05-11284, Abdul-Kabir vs. Quarterman, and 05-11287, Brewer versus Quarterman. Mr. Owen.",
  "How would you compare that evidence with the evidence in Penry itself?",
  "These are closer cases than Penry, I think. You'd have to concede that, wouldn't you?",
  "In Brewer - -",
  "Go ahead.",
  "But in, in Brewer's case, it's, quoting the record, evidence of one hospitalization for a single episode of nonpsychotic major depression. So it was certainly opened for a jury to determine that as mitigating and not aggravating in assessing the likelihood that there was going to be further violent behavior.",
  "Quite a bit different than Penry.",
  "And your submission -- your submission is that every juror is, or a reasonable juror is going to look at that, and the only conclusion that they are going to draw is that he is more likely to be violent in the future? As opposed to the conclusion that there is mitigating evidence because of this, that he should -- mercy should be shown to him in light of all of this? And I just don't see how you can speculate which way the jury is going to go.",
  "So that was in, in Brewer. Now - -",
  "-- there was no reliance or no similar statement by the prosecutor in Abdul-Kabir or Mr. Cole's case.",
  "So do we have different results in these two consolidated cases?",
  "So the, so the - - but my point is the absence of a similar prosecutorial statement in the Cole case cuts against you.",
  "Where is evidence of abatement in that case that was before the jury? So that if you ask them, was it this person's fault in some moral sense, that might affect whether they wish to show mercy? And if you ask them whether he is going to grow out of it, they may well say, it was not his fault because of this brain disorder and he is going to grow out of it and that was the evidence, and so we are not going to sentence him to death.",
  "But in Penry we didn't establish a per se rule. We said it depends upon the evidence. It depends upon the instructions. It depends upon what the prosecutors say. It seems to me that you're arguing for an absolute rule.",
  "But it's not no reasonable probability, that's not the standard. The standard under Smith is whether the juries can consider this mitigating evidence in some manner.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Owen. Mr. Marshall.",
  "How do we, how does that factor in on the issues that are before us, the weakness of the mitigating evidence? In what way are we supposed to assess it? We don't have a harmless error question in these cases.",
  "So your argument is that the mitigating evidence was not precluded by, reasonable consideration was not precluded by the instruction; it was precluded by the fact that there wasn't much mitigating evidence to begin with?",
  "And that depends on the nature of the evidence, I take it? I mean, if the evidence we were talking about was biological predisposition to violence, that's only going to point in one direction, right? I mean, if the evidence is isolated incident, incidents of depression, the idea is that, well, a juror might look at that and say, well, that's why he did it, and that since it was isolated it's not likely to come up again and therefore it can be regarded as mitigating as well as aggravating.",
  "And so when you get into this evidence of child abuse, I mean, how are we supposed to decide if the evidence is sufficient so that anyone looking at it is going to say, he's only going to do it again, or if someone who's looking at it is going to say, well, there's an excuse for it and he's going to outgrow it? Do we make that determination in every case based on the particular evidence and the particular arguments that counsel made?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Marshall. You Mr. Owen, have you 12 minutes remaining.",
  "How old was Brewer at that time?",
  "But the argument is that the jury hearing this evidence in light of all the instructions will only conclude that the evidence shows that he will be violent again. They will not feel that they can take it into account in any way to determine that it's a situation in which they should extend mercy, or that, I guess it was, I get the Cole and the Brewer records confused here, but that this, the cause for the violence will abate with, with age.",
  "Or that in, I guess in Brewer's case in particular, that since the violence was caused by a particular bout of depression, that would not necessarily recur.",
  "-- that was after - - I guess the question would be under Johnson, whether or not it could be considered in some manner.",
  "Thank you Mr. Owen. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in 05-11304, Smith versus Texas. Mr. Steiker.",
  "You agree that the application of the harmless error analysis is a question of State law, though, correct?",
  "They applied, they applied a legal standard, the egregious harm standard, that depends on failure of an objection. So I would have thought they, they certainly thought that there was an inadequate objection, or they wouldn't have applied that standard.",
  "Why is that - - just, why is that too burdensome? What's so burdensome about saying I object to that instruction?",
  "You're saying, there is a difference between saying it would have been futile and saying it's high and burdensome, and I'm just wondering what your specific point is.",
  "Well, but it didn't have to reach the harmless error question after it made an erroneous determination that there was no error at all. When the case came up here and the Court determined there was error, then it was necessary to reach it. I don't see that it's changing its position at all.",
  "Wouldn't it be normal exercise of judicial restraint to say, we don't have to reach out and decide whether this error was harmless if we've already decided there's no error at all?",
  "And it's a very bad -- I think in the long term in the broad category of cases, it would be a very bad solution for defendants, because what's going to happen, once a court's determined there's no error at all, it's much easier for them to say, oh and by the way if there was it's harmless. And if they did that and then it turns out there was an error, you're going to be back here saying, well, don't be bound by their harmless error decision because they thought there was no error at all, so they didn't focus on it carefully. I would say the way they approached it in this case is the more desirable way. If you don't think there's an error don't go on and decide whether it's harmless or not in the abstract.",
  "But even if it is, logically anterior to consideration of that procedural impediment is a particular ruling on the merits and the State court didn't make that merits. They thought there was no error. It is logically not necessary for them to decide whether an error is harmless if they don't think there's an error, and to say that they waive that, that later ground I would have thought would be very surprising. Why do we remand these cases for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion if there's nothing further to be considered?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cruz.",
  "The simple question is the procedural objection, as the four judges suggested, could have precluded consideration of the Federal claim at all.",
  "And the court said we're going to go ahead and consider it, and then when it turns out that they got it wrong and there was error they had to apply harmless error review. In Texas law, harmless error review turns on the standard whether there was an objection or not, and they went back and said there was no objection. The contrary assertions assumes that when they let the claim go forward, that they were waiving any reliance on objection for any purposes, not consideration on the merits, but also for any eventual later consideration on harmless error pursuant to the established State standard.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cruz. Mr. Schaerr.",
  "Or plain error, as applied in the Federal cases under Alano.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Steiker, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "What about General, Mr. Cruz's comments that this was a minor point in counsel's summation before the jury?",
  "Is this argument an assertion that the Texas State court was wrong in its determination of this question of Texas State law?",
  "No, your argument right now.",
  "Is your argument an argument that the Texas State court was wrong on its ruling under Texas State law harmless error.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States. Mr. Dwyer.",
  "So one of the guides for reasonableness review is what's ordinary in a particular type of case?",
  "It's impossible to do in the abstract. If you're just looking at a particular case, you have no idea whether 5 years is reasonable or not. There has to be a background to it so that you know that in this type of case, people usually get a sentence of 3 years or they usually get a sentence of 10 years. And it seems to me that what's ordinary is going to be a judge -- a driving fact in determining what's reasonable.",
  "Even if you're looking at not just the number, but the reasons. In other words, the question I asked earlier, you've got nine district judges, they all say we do not depart downward for military service, and you've got one district judge that says we do. It seems to me that if the court of appeals can't review that to bring about some uniformity in the factors that are appropriate to consider, then it's essentially a lawless system.",
  "On my particular case, what's the right answer for the court of appeals? They've got two cases before them. One, the judge departs three years because of military service. The prosecutor appeals. The other, the judge refuses to depart because of military service and the defendant appeals. Should those -- what should happen with those two cases?",
  "That's got nothing to do with that case. That's got something to do with a judgment apart from the particulars of the case about whether crack should be treated the same as powdered crack cocaine. It's got nothing to do with the individual case.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dwyer. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Dwyer, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "What about Mr. Dreeben's parting challenge? What are you going to do if your client gets 10 years? You're going to argue that's an extraordinary departure from the guidelines, right?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-5754, Rita versus United States. Mr. Cochran.",
  "Does it matter what judge did in other cases? I mean, if we look on the day before he said, well, the guidelines say this, but I think this case is different, so I'm going to depart, and the day after he says I know what the guidelines are, but I'm going to impose a higher sentence? I mean, how do we know he's -- when he says I looked at the guidelines and I think they're appropriate, that he's considering himself bound by something that he may or may not agree with, as opposed to what he said? Which is, well, I cannot find that they're inappropriate?",
  "Counsel, what if there weren't guidelines at all, and the district court said maybe, you know, it's new, I want to see what other judges have done; he presses a button on the computer, give me what the sentences were looking at these facts, and finds out in the last 100 cases, this is what the sentence was. And he says this seems to me no different than those and that's the sentence I'm going to impose. Is there any problem with that?",
  "Yes, well, he looks at all the individual factors and he says they seem not terribly different from these 100 other cases and the range in those 100 other cases was, you know, 5 to 7 years, and so I'm going to give him 5 years.",
  "How is that different than the -- how is that different than looking at the guidelines, which did that in a much more comprehensive way, and saying, I don't see anything different in this case from the normal guidelines case and so I'm going to impose that sentence?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Well, if you -- if you have that, two criminals, criminal defendants, with the same identical background and everything else, one judge says, I think military service should be taken into account, so I'm going to depart from the guidelines by 3 years. The judge next door says, I don't think it should be taken into account so I'm going to impose the guideline sentence. Both cases are appealed. They're consolidated for argument. What is the court of appeals supposed to do? Uphold both of them?",
  "What if the court of appeals does that? What if the court of appeals says we've got 10 district judges in this circuit, nine of them do not take military service into account, one does, and we think that's inequitable, doesn't serve the interest in uniformity. And so even though that one judge says in the exercise of my discretion I'm going to depart, we're going to reverse that as unreasonable?",
  "I don't know how terribly different it is than the normal review for abuse of discretion. I mean, you don't even need two judges in my earlier question. Let's say you have the same judge, and for three weeks every criminal defendant who comes before him he says, I think if you have military service, you should get a reduction. And then all of a sudden he says, I see you have military service, but I'm not going to give you a reduction. I mean, is he bound by some abuse of discretion standard to be a little bit consistent? And if that's the only type of appellate review we're talking about, to ensure some degree of consistency in how similar individuals are treated in similar cases, I don't see that it raises any concern.",
  "Or presumably the further the facts suggest that you ought to depart from the guidelines range? If you've got a submission here 18 compelling reasons, you shouldn't follow the guidelines, and you get one sentence from the district court saying -- you know -- I followed the guidelines, presumably that would be the same as a significant departure without further justification?",
  "Thank you, Dreeben. Mr. Cochran, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Mr. Cochran, you've started out by saying there were two places in the record that you thought showed the judge was bound by the guidelines. 49, what was the other one?",

  "What about the underlying principle that waivers of sovereign immunity are strictly construed. And when you have a waiver on the broader statute, but shouldn't you read them together with the specific to suggest that they weren't waiving sovereign immunity when a more specific statute governed, except to the extent of the provisions in that more specific statute.",
  "Well, but there may be situations where the Government, having levied, doesn't feel the need to pursued other remedies available to it. And if you then allow a challenge to the levy to come in later the person they would have proceeded against if they didn't have the levy may have left the country, may have dissipated the funds that they would otherwise go after. They need to know early on that they are barking up the wrong tree if they have levied on the wrong property, and that's why you have a short statute to clear that up as soon as possible.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Maynard.",
  "So why was it so hard for them to say that this is an exclusive remedy, as they have done in other situations?",
  "That's even all the more reason for them to say. I mean. If there's confusion about what remedies are available and they want it to be exclusive, it's easy enough to say that.",

  "Well, you say they're the co-architects. I mean, are you saying anything more than they are given the procedural right to participate in the hearing?",
  "Isn't there a bit of -- there's a leap from saying they have these various procedural rights and they're are a party aggrieved by the decision rendered after the hearing, that's a different question, isn't it?",
  "Which just begs the question, doesn't it? I mean, you're assuming that the parents are a party to the case in Federal court.",
  "I thought it was the unanimous view of the circuits that parents, as a general matter, do not have the right to represent their children in Federal court, that the provision of the judicial code that you cited does not confer on parents, generally, the right to represent children.",
  "The statute already allows the shifting of fees to a prevailing party. So presumably attorneys can be found to take the meritorious cases. And What we are probably dealing with are cases that can't attract attorneys, even though the attorneys know that if they win, they will get their fees.",
  "Well, if they had that overriding intent, it would have been easy enough for them to make clear that this was an exception to the normal rule, that parents don't have the right to represent children in court. They did that with respect to the administrative proceeding, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out. They perhaps conspicuously did not do it with respect to the proceeding in court.",
  "I know, but 14 -- is it 1415(f)? Specifically says that parents have the right to participate in the due process hearing. I'm looking at 1415(f)(1)(A). In other words, parents have the right to participate in the due process hearing.",
  "It doesn't say they have the right to participate as parties. They have - - it says they have the right to -- for an impartial due process hearing. I would suppose if you're trying to figure out who is the party to that case, you would still think of it in terms of the child and not the parents.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Andre. Mr. Salmons.",
  "That argument proves a little too much. If you have a child who is the victim of a tort, for example, and suffers a serious injury, it is the parents who are going to have to bear the costs of accommodating that injury. And yet in any tort action, it's still the child who is the party and not the parent.",
  "So their, their rights -- so their right to proceed in Federal court should be limited to the rights that you've identified under the statute as opposed to the right to proceed on behalf of the child?",
  "In other words, you think -- you think their -- their, their rights -- the rights they can assert are only ones they can identify as their own as opposed to the child's?",
  "It is not -- it is not just party aggrieved. It's party aggrieved by the findings and decision, as opposed to party aggrieved by a denial of the procedural right, and those strike me as two different things.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Salmons. Mr. Bergeron?",
  "Does a parent have a right to bring a 1983 action if their procedural rights under this statute are interfered with by the state actors?",
  "I think I understand your argument based on 3(E), but when I look at 21a of my blue brief there's another provision on attorneys' fees and it's phrased in a very curious way. It says that fees are allowed to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability. It seems to me that's the most difficult express language for you to deal with. It doesn't say attorneys' fees happen to be allowed to parents, it's to a prevailing party who is a parent. And I understand your argument to be that a parent can never be a prevailing party.",
  "Are attorneys' fees allowed to a parent who is bringing one of these cases on behalf of a child pro se?",
  "It's a convoluted question. Okay. So there's no issue under the spending clause that a non-attorney parent would be able to claim some sort of attorneys' fees?",
  "So how is the spending clause issue very significant in terms of the exposure of the school boards?",
  "Well, that's where I have a little bit of trouble. It's not -- the underlying right is still the same. It's the right of the child to a free and appropriate public education. And that can be vindicated in court actions by attorneys who get their fees paid if they prevail, and all we're talking about is a situation where the parents can assert that same right when an attorney won't. And I'm just wondering how significant additional exposure we're talking about? And what turns on that is whether to take the spending clause argument seriously or not.",
  "Right. But you would have had to do that if they had gotten a lawyer to take the case. What, what your spending clause argument is, the State agreed to undertake this liability, that they would have to provide a free and appropriate education, that if they litigated, they would have pay the other side's attorneys' fees. But if they knew that in the case where an attorney wouldn't take it, the parents could prosecute it, and that might result in overturning their decision and that might result in greater expense, well, in that case they would not have bought into this deal at all. That seems a little implausible.",
  "I'm not disputing that it results in additional exposure. I'm just disputing that it affects the voluntariness of their agreement to undertake the program.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Bergeron. Mr. Andre, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "So why didn't Congress just add the provision making this very clear that the Senate had passed, why did the House boot it out of the conference bill?",
  "Why do you think it's totally inapplicable?",

  "How do they -- in other words, if they spend the money are they singling it out? If it turns out it costs a million dollars to build the little Pilgrim church is that an identifiable sum singled out that would satisfy your requirement?",

  "If Justice Stewart agreed completely with what the Court said, why did he write a separate opinion?",
  "And just to add to the question, before you answer, at the jurisdictional stage. In other words, this would be litigation over whether the individual taxpayer has standing. The Court would first have to determine whether the activity you're challenging is incidental or not.",

  "Again -- I asked this before, and I think you were cut off before you had a chance. Incidental with respect to what? All of the money for a particular meeting, a particular breakfast, a particular whatever, is it incidental to that, or is it incidental to however many times the President has breakfast if he goes to a prayer breakfast?",
  "So even if the expenditure is very small, but to take a particular religious symbol that might be offensive to some other people, is that incidental because the meeting went on longer and cost more than the particular religious symbol?",
  "So if it was 2 dollars, you would say it's not incidental because it covered the whole cost of purchasing the religious symbol?",
  "Of course. But the point is that makes - -",

  "We'll hear argument next in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson. General Garre.",
  "I think it needs a little upcranking. Good.",
  "Were any of these administrative actions found to be unfounded? In other words, did he win any of the trespass citations?",
  "Counsel, I -- I think part of what's happening here is there is difference between the regulation on the books and how they are enforced. Just as a hypothetical, let's say they don't -- the Government doesn't get its reciprocal easement that it wants, and so it says look, we normally don't strictly enforce these cattle trespass things, but we are going to go by the book with this guy until he gives us the right-of-way. Every time his cattle cross over the line we are going to hit him with a trespass citation. They don't do it for anybody else but, they're going to do it for him because they want to get the reciprocal right-of-way. Is that appropriate or inappropriate?",
  "So that he can't - - but you're saying his remedy is to challenge each one. But actually each one, his cattle did trespass, so he doesn't have a good case. It's just that out in the West they don't actually give citations every time a cow crosses the river.",
  "So you're suggesting they would not be immune from a State law trespass action?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Tribe.",
  "If they finally canceled it, how did it -- I mean, if it runs with the land, they don't have the authority to cancel.",
  "Well, you say -- you call it punishment, but in fact the government's position on each of these particulars has generally been vindicated. When your client has appealed, they've upheld the trespass citations. When you've sued for malicious prosecution, the suit's been rejected. Which of the government actions do you not have an existing remedy for, apart from the Racketeer and Corrupt -- RICO Act or the, this new Bivens claim?",
  "Can you point to any one governmental action for which you do not have an existing remedy?",
  "You have a malicious prosecution claim for that. You brought that, you lost.",
  "You could have brought one.",
  "Well, if the position of the Government were more fairly represented they would say, we don't want everyone to be able to claim that everything we're doing under color of law is retaliation, because then we'll hear that against IRS agents, we'll hear it against OSHA agents. So long as you -- and their position is you have a remedy for everything you're complaining about, and you invoked some of them and you lost, you didn't invoke others and so you didn't prevail. But don't create a whole new remedy just because you're dissatisfied with having to pursue each one individually.",
  "You say this clearly establishes. Are the BLM folks supposed to have known about Willett versus Devoy?",
  "-- as clearly establishing their liability for what you call extortion? I'm sure what they would call trying to save the taxpayers money and getting the type of reciprocal agreement with this landowner that they have got with thousands of others.",
  "You agree if the case were otherwise -- and I gather we have a factual dispute on that -- that it would have been all right? I mean, if he didn't have this other easement already, but they were trying to negotiate it, that this type of playing hardball, I guess is one way to put it, would be all right?",
  "Well, that's what I'm trying to get, to see if you agree with that. In other words, everything about this case would otherwise be, I'm sure not breaking the laws, but otherwise it would be all right if they were trying to get a reciprocal easement?",
  "But are they disabled from negotiating? If they go up to somebody and say, you know, we'd really like a right-of-way because we have some interest in lands that we need to maintain on the other side, and the person says, no and, you know, get off my property, do they have to shrug their shoulders and say all right? Or can they say, well, you know, we're neighbors, we have a lot of interests in common and we should work together? Is that all of a sudden extortion?",
  "So how many trespass - -",
  "-- citations for his cattle does it take before it's all of a sudden extortion?",
  "And he challenged the citations and they were rejected.",
  "No. A, an action against the Government for ramming your sailboat is directly responsive to that. You get -- you get full recovery.",
  "You don't need the Constitution to the sue the Government for ramming your sailboat. Basic state tort law.",
  "You can answer. (A little laughter.)",
  "Thank you, Counsel.",
  "Mr. Garre, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Well, then why did you revoke it later, if it wasn't valid?",
  "But their argument is broader. It says you can't look at each little piece. You've got to look at the overall structure, and overall they are doing it to extort a property right they don't want to pay for, and they are not doing - - other people's cattle cross over and they don't prosecute them. Now, let's assume that's correct on the facts. Are you saying that they have no remedy for that type of extortionate activity?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "The Court will hear argument first today in case 06-278, Morse vs. Frederick. Mr. Starr.",
  "But the problem - - the problem, Mr. Starr, is that school boards these days take it upon themselves to broaden their mission well beyond education or protection from illegal substances, and several of the briefs have pointed out school boards have adopted policies taking on the whole range of political issues. Now, do they get to dictate the content of speech on all of those issues simply because they have adopted that as the part of their educational mission?",
  "Well, I think that -- I think you're right about that, and I guess my question goes to how broadly we should read Tinker. I mean, why is it that the classroom ought to be a forum for political debate simply because the students want to put that on their agenda? Presumably the teacher's agenda is a little bit different and includes things like teaching Shakespeare or the Pythagorean Theorem, and just because political speech is on the student's agenda, I'm not sure that it makes sense to read Tinker so broadly as to include protection of those, that speech.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "So -- so you think that the, not a 15 foot banner but a very discrete button that says \"legalize marijuana,\" although it might be covered as not being disruptive under Tinker, it could be inconsistent with the school's mission and prohibited on that basis?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Mr. Mertz.",
  "It's a case about money. Your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.",
  "But there's a broader issue of whether principals and teachers around the country have to fear that they're going to have to pay out of their personal pocket whenever they take actions pursuant to established board policies that they think are necessary to promote the school's educational mission.",
  "And you think it was clearly established that she had to allow a student at a school- supervised function to hold a 15-foot banner saying \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\"?",
  "But can't the school decide that it's part of its mission to try to prevent its student from engaging in drug use and so that it's going to have a viewpoint on drug use and that viewpoint is going to be that it's opposed to it and so that it takes a particular view with respect to signs that in their view seem to encourage drug use?",
  "So your position would be different if this were in the student gym and they were having a discussion. There was a program to discourage drug use and he held up his sign; you would say it would be all right to take down the sign inside the school gym?",
  "So it doesn't matter that this is outside. It matters on the content of the sign, not the location?",
  "So it's a political -- even assuming it's a political issue, the question is whether the school has to say our classrooms, our field trips, our sponsored and supervised activities are a forum for that debate?",
  "And disruption does not include undermining the message they want to send? It has to be some type of physical disruption. But undermining the message they want to send, they can't make the judgment that that's not allowed?",
  "Does the school have to be completely neutral in that respect? Does it have to punish who says that was a good program, I'm not going to use drugs, and you shouldn't either, because he's taking position on a public issue?",
  "Where does that notion that our schools have to be content neutral -- I thought we wanted our schools to teach something, including something besides just basic elements, including the character formation and not to use drugs. They have to be neutral on whether you should use drugs or not?",
  "Why did he go where he went?",
  "Why did he choose that location to unfurl his banner?",
  "I think it's - -",
  "Can we get back - - I'm sorry.",
  "Can we get back to what the case is about. You think the law was so clearly established when this happened that the principal, that the instant that the banner was unfurled, snowballs are flying around, the torch is coming, should have said oh, I remember under Tinker I can only take the sign down if it's disruptive. But then under Frazier I can do something if it interferes with the basic mission, and under Kuhlmeier I've got this other thing. So she should have known at that point that she could not take the banner down, and it was so clear that she should have to pay out of her own pocket because of it.",
  "And so it should be perfectly clear to her exactly what she could and couldn't do.",
  "That gets back to the point I was trying to make earlier. He came here because it was the school event, the school sponsored activity. He could have gone anywhere along the route. He knew that it was coming by the school, he knew that they were going to be, the students were going to be released to see it. He went to join up with the school even if he were truant that day.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Mertz. Mr. Starr, you have a minute remaining.",
  "Thank you counsel, the case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler. Mr. Haltom.",
  "As I read the Court's opinion in Brecht, the Brecht standard on harmlessness is based on the structural consideration that your under collateral review at that point, rather than under direct review. You would apply a different harmlessness standard that doesn't seem to take into account the fact that it's collateral review rather than direct.",
  "Well, I guess that's where maybe we -- is the subject of debate, whether the central theme in Brecht was, this is collateral review, and that calls for a different standard, or whether the central theme was Chapman review had been undertaken, and therefore, that calls for a different standard. I'm not sure I agree with you that the latter is the case.",
  "Page what?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Where is that in the question presented?",
  "You're now arguing that under Brecht this should not have been harmless; is that the point you're making?",
  "That wouldn't help us resolve the conflict in the circuits between which standard is applicable, though, right?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Haltom. Mr. Moody.",
  "Counsel, if the State court had conducted a Chapman review, erroneously, how would that be reviewed under Federal habeas? You would ask under AEDPA whether it was an unreasonable application of Chapman?",
  "That seems awfully refined, doesn't it, to do two different analyses? Is this an -- is this an unreasonable application of Chapman? And then apply the Brecht standard after determining that it was an unreasonable application of Chapman?",
  "Do you think the question of the application of Brecht is included within the questions presented?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett?",
  "I suppose if we're going to apply the Brecht standard ourselves, we would have to do the same thing.",
  "There's no evidence or inference that it was close on the alternative murderer theory, which is the only thing that Maples' testimony goes to.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Haltom, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Well, how strong is this witness, who didn't even know if it was a serious conversation, didn't hear the beginning of it, and didn't -- couldn't tell whether he was talking about something that happened 10 years before or 2 days before?",

  "Well, we didn't - - haven't applied it to a penalty phase closing argument, but we've certainly applied the general standard to the penalty phase.",
  "I'm sorry, counsel. Maybe, counsel, if you could answer that question?",
  "Counsel, I'm looking at the quote, the statement, the reference to Patton, and I have to say I don't read it as imposing a duty. It says what the prosecutor says is that sometimes you've got to kill and sometimes you've got to risk death because it's right. His point is that at some point, at some times, you have to impose death because it's right, not because it's your duty as a soldier. Now, where is the reference to you have this duty as a soldier in the prosecutor's statements?",
  "If those direct Federal cases were interpreting the constitutional provisions directly, they would count as established law?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Blume?",
  "That was objected to and the objection was sustained, correct?",
  "Which in that case, AEDPA says we look to clearly established law by our U.S. Supreme Court decisions. Which is the clearest U.S. Supreme Court decision that was violated here?",
  "Well, pick which one do you think is the most directly applicable.",
  "It's not Romano. Romano was an introduction of evidence case, right?",
  "My point is simply the level of generality at which the guiding principles were articulated, which helps when you're applying it, but in determining -- it is the point Judge Bowman in dissent that when you don't have a case that's close, that you have more leeway in terms of the deference to the Court, because it's not a clearly established precedent of the Supreme Court. Yes, there are the Jenner cases that establish the general principles, but the question is how clearly those were contravened before you can say it violated clearly established law.",
  "So Judge -- Judge Bowman would be an unreasonable prosecutor? He dissented; he thought these were not unreasonable on the basis of on clearly established law.",
  "The standard is unreasonable in light of clearly established law.",
  "Well no, he specifically recognized there was nothing on all fours and that there these other generally applicable decisions and he thought the state courts had broad -- a broader range when there was no decision on all fours.",
  "I'm reading at the bottom of page 820 in the petition appendix.",
  "To -- to send a message?",
  "What the defense lawyer said to the jury in his closing was if you vote for life, you are sending a message. He said if you vote for life, you are still doing your duty.",
  "How was that message -- a different message, I guess, but he can say send a message, but the prosecutor can't?",
  "Your recital was not a complete picture of the case. This was an assassination of a witness in a Federal drug prosecution, with how many shots to the head?",
  "Six. And the jury determined unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt that this was the guy who did it. So you do have to look at the penalty phase in the context of those facts.",
  "What do you -- what should a prosecutor's closing -- penalty phase argument look like? What are the sorts of things that he should be talking about?",
  "Of course, the defense argument was not focused on Weaver either. The defense counsel said it was a vote for life, fight for it. Always fight for life, always, always. The argument by the defense wasn't -- and it's hard for me to imagine in a penalty phase how the arguments wouldn't extend beyond the particular individuals.",

  "What about -- what about the reliance interest, though? I mean, hasn't a whole industry of discount stores developed in reliance on the Dr. Miles rule? And don't we need to be concerned about the disruption to that established practice?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Hungar?",
  "Well then, what's the great benefit then in changing the rule if it's perfectly legal to achieve the same result already?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hungar.",
  "Mr. Coykendall.",
  "What is your main objection to -- I mean, it's hard to propose a rule of reason. Why, why can't the rule of reason work to promote the objectives you've just articulated?",
  "Well, I thought the Ping brief that was referenced earlier made a point that it made, the prices may be -- resale price -- the current Dr. Miles rule may result in increased prices because of the inefficiencies for those retailers, or of those manufacturers who want to establish a regime where something other than price is important, and they have to do that unilaterally, which increases inefficiencies.",
  "Why is that? Why can't -- eliminating the rule, I thought the whole point was they would just put in their contracts, you have to sell it at this price, and they could enforce the contracts, rather than having to have these machinations of making sure they don't do anything that looks like an agreement with their retailers.",
  "Why would you argue that those are more efficient than resale price maintenance?",
  "Well, you can add the contractual provisions you were talking about to a contract that has a minimum resale price. The minimum resale price is to take away the incentive from the retailer not to carry through on the non-price aspects.",
  "Your reference to the will of Congress, they haven't enacted legislation that supports the result you seek.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Underwood?",
  "Well, it's also been settled law for 90 years under the Colgate doctrine that manufacturers can achieve the same results, albeit more inefficiently. Doesn't it make sense to allow them to adopt the most efficient means to an end that is already completely legal?",
  "But of course, they could always pass a law saying that if their intent is so clear. They didn't do that here.",
  "But they could. I mean, you could easily write the agreement saying you have to charge this much and because you have to charge this much you also have to provide the training, the service, whatever the non-price inducements are.",
  "But then the retailer, but then the retailer might have a real incentive not to do a good job on the service because they really want to market it for price, not for service.",
  "Well, but there you have the free rider problem, which is you go to the fancy show room, you figure out what you want, and then you buy it at the discount store.",
  "And that no longer is applicable?",

  "We'll hear argument next in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell. Mr. Mancino.",
  "But you knew that 14 days was the maximum because the motion asking for it cited and quoted from the rule.",
  "What if, what if the District Court gave you an extra month? Would your argument still be the same, that that -- because the court set it, that trumps the limitation in the rule?",
  "Why isn't -- this is just a notice of appeal. Why would you -- why not file it the same day? In terms of looking at it from some equitable sense, I don't understand why you wait toward the end of the period assuming you hadn't focused on the difference between the 14 days and the days allowed. What -- why, why would you delay filing the notice of appeal?",
  "Does it make -- does it a difference that we're dealing with the safety valve provision? In other words, you've got the 30 days to file; and then this rule allows you to -- it's a safety valve, if you didn't get the notice or whatever, you've got a certain procedure that can give you the extra 14 days. And now it seems to me that you're asking for a safety valve on top of a safety valve. And I wonder if there's some point where you cut off the -- allowing an out for missing the deadline.",
  "Well, but as soon as you start talking about an exception from the provision in the rules, then you're going to get a lot of applications and there are going to be a lot of different reasons for why it wasn't filed on the last day. Once that -- it seems to me, you open it up for an indeterminate ruling.",
  "No, but Justice Kennedy's point I think is critical. In other words, the drafters of the rule obviously wanted to provide a safety valve. But they also appreciated that you can't have it open-ended. So they did impose limits on the -- if you want to call it equitable exception to the 30-day rule. And it seems to me that you sort of restrike the balance the drafters of the rule struck if you allow further equitable departures from their, their rule.",
  "Would your -- would your proposed exception, does it work the other day? I mean, let's say the district court entered this order and set a date certain for you to file the notice of appeal, and only gave you seven days on his count rather than 14, and you filed it on the ninth day, in other words within the 14 days given under the rule. Would you be out of luck because of what the district court set out in its order as what's binding, as opposed to what the resume says? Or could you rely on the fact the rule says you get 14 days?",
  "Why wouldn't the same approach work the other way? The rule says 14 and the judge was wrong to give you more?",
  "All of that might have -- all those things might have been going on in the judge's mind, but you don't contest that the 14-day period was not complied with? You don't have an argument that you complied with the 14-day period?",
  "One of the things I think the drafters of the rule wanted to assure is that there would be a point at which the prevailing party in the district court could know with certainty there wasn't going to be further proceedings in the case, and that's the purpose of the 180-day period and all that. It's not open-ended. Under your rule where the actual time for filing could be at some indefinite point, they'd never really quite have that assurance, would they?",
  "Well, what would be an unreasonable period of time if the two or three days is not? Would another 10 days?",
  "You think we should have a rule of reason rather than a per se rule.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Marshall?",
  "So he hasn't received, just quoting from Osterneck, he hasn't received assurance that the act has been properly done?",
  "In other words, if he came back and said, was my notice of appeal timely or something, and the judge at that point ruled, then it might come under that provision. But this is just - - prospectively, he could have filed this timely even after the judge issued the order. In other words, he could have filed it on the 14th day. He didn't have to wait until the 17th day.",
  "That would be the very narrow circumstances doctrine, not the unique circumstances doctrine.",
  "You can finish your answer.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Marshall.",
  "You're sure habeas cases are classified for this purpose as civil rather than criminal?",
  "Looking at the rule, it does require these findings. Has that been interpreted to require that they be written on the record or is that simply something that's supposed to guide the district court?",

  "Thank you, Mr. Shapiro. General Clement.",
  "They might, but they haven't yet. A couple of times you've used this phrase cutting across IPOs. Are you saying there should be an absolute immunity from antitrust prosecution within a single IPO?",
  "Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Lovell.",
  "What about the Solicitor General's suggestion about extending antitrust immunity to a single IPO? In other words, what's wrong with that? That's where the SEC's regulation seems to be most pervasive, and what you can do in the context of an IPO if your allegations cut across IPOs that might be different.",
  "What are you talking about when you say a horizontal agreement? Are you talking about a group of underwriters in the context of a single IPO?",
  "No.",
  "I'm trying to grasp the difference between the single IPO and multiple. So in response to Justice Breyer's hypothetical, they all agree in the context of a single IPO, let's make sure everyone's going to hold the stock for a month, and you say no problem.",
  "Well, if the same underwriters get together the next month, they've got a different IPO and they say, you know, let's do the same thing we did last time because seemed to work well in terms of the issuance and the capital formation. All of a sudden that's an antitrust problem?",
  "So your test is it has to be prohibited by the securities laws?",
  "What do you say to the -- sort of stepping back from the trees to the forest, to the general suggestion that Congress has been tightening up the requirements for private securities litigation over the past few years; and you're bringing this now as antitrust claims as a way to circumvent Congress's regulation.",
  "But the problem - - the problem is that, of course, these people are to some extent under the securities laws in the business of fixing prices. They get together as a syndicate, a syndicate, and say well, you have to figure out what price we're going to charge for this initial public offering. It looks, if you didn't understand the context, it would look an awful lot like an antitrust violation. And the problem is, I guess, that -- that when you take that type of evidence, the type of evidence you're going to be relying on to show that there's price fixing, it is exactly what the SEC wants the people to do. They want them to get together. They want them to agree on an appropriate IPO price that's going to contribute to capital formation and everything else. And how do you at, as Justice Alito pointed out, at the 12(b)(6) stage, how is a district court supposed to say well, this is the bad price fixing, this isn't the good price fixing?",
  "How did they applaud them?",
  "The SEC which is the agency charged with supervising those markets, thinks otherwise.",

  "Do you have a position on Justice Alito's earlier question about whether the standard at the summary judgment stage is the same as the standard at the pleading stage?",
  "Thank you Mr. Shanmugam. Mr. Miller.",
  "You're arguing the facts and the inferences. You said the Seventh Circuit got it right. As I read their articulation of the standard on page 20A of the petition appendix, it's the normal standard that would have been applied prior to the passage of the PSLRA. Could a reasonable person infer -- Congress passes a law saying they've got to give rise to a strong inference. Shouldn't that have changed the standard?",
  "I don't understand the Seventh Amendment argument here. Congress can surely articulate the standard that's going to be applied as a matter of substantive law. If Congress says, you have to prove by clear and convincing evidence, that doesn't interfere with the Seventh Amendment because a jury would be instructed pursuant to that standard.",
  "I thought you told me that Congress could set a high level of burden on factual issues, and that that wouldn't intrude upon the Seventh Amendment.",
  "Are you saying that Congress can not set a fact burden on the merits that is different than preponderance of the evidence.",
  "If I'm with you so far, why would you suppose that Congress would create a different standard on the motion to dismiss than they meant to apply at the merits standard?",
  "Well, then what was Congress trying to do when they said strong inference? It seems to me that if you think the standards have to be the same at pleading and at proof, and Congress says strong inference at pleading, it means you have to show a strong inference at proof, and that's why there's no Seventh Amendment problem.",
  "But all of those cases were before the PSLRA where Congress, it seems to me, established a very different standard. They said they have to support a strong inference.",
  "Strong inference was not the test that was being applied in Anderson, Liberty Lobby, in any of those cases.",
  "How does that change how we should read strong inference in the statute? Are you saying don't worry whether it's a strong inference or not because labor unions are bringing the cases and they're not going to bring a frivolous case? No. Congress said there has to be a strong inference. And what concerns me is that the very standard that the Seventh Circuit articulated said simply could a reasonable person infer. The notion of strong inference isn't in that standard at all.",

  "Counsel, what - - what do you do about 1447(e) which says that if after removal joinder might defeat subject matter jurisdiction, the court can deny joinder or permit joinder and remand the action. In other words, you have got subject matter jurisdiction but the statute contemplates it may -- later -- later you may lose subject matter jurisdiction and you can remand it there. And I suppose that that needs to be interpreted in pari materia with (c) so that the remands would not be subject to review. It seems to me the same situation here. You have got allegedly subject matter jurisdiction. It is later defeated, and it is remanded. Why shouldn't that be covered by (c)?",
  "But you don't have any doubt that a remand under 1447(e) would be covered by 1447(d), do you?",
  "Counsel, it's a good thing you've got a lot of fallback arguments because you fall back very quickly. I would have thought your answer to Justice Alito would be, the statute says if it's remanded, it's not reviewable on appeal or otherwise. And if it's remanded for a silly reason, that will be corrected on review of the State supreme court by this Court.",
  "That certainly changes the argument. So the notice of appeal that's filed or the brief on appeal says not only was the court wrong, it was patently wrong, and the court of appeals has to consider that before determining whether it has jurisdiction to review the remand order.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Simon. Mr. Frederick, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke. Mr. Farr.",
  "Thank you Mr. Farr. Mr. Salmons.",
  "So if the Department of Labor had enacted its regulations as originally proposed, those regulations would have been invalid?",
  "Not seemingly conflicted. They conflict.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Salmons. Mr. Becker.",
  "The same time that 552.3 was finally promulgated.",
  "They came out together, right?",
  "How -- putting aside -- putting 552.109 aside, how is 552.3 a plausible interpretation of the statute?",
  "What employment would someone who's hired by a third party be engaged in if not domestic service employment?",
  "Ought not to get as much deference from the courts.",
  "So why are you sure there's a conflict in the first place? You know, 552.3 says that the term domestic service employment refers to services performed in the home of the employer. It doesn't say it only refers to that. And then you go down and 109 says it also includes employees who are employed by a third party. I mean, can't they be reconciled in that way.",
  "It's not the way the Agency has done it. But you don't think we should defer to them, anyway. So - -",
  "Yeah, but it says it refers to something. It doesn't say as many of these regulations and statutes do, is, you know, it is defined as. And particularly when you're confronted with what would otherwise be a conflict, maybe refers to should be read to mean includes rather than is defined as.",
  "Well it is interesting when you look at -- I mean, they're -- it's a good point. It's interesting when you look at the other definitions, the babysitting, it says this provision shall mean. Here it just says it refers to. Let's see, the other ones -- casual basis, shall mean. Companionship services, shall mean. This one doesn't say shall mean. It says it refers to this. I'm just wondering if that's something that suggests it's not intended to be as exclusive as the other definitions.",
  "There it says --there it says includes. And if you're talking about 552.101, there it says the term includes persons frequently referred to as private household workers.",

  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Glitzenstein?",
  "That's not quite right. They would look at that in the context of reviewing the permits that are issued by the State agencies.",
  "No, what he's suggesting is there isn't going to be any impact on any endangered species until a particular permit is issued by the State agency, and that those permits are submitted to the Fish and Wildlife Service for their review.",
  "What does that have to do with the -- I'm sorry.",
  "But the point -- the point is that it's the issuance of a permit under the program, whether administered by the Federal Government or the State government that has the potential for jeopardizing endangered species. It is not the administration of the program. And EPA has in place the procedures to allow them to review the particular permits, which what is what might jeopardize an endangered species. And they don't need to leverage their limited authority, their non-discretionary authority to approve a transfer, to have that authority to review the actual act that might jeopardize an endangered species.",
  "So what is -- is there any limitation? Let's say that EPA says we're all set to approve this transfer, except OSHA sent us a letter and they don't like the occupational safety rules you have at the State environmental agency; so until you change those rules, or enter a memorandum of agreement that you're going to change those rules, we're not going to approve the transfer.",
  "Yeah, like the OSHA act. It says, you know, the states should do this, and they're not doing it. So EPA can leverage their approval into any area of law?",
  "But sometimes states say no. So if they say no, presumably they're going to have to impose the obligation as a condition of approval.",
  "Yes.",
  "Jeopardy from the issuance of a prospective future issuance of a permit by Arizona if they get the delegated authority. And that issuance of the permit would be subject to objection and review by EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service.",
  "The position that EPA has taken.",
  "Under their authority.",
  "So how does it matter whether they have it or if it's transferred to Arizona?",

  "One thing I couldn't clearly discern from your brief is the significance you attached to the defendant's, defense failure to object. How does that enter into our analysis?",
  "I thought Justice Stevens's articulation of Judge Kozinski's opinion was exactly right but I thought you would in response cite us to page 208a where the Washington Supreme Court said that those jurors' views, including Mr. Deal, would have prevented or substantially impaired their ability to follow the court's instructions and abide by their oaths as jurors. It seems the court of appeals judge overlooked that.",
  "Is this something particular under Washington procedure, this summary and conclusions section at the end of the opinion?",
  "All right.",
  "You may reserve the remainder of your time for rebuttal.",
  "Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Ms. Elliott.",
  "But that's the beginning of the questioning, isn't it? It is not the end of it. It is surely not the law that just, whenever a juror says sure, I'll follow the instructions, that he's automatically -- has to be seated?",
  "After several times saying the only time he would consider it is if the person is going to reoffend. I mean, if he just gets the right answer once out of six times and it's the last time, is the judge required to ignore the prior colloquy?",
  "But look at page - - look at page 262. He says, you know, could -- could you -- when do you think the death penalty is appropriate? If the person would reviolate if released.",
  "There are others.",
  "What if the -- what if the voir dire -- what if the juror said just what he said on a few occasions, that I would consider it if the person would reviolate? And that was all. That would be a basis for excusing him?",
  "You don't go as far as Judge Kozinski?",
  "Now on the that, just the language you just focused on, on page 75, if that was correct, you disagree with it, but if if the court concluded that the juror had not overcome the idea that he must kill again before imposing the death penalty, that would be a sufficient basis for excusing him?",
  "Yeah. How many paraded by? I mean, do we know?",
  "In your view, do we look at this any differently through AEDPA than if we were looking at this on direct review?",
  "So that makes a difference in the standard of review that we apply in this case?",
  "So, does that mean we give a greater degree of deference?",
  "I'm just trying to get a handle on your view as to whether the standard of review with respect to deference to the State court is different in this respect than it would be on direct review?",
  "I thought your brother made the point that there was a more elaborate explanation of the trial judge's determinations when there had been an objection.",
  "Substantially impaired.",
  "Which is a lot different than irrevocably committed.",
  "You would agree that substantially impaired is not the same as irrevocably committed?",
  "Well, there's a third choice which under AEDPA is the Washington State court decision to which we should defer.",
  "Yes.",
  "On page 208, though, the Washington Supreme Court also stated the standard, as I understand it from Witt, that Mr. Deal's views would have prevented or substantially impaired his ability to follow the court's instructions.",

I would not want to get to a situation where people feel the need to artificially keep a case alive simply to ensure their entitlement to attorney's fees. So how do you protect against that?",
  "So what do you do in a situation of mootness where there's -- you know, they'd be happy to pursue the claim to establish that they prevail on a permanent junction as well as a preliminary one, but the case has become moot. Are they automatically disentitled to attorneys' fees in that case?",
  "Well, there may be a pint to pursuing it but I'm not sure it's one that the locality governments -- I mean if you ask them the question, would you rather be liable for attorney's fees where you lose in a preliminary injunction but then the case becomes moot, or would you rather have to face individual officer liability to prevent the case from becoming moot? Or would you rather face ongoing litigation to prevent the case from becoming moot because there's too much invested in the fees -- they might choose the former.",
  "Well, the plaintiffs decided to challenge it to the end. But I'm suggesting that if they know they might -- it might result in a loss of attorneys fees, when all they really wanted was a particular demonstration, others might pursue it differently.",

  "Is it -- can a preliminary injunction never be the basis for an award of attorney's fees?",
  "I have never understood why that's an issue. Can't the parties -- it seems to me an exception that isn't consistent with the theory. Why can't the parties just agree on attorney's fees in the settlement agreement and the consent decree and then it wouldn't have to be an issue?",
  "Ms. Millett, did I hear your legal test a while ago is an enduring change in the defendant's behavior? Is that your standard?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Millett. Now we'll hear from you, Mr. Galanter.",
  "No, no. They left Federal court having lost on the permanent injunction.",
  "Their legal, their legal claim was that these regulations were invalid under the First Amendment. And they lost on that legal claim.",
  "Well, they succeeded in filing their complaint as well, but they don't get attorney's fees for that, because they were successful at the filing complaint stage.",
  "All the work you did to show irreparable harm, balance of the equities, not on the merits, you're saying that's off the table?",
  "Counsel, your approach, just as there are problems from the judicial economy perspective with your friend's approach, but doesn't your approach require the States to fight tooth and nail on the preliminary injunction because they're running the risk if they lose there, they're going to pay fees even if they prevail later? As opposed to, as is often the case, they might say, you know, we consent to the entry of the preliminary injunction or we don't -- you know, we're going to save our energy. Doesn't it require them to fight every possible stage, including appeal and so on?",
  "Well, he doesn't have to say he's wrong. What often happens is as it is here, he say's I've got 24 hours, I don't have a brief from the other side, I kind of make the best guess I can. And then later on after an adversary presentation and an evidentiary hearing, he issues a different ruling. As here, he doesn't have to say I was wrong on my 24-hour off-the-cuff guess. It's just that I'm better informed. Is that repudiation or not?",
  "Did the court order provide for a screen?",
  "So the State prevailed to some extent as well. They prevailed to the extent of getting in the order that they can do what they had done, which is erect a screen.",
  "So they're entitled to some -- I mean, if -- this is not a reciprocal switching thing, but I mean, it does go to the question of whether or not you are the prevailing party when your opponents have prevailed to a significant extent as well.",

  "I know you were asked this question and your answer may have just slipped by me. Why, if you had asked for a TRO, why would you not be entitled to fees on that?",
  "No. I thought you prevailed in the sense that you secured relief. That's how you articulated it up to this point.",
  "The State did make a point, that they were kind of -- this was short notice and they were doing the best they could on short notice. I mean, they showed up but only sort of.",

Couldn't you have fit your claim under 2244(b)(2)(B), I guess, on that basis? And then we don't have to engage in the fiction that a second petition is actually not a second petition.",
  "I suppose it doesn't fit comfortably under there, but I guess the argument would be that -- guilty of -- we've used the concept of being guilty of the death sentence as opposed to guilty of the crime before, and the fact finder -- you wouldn't be sentenced to death if the sentencer had known you were incompetent. I appreciate that it's not the most comfortable fit, but at least the part -- it seems to be addressed to the question of a factual predicate that's not present at the time of the first habeas petition. And that seems to be your justification for not filing it at that time.",
  "Right. The point is that (b)(2)(B) is addressed to that precise situation where the facts aren't present when you file the first application.",
  "The constitutional violation won't occur until the execution?",
  "It's prospective, as you said?",
  "Could you maybe elaborate on that? And mean if you have someone who is competent at the time they're convicted, competent at the time they're sentenced, and you say they're walking to the gurney to be executed, you know, they fall and hit their head and they don't understand it, it's somehow very cruel to go forward with the execution at that point, while it wouldn't have been before? I -- it seems to me, I mean, obviously competence at the trial and sentencing is important. I just don't understand the concept that it has to continue to the point of execution.",
  "Well does he understand why he's being imprisoned? I mean, does this, the Ford right extend to prison? Is it cruel to keep someone locked up for life when they don't understand why they're being locked up for life?",
  "No. There's an element of retribution to imprisonment, just as there is to capital punishment. Both deterrence and retribution in both instances, I would have thought.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Cruz?",
  "How should he have raised the claim to avoid the second or successive bar?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cruz. Mr. Wiercioch, your rebuttal time was used up but not primarily by you. If you want to take two minutes for rebuttal?",

  "We'll hear argument next in case 06-376, Hinck vs. United States. Mr. Redding.",
  "But not with respect to abatement of interest in particular.",
  "But why would you not want some -- a larger taxpayer to be able to proceed in the tax court if you can also proceed in the claims court?",
  "But you have no basis for an abatement of interest action apart from 6404(h), correct? That is the only place you get the actual cause of action to sue for abatement of interest?",
  "But what would you cite to, in response to the prior cases that said you had no cause of action for abasement of interest?",
  "But the one I'm looking at just has (e)(1). Did you have a page number?",
  "Well, sure. But - - but that's just saying, if -- you used to have the entitlement under (e)(2) and you're saying well, you could bring cases under (e)(2). But 6404(h) allows you to bring cases under (e)(1). It would follow a fortiori that you could bring them for (e)(2) as well, but that doesn't prove that you could prove them under (e)(1) in the claims court or the district court.",
  "But if you went into the district court and claimed that the failure to abate interest was an abuse of discretion, what would you rely on for the -- for the cause of action?",
  "I thought the prior cases consistently, consistently said that there was no judicial review because it was \"may abate\" and that it was only with the arrival of 6404(h)(1) that there was a cause of action for abuse of discretion?",
  "So you want to look at 6404(h)(1) saying now we have a standard, but you don't want the other stuff that goes along with 6404(h)(1), which is it's in the tax court; you got to have less than ten million, blah, blah, blah?",
  "Of course, there's a fundamental difference on this particular question between pay and sue and sue - -",
  "-- prepay, because if you -- in the district court if you're paying and suing you're not really subject to the accrual of interest, right?",
  "If I owe the IRS, 1,000 dollars and they send me a bill and I paid the 1,000 dollars, they've got the money, I don't. So I don't owe interest on that, do I?",
  "The initial bill includes the interest?",
  "But still, in the tax court situation it's still accruing?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Redding. Mr. Marcus.",
  "But what the cases said prior to 6404(h) when they asked for interest abatement was not that we don't have jurisdiction to consider that claim. They would just say there's no standard to apply, so it's committed to agency discretion by law. Then all of a sudden 6404(h) comes along and gives you a standard, so that removes that objection. What's wrong with that?",
  "Well, that's because of the way that Congress enacted the language. It doesn't say that the tax court and only the tax court shall have jurisdiction. It says the tax court shall have jurisdiction. That is a, in many respects a preferred forum and they're saying you can bring it there as well, but it doesn't take away the jurisdiction that the prior courts had recognized.",
  "Don't you think it's kind of strange, though, if you have the interest abatement is available only for a particular category of taxpayer and not others?",
  "If you have a net worth of two million and one dollar you can't get any interest abatement, but if it's $2 million you can.",
  "Right, but you abate it in some cases, but you don't abate it in the others.",
  "That's what I thought, too. But then your friend explained that in the initial bill is where the interest is contained in a lot of these cases and in this case in particular. So it's not as if you have the opportunity to pay it in advance to stop the accrual of interest. Just you get the bill and you find out, you know, you owe a 1,000 dollars and 300 of it is interest.",
  "The difference - - the difference is that the district court, the claims court already has jurisdiction for pay and sue claims, if you pay the IRS you can sue to get a refund. And so this isn't as if we're looking at something that says the tax court has jurisdiction and trying to use that as a wedge to get other jurisdiction. There's already a grant of jurisdiction. The problem was, there was no standard of review for these may abate claims, and all of a sudden we find in this provision there is a standard of review, it's abuse of discretion, and that fills the void. Why can't they just use that?",
  "But I thought what you had argued before when people would try to seek this release was that there's no standard of review to hold the Secretary's exercise of discretion up against.",
  "But one thing you never said was that there was no jurisdiction, because there is jurisdiction in the district court. If you've paid money to the IRS and you want it back, you can bring a refund action.",
  "Can they bring it as additional claim after they get the final determination? They start a whole separate action for interest abatement?",
  "Is it part of the same proceeding or is it a separate proceeding?",
  "You're making the claim that it's no big deal that you have to go to the district court to get your refund and then go to the tax court to get the interest abatement, which does seem like a big deal to me. And you say, well, in the tax court you have to do it separately, too.",

  "Well, but you - -",
  "Well you've glided over the great difficulty which is it doesn't say that people identified in the statute shall be liable to other persons. It says they will be liable to, under certain circumstances, the United States, a State or an Indian tribe and they are liable for -- for other costs incurred by any other person. And it just seems that the most natural reading of that construction is that the other refers to other than the United States or a State or an Indian tribe.",
  "Well, how sure are you -- how sure are you that it doesn't protect them still?",
  "Well, when one responsible party has paid out the cost and is seeking a cost recovery claim from another responsible party, it's not too much of a stretch to call it a contribution claim, is it?",
  "You're not worried about any of that when you're dealing with an innocent party, the person you say can bring this action under 107(4)(b). Don't all those same concerns and objections apply in that case as well?",
  "But you don't know, you don't know, that you're dealing with an innocent party until the end of the litigation.",
  "Do you have another example of an innocent party who can bring an action under 107(4)(b) other than a governmental subdivision?",
  "But they're somehow affected by the hazardous release.",
  "But they're still somehow affected by the hazardous release.",
  "But my point is that subsequent owner, EPA is going to start looking at him as a PRP, not as an innocent party. In other words, there is going to have to be an awful lot of litigation before he can establish that he is not a PRP and is instead an innocent, innocent party.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hungar. Mr. Armstrong.",
  "Well, but there's nothing, there's nothing unnecessarily unfair. It turns out that the Union Oil Company is bankrupt and in part of the settlement they agreed to turn over all the documents listing whoever it was that gave them the chemicals. And it's a very complicated thing because we're dealing with people often in these cases that don't have assets and only limited responsible parties have the assets. So they're trying to recover what they can from the others.",
  "As you read the statute, you're talking about a PRP, but any other person doesn't have to be a PRP, does it?",
  "You could set up a company that cleans up these sites, right, and go traveling around the country and clean them up and then send people a bill and cite your reading of 1074(b), right?",
  "Well, if we rule in your favor presumably there will be a lot more, right?",
  "What about non-PRPs?",
  "Thanks, Mr. Armstrong. Mr. Geck.",
  "Is that how it works? They would have to, if you bring a 107 action, the defendant has to bring his responsive action under 113? Or is it as, I guess your friend had stated earlier, equitable principles are going to lead to an allocation of responsibility under 107?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Geck. (Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.) Mr. Hungar, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hungar. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in 06-8120, Brendlin versus California. Ms. Campbell.",
  "Well, it wouldn't apply in a taxicab, right? I mean, the cab is driving erratically, the officer pulls it over. If I'm a passenger in the cab, I think I can get out and catch another cab, right?",
  "But you would have no reason if you were a passenger on a bus in the normal case to assume that the officer was concerned about you. Your view would not be that they are stopping me, you'd think they're stopping the bus because the driver ran a red light or whatever.",
  "But you would state he is still seized because the car is stopped.",
  "Well, does that make a difference? Let's say, you know, the car drives through a red light and the police lights come on. The passenger surmises that it's because they ran a red light. So that's a different case? You would say it's not seized if he reasonably, objectively, reasonably assumes it's because of what the driver did.",
  "So then why are we pointing out that they didn't know? It makes no difference under your view of the case.",
  "Well then, if all that matters is the physical stop, what do you do about the cases that were talked about earlier where the other cars have to stop because of the way -- that's a physical stop and yet our cases indicate you're not seized in those situations.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Zall.",
  "What if there's a suitcase in the back seat? Just the driver, the driver's pulled over, and then somebody comes walking down the sidewalk, the driver's friend, he opens the car door, takes the suitcase and starts walking away? Wouldn't the policeman say, put that back, because he thought he had seized not just the driver but everything in the car, too?",
  "I'm talking about the suitcase. You wouldn't, you wouldn't reasonably think someone could just take something out of the car that's been stopped by the officer and walk off with it, right? Everything, all the contents of the car, are seized as well as the driver, right?",
  "If it's not, if the opposite is true, then it is a seizure even though they stop the car?",
  "Even if they make that, even if they make that interest clear prior to the stop?",
  "No. They pull up next to them and they see that Brendlin is the passenger and they yell over: Pull over, Brendlin.",
  "It's not the police who have authority over the passenger; it's the driver. The driver's exercising authority. Just because the police say to pull over, the driver can take off and the passenger isn't seized at that point.",
  "Well, but there's - - you know, our Brown case establishes a multifactor test for determining when the illegal seizure has been attenuated and the Court hasn't applied that, the California Supreme Court hasn't gone through that test in this case.",
  "No seizure of a passenger or a driver?",
  "Finish your sentence. Sure.",
  "Thank you Counsel. Miss Campbell, you have five minutes remaining.",
  "So that -- so that, still then, it's just begging the question of whether or not his Fourth Amendment rights were violated. You're making a good case that the driver's Fourth Amendment rights were violated, but why isn't the passenger, as your friend said, just in the unlucky circumstance to have been in a car whose the driver's Fourth Amendment rights were violated?",
  "The California Supreme Court didn't have to reach that issue because it found there was no seizure.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 05-1448, Beck versus PACE International Union. Mr. Baker.",
  "Right - -",
  "I thought your argument was, once you make a decision to terminate, there are various rules that are triggered, you just can't take the money and run with it. You've got to make provision. And that merger was not one of the permitted ways of terminating a plan. Is that wrong?",
  "But the point is the $5 million is not going to these employees, it's being thrown into this vast sea of all these other employees, whose employers have not done as good a job of funding their plans. This is to the benefit not to the beneficiaries of this plan, but to other union members who don't have the luxury of having an employer who has overfunded their plan, and are trying to get that five million to help them, not your beneficiaries.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Roberts.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Clark.",
  "But I thought we just heard that the PBGC might look at it a little differently, that they are more comfortable with the annuity insuring that these beneficiaries get their benefits as opposed to just throwing the beneficiaries into a pool with your other union members.",
  "Doesn't this put you in an awfully difficult position? I mean, you're representing the union, which has other members besides these beneficiaries, and you're saying even though under their plan the beneficiaries are fully protected with irrevocable annuities, we think they're going to be better off if they're thrown in with our other members and we get the $5 million to spread out, not to these beneficiaries but among all these other members. Isn't that an awkward position to be in?",
  "And beyond as well? I mean, let's say we have 5 million extra dollars here. See, that's what I don't understand. If you're saying it's a fiduciary, I mean, how can they make a decision ever to do anything other than just give the five million to the beneficiaries?",
  "Well, the terms, the plans terms here, did not provide for merger in the event of termination, right?",
  "Even though the district court decided it? Usually in a waiver situation it's whether you argued it or whether it was addressed by the court.",
  "If you're -- if you prevail here -- I mean, the reason we have a case is because the employer overfunded the plan to the tune of $5 million. If you prevail and they cannot get that back even after fully insuring the benefits for the beneficiaries, employers in the future will be very careful not to put in one penny more than what's required to fund the plan; isn't that right.",
  "What possible equitable basis does the union have to claim this extra $5 million?",
  "It's not for these beneficiaries. It's for all the others. It's spread out among this pool in the multiemployer plan. These are the employer excess contributions. What -- looking at it as an equitable matter, what claim do they have to the extra money?",
  "Are there a lot of plans that look like that, that if there's extra money, we've overfunded that it goes back to the union, not back to the company?",
  "The union plan.",
  "Counsel, your little (ii) that you're relying on begins by saying in accordance with the provisions of the plan, the other solution otherwise provides. Where in the provisions of the plan does it say that they will consider merger?",
  "Do you know, is there a particular provision in the plan that says that? Or - -",
  "I don't read in accordance with the way you do. I read in accordance with to mean provided by the plan.",
  "Thank you Ms. Clark. Mr. Baker, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-134, The Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations et al. vs. The City of New York. Mr. Howley.",
  "Well, that brings up the basic question I have, is this a question of State law or Federal law?",
  "So even if you have different rules in different States, there is going to be one rule under Federal law under 1605(a)(4)?",
  "Well, they just may be more sympathetic to India and Mongolia than they were to Libya.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Howley. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "I thought that the Department submitted a good brief on this issue, but in 1985. What do you do with all the arguments -- I'm looking at page 12 of your brief in the Englewood case, which you argued that these liens were interests in property. Are those arguments no longer valid?",
  "The other reasons you gave, the holder of a lien can bring an action to enjoin waste, holders of liens are entitled to compensation if eminent domain is exercised. All of those reasons are still as valid as they were in 1985.",
  "Well, how can the, how can the lien holder then bring an action to enjoin waste of the immovable property?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Cardozo.",
  "Over tax liens or claims?",
  "And you don't go that far.",
  "Well, the -- the convention used language quite different than that was used by Congress. So I'm not quite sure how that international practice reflected in or arising out of the convention is terribly pertinent.",
  "And in some cases they used language directly from the convention and in this case they didn't so it seems to me a particularly ill-advised source for looking for what they were trying to do.",
  "Unless New York law is changed and you pass something saying you get a lien on property if you have delinquent property, parking tickets.",

  "We'll hear argument next in case 05-1284, Watson versus Philip Morris Companies. Mr. Frederick.",
  "So it's perfectly all right for them to adopt a new method of testing tar and nicotine that yields numbers that are far lower than the Government's method, and to publish an ad saying these are our tar and nicotine figures, and the FTC would have no problem with that?",
  "Not just the preferred method, but presumably the only one they would allow. If you used another one, they would bring a deceptive trade practices action very quickly.",
  "They still might have gotten it right.",
  "Well, I understand you have a dispute about whether that is this case, but there are many areas where the Government requires testing of products. You know, the strength of seat belts and stuff, and they specify very precise means to which those tests have to be conducted. And if someone, a manufacturer is complying with those requirements, and a challenge is brought, saying something to the effect that that test doesn't give you a good measure or something, in that situation would this removal provision apply?",
  "What if the Government says you've got to test your cars, you know, every three months or something, and you've got to send us the results of a random -- random test?",
  "Well, that doesn't seem to be a distinction. The drug companies -- the Government wants to make sure that drugs are safe and effective and so they issue regulations saying here's how you have to test it. They're just, you could say, delegating the testing to the companies.",
  "There's a difference between you are providing products and complying with testing. In other words, and if, in fact, the Government specifies precisely how the testing is supposed to be done to determine whether it, the Government, will approve the marketing of a particular drug, and the challenge, the litigation is to the testing. Somebody sues as drugs company and says you know, you tested this drug wrong, we think you should have tested it some other way, and the drug company says the Government told us how to test it -- why in that situation aren't they acting under a Government official?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Gornstein.",
  "What's -- what's your conclusion? That those are not people acting under Federal officers - -",
  "Because policing sounds like - -",
  "What about -- what about USDA food inspection? Isn't a lot of that delegated to the producers rather than the Government officials?",
  "But you still get a Government stamp.",
  "So if you are a federally certified inspector you are acting under - -",
  "What about private transportation of mail? Is the private contractor who's carrying U.S. mail, is that person -- could he remove a case under this provision.",
  "You don't care what kind of testing they do? They can change the method and change the way to resolve - -",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Olson.",
  "Mr. Olson , you've been talking a lot about testing. But when you look at the complaint in this case, testing is a small part of it. They're complaining about the modification of the tobacco blend, the weight, rod length, the circumference, use of reconstituted tobacco sheets. In other words there's a lot going on here in the complaint here besides the testing. And if the Government is in no way specifying the tobacco blend, the weight, the length, all these other things that are allegedly part of the manipulation to affect the figures.",
  "I don't understand your response to Justice Kennedy. If we determine that you're acting under the direction of a Federal officer, that would seem to me highly pertinent on the merits of a preemption argument. So it would not be just the forum, but kind of getting into the preemption merits.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Frederick, two minutes remaining.",
  "Now the FTC told us why they did it. They did it because they could save the money by having the industry do it rather than them doing it.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-969, Federal Election Commission versus Wisconsin Right to Life, and Case 06-970, Senator McCain versus Wisconsin Right to Life. General Clement.",
  "How are we supposed to decide whether this case -- if you think it's important to our resolution, how are we supposed to decide whether this particular case is typical or not?",
  "I think it's very hard to determine. Therefore, I think it's hard to determine in the abstract whether its inconsistent with the conclusion in McConnell that a vast majority of the cases would not be covered or if it's inconsistent with it.",
  "That gets back to my same question: How do we know that this is or is not outside the mainstream. We have just the three ads that are at issue here. It's not as if we have a survey of all the ads that are run during the blackout periods in particular election cycles. How do we tell whether this is within the mainstream or not?",
  "Counsel, the Court in McConnell used the term, as you've used it this morning, \"vast majority.\" What is that? Is 70 percent a vast majority, so that 30 percent of the ads are going to be outside of that and would be candidates for this as-applied challenge?",
  "You're suggesting the district court decision is not consistent with McConnell. But it seems that your approach today is inconsistent with our decision last year that you can have as-applied challenges. You're suggesting that if we allow this as-applied challenge to go forward that we have to facially strike down the section.",
  "So tell me what one, an ad that would succeed in an as-applied challenge looks like, or what the standard would be that we would apply in a way that you think would not call into question the decision in McConnell about Section 203?",
  "What you're saying, though, is if this as-applied challenge succeeds you're saying the only way we can do that is if we think that the statute is facially unconstitutional. I'm just trying to see if there's a way of - -",
  "-- approaching this as-applied challenge in a way that doesn't require us to revisit that prior - -",
  "Can I, can I understand you to suggest we ought to draw a distinction in as-applied challenges between a 501(c)(3) organization and a corporation?",
  "That is not a 501(3)(3) corporation?",
  "Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Waxman. ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, ET AL.",
  "I think it's an important part of their exercise of First Amendment rights to petition their senators and congressmen, and to urge others to -- as in these ads -- contact your senators, contact your congressmen. Just because the ACLU doesn't do that doesn't seem particularly pertinent to me.",
  "Please.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Mr. Bopp?",
  "Mr. Bopp, your argument that McConnell's facial holding should be overturned appears on page 62 of your brief. I take it you have at least 61 page arguing that your as-applied challenge can succeed without overturning McConnell's position?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Bopp. General Clement, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, General. The case is submitted.",
  "Counsel, do you agree that if we conclude the language is ambiguous, we should defer to the Secretary's interpretation in the comments accompanying the regulations?",
  "It just mirrors the statute - -",
  "Well, then - -",
  "Assuming we would think the statutory language is ambiguous, we are likely to think the same language in the regulation is ambiguous.",
  "Well, which -- which prevails, Chevron deference or spending clause presumption?",
  "Well, it depends on the particular circumstances. I mean, if the parent is able to show look, the school district is being very unreasonable here; it's clear he is going to need more than the services they were going to offer, well that wouldn't have - - MR. KOERNER. Yes.",
  "-- run afoul of any of the other provisions.",
  "I think they may - - they may well have to stay longer than 10 days to either realize that the program is inadequate or to feel comfortable that they'll be able to establish that on the record. It's pretty hard to say something's not working after only on 10 days.",
  "Oh, I don't think that's true, because the problem would be you would go to the hearing to see if you were getting the adequate education and you would have -- you would essentially have to make a facial challenge rather than an as-applied one, and the school would say, well, you didn't give us a chance; we were going to do this and we were going to do that. So it would be a heavier burden to carry. The parents would have a heavier burden.",
  "-- if they did - -",
  "No, my suggestion is still that it would be easier to prevail at the impartial hearing, if you can say, look, we tried, it didn't work, as opposed to saying, we never even tried.",
  "If I were the impartial hearing examiner, I would think that that's a harder burden for the parents to carry if they didn't even try. The school's going to come in and say, here's what we would have done if you'd given us a chance and you didn't give us a chance.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Koerner. Mr. Gardephe.",
  "So you read - - hypothesize two statutes: One, the statute before the phrase \"who previously received special education\" was added and the statute after? You read both of those statutes the same way; right?",
  "I don't understand. You read \"who previously received special education services,\" and you say that includes who previously did not receive special education services.",
  "There would be no reason for Congress to put that language in if the same right to reimbursement existed if the child had not previously received special education services.",
  "Because your friend reads that the exact opposite way and says, since (C)(iii) only makes sense if the child is in the public school, that that's a limitation on how you should read (C)(ii).",
  "In that case, isn't it pertinent that the title to (C)(ii) says \"Reimbursement for Private School Placement\"? It doesn't say reimbursement for private school placement when the child previously attended public school.",
  "That just means that (C)(ii) doesn't address the entire universe of issues that might arise. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't address exactly what its title says, \"Reimbursement for Private School Placement.\"",
  "Where is that set forth?",
  "Were those provisions at issue when this dispute arose? They are the 2004 amendments - -",
  "I suppose it's how broadly you read legislative history. I thought there was a statement by Representative Castle that this would limit the payments that school districts had to make.",
  "So when it comes to reimbursement of tuition, the parents who never place their child in the public school are in better shape than the parent who place their child in public school and then want to remove him.",
  "But cooperation does not require sending the child to the public school.",
  "Well in my case they would note have received any benefits, under the terms of the statute.",
  "That's why your friend says it serves the purpose of helping to make clear that the public school is -- whether it is or is not able to provide the appropriate public education. I mean, why would Congress have put the phrase in there - - even if it was describing as you say the most common situation -- why would it put the phrase in there if it doesn't serve that purpose at least?",
  "What you're saying is it's not a very significant hurdle, but it is going to be a hurdle in some cases.",
  "The useful purpose it serves is allow the school district to show what it can do in ten days, as opposed to a mere theoretical statement, it allows some actual concrete practice to see if the plan that the public school has developed is going to work or not going to work, that the impartial hearing examiner can evaluate in a more concrete setting.",
  "But then the whole point is the statute was then amended after Burlington. So to say what Burlington interpreted, it don't seem to me to be very compelling on the question of what the amended statute provided.",
  "You have review before the impartial hearing examiner about that alleged bad faith, correct?",
  "You have reviewed before the Hearing Examiner that alleged bad faith on the part of the school district.",
  "And what was that primary mandate?",
  "There is no issue of mainstreaming in this case at all; right?",
  "Neither of the options are mainstream options?",
  "You know, it -- I'm sorry.",
  "So is mine. Thank you, Mr. Gardephe.",
  "Mr. Garre.",
  "So in a situation where it's not in the summer, where they say, well, let's see how it works, and then they go to the public school, I would have thought your argument also would say it's not -- they don't have to give notice of 10 business days because in Burlington you said you don't -- you have to make available the tuition reimbursement. They passed a statute imposing a limitation on that, 10 business days.",
  "You don't dispute that limitation. You dispute the other one, though, which says they have to have previously received special-education services.",
  "Anywhere? I thought Representative Castle said that this would result on easing the burden on the school districts to pay tuitions.",
  "But the whole point is you don't necessarily know it's inadequate until later in time. Right? The school board thinks it is adequate.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Koerner, you have three minutes remaining.",

  "Why doesn't Congress -- why didn't Congress, in fact, do what you say they implicitly did explicitly? They could impose the 100 to 1 ratio throughout as opposed to simply as a minimum and a maximum. And they did not do that.",

  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-7949, Gall v. United States. Mr. Green.",
  "Well, I'm sure that's not always true. I mean, if the leader of some vast conspiracy is the one who blows the whistle, I suspect he may well be charged anyway.",
  "Well then, what's left of the appellate review? I mean, under your theory is there any substantive review for the appellate court or is it all just procedural under -- putting aside your logical coherence point, which - -",
  "In a typical abuse of discretion review, you still have -- for example, if you have a judge in -- well, let's say you have a judge; in one case he says because this is a -- a young defendant, I'm going to give him a lighter sentence; and in the next case says, you know, I don't think age is a factor that I should consider in the case; in the next case he says it is and then not. Each -- all of those cases, I take it, are upheld under your view on appellate review.",
  "So there can be substantive review for consideration of age?",
  "Okay, so at the same time - -",
  "But if you have two district judges in the same courthouse and the one says, when I have a young defendant I always -- I forget whether the term is \"vary\" or \"depart\" -- but I always go down, and the next judge says, I never consider age. Those -- both of those are upheld under your view, I take it?",
  "Isn't that exactly --",
  "Isn't that exactly what the Sentencing Commission did in establishing the Guidelines?",
  "Mr. Green, I understood you to respond to Justice Souter's question that courts of appeals could consider a broader range of cases in deciding whether it's an abuse of discretion in a particular case.",
  "Now, if they can consider a broader range of cases, what's so bad about suggesting that if a particular case is way out of what their broad review shows, if the broad review shows that in most cases this type of defendant gets 5 years and in this particular case, the judge gave him 30 years or gave him zero, what's wrong with suggesting that that is a factor they should at least start with in saying something's unusual about this case, we ought to take closer look?",
  "Well then, what's the point of looking at the broad range of cases if they can't do anything about it?",
  "So is it right to say if the broad range shows that most of these defendants get a sentence of 10 years in jail and in this case the person got probation, that the court should look for some reasons to explain what the difference, to justify the difference?",
  "We'll give you rebuttal time, Mr. Green, but I just have one question. I think we've gotten off the track a little bit. The question presented is about the extraordinary circumstances test and proportionality review. We've been talking a lot about what district court judges can do. What's wrong with, whatever you want to call it, saying if something is out of the norm, you ought to have some good reason for being out of the norm?",
  "That's the only question presented in this case.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Green.",
  "Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Well, you should - - I'm sorry. But I mean -- the only purpose of the presumption under your view is to trigger some inquiry into the reasons.",
  "Under 3553(a), district courts have to provide reasons anyway, right.",
  "So if there is no explanation of the reasons it is going to be invalid under the statute, quite apart from any presumption of unreasonableness.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Green, you have a minute remaining. Why don't you take three?",

  "We'll hear argument next in case 06-1005, United States versus Santos. Mr. Roberts.",
  "Why don't you continue. I'm sorry. I didn't know you weren't done.",
  "I thought your answer to the line of questioning that we were having was that the problem would still be there, even if you limited this statute to profits. You take the two bank robbers in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, the one that robs the bank, the other in the get-away car. If before the robber gave the money to the person in the get-away car, he said, now, you know, I'm keeping $100 because I had to buy the gun and that was $100, so you only get 400, so it's only the profits that they're splitting, you'd have the same problem, wouldn't you?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Vare.",
  "Didn't Justice Alito correctly suggest that these merger problems would still persist even under your definition of \"proceeds\"?",
  "No, but I mean if you have a \"profits\" definition and the enterprise has profits, all of these problems we've been talking about in terms of the merger, as I call it, between the money laundering and the underlying offense would still be there, right?",
  "I didn't see that you presented -- a separate question presented in your opposition.",
  "Where is that?",
  "Not at page (ii).",
  "Oh, but I am looking at the orange one, not the red one. The orange one is what we have before us when we decide whether or not to grant certiorari. And there you don't have a different question presented.",
  "If we adopt your position, we will have to decide a question like, for example, if the argument is I didn't have any profits because I had to pay $10,000 for a hit man to kill somebody, we would have to have a judicial decision that, yes, paying hit men is the ordinary and necessary business expense in carrying out illegal gambling operations, right?",
  "Let's take two illegal gambling operations that are identical in every way except that the one pays the runners, you know, $200 a week. The other pays the runners $500 a week. And the one that pays $500 doesn't make any profits because he's paying too much to the runners. The first one, the more successful operation, you say, can be prosecuted for money laundering because its has profits. The other one doesn't. So incompetence is rewarded.",
  "But the - -",
  "No, I'm focusing on the question presented -- that was the only question presented when we considered whether to grant certiorari by either of the parties, and that focuses solely on the question of whether \"proceeds\" is considered gross revenues or profits.",
  "So someone who simply paid off whoever it is that ships in, you know, a ton of heroin, you'd say is not guilty then? Same thing. I mean, you're just paying off the people who engage in the activities that are necessary for the continuation and promotion of the illegal enterprise.",
  "Well, how do they know even what the fiscal year of these enterprises is? I mean let's suppose you have some costs. They have to buy the poppy field or wherever, but, you know, over 3 years, they're going to make a lot of money. You're saying you can't prosecute them in year 2?",
  "My point is the profits may not come in immediately, even though the underlying activity is exactly the same.",
  "Well that's -- but we don't try to solve every case. We look at particular questions presented. And maybe there's going to be another case coming up in which the issue of how broadly you should construe promotion is, or whether you should have a different definition when the offenses are merged or not. And we'll confront that when it gets here. It seems to me that your argument is - - maybe your best argument, but your argument, anyway, is let's avoid this question because of these other mistakes that have been made, mistakes which are not presented to us on the question on which we granted cert.",
  "I thought it would depend on whether or not the insurance proceeds exceeded how much he had to pay the hit man, right? Let's say he's not doing it to get the insurance money. It just so happens he had a $50,000 policy on the victim - -",
  "Yes. He just wanted to commit the murder, not get the money. And so he pays the hit man $100,000, he gets the $50,000, and then uses it for all these other activities, you'd say no money laundering, because no profits?",
  "I thought their answer was the money laundering statute covers a whole waterfront of activities besides illegal gambling. And the question is, what did Congress intend when they passed the money laundering statute. This is kind of the tail wagging the dog. The tail is, well, it presents these problems when you're talking about gambling operations, but there's a whole rest of the dog area where it doesn't present a problem.",

Is there any way they can achieve that objective, to have the nominees actually chosen not by the voters but by a convention, and yet have some role by the voters?",
  "No, I'm just asking is there a way to have a convention with some role by the voters or the party - -",

  "But it's not like under the Sherman Act, where we have reason to think Congress intended the Court to go about the business of construing and developing antitrust law. In fact, they have kind of taken over for us. They are imposing certain limits on when actions can be brought, proposing particular specific elements. In one of the provisions, 20(e), specifying the SEC can bring an action but private investors can't. I mean, we don't get in this business of implying private rights of action any more. And isn't the effort by Congress to legislate a good signal that they have kind of picked up the ball and they are running with it and we shouldn't?",
  "Well, that's kind of my point. We did that sort of thing in 1971. We haven't done it for quite sometime.",
  "I'm not -- my suggestion is not that we should go back and say that there is no private right of action. My suggestion is that we should get out of the business of expanding it, because Congress has taken over and is legislating in the area in a way they weren't back when we implied the right of action under 10(b).",
  "Is it -- is it a necessary part of your theory that the deceptive practice that Scientific-Atlanta went in, that they knew that that was also -- that Charter would carry that forward? I mean, let's suppose that there were benefits to this deceptive practice to Scientific-Atlanta, that it looked like it had more money to spend on advertising than it really did, but they didn't care what Charter did with it. In fact, they didn't know that Charter was going to carry it on its books the way they did. Would there still be liability for Scientific-Atlanta?",
  "Why shouldn't we be Bank case? There we said there's no aiding-and-abetting liability, Congress amended the statute in 20(e) to say yes, there is, but private plaintiffs can't sue on that basis. Why shouldn't that inform how we further develop the private action under 10b-5?",
  "But they were -- they were addressing a very specific decision from this Court, the Central Bank decision. And the one thing they did not do is say that that decision was wrong with respect to private -- or going forward they weren't going to overrule that decision with respect to private rights of action. You're asking us to extend to non -- I know you call it a primary violator, but not the person who --",
  "-- who put the extend that liability to them, which seems inconsistent with Congress's approach in 20(e).",
  "But that's -- but that's not the fraud that was imposed upon the market. The fraud that was imposed on the market was Charter's accounting for the transaction on its books. Nobody bought or sold stock in reliance upon the way that Scientific-Atlanta and Charter structured their deal. They did so in reliance on the way that Charter communicated its accounting to the marketplace.",
  "Well, wouldn't it --",
  "Mr. Grossman, I'm conscious of eating into your time but a question -- how many chains of this connection can you have? Let's say Charter was not a publicly traded company, but same thing happened with respect to Scientific-Atlanta, and that made it look valuable to a company that is publicly traded. So they decided to buy Charter and then that made their profits look better to investors. Can you --",

That's not what was charged; that's not the indictment; that's not what you're arguing. So I guess the question is more appropriate for the government. But, if, following Justice Ginsburg's question, this covers it, and it seems to me that it does, then we're not arguing about very much.",
  "Mr. Koch, let's say that the parties to the transaction are concerned about avoiding exposure under the money-laundering statute, and so they got together and said: All right, we are going to have this deal. What can we use besides money? And they say: Well, let's use guns, or let's use a gun. And the seller of the drugs says: Okay. I'm willing to use that. Isn't he using the gun in furtherance of the transaction?",
  "It's being actively employed as the consideration in the sale.",
  "It's not being shot, but it's still being employed.",
  "But I think it would be a natural, grammatical construction to say he's willing to use the gun for the consideration.",
  "Subsection (b) is not charged in the indictment?",
  "No. But that was not charged in the indictment?",
  "Section 2(b)?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Koch. Ms. Maynard.",
  "So if you have - - sorry.",
  "Well, let's say - - let's say you have a duel, and each person in the duel needs to have a weapon. One person has a gun; the other person has the sword. Would you say the person with the sword is using the gun in the duel?",
  "Because you can't have a duel without both people having weapons.",
  "You wouldn't say that the person - -",
  "Each person in the drug exchange brings to the table what they've got. The one has the drugs; the other brings the gun. That doesn't mean that the person with the drugs is using the gun.",
  "It cuts the other way. Congress knows how to say involved in if it wants to reach that broadly, and it didn't do it under the provision in which -- pursuant to which Mr. Watson was indicted.",
  "So if Congress passes a statute saying anyone who uses a gun in a crime of violence gets an additional sentence, the person who is shot is using the gun in a crime of violence?",
  "So is that a necessary element of the offense: That the transaction be negotiated in advance?",
  "I don't think -- I don't see how your hypothetical advances the argument. I mean, I don't necessarily agree that someone who sells drugs for currency is using the currency in the transaction. They are accepting it. It is what they want. That's not the same as using it.",
  "Well, that's what weakens your hypothetical. It's not the normal use of a gun as a medium of exchange.",
  "It held that the person who does use the gun, which is the natural, grammatical construction, uses the firearm. That's quite a bit different than the question of whether someone who receives it as the consideration is using the firearm.",
  "Well, I just -- I don't understand the significance of the argument you just made. Are you saying that because some people might be let out of prison if we correctly construed the statute, we should read it your way?",
  "So what was your point referring to the people who were convicted under this statute --under this construction of the statute?",
  "I thought the argument you made earlier was that this may not be of particular ongoing significance because of the amendment.",

  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 06-984, Medellin v. Texas. Mr. Donovan.",
  "Who would enforce those constraints? The thing that concerns me about your position is that it seems to leave no role for this Court in interpreting treaties as a matter of Federal law. Suppose, for example, that the International Court of Justice determined in this case its judgment was the same, but they added: As a matter of deterrence, we think the officers who failed to give consular warning should each be sentenced to 5 years in jail. That's the ICJ determination. Would this Court have a role in reviewing that judgment?",
  "Even if we determine - -",
  "Even if we determine, even if we determine that that judgment is based on a legal error?",
  "So if the ICJ determined that the officers should each go to jail for 5 years, we would have no basis for reviewing that judgment?",
  "I'm sorry. I'm still looking for an answer to the hypothetical. What would be the basis for this Court's reviewing the ICJ's determination that officers should go to jail for 5 years?",
  "The Court doesn't have executive power. It has judicial power. It's already exercised that judicial power in Sanchez-Llamas in determing the meaning of this treaty. And I understood your position to be that we have no authority to construe the treaty in this case because a judgment was issued by the International Court of Justice.",
  "Now - -",
  "Just to get back, you're conceding, I take it, whether the ICJ has done something like this before or not -- and we can debate whether what they've done in this case is precisely that -- there is a role for this Court in determining whether or not a judgment of the ICJ should be enforced.",
  "Just enforcing the obligation to comply or, as we have in this case, determining the legal basis for the ICJ determination?",
  "Is the answer to - -",
  "Is the answer to either my or Justice Stevens's hypothetical then, yes, we do have to enforce an ICJ judgment of that sort?",
  "But - -",
  "Well, why don't - - why don't you take 5 extra minutes? And we'll give you your rebuttal time. If the Avena judgment is binding as Federal law, is it your position, though, that the -- this Court has no authority to review the content of that Federal law -- the judgment? Our choice is simply enforce it?",
  "So we have no - -",
  "We have no authority to review the judgment itself, even though the judgment will have the effect as Federal law of preempting the State law in this instance?",
  "Excuse me, but your position is not that we are applying the obligation to comply, because we interpreted that in Sanchez-Llamas and came to the exact same conclusion as the ICG here. What you're saying is it's different here because the operative law is the judgment.",
  "So if he determines that the judgment should not be enforced and this Court determines, based on our construction of the treaty and the judgment that it should be enforced, which determination controls?",
  "Well, if we have the authority to determine whether the treaty should be complied with in the face of a presidential determination, why don't we have the independent authority to determine whether or not it should be complied with at a matter of Federal law without regard to the President's determination?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Donovan. We'll give you 5 minutes for your rebuttal. General Clement.",
  "What if the President had said, we're going to comply with this judgment, but in a different way than the ICJ determined. We're going to comply by examining in each case whether there's already been a determination of prejudice, and if there has then there's no further review, but if there hasn't then there'll be further review. Would that be binding as a matter of Federal law?",
  "It's the same as a memorandum just like -- it's a memorandum just like the one we have here.",
  "It says that if there has already been -- the State courts are to determine if there's already been a determination of prejudice in the case, and if there has there's to be no further review. But if they determine there hasn't, there is to be further review. That's different than the ICJ's judgment, which suggests there should be a new determination in every case. Is that -- does that have the same status as the memorandum here?",
  "But he can -- he can take action that's inconsistent with the determination of Federal law by this Court?",
  "I thought we determined in Sanchez-Llamas that the treaty did not mean what the ICJ said it means in this case.",
  "Do you doubt that the judgment here is based on a determination of the Vienna Convention that's exactly the opposite of what we determined last year?",
  "Yes.",

  "Thank you, Mr. Cruz. Mr. Donovan, you have five minutes.",

But the question of whether or not that arbitration is binding in the bankruptcy proceeding that was at issue there was very much one for the U.S. Supreme Court to make.",
  "What is the authority -- I get back to where I started. I understood you to concede that we would have authority to construe the judgment if it provided, for example, for a punitive sanction against the officers. What is the basis under your theory for that authority?",
  "But it can -- it can contravene our interpretation of the treaty as a matter of Federal law.",
  "Do we have the authority to interpret the judgment of the ICJ?",

  "Mr. Days, suppose that the exchange has a standard sort of nondiscrimination provision with respect to employment practices, and it -- an employee asserts that she was discriminated against in the promotion review. Would she be covered by this provision?",
  "Well, I suppose the transaction would be her annual employment review that she alleges violated the exchange rule saying the exchange would not discriminate on the basis of sex.",
  "So -- so, the transaction has some substantive limitation that is derived from where?",
  "Well, why aren't these ancillary rules? When I think of a futures exchange market and the transaction, I think of the buyers and the sellers, you know, the longs and the shorts, and this strikes me as just kind of the paperwork in the back office. Why is that, why should we assume that's covered by the term \"transaction\"?",
  "These people -- you mean the ones in our hypotheticals.",
  "So - -",
  "The concern on the other side, I take it, is that it's not just limited to transactions on the exchange, but transactions subject to the rules of a contract market. And I understood you, in response to the hypothetical that Justice Kennedy posed, that you indicated that transaction has some substantive limit to it, and if that's the case, which seems to me an awfully large concession, then we have to figure out what the limit is. And it seems to me that it could just as easily be limited to the transaction between buyers and sellers of futures contracts as between all these subsidiary, ancillary, collateral, whatever transactions that simply implement that broader transaction.",
  "No. I mean the - - the market is about investors. It's about buyers and sellers. Now, you're -- the clearinghouse and these FCM's may or may not be covered by the language of the statute, but it's an awful big stretch to say they are central to the market. What's central to the market are the investors. That's why they have these. They wouldn't have this market for -- for your clients, I mean for the clearinghouse or anything else. The market is there for the buyers and the sellers. That's the central transaction.",
  "Mr. Days, we'll give you a minute for rebuttal. Mr. Stewart.",
  "Where -- where do all of those assumptions come from? I would have thought the limitation of \"transaction\" beyond the plain language would be a significant concession in this case. I mean - -",
  "So we have to figure out what was the core of Congress's concern and limit \"transaction\" in that way?",
  "But they would be subject to the rules of the contract market.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Pincus.",
  "I'm sorry. I'm not following you. I think Justice Kennedy's question still applies. Your argument assumes that the \"or\" is an \"and.\" I mean, you don't need to have a transaction \"on\" at all. It can be simply one subject to the rules.",
  "The fact that Congress put \"on\" in there and then followed it with \"or\" means you don't have to worry what \"on\" means if you're subject to the rules of the contract market.",
  "This is like ejusdem generis argument. You're saying, we should interpret \"subject to the rules\" in the same light that we interpret \"transaction\"?",
  "The answer would be that those transactions are not subject to the rules of the exchange.",
  "They don't care what kind of arrangement the FCM might have with its bank. That's up to the FCM. There's no exchange - -",

In Circuit City you have a couple of examples -- seamen, railroad workers -- here it's just a customs or excise worker. I regard customs and excise as kind of the same thing. So why isn't it more like the cases where we've said you have an example in a residual phrase; the example is not limiting.",
  "Well, not just goods or merchandise. Goods, merchandise or other property. And does other property include any type of property?",
  "So \"goods and merchandise or other property\" are just examples, and then a residual phrase that includes everything; but \"customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer,\" that's subject to ejusdem generis - all in the same sentence.",
  "But, I mean that's always true when you have an example and a more general phrase. And yet our cases indicate that we often read the language that way. In other words, it's giving you, perhaps, the most common example in which you're going to have a detention of goods, but it's not limiting it to those officers.",
  "Yes, but S.D. Marine wouldn't have come out the other way.",
  "Was that an obscure statute in S.D. Marine?",

  "We'll hear argument next in case 06-6911, Logan v. United States. Mr. Coad.",
  "I understand that - - I understand that it is rare for misdemeanants to lose their civil rights.",
  "But certainly the minority approach. In most States if you are convicted of a misdemeanor you do not lose civil rights?",
  "So your argument, if accepted, would essentially weed out, or at least for a majority of the States, weed out subdivision (a)(20)(A)(b) -- (a)(20)(B)? In other words, there's coverage under the statute if you are convicted under a misdemeanor and you want to say, well, if your civil rights were never taken away, you shouldn't be covered. Well, that would mean most misdemeanors aren't going to be covered.",
  "Well, if I say most misdemeanors aren't going to be covered, it's not an answer to say, well, here's one State where they are covered. It's maybe 49 are not.",
  "Isn't there another difficulty for you in this statutory comparison that Justice Souter has noted? You're argument under (a)(20) is that it would be absurd for Congress to take people, exempt people, whose rights have been restored, but not people whose rights were never taken away. That is exactly what Congress did in (a)(33). So if Congress thought it was all right even in albeit in a different context, it seems to me to be very difficult to argue that it is inherently absurd to do it somewhere else.",
  "You phrased Congress's intent as allowing an exemption for people the State has found trustworthy. But I don't think that's how this legislative process works. You have additional punishment, and then somebody says: Oh, let's not apply it to people who are convicted of antitrust violations. And you say: Yeah, yeah. And then somebody says: Let's not apply it to people whose civil rights have been restored. And they say: Fine. And then nobody pipes up and says: Well, let's not apply it to people whose civil rights were never taken away. In other words, it's not an intent that is not effectuated. It is just you want the intent to reach more broadly.",
  "So it's based on a congressional mistake, in other words, about the breadth, but it still doesn't - -",
  "What about securities law violations? (A)(20)(A)says this doesn't apply if it's an antitrust violation. Now, did Congress -- you could say: Well, they would have applied it to securities law violations, too. It's a business offense. They're not interested in that. So we should read this as applying to securities law violations.",
  "That kind of begs the question for you to say Congress is worried about offenders States think are trustworthy. What they actually said are, of course, offenders who have had their civil rights restored. Maybe if they focused on the question of whether or not civil rights were taken away in the first place, they would have made a different judgment, as they did, of course, in (a)(33).",
  "Well, isn't -- under our precedents, isn't what you just said fatal to your case: In other words, Congress didn't think about this, or they made a mistake in thinking about it? In either case it's clear that they didn't legislate with respect to it.",

  "But if I could start with one of the more compelling hypotheticals on the other side. Let's say I'm a movie reviewer. I write a review saying this is an awful movie. It portrays child pornography. Aren't I presenting information in a way that would cause others to believe that the movie contains child pornography, and wouldn't that be covered by the statute?",
  "Well, that's a very different thing. I read your brief the same way Justice Breyer did and particularly footnote 4 of the reply brief, which I understood to be giving \"presents,\" for example in this statute, a promotional meaning in light of the other words around it, \"advertises, promotes\" and simply telling your -- you know, your neighbor, I got this, what should I do about it, isn't promotional. It may be in a technical term \"presents,\" but it's not promotional. And, again, I understood your brief to suggest that you have to interpret all of those words in an advertising, soliciting sense.",
  "My understanding was not that it was limited to commercial speech. That was clear from the footnote that I cited. But that \"presents\" was limited to promotional activity. It's one thing to present and say either whether to law enforcement or your neighbor; it's another thing to promote the child pornography. And I thought your brief was adopting a limited construction of words like \"presents\" that would cover only promotional activity.",
  "I'm sorry. I lost -- in your answer, I lost a negative or something. Are you saying that this type of activity frequently occurs or infrequently occurs?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Diaz.",
  "Well, there's a difference, isn't there, between beliefs and thoughts about -- what, the legality of a particular type of pornography or something like that, and a factual matter? I thought this was child pornography? Saying this regulates thoughts and beliefs, those are two quite different questions, aren't they?",
  "But that's an entirely different thing to say that this car is a great car and it turns out not to be a great car, and to say what you have is either -- is not -- is child pornography when, in fact, it's not. Those are two different things.",
  "The statute has an objective component. To the objective observer, it must reasonably cause them to believe that it's actually child pornography. So that -- that would be -- that would prevent sort of the vague puffery that you're talking about from being covered while still covering something that satisfies both the subjective and objective test.",
  "No. I don't think that is responsive to Justice Kennedy's point. You wouldn't be carving it out of the First Amendment. You would be saying we're going to treat this area like other areas, which would say that whoever is challenging it has to show that they're a problematic case. In other words, your client is relying -- he didn't produce Lolita. You're relying on the effect on other people, and that is what our overbreadth doctrine allows, if there's a substantial amount of speech that's protected. And what I understood the question to suggest is that we would wait basically for as-applied challenges when Lolita is being prosecuted and we would hear from them, but not in your case.",
  "Well, but it's the boundary between what is -- what should be protected in relation to what's unprotected. So what's the ratio between legitimate films like Lolita and illegitimate child pornography? In other words, is, in fact, the protected material substantial in relation to the law's legitimate sweep?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Diaz. General Clement, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you general the case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Danforth v. Minnesota. Mr. Butler.",
  "Well, Federal rules don't have minimums and maximums. They have a rule. And as Justice Kennedy pointed out, you can have a State rule under the State constitution that goes further. It seems to me that the States' determination to apply Crawford retroactively must be based on a disagreement with this Court's Teague analysis, which refers back to the substantive elements of Crawford. So, in other words, the disagreement at bottom is a disagreement about how to read the substantive requirements of Crawford.",
  "Well, how do you - - I understand your point. Teague has both elements to it. But if you're applying Teague, there are certain exceptions that are based on exactly what the underlying right is, what the Crawford right is. Is it a watershed rule? Is it something else? And the court makes a determination as a matter of Federal law on those points. And what you're arguing for is discretion in the State to disagree with those substantive determinations.",
  "Can a State -- can they pick -- can a State pick and choose? Can it say that we are going to allow Crawford claims to be applied retroactively, but other claims, we're not going to?",
  "Well, and if you think that the Teague rule is an assessment of the substantive -- part of the substantive constitutional interpretation, an assessment about what the impact of Crawford is versus other decisions, then I guess they couldn't, right?",
  "Based on the distinction between right and remedy, a distinction that is -- that in countless areas of the law we -- we have said is -- is an ephemeral one?",
  "Does your -- does your approach apply to legislative enactment's as well? Let's say Congress passes a law and it provides as particular remedy, and it says this remedy shall not be retroactive but only apply in new cases. Can the State say well, we think it ought to apply to old cases, pending cases on habeas, or whatever, and so we are going to apply this retroactively, even though Congress said it's only prospective?",
  "No, no. They just say here's a new remedy, maybe a glance and exclusionary remedy in cases where we have held one isn't required - - can the State allow that retroactively, even though Congress -- a Federal remedy, even though Congress has said this Federal remedy is only prospective?",
  "Well, your reliance on this ancient distinction between right and remedy - - I mean if Congress says you don't have a remedy if it's retroactive, it's hard to say what kind of right you have.",
  "Sure, as a matter of State law.",
  "But here you are arguing in favor of retro-application of Federal law. There is no issue -- as Justice Kennedy pointed out, you can have a State confrontation clause and do whatever you want with it. But you are relying on the Federal provision.",
  "No. No. I would have thought the very least Teague is, is Federal common lawful. In other words, this is the Federal law of remedies. I think it is more than that. I think it is substantive constitutional -- substantive Federal constitutional law. But it's at least Federal common law, and doesn't Federal common law preempt State common law.",
  "-- it is the other way around which makes it problematic. You are going to say the remedy is retroactive even if there's no right. You're going to say where we have decided that there is no remedy and, therefore, if you have a right, it's -- I don't know what you get out of it -- you want to say, no, there is a remedy.",
  "So you have to argue, and this is why I think the distinction has been rejected in so many other areas of the law, you have to argue that the remedy question is totally separate from an analysis of the right. Because otherwise, you are saying the State courts have the right to disagree with our determination of what the Federal right is. If you think the remedy, the question of remedy draws some substance from what the right is, which I would have thought is obviously the case, then it seems to me you're asserting a power on the basis of the State court to overturn our Federal law determinations.",

  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1287, CSX Transportation v. the Georgia State Board of Equalization. Mr. Phillips.",
  "And do you want the district court to in addition determine which methodology most accurately reflects that true market value?",
  "You want to be able to challenge the state's chosen methodology for determining market value?",
  "So if the, so if the district court says this methodology, Methodology A, most accurately yields true market value, that is giving rise to a Federal rule of determining value, isn't it?",
  "Well, I don't see how it varies based on the particular circumstances. If he says I think, you know, whatever it is, discounted value approach is the best way for determining market value, he's not going to in the next case or the district court isn't going to be able to say, I think reproduction cost is the best method. You're going to establish a Federal rule for what is the best way of determining market value.",
  "That happens, that happens once every 25 years. If you prevail on a method that you think is more favorable to railroads before a particular district court, you're going to cite that district court in the next case that you've got and you say: Look a district court's already looked at this and they said Method A is a better way of determining market value.",
  "So if a district court says in one case Method A is the best way to get market value and another district court says Method B and they both appeal, the court of appeals is going to have to resolve that conflict, isn't it?",
  "Well, but it's already been pointed out if the range is a variable of $4 billion I think it probably is worth their while to challenge what they think is a low valuation.",
  "What if we were to adopt a different approach which said that you can challenge the methodology, methodology, when different methodologies are used, but if the State is using the same methodology that's their choice? It seems to me the only other alternative is to have the Federal judiciary develop a Federal rule about what methodology has to be used.",
  "Isn't that how it works in utility rate regulation? Isn't there in fact a standard Federal method of determining what rates affect the taking of property - -",
  "Yes, if it's challenged - -",
  "The rate of return in a public utility.",
  "Well, more often than not. But in fact it is an ultimate finding of fact, but it's based on valuation methodology and that's what's at issue here. No one doubts that the application of a methodology can be challenged. The question is whether or not if you start out -- I reached these facts because I used reproduction costs as my method of valuation, and your submission is going to be that vastly overvalues our property and you should use a different method. That's a legal question. That's not a method -- question of fact.",
  "What if the district court -- what if there is one methodology that gets you an answer within 20 percent margin of error, up or down, and there is another methodology that gives you an answer with a 5 percent margin of error, up or down? Can you challenge the application of one of those as opposed to the other.",
  "Well, of course you can challenge it.",
  "My question -- my question assumes that the methodology leads to a value that is either 20 percent higher or lower in one case, and 5 percent higher or lower in the other case.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.",
  "Were all of the values that were arrived at in this case within the ballpark?",
  "Were all the valuations used here reliable indications of true market value?",
  "Well, there is no way to tell. Everybody agrees we're just making more or less educated guesses.",
  "And so the district court has to engage in purely fictional enterprise, and say yes, all the methodologies give you a range of 6 to 12 billion, but I think the answer is 8.2 billion.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. Mr. Calvert.",
  "Well, that's what - - I'm sorry.",
  "I thought that would be part of your reply to Justice Breyer, that you had five different methodologies here and you chose the lowest one; and the question really is how many more methodologies do you have to look at if you're going to choose the lowest one in each case.",
  "You know, if this comes down as it probably will in every case, to a battle of competing experts, are you aware of any other area where we say that a district court cannot look at the methodology used by an expert in determining whether or not to give credence to the expert's opinion?",
  "So why should we create a special rule here for the State?",
  "What if what if the State elected to use reproduction cost as its valuation method, which I guess everybody agrees vastly overstates the value of the railroad?",
  "So if there are problems with a particular methodology, the methodology can be challenged?",
  "Right. And your argument is that it's not reasonable because it must overstate the value by a particular percentage or number. And I think Justice Souter's question is: Well, where do you draw the line? If you say it's not reasonable because it overstates value by 50 percent, is a methodology that overstates value by 20 percent reasonable or not - -",
  "-- keeping in mind all the methodologies here range from 8 -- 6 billion to 12 billion.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Calvert. Mr. Phillips, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "I mean I assume that's in the normal context of the adversary process. In other words, the district court does not necessarily have to come up with a number independent of what the parties present to it.",
  "It can decide which of the presentations is closer to true market value.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips, the case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 06-666, Department of Revenue of Kentucky v. Davis. Mr. Trower. ORAL ARGUMENT of C. CHRISTOPHER TROWER",
  "We have a different variation here that wasn't present in United Haulers, which, of course, is that Kentucky does compete with other public entities in the municipal bond market. In other words, I think you have a strong case with respect to discrimination against private bonds, but Kentucky competes against Ohio bonds as well. And they're making the Kentucky bonds more attractive through this discriminatory tax on the Ohio bonds. Why isn't that a sufficient distinction from United Haulers?",
  "Well, I suppose you could achieve the same result simply by providing you're not going to pay interest to somebody who is not a Kentucky resident.",
  "So we have to overrule Bacchus to agree with you?",
  "Does your argument depend upon the uses to which Kentucky is putting these proceeds?",
  "Well, I thought it would because you're saying nobody else is responsible for public works in Kentucky and so on.",
  "No. Just a public facility.",
  "So, if Kentucky had a law that it could only -- no out-of-State car dealer could sell cars in Kentucky, that benefited Kentucky car dealers, and then it had a special tax on Kentucky car dealers to fund local hospitals, airports, roads, whatever -- that would be all right?",
  "So it doesn't matter? So the use to which the proceeds are put doesn't save an otherwise discriminatory activity?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Trower. Mr. Brunstad.",
  "Or United Haulers.",
  "So you want to suggest -- I'm sorry.",
  "Are you suggesting that the result in United Haulers would have been different if there were a competing trash processing facility out-of-State?",
  "Well, they are not taxing the out-of-State commodity. Their tax is imposed simply on Kentucky taxpayers.",
  "But our approach in the General Motors case was the exact opposite. There we couldn't figure out whether the market for natural gas was captive or not captive. It was a little of each, and we kind of said well, you know, if it's kind of a close question, leave it for Congress. Because, after all, the Commerce Clause talks about Congress' power. The dormant Commerce Clause is not mentioned. So this is an area where Congress can regulate if it wants to, and it has never shown the slightest interest in interfering with State tax exemptions for their own bonds.",
  "It strikes me as much more fundamental, whether or not a State can issue a tax exemption for its -- its bonds. That seems more fundamental than the more specialized issues in those other cases. And I think we have said when you're dealing with a specialized issue that may not get the attention of Congress, we have a different approach.",
  "But it's not distinct from United Haulers. Garbage is garbage, too.",
  "But the fact that bonds are bonds doesn't seem to me to be very responsive.",
  "Your argument that you just presented in response to Justice Stevens' question, I think, relies on the discrimination against the out-of-State issuers.",
  "Your clients are not out-of-State issuers.",
  "We don't have an overbreadth doctrine under the Commerce Clause. Why aren't their arguments limited to discrimination against them rather than discrimination against out-of-State issuers?",
  "So your Kentucky taxpayers can argue about the discrimination against out-of-State bond issuers?",
  "How do we know that your clients will be better off regardless of how this case is resolved? One way to resolve it, of course, would be to take away the Kentucky tax exemption, which would hurt your clients. Another way to resolve it would be to extend the tax exemption to the Ohio bonds, which may hurt your clients if the Kentucky bonds aren't competitive, and the price of the Kentucky bonds goes down. They are going to lose either way.",
  "But whether or not it benefits them, it seems to me, depends on how competitive they are with other States' municipal bonds. In other words, their advantage now comes from the tax exemption for Kentucky bonds; and it's not clear, if that is eliminated across the board, that Kentucky bonds are going to be competitive with, you know, bonds of whatever other State. So the value of them may go down, and your clients may lose, whether you win or not.",
  "I mean it -- it provides an advantage depending on the level of the State income tax and, I suppose, the level of the exemption. It doesn't necessarily mean that that's the only bonds they are going to hold.",
  "And it's less of a problem if it's like Kentucky, which, I assume, has a lower income tax.",
  "Well, it assumes it's all in the definition of your market. If your market is tax-exempt bonds nationwide, it's one thing; but your brother says the market ought to be people who issue bonds for public works in Kentucky, and Kentucky is the only one who does that so there is no discrimination against anyone else because nobody else is similarly situated to Kentucky with respect to Kentucky public works.",
  "Well, I thought it was inherent in your argument that most of them -- I mean, if you're talking about hoarding capital, it doesn't work very well if a lot of people outside Kentucky are buying these bonds. There's not much Balkanization if they're circulated widely. I thought that your argument depended on the proposition that most of these bonds are bought by Kentucky residents.",
  "Well, that's not fair because Kentucky is going to use the proceeds of the bonds to build a hospital, a school that is going to serve Kentucky residents.",
  "So there's -- it's not just emotional attachment to Kentucky that would promote the purchase of those bonds by Kentucky residents. It's self-interest. They want a public hospital nearby, and, therefore, it makes sense to buy the hospital bonds.",
  "There's a very - - there's a very big difference between -- and it gets to the difference with the Wisconsin cows, which was addressed in United Haulers. That's a tax on private activity, and private actors don't have the responsibility of providing government services. Kentucky does.",
  "You don't see a dormant Commerce Clause, though.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Brunstad. Mr. Trower, you have 12 minutes remaining.",
  "Well, why do you care, Mr. Trower? I mean, if you lose your tax exemption, it means you've got to pay more interest to sell your bonds, but it also means you're going to get taxes that you don't get now. Isn't it kind of a wash? Does it really matter.",
  "Yes, but the State's going to have more money from their income taxes, and if they want to spend it on a project in a particular municipality, they will be free to do that.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Trower. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-1164, John R. Sand & Gravel Company v. the United States. Mr. Haynes.",
  "Are you asking us to, or you think we have to, to rule in your favor overrule our decisions in Kendall and Soriano?",
  "Of course, Irwin involved Title 7 and not this 2501. And we hadn't addressed Title 7 before, but we have addressed 2501 before.",
  "Well, in, in the more recent case of Kontrick -- I'm looking at footnote 8 of that opinion -- it used 2401 as an example of the jurisdictional bar and 2401 has pretty much the same language as 2501.",
  "Well, just, just to get all the cases out on the table, our more recent decision in Bowles suggested that there may be a difference between statutory and rule limitations and also suggested that the prior history of the interpretation of a provision was highly relevant.",
  "It's a pretty risky business, though, to rely on a dissent in determining whether a majority overruled the prior precedent or not, isn't it?",
  "Irwin. I thought that was the one Justice Ginsburg posed to you - -",
  "-- where Justice White in dissent said that Irwin overruled Soriano. But the majority certainly didn't say that.",
  "But it hasn't recodified 2501 in the past 17 years, has it?",
  "So you think we do have to overrule Kendall and Soriano?",
  "Or at least say that we already did in Irwin?",
  "Well, that's exactly what I think we said in -- in Arbaugh; and that, certainly, going forward from that point on, Congress has more or less specified that it's jurisdictional, or we're not going to read it that way. But I'm not sure that was the rule in Irwin and I'm pretty sure it wasn't the rule in Soriano and Kendall.",
  "No, I know, but it seems to me you're arguing that if Kendall came up today, it would be decided differently, and maybe that's right. But the point is it came up 100 years ago and it was decided, and the question is whether we should overturn that decision.",
  "Well, I think your argument is more strongly supported by Irwin than Franconia. Franconia simply involved an accrual rule, which doesn't go to what the jurisdictional effect of the bar on commencing a case is. The government there was overreaching and arguing for a special accrual rule, and the Court said no. That's different than saying whether the actual time for commencing litigation is jurisdictional or not.",
  "Well, but that's like saying in every diversity case, theoretically, the court has to scrutinize whether someone who alleges they are a citizen of Pennsylvania really is. And that's just not the way it really happens. The question usually, if not raised by the party, comes up under some other situation, such as in this case the amicus raised it.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Haynes. Mr. Stewart.",
  "Is that when you're beyond the seas or something?",
  "You know, I don't - - it's -- we've found it difficult enough to figure out which statutes are jurisdictional and which are not. And now you want us to say, well, even if it's jurisdictional, the consequences may be different for jurisdiction and for equitable tolling and for waivibility. I mean, it seems to me that's a very difficult argument.",
  "I suppose Franconia would be a case where the Irwin logic not only would but did apply.",
  "It is hard to understand how they could have lost the case.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Haynes, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Haynes. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 06-1322, Federal Express Corporation v. Holowecki. Ms. Lensing.",
  "Well, I think -- I think you're right about that. I mean, once the lawyer's involved and they're in litigation and all that, they're not going to take conciliation efforts with the same light as before. But the question is whether the remedy for that, which is some unfairness to you, is to throw the suit out or try to fix it as much as possible, such as through a stay or dismissing without prejudice or something. Why should the Plaintiff -- it's not his fault that the EEOC didn't notify you. Why should he suffer the categorical sanction of dismissal simply because it's a little unfairness to you?",
  "Do we know - - perhaps this is a question your friend on the other side will be able to answer better than you. But do we know where she got the form, why she filled it out? I couldn't find in the record whether this was given to her by someone at the EEOC or whether she downloaded it from the website or what.",
  "I agree completely with everything you said. I just don't understand your leap from government incompetence to saying the plaintiff loses.",
  "Do you think Ms. Kennedy is entitled to equitable tolling in this case?",
  "I guess she, reasonably or otherwise, thought there already was a lawsuit.",
  "Did you undertake conciliation efforts after her formal, her filing of the Form 5 charge?",
  "Counsel, the Government relied in its brief very heavily on the Chevron case, saying we should defer to the agency's regulations, and on the Auer case, saying we defer to the agency to tell us what its regulations mean. And you didn't cite either of those cases in your reply brief. So I wonder what your answer is to that argument.",
  "And you're only - - when you say you're hurt, the only prejudice that you rely on is the fact that you didn't have an opportunity to go through prelitigation conciliation.",
  "But -- but my point is, you're not alleging prejudice from the lack of prompt notice. In other words, it's not a situation where you'd say if we had notice we would have done this, and that would have prevented everything.",
  "Your only prejudice is the lack of conciliation period.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Lensing. Mr. Rose.",
  "Mr. Rose, I'm having trouble figuring out -- she not only filed this intake questionnaire; she also filed a lengthy affidavit.",
  "Where did all this stuff come from?",
  "Did these friends file charges on intake questionnaires?",
  "On Form 5.",
  "Do you know why she signed the intake questionnaire on two different dates?",
  "You were representing her at that point?",
  "I like my cite better. If you look at 1626.3 on page 351, it says: 'Charge' shall mean a statement filed with the Commission by, or on behalf of, an aggrieved person which alleges that the main prospective defendant has engaged in, or is about to engage in, actions in violation\" - -",
  "Thank you, Mr. Rose. Mr. Heytens.",
  "Why should we defer to an agency regulation when people in the agency hardly ever follow it?",
  "Well, you didn't - - in this case you didn't treat it as a charge, because you didn't give notice.",
  "Do we give Chevron deference to things like your internal compliance manual and these other memos?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Heytens. Miss Lensing, you have a minute left.",
  "Thank you, Miss Lensing. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-989, Hall Street Associates v. Mattel, Inc. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Mr. Phillips - -",
  "Mr. Phillips, why do you care? If this is not enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, which gives you kind of a shortcut - - the district court must confirm it if certain criteria are met -- I assume you have a normally enforceable contract that the district court can enforce just like it enforces any other contract.",
  "So you should lose.",
  "So you should lose.",
  "No. We should conclude that you don't fall within the Federal Arbitration Act and it's not a big deal because you can bring -- you can have the contract enforced. The district court as far as I can tell wants to enforce this agreement, presumably will enforce it as a contract. So you don't need the Federal Arbitration Act, so why should we fly in the face of its plain language to accommodate your interests?",
  "Is there a basis - - well, the Federal Arbitration Act doesn't provide jurisdiction anyway. So I assume you have a basis for being in Federal court - -",
  "-- in the first place. So you're just enforcing a contract in diversity in Federal court.",
  "No, you're asking us to bring it under the Federal Arbitration Act and say that the district court must confirm it despite the fact that you've changed the standards under Section 9 to 11.",
  "Right.",
  "But my point - -",
  "My point is that if you have an ordinary contract action the district court will, because your contract provides a particular standard of review, enforce that. Right?",
  "But they have in fact. On page 43 of their brief, they say that if you prevail the parties would be left to a State law contract action to determine the enforceability of the award.",
  "No, no. I - -",
  "No. Their citation is to an arbitration treatise. The contract they're referring to is the contract to arbitrate. And, unless I'm mistaken, what you want is for the district court to be able to enforce your agreement under the Federal Arbitration Act. Right?",
  "Well, it doesn't fall squarely within it because the Federal Arbitration Act sets different standards of review. And all I'm saying is I don't see what the big deal is because you -- okay, don't use the Federal Arbitration Act, which gives you kind of an express remedy the district court must confirm. Use normal contract law and say to the district court: Well, you don't have the Federal Arbitration Act, you don't have to confirm it as a judgment, but we have a contract, it's perfectly valid, it sets a different standard of review, you should enforce it.",
  "The arbitration provision, the arbitration agreement is just a contract. Right?",
  "Well, then I don't understand why it's not enforceable as a contract.",
  "Well, if it's enforceable -- I'm obviously missing something here. If it's enforceable as a contract, what is the great benefit you get out of prevailing and saying this should be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act?",
  "What do you do if you have a contract, an arbitration agreement that's not covered by Section 2, it's not concerning a maritime transaction or involving commerce?",
  "Okay.",
  "Why in the -- why is that the case? I mean, this doesn't purport to occupy the field of arbitration and to preempt State law. It provides that a very direct order -- the district court must confirm the arbitration award as a judgment - -",
  "-- if you fall within the criteria. And all I'm saying is they'll say, okay, I don't have to confirm it as a judgment.",
  "Oh, no. You're in Section 2, I agree - -",
  "I agree that you're in Section 2, and the State court can't invalidate your agreement under some special rule that applies only to arbitration. But you want to be under Section 9, and that says - -",
  "-- that the district court must confirm the arbitration award if it meets certain standards.",
  "But the only basis --",
  "The only basis you have for getting them to correct the award is a different standard of review than the one provided in Section 10.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Ms. Brinkmann.",
  "What happens outside -- that happens all the time. They are called consent decrees. The party agrees, and agrees to particular provisions, and they submit it to the judge and say: We want you to write two words, \"so ordered,\" at the bottom of this; and then it becomes a judgment. You don't have to worry about the Arbitration Act. It's a contract.",
  "I have the same question for you that I had for your friend: Why do you care? I mean, if you are saying, look, you can enforce this as a state law contract -- you know, it's not streamlined. The judge doesn't have to do it; but, you know, this judge wants to do it. And he is going to enforce it as a State law contract. What do you gain?",
  "You don't have to go back to State court. You have diversity. You are in Federal court, no matter what; right?",
  "Isn't there - -",
  "Sure.",
  "Sure, if the parties agree, and here's our stipulation: We agree that he is a citizen of Pennsylvania and you're a citizen of - -",
  "I thought your answer would be part the point Justice Stevens brought up earlier. There was this State hostility to enforcing arbitration agreements at all - -",
  "And so what the Federal Arbitration Act says is, all right, in the narrow circumstances where the parties agreed, subject to this narrow standard, you have to enforce it. But that doesn't mean we are going to override the State law across the board.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann. Mr. Phillips, you have you 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-856, LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg & Associates. Mr. Stris.",
  "But the plan itself is nowhere in the record, is that right?",
  "Right, the summary. And I looked at the summary and saw nowhere the rules about investment options, what you get to choose, how often -- and for all we know, the plan might say you have no choice about investment options, it's all going to be invested in T-bills or whatever.",
  "Where in the record is it?",
  "No, that's in the opposition to certiorari, and I don't believe that's in the record.",
  "Oh, that's the summary of the plan.",
  "The summary on the page you mentioned says that you will be able to -- you have certain investment choices are available to you, and that the administrator will provide you with information on what they are and how you can change it.",
  "But we don't know those details, correct?",
  "It would also presumably more obviously constitute a breach of the plan, correct?",
  "Your position is anything that is remediable, if that's a word, under (a)(1) can also be pursued under (a)(2)?",
  "Let me step back. Do you agree that you could bring an action under (a)(1) for this breach of the plan?",
  "Your approach, if can you go under (a)(2) -- you're right that we judicially have developed a number of glosses on (a)(1), including I think most importantly the Firestone deference principle. But if you're right that you can go under (a)(2), then all of that work has been in vain. You can avoid all the limitations on (a)(1) just by saying we want the same relief under (a)(2).",
  "You told me earlier that any breach of the plan was a fiduciary duty.",
  "Now you're -- the - - what is it -- the obverse or the converse of that you're saying is not true.",
  "I -- I'm not sure about your characterization that he would pick the pockets of the other plan participants. By definition he only prevails if this was a benefit to which he was entitled under the plan. So that doesn't seem unfair to the other plan participants.",
  "Well, it may or may not have the money. You could have failed to follow his instructions in a way that enriched the plan, and it's simply a question of getting that money properly allocated rather than improperly allocated to the other plan participants who are picking the pocket of your client.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stris. Mr. Roberts.",
  "But that means every participant, right? In other words, for the failure of the plan to follow this individual's instructions, any participant in the plan can bring suit under (a)(2)?",
  "How do we know that this is a breach of fiduciary duty under (a)(2) without having the plan before us? In other words, it may not be a fiduciary obligation to follow an instruction from somebody if the plan provides a different way in which those instructions are going to be handled. I'd say, as I think a lot of these plans do, you can change your investment options only during a particular period. Well, if the instruction came at a different time, it wouldn't be a breach of fiduciary duties because it wasn't a breach of the plan.",
  "But I thought his argument -- his argument reduces to the fact that it's a breach of fiduciary duty because it's a breach of the plan. But if not a breach of the plan, then it's not a breach - -",
  "So we need to know -- we need to know what the plan provides before we can decide.",
  "The pleadings don't include the plan. So we have to assess the pleadings without the terms of the plan.",
  "But we don't know under what terms. I mean I've seen plans where you are entitled to direct, but that's subject to conditions and limitations.",
  "Do you agree that if it is within (a)(1)(B) that it's therefore not within (a)(2)?",
  "Well, I thought your answer would be yes. In other words, if it's in (a)(1), it's not in (a)(2).",
  "You can finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Roberts. Mr. Gies.",
  "If there is a suit under (a)(1)(B) for a breach of the plan by a fiduciary, do you agree that the plan, if it's liable, could then sue the fiduciary? I realize I'm talking about a suit by one of your clients against the other, but would that be a feasible result under the statute?",
  "You view it as a lost profits claim. Would your position be different if he directed a sale of the stock and then the stock went down 30 points instead of going up? That's not lost profits. That's avoiding losses to the plan.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gies. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-1286, Michael Knight, Trustee, v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Mr. Rubin.",
  "Counsel, you agree that as a taxpayer seeking an exception to a general rule, you have the burden of proof in this case?",
  "We can't take -- I guess it's not judicial notice, but we can't assume that individual investors with several million dollars of liquid assets might hire investment advisors?",
  "Do they usually hire investment advisors?",
  "I guess you'd concede, wouldn't you, that you're not entitled to all of the investment advice that you receive but perhaps only that that is related to the trust status? In other words, if your investment advisor charges you $50,000 and, you know, 10,000 of it is unique to the trust, but 40,000 is the same sort of advice he'd give an individual, you'd only be able to get the 10,000 outside of the 2 percent limit?",
  "But they don't have to hire investment advisors. There is a standard that they may think they can meet on their own. They may - - you know, it may be an investment advisor that is the trustee. He doesn't have to hire somebody else. So it's not something that necessarily inheres in the nature of the trust.",
  "Why -- if I could pause you on that, why is that the case? Let's say it's a -- the trustee understands perfectly his obligations under the law. Let's just say he is supposed to preserve capital and invest conservatively, but he wants advice on which is the best conservative investment. You know, is it railroads or is it utilities? And that's the investment advice he seeks - - just that. He says: I know how I'm supposed to invest as a fiduciary, but there are options in there, and I just want advice on the options.",
  "Well, isn't that just like an individual investor? If you have an individual investor with $10 million in liquid assets, he or she might know what he wants to do, either capital appreciation or preservation, you know, whatever the option is, but just wants some advice on how best to go about that. That sounds exactly like the trustee in our hypothetical.",
  "No. No. No. You see, that's my difficulty with your position. It's not uniquely trust because you certainly have individuals who may want income rather than capital appreciation or, you know, preservation of capital. They may have exactly the same objectives as a trustee. It's not unique to the trust.",
  "Okay. Well, then let's take that. Let's suppose that the trustee goes to an investment advisor, doesn't tell him that he is a trustee, just says, I need to know, I can't decide, should I invest in Union Pacific or CSX? I'm going to invest in a railroad; which one do you like better? He doesn't tell him he's a trustee, gets some advice and gets a bill. Is that subject to the 2 percent floor, because presumably the advice has got nothing to do with fiduciary responsibilities?",
  "Oh, no. It's a reasonable -- let's say a railroad stock is a reasonable investment for a trust. He just wants to know which one is the best one.",
  "How can it be distinctive if the advisor doesn't even know that the person's a trustee?",
  "Well, when it's filled out - -",
  "-- he knows it's on Form 1041 rather than 1040.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Rubin. Mr. Miller.",
  "You didn't think much of this argument before the Second Circuit adopted it, did you? You didn't argue this before the Court of Appeals?",
  "So you have a fallback argument.",
  "Well, now might be a good time to fall back.",
  "So how does your customary or commonly incurred test work? Let's say you have two trusts, one $10 million, the other 10,000. I think an individual with $10 million might well seek investment advice, but an individual with only 10,000 might decide it's not worth it. Would you have a different application of the 2 percent rule for those two trusts?",
  "How many -- how many individuals do you need? Let's say it's $3 million in the trust, and we think maybe 60 percent of people would hire an investment advisor; 40 percent would think they can do just as well on their own. Is that customarily incurred by individuals?",
  "Your answer to both questions is \"might well be,\" and that's a fairly vague line when it comes to taxes.",
  "Or, even worse, advisors are going to break themselves up into different advisors. There's going to be somebody who says I'm a fiduciary advisor whenever a trustee calls, but, I'm a normal advisor, when it's an individual.",
  "What's your best case for that proposition? Your colleague resisted the notion that he had the burden and what's your best case for that?",
  "But I thought that rule applied to the applicability of individual exemptions. Here we have a different question. It's how to read an exception to the general rule. Do you have a case for a proposition that the taxpayer has the burden in those cases? You said that in your brief, but it didn't have a case cite with it.",
  "What if you get a bill from the investor advisor, and it's $50,000 and it's broken up, 30,000 is general stock picking advice, and 20 percent is specialized fiduciary advice? In other words, they figure out what good stocks are they pushing these days and they go down and say, well, you're a trustee, you can't buy this you can't buy that. You would -- would you agree that the $20,000 is not subject to the 2 percent floor but the 30,000 is?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Miller. Mr. Rubin, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "But it could also be tailored to an individual with particular circumstances that are similar to that of the trust. So an individual could incur it. An individual with the same amount of money involved probably would incur it.",
  "So an individual might have more than one child he wants to provide for and as far as a remainder, there may be more than one grandchild. It could be exactly the same -- an individual could have exactly the same objectives as a trustee.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Rubin. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in case 134 on our original docket, New Jersey v. Delaware. Mr. Farr.",
  "So that if you have one of these wharves that goes beyond the low-water mark and there are two people at the end of it and one of them shoots the other, would they be prosecuted for murder in Delaware or New Jersey?",
  "I suspect the New Jersey Supreme Court would.",
  "How do we split that difference? I mean let's --",
  "I mean, how do we decide the difference between those two cases? And applicable here, for example, let's say it's perfectly fine for New Jersey to build a wharf out there, but they can't use it for liquified natural gas, which Delaware may conclude poses particular problems that other uses don't.",
  "Then how come your position in my murder hypothetical was what it was? Because I assume murder is not a riparian use either. And yet, why would Delaware have jurisdiction over a casino but not over a crime?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Farr.",
  "Mr. Frederick.",
  "So we here decide -- under your view the case comes down to whether or not use of the wharf for a liquified natural gas terminal is a traditional riparian right.",
  "So let's say Delaware, it's not liquified natural, gas but it's, you know, bulk shipments. Is that a traditional riparian right that Delaware could not prohibit or is it something that it could prohibit?",
  "No. So what we want to know it whether or not there are constraints in the Compact.",
  "A permit -- a permit for the project or a permit for the wharf?",
  "Well, then what does the 1905 Compact give New Jersey?",
  "What's left under your reading of Virginia v. Maryland? I understood that case to say -- I mean it's the same thing, the Maryland boundary goes to the low-water mark on the Virginia shore. Yet this Court held that that did not include police power to prevent the particular riparian use at issue there.",
  "That's the case here as well. There's no doubt that New Jersey under the Compact has the right to grant riparian rights, including wharfing out, that go beyond the low-water mark.",
  "As I understand our decision in Virginia v. Maryland it's that withdrawing of the water is a carve out of Maryland's police power that would otherwise apply.",
  "Right. Now why isn't there a limited carve out on the New Jersey side of similar riparian rights? In other words, New Jersey has the authority to authorize wharfing out and to that extent, it's a carve out of Delaware's police power.",
  "How does that work? What if New Jersey says to the wharf owners you must dredge around your wharf because we think it's -- you know, silt is depositing, and Delaware says you may not dredge around your wharf because we think it's going to disturb the oysters? Who -- how do you concur jurisdiction work in that case?",
  "Well, it's something they do have the authority to regulate.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Farr, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Mr. Farr, can I ask you a question as purely a --",
  "-- matter of curiosity? The parties talk about the Duke of York's grant to William Penn in this case, but nobody ever explains where Delaware came from. How did that -- where did Delaware -- I mean a grant to William Penn is Pennsylvania. Where -- when did Delaware --",
  "Thank you. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-457, Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transport Association. Mr. Stern.",
  "Well, certainly that may be true, but it certainly relates to the service of a carrier. I understood your argument to be that we can't read that language literally.",
  "It talks about what carriers have to do, so -- in connection with delivery, so it relates to the service of the motor carrier.",
  "It doesn't dictate what they have to do. They can get out of the business.",
  "Well, we also considered it in Morales, and I thought this law was enacted in the immediate wake of Morales, which adopted a much broader reading of \"relates to\" than the subsequent ERISA cases.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stern. Ms. Brinkmann.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.",
  "You're talking about the Federal act or the Maine act?",
  "Could I follow up on Justice Kennedy's question, though, and specifically, do you think the New York settlement, if the carriers did not agree to it, that they would nonetheless prevail because the terms of it are pre-emptive?",
  "Well, see, you are -- you are pretty familiar with the New York settlement then.",
  "Well, then I think you ought to be able to tell me whether you think it's pre-empted by the Federal law under your theory or not.",
  "Well, you have familiarity with the knowing delivery requirement here.",
  "Is that pre-emptive under your view?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. Mr. Stern, you have five minutes left.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stern. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-1221, Sprint/United Management Company v. Mendelsohn. Mr. Cane.",
  "You agree that it has to be a case-by-case determination? There's no absolute rule either way?",
  "So I assume it would be addressed as it was here, in a motion in limine, the plaintiff would say here are the witnesses we intend to call; the company would say we don't think they're relevant because, as you say, there's no connection between them, and then the judge would decide.",
  "That's on the issue of relevance.",
  "Would that be done typically at the motion in limine stage? I mean, do you establish whether or not there was discrimination in the \"me, too\" cases at trial or prior to the trial, outside the jury's - -",
  "What about the spreadsheet evidence? I thought there was some effort to show a connection through the spreadsheet showing the age of the dismissed employees?",
  "Your theory doesn't depend on where in the hierarchy the other supervisors are located, I take it, if there's a connection? In other words, if there's a lower-level supervisor who discriminates and that is somehow communicated to the supervisor in question, and whatever -- that you know, the point is that the other one wasn't disciplined or something, that would still -- under your theory that would be admissible, correct?",
  "No, I'm talking about a situation -- let's say it is a lower-level supervisor outside the chain of command who commits another \"me, too\" act, but that is communicated to the other in a way that suggests, for example, that the company tolerates it or accepts it. I take it that that would be potentially admissible subject to 403 under your theory.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cane. Mr. Garre.",
  "That's under - - under 401, it's not always admissible, or do you need 403 to reach that conclusion?",
  "But do you think there are situations where other-supervisor evidence is not admissible under 401 itself?",
  "The determination of the relevance of the \"me, too\" evidence -- and I assume also the 403 status -- needs to be made at the motion in limine stage, or is it a question for the jury?",
  "So if it's -- if on the \"me, too\" evidence it's a \"he said/she said\" type of case, does that get admitted to the jury? Or is that excluded at the motion in limine stage?",
  "Well, they're only -- it is only relevant, of course, if it is true; and if the company denies that the \"me, too\" episode even took place, don't you have to have a separate trial on that before you can determine whether it's even admissible?",
  "Well, I get back to my -- the predicate to my question. It's only relevant if it happened.",
  "And it seems to me we've had a lot of discussion whether it is relevant if it happened, but we don't know how we determine whether it happened or not.",
  "So an allegation - - an allegation of discrimination in a \"me, too\" context is automatically relevant?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Egan.",
  "Counsel, what if you have a situation that's been referred to earlier, where you have four other supervisors that are presented as \"me, too\" evidence. They are in the Los Angeles office. The defendant's supervisor is in the Fresno office. Is that evidence relevant?",
  "It is just that they -- they are alleged to have fired people for an impermissible basis under the age discrimination act as well.",
  "All right, let's take it and say yes.",
  "Well, but doesn't that beg the question? We don't know. This isn't a pattern and practice case. You don't have evidence of a company-wide policy of discrimination. Take my hypothetical. There are just four people who are alleged to harbor age-based bias, and they -- in the Los Angeles office. No connection to the Fresno supervisor at all, other than that they work for the same company. Is that enough for relevance?",
  "It might not be relevant.",
  "Are these episodes that were necessarily communicated to the supervisor at issue here?",
  "You don't make the -- you don't suggest that he was even aware of these other anecdotes.",
  "But you're conceding that we don't even know that that comment was communicated in any way to the supervisor at issue here. He may not have been aware of it. The supervisor -- he may have been in Fresno and that supervisor in Los Angeles.",
  "I assume there's no dispute over any direct evidence you have that the supervisor was being guided by a company policy or statement or the RIF program that was discriminatory. The issue here is whether or not you can bring in testimony that -- which has no demonstrated connection to the supervisor.",
  "But what - -",
  "What happens in this case? Let's say there are five \"me, too\" situations presented, and the court make a determination in each one, and the jury finds for the plaintiff. And then it's appealed, and the argument on appeal is, well, in three of those five cases there wasn't age discrimination and here's why. And that evidence is - - well then the court of appeals agrees, yes, those three cases shouldn't have been admitted. Is that reversible error?",
  "No, under my hypothetical, in the three cases, the court of appeals, let's say, determines that the alleged statements did not occur. That's the argument. And this was admitted to the jury in three of the five cases, and those statements did not occur.",
  "Is that reversible error on appeal?",
  "Five gets you cases when the court of appeals determines that three did not occur?",
  "What if I assume your rule cuts the other way? Let's say in this company of 70,000 or 17,000, or whatever it is, there are a thousand supervisors. Four or five are alleged to have discriminated on the basis of age. I assume the company can call the other 995 and say: Are there any allegations against you? Did you fire people? And did you in some cases keep the oldest one? And then they have to -- you know, they say yes. So the, \"me, too\" evidence works both ways, right?",
  "So if you are talking about culture, what is the culture of the company if 995 supervisors don't supervise -- don't discriminate in their decisions and 5 do?",
  "So if company can admit evidence to show the opposite of your \"me, too\" evidence by other supervisors and you say five shows the culture of discrimination, how many are they allowed to admit before -- to show the opposite culture? Certainly more than five if they say this isn't representative. You have to look at these 15 others.",
  "Right. There are 15, 30, or however many is equally relevant.",
  "So you think the court of appeals erred as well in ruling that the evidence was admissible? Because as I understand your answer to Justice Souter, it is that there should be a 403 evaluation and the court of appeals didn't allow the district court to undertake that.",
  "And if on the remand that you conceded is necessary, that will take place in the context of a motion in limine and not in the context of a new trial?",
  "So you think a new trial is required for the district court to make the 403 determination?",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Egan.",
  "Mr. Cane, you have five minutes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cane. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in case 06-10119, Synder v. Louisiana. Mr. Bright.",
  "I think that's right that you zero in on the ones as to which you objected. But you also want to rely on the fact that these other jurors were excluded, and no objection was made to their exclusion. If an objection had been made, the State, of course, would have -- could have explained if they had a reason, a non-racial one, why they were struck. But you didn't object. And yet you want them to be considered as convincing racial bias.",
  "Presumably because no objection was raised as to Mr. Hawkins. I mean, it is -- the burden is on you to object if you think jurors are being excluded on a racial basis.",
  "Out of -- out of how many who were struck.",
  "Well, I'm looking at -- at the joint appendix on page 360. As I read it, Miss Scott gives an answer that can't be heard, right?",
  "Ms. Dupont says, \"I'm sorry, I can't hear you.\" I mean, we don't know; since we weren't there if it was kind of, you know, \"I think I could\" and then \"I think\" -- I mean, you know, it's an atmospheric determination by the -- the district court judge; and as -- as has been pointed out here, all we have is the cold transcript.",
  "That's on joint appendix 401?",
  "And -- and the problem with that, of course, is it's - -",
  "Well, but -- the question is not could you consider the death penalty. It says could you consider both, when they're going through several of the juries. Jurors.",
  "And I thought that was -- the point was made by your friend on the other side, was that it was ambiguous as to what option she was saying she could consider.",
  "If - -",
  "With Brooks, what he said when he said I'm missing right now something that will better me towards my teaching career, and they say -- and the judge says, is there anybody who could speak to it? And he says, I've already talked to the dean. And so based on the initial conversation with the dean he was still worried.",
  "Then the judge calls the dean, and of course the dean's going to - -",
  "Well, that's what he's going to say to the judge. When Brooks talked to him, apparently there was a problem because his concern remained after having talked to the dean.",
  "He says I'm missing right now - -",
  "Something that could help me out towards my teaching career.",
  "I don't understand your answer that Mr. Brooks did not say there was a problem. He says, I've already missed half a day. There's something I'm missing right now that will better me towards my teaching career. He says I've already talked to the dean. How can you say he isn't identifying a problem?",
  "What about the explanation that was given that this was referring to the defendant's feigning emotional distress rather than anything to do with race?",
  "What doesn't have anything to do with it?",
  "So the relief you are requesting goes only to the penalty and not to the conviction?",
  "Even though -- even though your theory is that it was only with respect to the penalty that the bias -- you have no allegation - -",
  "-- that this jury did not return a valid conviction. I thought your objection was with respect to the death penalty.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Bright. Mr. Boudreaux.",
  "Mr. Bright contrasts that with the more probing inquiry with respect to white jurors who said \"I think I could,\" and here there was no follow-up.",
  "Mr. Boudreaux, even if -- even if you're correct that a neutral explanation was given focusing on the emotional distress, are you - - do you think the prosecutor would have made the analogy if there had been a black juror on the jury?",
  "I still have -- I am curious to the answer to Justice Breyer's question. When they go back and back strike at that point can the defendant say I don't think you can back strike this juror you're doing it on the basis of race.",
  "They can go back and back strike.",
  "They can go back and object to the back striking? The State would say, well here's the reasons we're back striking.",
  "I'm sorry. There's some ambiguity in your answer. Miller-El says others who were struck can be considered as part of the totality. My question is -- can they go back and object not only to the back struck juror, but as Justice Stevens points out, to the others who weren't objected to perhaps because there wasn't a black person on the jury?",
  "Still, the prosecutor is still there. You can ask the prosecutor, why did you strike that juror?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Boudreaux. Mr. Bright, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Do you agree with your friend on the other side, that you could have objected both to the backstruck juror and to the jurors to whom you -- with respect to whom you did not object because there was -- the juror that was later backstruck on the jury?",
  "The objection would have afforded the state an opportunity to present the - - if there was one -- the non-racial reason THAT they struck the juror.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Bright. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-179, Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc. Ms. Zieve.",
  "Isn't that situation addressed by the requirement that the manufacturer alert the FDA to new information and at least file annual reports, and then the FDA can pull back the pre-market approval if they think these problems require it to do so?",
  "Right. I thought that was your -- your theory was a little more nuanced. In other words, they don't require you to market a particular catheter. And you -- what I understood you to be arguing is that there may be a better design and that it was negligent for the manufacturer to market a particular design, even though they're allowed to; they don't have to.",
  "They should have made the change to make it safer, right?",
  "Well, if that's - -",
  "Well, if that's what happens, what, as a -- what's going to happen for patients at a time when your theory comes up, the manufacturer looks at it and says, well, maybe this is a better device; we don't want to risk these tort suits, so we're going to stop selling our old device that's been approved, but now we have got to get FDA approval of the new device and that might take forever or at least a year, let's say. And what happens to patients in that year? They've got no device.",
  "But your theory is that although this device has been approved, here's a better one. And it's negligent on the manufacturer's part to market a device, even though approved by the FDA, when there's a better one that would reduce the risks.",
  "What do you want them to do if you think it's negligent for them to market the approved product? Don't you want them to take it off the market?",
  "It's not that it is not reasonably safe. It's that another design would be safer. And you think that's a basis for negligence because you say, yeah, the FDA approved it, but that doesn't mean they required the manufacturer to market that device.",
  "So that's just like a car speedometer. I mean, the speedometer goes up to 120 miles an hour, but that doesn't mean you are supposed to drive it that fast.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Olson.",
  "What if the FDA hasn't done it? How are newly discovered flaws dealt with? I mean, say where you have this catheter, and the FDA didn't look at the possibility of allergic reactions to the balloon plastic, and all of a sudden it turns out to be a serious problem. How can you say that that's preemptive?",
  "You -- you agree that that was not preemptive.",
  "Mr. Olson, I'm looking at the Government's brief on page 4 which says that in the annual reports, the -- the manufacturer has to disclose unpublished reports of data from clinical investigations or nonclinical laboratory studies involving the device. So presumably that includes any nonclinical laboratory studies that the manufacturer itself conducted.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Ms. Zieve, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Didn't the Court - - didn't the majority of the Court reject that line in Lohr?",
  "Thank you.",
  "If I could -- I'm sorry -- I've been thinking about your example of ambiguity. You're saying it is ambiguous when they say you can inflate it up to the bursting pressure or until the blockage is cleared?",
  "Well, doesn't that obvious mean if the blockage is clear, you don't keep inflating it to the bursting pressure. You think that doctors read that as saying you can inflate it past the bursting pressure unless -- if the blockage isn't cleared?",
  "Even though the label said eight is the bursting pressure?",
  "Okay.",

  "I thought that we ruled in the Hamdi case that procedures quite similar to those under the DTA were adequate for American citizens?",
  "So that --",
  "So our judgment in this case depends upon whether we agree with you or the government that the procedures available under the DTA are meaningful under Hamdi?",
  "Your argument wouldn't be any different with respect to the availability of habeas if these people were held for one day, would it? We don't look at the length of detention in deciding whether habeas is available, do we?",
  "Well, let me just stop you there. Do you want this Court to rule on whether or not there are military exigencies that require the holding and detention of these enemy combatants?",
  "Putting aside the battlefield hypothetical, we're talking about Guantanamo. Your argument is that somebody held one day in Guantanamo has the right to habeas. So the extent of detention is irrelevant to your assertion.",
  "What is the relevance to your -- this line of reasoning to the recent enactment by Congress of section 1005(g), which says that the base at Guantanamo is not part of the United States? There is a judgment by the political branches that we don't exercise sovereignty over the leasehold, and it seems to me that, if we're going to adhere to our habeas corpus cases, we would have to reject that determination.",
  "So to determine whether there's jurisdiction, in every case we have to go through a multi factor analysis to determine if the United States exercises not sovereignty, which you've rejected as the touchstone, but sufficient control over a particular military base? Over the Philippines during World War II, in Vietnam, and it is going to decide in some cases whether the control is sufficient and others whether it isn't?",
  "And that is a judgment we the Court would make, not the political branches who have to deal with the competing sovereignties in those situations?",
  "We'll give you your rebuttal time.",
  "Mr. Waxman, this determination, whether it's sovereignty or subjugation or control of non-sovereign territory, would, I expect, have diplomatic consequences. It is, I think, typically an act of war for one country to assert authority and control over another country's jurisdiction. And here we have Section 1005G where Congress and the President have agreed that Guantanamo Bay is not part of the United States, and, yet, you would have this Court issue a ruling saying that it is subject to the total, complete domination and control, or whatever the factors are. What is the reaction of the Cuban government to be to that?",
  "We -- there are -- am I wrong that there are Cuban workers who come on to the base and work?",
  "So if you have two of those workers and they get into a fight over something, one can't sue the other in Cuban courts?",
  "What authority -- what authority do you have for that: That such a suit would not lie in the Cuban court?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Waxman. We will give you five minutes for rebuttal. General Clement.",
  "The DTA, see, is unclear to me, anyway, on this question. You agree that there is the authority under the DTA, and I assume under the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in reviewing those determinations, to order a release?",
  "2243 doesn't specify the availability of release, either, but it has certainly been interpreted to authorize that by habeas courts in this country.",
  "Yes, but that --",
  "I suppose any challenges to the adequacy of the standards, or whatever, are the sort of things that would be raised in the D.C. Circuit. And we don't know what that's going to look like yet, because the D.C. Circuit hasn't had an opportunity to rule on those.",
  "The procedures that are before us under the DTA and the MCA, of course, weren't available for the whole six-year period, were they?",
  "Is that because the withdrawal of jurisdiction does not apply to review of the proceedings in the D.C. Circuit that's provided under the statute? In other words, your argument that the habeas jurisdiction doesn't extend doesn't reach the review of the adequacy of the DTA proceedings?",
  "Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Waxman, we'll give you five minutes.",
  "That is an argument that, I gather, both sides agree is available to you under the DTA before the D.C. Circuit.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Waxman. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in case 06-1181, Dada v. Mukasey. Mr. Meade.",
  "How many of those are -- are granted?",
  "What percentage of motions to reopen are granted in favor of the alien?",
  "So how many -- do you know how many are filed on an annual basis?",
  "So there would be no reason not to file one of these if you were subject to voluntary -- if you elected voluntary departure, and it extended your time to stay, right? Seemingly, everybody would file one of these if we rule in your favor.",
  "We're dealing with people who have already broken the law. So you're saying they are likely to follow the statute that says only file a motion to reopen under these circumstances?",
  "Counsel, another way to reconcile the two that I think would be beneficial to your client, but I'm not sure it's open to us, is to address the Government's view that, when you voluntarily depart, your motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn. That is, as I gather, set forth only in a regulation and not the statute. Now, it seems to me that if I were -- if I thought it important to reconcile the two, I would be much more concerned about that interpretation -- that the motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn -- than I would suggest we start incorporating equitable tolling rules and all of that. But, I take it, the vulnerability of that regulation is probably beyond -- beyond debate.",
  "So if we don't address it here, there's going to be another case in a year or 18 months where that's going to be raised?",
  "Well, in all these cases, if you think you have a good case on the motion to reopen, all you have to do is give up the benefits that you have availed yourself under voluntary departure, and then the motion to reopen is not automatically withdrawn.",
  "No, I mean he -- you should not elect voluntary departure in the first place.",
  "What were those circumstances here?",
  "Well, presumably it doesn't take them much time because when someone elects voluntary departure they don't have to address it. I mean, this would obviously increase the volume of motions to reopen. As I said, I don't see know why anybody -- why everybody wouldn't file one, because it extends their stay.",
  "Well, is your position that the right to appeal is taken away, just as under the current regime the motion to reopen is taken away?",
  "Do you have to argue that the -- my understanding is that once the -- let's say it's the government's proposed regulation and the motion for -- or the voluntary departure is withdrawn to enable you to consider the motion to reopen. They can proceed with deportation at that time, correct?",
  "So you -- you almost have to be arguing that the motion to reopen tolls the time for deportation as well, right?",
  "Well, under your position, I guess, is what your position is on that.",
  "In other words, the government cannot enter a deportation order during a voluntary departure period.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Meade. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "That's a very strange statutory quid pro quo, it seems to me.",
  "If you do that, the alien is still subject to deportation, right?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, do you know what percentage of these motions to reopen are granted?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Meade, you have five minutes remaining.",
  "Do you have any estimate about how many more motions to reopen will have to be considered if your client prevails in this case?",
  "No, I don't understand that, because my -- as I understand it, it would in every case grant an effective extension of the time which you would have to depart if you had filed a motion to reopen.",
  "You answered my question with respect to the government's proposed regulation. But under your position that would allow the voluntary departure option to remain open, then anyone who exercised that option would want to file a motion to reopen because it would extend their time?",
  "The answer is yes?",
  "Not if it has 10,000 of these a year, as you told me in your opening argument. I mean, it takes some time to address them. You can't say all they have to do is decide them all within two days.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in the Case 07-5439, Baze v. Rees. Mr. Verrilli.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, your argument is based on improper administration of the protocol. You agree that if the protocol is properly followed there is no risk of pain?",
  "I thought your expert -- I'm looking at page 493 to 494 of the joint appendix -- agreed that if the two grams of sodium pentothal is properly administered, the way he put it, in virtually every case there would be a humane death.",
  "That method has never been tried, correct.",
  "Do we know whether there are risks of pain accompanying that method?",
  "The record establishes that the second drug that's used here is used to prevent involuntary muscle contractions. That would not be -- there wouldn't be a safeguard against that under one drug protocol, I take it.",
  "Can you -- do you agree that that is an appropriate problem to be addressed by the execution protocol, that they should try to reduce the likelihood of involuntary muscle contractions?",
  "I think that their -- one of their reasons was that it would enhance the dignity, not only of the procedure as a whole, but also to the condemned.",
  "What do we do with the -- if you prevail here, and the next case is brought by someone subject to the single drug protocol and their claim is: Look this has never been tried. We do know that there's a chance that it would cause muscle contractions that would make my death undignified. It will certainly extend how long it takes to die, so I'm subject to a lingering death and the more humane protocol would be the three drug protocol?",
  "You have objections that would apply even to your single drug protocol. You tell us that one reason this challenged protocol doesn't work is because people will mix the drugs in the wrong way, including the sodium pentathol. That objection would still be there if we adopted your alternative, wouldn't it?",
  "I'm focusing specifically on the mixing of the drugs. The mixing of the sodium pentathol would be undertaken under the Kentucky procedure and under your proposed alternative, correct?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Verrilli. Mr. Englert?",
  "Does the Kentucky law do anything other than adopt the AVMA guidelines.",
  "And presumably it would depend upon whatever new alternative the plaintiff in that case proposed.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Englert. Mr. Garre?",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you Mr. Garre. Mr. Verrilli, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "But the anesthesia concern of course is you don't want to kill the person when you're administering just anesthesia in a surgery so you would want somebody trained there that you could bring them back if anything went wrong that concern is not present here.",
  "Finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-11612, Gonzalez v. United States. Mr. Newton.",
  "This may not be a pertinent question, but where does the right to voir dire come from in the first place?",
  "So it's derivative from other rights? In other words, it helps implement the right to a fair trial, in the Batson context helps guard against an equal protection violation, but it's not on its own a free-standing right.",
  "In practice, it's more a tactical decision than a theoretical one. I mean you can explain to your client the difference between Article III and a magistrate, but he's going to be more interested in your judgment about, oh, judge so and so doesn't let you get away with anything on voir dire, you know, he runs a tight ship. This magistrate will let me raise all sorts of other things. I mean, it's like an objection at trial, in other words. It's going to be a tactical decision rather than a theoretical constitutional one.",
  "Well, if you get to that point, which case of ours holds that the right to a jury trial is a personal right that the defendant must waive rather than waive through counsel?",
  "But that can be expressed through counsel. I mean, does -- you know, does your client consent to this? Yes. I mean it's quite a different question to say that he has to be the one who stands up in court and says it.",
  "But, of course, that was for the whole trial. This is for a very discrete aspect prior to trial.",
  "Was there a right to voir dire at common law? I have the impression the judge would send somebody out and, you know, grab the first 12 people they could find.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Newton. Ms. Blatt?",
  "Of course, it might be said of the right to plead guilty as well. The lawyer has a lot more experience with what kind of sentence the judge is going to impose, what the odds are of the jury returning a verdict of innocence. I mean, the fact that the lawyer is better situated to make the judgment doesn't mean it's not a fundamental right.",
  "Do you -- do you think the right to a jury trial is something that has to be personally waived by the defendant or can that be waived through counsel?",
  "Were those -- was the right to a jury trial at issue in those cases?",
  "When I was researching it, I saw that it was usually included in the list, but I thought it would track back to some case that held that it was, but it never -- never does.",
  "Well, suppose the question would come up. I mean, if the circuit does that the question would come up, if the magistrate doesn't do it and it's not objected to, because of course if it's objected to you deal with it then.",
  "And then we'd have to decide, or the Court would have to decide whether that's a basis for reversal.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Mr. Newton, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "You can finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 06-1509, Boulware v. United States. Mr. Cline.",
  "We don't -- and this may be the point that you just made, but I want to clarify it. We don't have to decide whether this diversion was with respect to stock, because you put that at issue, and you weren't allowed to make that - -",
  "I suppose it would be open on remand for the Government to argue it was not with respect to stock for the reasons that have come out, that it was just a diversion?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cline. Ms. Maynard.",
  "Well, the court didn't let the taxpayer submit evidence. He came forward and said: Look, there's an issue here despite the return of capital. I would have thought at that point the burden shifted to you again. That burden - - having met that burden of production or at least tried to, the burden would shift to you to show, no, it's not a return of capital, it's a dividend.",
  "He said in his proffer that he would present expert testimony that this -- the corporation didn't have profits and earnings, and therefore it was a return of capital. And the district court said no, you don't get to do that.",
  "Right.",
  "No. I mean, the district court -- the district court said that's not relevant, it's not relevant whether they could be classified as dividends. I'm quoting from your brief on page 8: \"It is not relevant whether the funds could have been classified as a return of capital or a dividend at the time when they were diverted,\" because, he said, what was relevant is -- is the intent, whether they were in fact treated as return of capital.",
  "Well, but if he is making a profit and it depends upon whether or not there's adequate earnings or not, isn't he plainly saying that that means it's with respect to my stock? Because if he were getting it, for example, as an employee for consideration, it wouldn't matter whether there was sufficient earnings or not. But when he says it depends on whether there's sufficient earnings, it seems to me that that's clearly notifying you that he's saying it's with respect to his stock.",
  "This is a criminal case. He's presented the argument, but don't you have the burden of showing as an element of tax deficiency that what he's proffering there is not true?",
  "That's not right. He says right here that it may or may not be income depending on a fact, not an expert's opinion, whether or not HIE had earnings and profits for the years when the moneys were obtained by Boulware. That's a question of fact. You look at the corporate books. You get the accountant on to testify. It's not an expert's view on what's legally relevant.",
  "It's not totally relevant if the question he is trying to submit, whether they are earnings or profits or not, which will affect its treatment. It's only relevant if it's with respect to stock.",
  "Well, please - -",
  "Thank you, Ms. Maynard. Mr. Cline, you have four -- ten minutes remaining.",
  "Where is that evidence? If he has the burden of coming forward with it, I assume that means in the proffer. And where is it?",
  "Justice Breyer's point is that that isn't directed to that issue. It's directed to the issue of whether he was using the funds for a corporate purpose.",
  "And that evidence came in after the proffer, didn't it?",
  "Well, this is a motion in limine which is before the trial.",
  "Well, it's kind of hard to say it's with respect to stock when the other stockholder doesn't get any.",
  "What page in your brief did you say?",
  "Of your reply brief?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 06-1037, Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC. Mr. Klausner.",
  "And always based on age plus service.",
  "But is there any reason -- I think what you're saying is we should view this as a retirement plan and there are a number of ways you can be eligible for retirement: Age plus years of service, but another way you can be eligible is disability.",
  "So the effect of this litigation is that policemen or firefighters who are injured and become disabled now get lower benefits for disability?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart.",
  "So it's fine for them to use that, but you're saying it's not fine for them to use any element of age in making that computation?",
  "Even though, under the Federal law, they can use age as the exclusive requirement in determining retirement?",
  "You prevent the State from taking into account the fact that younger disabled workers have not had the same opportunity that older disabled workers have. And it results -- if we adopt your system where you can look only at years of service, what it, in effect, is going to do is to prevent Kentucky from giving disability benefits to older workers who become disabled. For example, if you have two workers, one who starts work at 18 and acquires years of service, say, 12 years of service and becomes disabled, you would say, well, you can take those years of service into account. The older worker who begins at age 30 and is disabled in his first year on the job, you say, well, you can only look at years of service. You can't impute to both of them retirement age. So the 30-year-old who becomes disabled has to get less, fewer benefits than the 18-year-old who becomes disabled.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Now, Mr. Klausner, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you Mr. Klausner. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-21 and 07-25, Crawford v. Marion County Election Board and Indiana Democratic Party v. Secretary Rokita. Mr. Smith.",
  "We can limit your standing argument to -- I guess it's based on the affidavits of Ms. Holland and Ms. Smith, the one who is a clerk for the Democratic Party and the other who is a judge for the Democratic Party. We don't have to agree with you that anybody who votes, might vote Democratic, is enough to give you standing.",
  "Well, I understood Judge Barker to say that you had not come up with a single instance of somebody who was denied the right to vote because they didn't have a photo ID.",
  "So elections were conducted under this law?",
  "But why -- and they're not going to be able to get one even though the State will provide them with one if they don't have one, subject to some identification?",
  "That would be potentially constitutional?",
  "Okay. So we should ignore your religious objection argument in this case?",
  "Well, how far away is the furthest county seat for somebody in the county,",
  "County seats aren't very far for people in Indiana.",
  "We have -- the record shows that fewer than 1 percent of people in Indiana don't have a photo ID.",
  "Well, so do the voting rolls. I thought the district court found 41 - -",
  "Mr. Smith.",
  "-- 41.4 percent of the people on the voting rolls in Indiana were either dead or they were duplicate entries.",
  "Do you take issue with the 41.4 percent figure for bad entries on the voting registration rolls?",
  "And this is one of them, I suppose, requiring photo ID?",
  "Well, don't you think if you have the voter rolls with a significant number of bad registrants, either dead or duplicates, that that presents a significant potential for fraud?",
  "Well, that's because it's less of an issue. If somebody wins an election by 500,000 votes, you may not be terribly worried if some percentage were cast by fraud, but you might look to the future and realize there could be a closer election and there -- it's a type of fraud that, because it's fraud, it's hard to detect.",
  "But the problem with the duplicate entries is there may be two entries for John Smith because John Smith has moved and the voter registration hasn't been updated. So all you need is somebody else to go in and say: I'm John Smith, this is my address. And later in the day somebody else comes in and says: I'm John Smith and this is my address. And because they're duplicates it's really difficult to check.",
  "They help you get it. They say if you don't have an ID we'll give you one. If you don't have a photo ID, come in and we'll give you one.",
  "What documentation did President Carter and Secretary Baker propose to require for their photo IDs?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Smith. Mr. Fisher.",
  "Mr. Fisher, you make -- rely on the argument that 40 percent of the registrants -- or not registrants, the people on the - - yes, registrants -- on the voter list are -- are not accurate. That argument is a little difficult to -- to take because what you're saying is we do such a lousy job on registration that we should be able to do a - - have a more stringent voting requirement. Why do you do such a lousy job on registration?",
  "I thought you were sued by the Federal Government because you did such a bad job.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fisher.",
  "General Clement.",
  "And presumably the challenges could be adjudicated. You have 10 days to go down to the courthouse when you file a provisional ballot, and if it turns out the election was decided by three votes and there are 30 provisional ballots, presumably the challenge can be brought at that point as well.",
  "Do you think there is standing in this case to bring the facial challenge?",
  "Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Smith, three minutes.",
  "You said it serves no purpose. What if we determine that it does serve a purpose in preventing fraud. How are we supposed to weigh that against your asserted burden on the right to vote?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Smith. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in 06-1082, Virginia v. Moore. Mr. McCullough. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. McCULLOUGH",
  "Mr. McCullough - -",
  "But suppose it works the other way. If Virginia has a law saying you can arrest anybody you want on our highways, but, you know, here's what the offenses are, the officers did not have probable cause to think a crime had been committed, but it was they had probable cause to arrest, I suppose under the Respondent's theory that would be all right.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Goldstein.",
  "Well, I thought it's questioned in your footnote 13 in your brief. You seem to suggest that the exclusionary rule is not at issue in this case.",
  "So - so we should write an opinion saying we're not saying that it was correct to -- we're not saying that it was correct to exclude the evidence in this case?",
  "No, it says the laws of the 50 States are pretty variable on this question as well.",
  "Do we have to look at both of those varieties? Let's say the State has a rule that, yes, you can arrest people in a way that we would say you can't, but you don't have to have probable cause. You just have to -- they're just arrestable.",
  "-- is probable cause to arrest. The State has a law that says you can arrest in these circumstances whether or not you have probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed.",
  "I thought you were telling us it has to be sufficient cause to arrest, not sufficient cause to believe that a crime has been committed.",
  "So it is, as your friends on the other side put it, you are advocating a two-step process. There has to be probable cause to arrest and there has to be probable cause to believe a crime has been committed?",
  "No, they're different here. They had probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, but you say they didn't have probable cause to arrest because State law makes it illegal.",
  "What if the State makes a trivial offense arrestable, as in Atwater? You're suggesting in that situation the common law rule we have doesn't apply. It's a trivial offense, but it's made arrestable and therefore it doesn't violate the Fourth Amendment to search incident to that arrest.",
  "Well, what if the legislature -- this was the hypothetical Mr. Dreeben posed. What if the legislature says yes, you can arrest for this offense but you cannot search incident to the arrest, because we think that's too much of an intrusion given the fact that it's a relatively trivial offense? In that case, would our doctrine saying under the Fourth Amendment you can search incident to a valid arrest be reversed preempted, preempted by the State law?",
  "So the State can define the circumstances under which you can have an arrest, but the State can't define and limit the consequences of the arrest?",
  "Counsel, can I get back to your discussion of Cooper? In Cooper, you said that if it violates the State law for an inventory search, then you can't search incident to that. But that's because it is then not an inventory search. Here there's no doubt that this was an arrest, whether it complied with State law or not.",
  "No, but just -- it gets to -- I mean, if you don't follow the State rules, it doesn't comply with the rules for an inventory search. But here you're saying if don't -- you're not saying if you don't follow the State rules, it's not an arrest. It's not a lawful arrest. But that's a different question than whether or not it is an arrest. Our precedents say if it's an arrest, you can search incident to the arrest.",
  "Counsel, if we assume, contrary to your footnote 13, that the exclusionary rule is implicated in this case, could you explain why, under the Federal Constitution, there should be imposed on the State an exclusionary rule for a violation of State law when State law does not impose an exclusionary rule for the violation of its law?",
  "Well, I guess the question would be: Why doesn't our jurisprudence on whether there's an arrest also look to something else, rather than whether it's permitted or violated under State law? In other words, the State doesn't -- the State law does not provide for the exclusionary rule, but we say the Fourth Amendment does. Under -- this is not a valid arrest under State law, but your brothers say under the Fourth Amendment it is because there's probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.",
  "I think your friend agreed that the cases didn't establish whether our references to probable cause meant to probable cause to arrest or probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed. You don't agree with that? Do you think that the cases foreclose their position?",
  "You can finish your answer.",
  "All right. Thank you, Mr. Goldstein. Mr. McCullough, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. McCULLOUGH",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 06-1463, Preston v. Ferrer. Mr. Schleimer.",
  "Well, It wouldn't eliminate it. Your friend on the other side says it the simply delays it, because you get to arbitrate de novo after the commissioner's decision.",
  "Well, I guess I could let him answer, but I suppose he would say you go to that court, and you get a motion to compel arbitration.",
  "Counsel, I have to confess I've never understood these choice of alaw provisions. You incorporate California law. I assume California law is interpreted consistent with Federal law. If Federal law preempts California law, that's what you're incorporating. It always struck me as kind of circular.",
  "When you say California law applies, you don't mean to the exclusion of Federal law?",
  "Counsel, would you have any problem with a California law that said you can arbitrate but the arbitrator must allow the Labor Commissioner to file an amicus brief?",
  "What if it goes on and says, and you must allow the Labor Commissioner to appear at the arbitration?",
  "So, what if it says you've got to wait for 30 days to allow the Labor Commissioner to consider whether or not to intervene?",
  "How was the arbitrator chosen? Does he or she have any particular expertise in this area?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Brunstad.",
  "Normally we say that those types of disputes are for the arbitrator to decide. The theory is that the arbitrator can apply the existing law as well as a court, and if that's the theory, couldn't the arbitrator apply the existing law as well as an agency?",
  "Right, you at least have that additional step. It is -- particularly since you only have 10 days to appeal from the labor commissioner, someone who wants to arbitrate has to appeal, has to go to superior court and get a motion to compel. You can't even wait to see if your opponent goes to superior court and -- well, if he has won, he wouldn't go into court. But you have to go to the court to get a motion to compel? You can't just go ahead and proceed with arbitration.",
  "And if you -- and if you are successful and get from the superior court an order to compel arbitration, your opponent can then appeal it, I assume.",
  "Counsel, do you - -",
  "Mr. Schleimer, you have nine minutes remaining.",
  "Well, your friend says that this agency has exactly that power, and the reason you required these things to go before her, is that she knows what's going on in the area and, if appropriate, can take the supervisory authority or whatever the equivalent of prosecutorial action is.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 06-11543, Begay v. United States. Ms. Katze.",
  "You are assuming, of course, that the canon of ejusdem generis applies to the statute, as opposed to Congress just singling out a couple of things it wanted to be sure were covered. And we left that issue open in James, didn't we?",
  "No, but then I was wondering about that as well, that as a violent felony whether that gives you any traction. But extortion, you don't normally think of that as a violent felony and yet it's clearly included in the definition.",
  "Yes, but you don't say, give me that or I'll break your legs all the time. You may say, give me that or I'll release this embarrassing letter. That's extortion. It's not violent, though.",
  "But then, releasing the letter is not violent and it may cause embarrassment rather than physical injury. Yet it would qualify as extortion.",
  "It's kind of odd, when the catch-all is phrased in terms of physical injury to another, to say that it's concerned only with property crimes.",
  "Well, doesn't that suggest that \"otherwise\" in the statute is in fact used to mean \"likewise\"? I mean, if we said \"attempted burglary\" in James it's obviously included because burglary is -- attempted burglary doesn't present a risk in a different fashion from burglary. It presents it in the same fashion.",
  "That was a helpful question.",
  "Well, particularly when you look at subsection (i) in the broad reading of serious potential risk of (ii), why would -- why would Congress mean to exclude a particular category of physical injury from the reach of the statute?",
  "No, not everything; everything that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.",
  "What do you think presents the most serious potential risk of injury to all of us, that we are going to be a victim of arson or that we are likely to get hit by a drunk driver?",
  "Thank you, Counsel.",
  "Ms. Kruger.",
  "How do we know that? I guess this is a question I asked your friend. I mean, degree of risk. I mean what are the odds that we're going to -- that if there's a burglary, some physical injury might result as opposed to an episode of drunk driving.",
  "In other words, I guess -- do we really look at how -- what percentage of drunk drivers are involved in accidents as opposed to what percentage of burglars are involved in violent confrontations?",
  "How much of a limitation is the point Justice Breyer was making? I mean, let's say you've got a habitual drunk driver. Everybody in town says he always drives drunk. I mean, how would they greet the news: Guess what? He's just got a gun. I mean, that raises the level of risk significantly, doesn't it?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Kruger. Ms. Katze, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Extortion doesn't involve property as an element.",
  "Something of value -- something of value could be, you know, a confession in a related case or something. It doesn't necessarily have to be property.",
  "I don't understand that. Yes. Life, liberty, and property include more than property, but - -",
  "What about - -",
  "Well, we know that attempted burglary is covered, and you don't have to enter the house in an attempted burglary.",
  "Yes. Well, you are saying this is an analogous crime to the four that are listed, or it is not an analogous crime to the four that are listed?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Katze. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-1646, United States v. Rodriguez. Mr. Shanmugam.",
  "You seem to -- you seem to flinch from the natural consequences of your position in not looking at the maximum for a particular offender. For example, you know, under some guidelines, if he was the ringleader his sentence can be enhanced beyond what would otherwise be the maximum for a first-time offender, but you say you don't take that into consideration.",
  "How is that different from your position here, where it is the fact that the individual is a recidivist that causes you to look to a different maximum?",
  "So that's the reason you sort of pull back from a more aggressive reading, because it's not as broad a category?",
  "Well, but only if they're subject -- only if they have some characteristic that had caused the State legislature to give the higher maximum, such as being the ringleader or some other enhancement.",
  "Surely not, Mr. Shanmugam. You were talking about broad categories earlier. It seemed that the broad category in the situation you posit would be the normal offender rather than the recidivist, and that's the one we ought to look at.",
  "Well, I know, but you began your discussion by saying we had to choose one maximum. You were accepting that requirement. It seems to me, if that's the case, it's clear that we ought to pick the maximum for the particular offense without considering additional enhancements.",
  "But you don't accept that approach when we're talking about enhancements under State guidelines. You know, if the normal sentence is whatever it is, 10 years, and you get an extra 2 years if you're the ringleader, you say no, you don't look at that; you just look at the 10 years.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld.",
  "Isn't it pertinent, Mr. Rothfeld, that in trying to decide whether a maximum term of imprisonment encompasses recidivists, we're dealing with a statute that itself is directed to recidivism. You're asking -- you've got three previous convictions and then you get a particularly harsh sentence. If recidivism is what you're trying to address, it would seem to me in deciding what a maximum term is that it would be natural to assume that they would take recidivism into consideration in that context as well.",
  "Well, but it just seems to me that if you have Congress addressing what they regarded as a very serious problem of recidivism, they would think that that's a problem that should be taken into account in determining what maximum sentences you're subject to under State law.",
  "Counsel, you - -",
  "Well, we know it was focusing on the particular problem of recidivism. That's what the overarching Federal statute is directed to.",
  "And I think, following up on Justice Kennedy's question, that you would assume that this Congress thought that recidivists presented particular problems that were different from the one particular offense.",
  "Well, but the flip side of that hypothetical is somebody selling a ton of marijuana. It's the same offense as somebody who's done it and been convicted of it three different times. I mean, I don't think your hypothetical helps advance the argument.",
  "Counsel, if you were representing a -- a defendant who has two prior convictions for something that has a sentence of 8 years, and on the third one he is subject to a sentence of 15 years; and your initial meeting, the first thing he wants to know is what's the maximum that I'm facing? Would you tell him it's 8 years or would you tell him it's 15 years?",
  "Counsel, the Government of course responds to your rule of lenity argument by saying it loses a lot of its force when we are talking about how -- the degree of sentencing rather than whether conduct is subject to a criminal sanction in the first place.",
  "But someone who is, you know, we are trying to decide whether he is subject to 20 years in jail or 30 years in jail, invoking the rule of lenity is a little bit -- it's not the same as somebody who comes in and says I didn't know this was a crime at all, because it's so vaguely written.",
  "Well, we know -- we know that someone's liberty is going to be taken away in a case like this; it's just a question of for how long.",
  "It is -- it is a fundamental verbal embarrassment for your argument that you would say in a particular case that the maximum to which someone is subject is say, 5 years, and that person is in fact sentenced to 15 years. It's just the -- the words don't fit together under that argument.",
  "Well, no, I thought their argument was you look at broad categories rather than individual characteristics. It's not a one-way ratchet at all.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Shanmugam. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 06-1413, MeadWestvaco v. The Illinois Department of Revenue. Ms. Brinkmann.",
  "To Ohio?",
  "Ms. Brinkmann, you begin your brief by saying this, a paper company, that happens to own a data processing company. Why couldn't you equally say this is a data processing company that happens to own a paper company?",
  "Well, and Lexis/Nexis has been a data processing company since whenever.",
  "It's not the oldest -- whichever is oldest isn't the one that gets to be regarded as the dominant partner, is it?",
  "Is General Electric a light bulb company or, since it owns NBC, a media company.",
  "Well, that's because they sell paper in Illinois?",
  "Well, Lexis sells data services in Illinois, too.",
  "Well, why doesn't - - I mean, you just said, as I understand it, Illinois has the right to tax Lexis under business activities in Illinois. Illinois would argue the reason it has a capital gain is partly because they were doing business in Illinois and so we should be entitled to part of that capital gain. Almost -- I mean, it seems to me it would be pretty easy if they get to tax 2 percent of Lexis's business, well then maybe they should get 2 percent of the capital gain when it's sold or tax 2 percent.",
  "Well, isn't it kind of like futures hedging? I mean, you've got a paper company and then you've got something that is sort of the paperless aspect, and they can look at it and say, well, we're kind of hedging our paper business by investing heavily in something that's supposedly going to take away the need for paper.",
  "Ms. Brinkmann, one thing that concerns me is how this will complicate the process. I think, with respect to ordinary income, the States work this out, and they figure we get 5 percent because we have 5 percent of the presence or business, whatever. Now, they're going to have that, and they're going to have an overlay on that. They're going to say, well, it's 5 percent; but, you know, we sold this asset that doesn't have any connection to Illinois; and that's part of the income we've got. So you don't get quite 5 percent of all. And another -- Illinois is going to come back and say, well, yes, but you sold this other one; and, as to that one, you've got sufficient connection with Illinois. It seems to me it's going to be impossible to sort this out.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann. Mr. Barov.",
  "Counsel, why isn't your friend correct that you have waived any argument based on the presence of Lexis in Illinois?",
  "Well, but that's - - they are very different from your current argument, which you emphasize that whether they are unitary or not, Lexis/Nexis was in Illinois.",
  "Okay. Now, as to that argument, at least I am very reluctant to overturn a State court on an argument that they didn't have an opportunity to consider. And whether it's technically waived because you raised it in the trial court or not, it certainly was not an argument you made to the Illinois appellate courts.",
  "Well, it wasn't in Allied-Signal. In Allied-Signal the asset that was sold was in New Jersey, and that was totally irrelevant to how we treated the issue in that case.",
  "Well, that's why it's even more dramatic to me that you didn't raise the argument based on the Lexis connection to Illinois. That's the basis on which your auditor is claiming these taxes; and, yet, you don't even raise it before the Illinois appellate court as a ground for being able to reach the Lexis/Nexis income.",
  "We couldn't do anything more if we said you haven't waived it, we couldn't do anything more than send it back. You're telling us Lexis has this presence in Illinois, but we have nothing in the record about that.",
  "Where is that?",
  "I just -- usually appellate courts don't make findings. That's why I'm curious - -",
  "I thought -- I've been looking, too. I thought 18A does say that they had $46 million of sales attributable to Lexis/Nexis.",
  "No, only 46 million.",
  "It said 46, not hundreds of millions.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Brinkmann, you have three minutes.",
  "Ms. Brinkmann, your final point.",
  "Ms. Brinkmann, on the waiver point -- I'm looking at page 18a -- it not only says that Lexis/Nexis contributed $46 million from its presence in Illinois; it begins the sentence by saying \"as the Department notes, $46 million of Mead's income came from Lexis/Nexis activities in Illinois.\" So that doesn't sound like a waiver of that point to me.",
  "Initially, it's about the context in which -- what I regard as an important fact -- was raised, whether it was raised in the context of an argument on unitary business or whether or not they went too far, but the stubborn fact is still there.",
  "Thank you. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-937, Quanta Computer v. LG Electronics. Ms. Mahoney.",
  "Well, if that's true then this case really isn't a big deal at all. It just depends on exactly how you word the contract when the patentee sells it to a purchaser. You can word it -- in other words, you can word it in such a way that the patentee's rights extend further downstream and you're saying all this case turns on is whether the wording here was correct or not.",
  "Well, I understand your position to -- to acknowledge that they could have structured the sale to Intel in such a way as to achieve the same result that you're saying is so bad under the patent laws.",
  "So the parties are unwilling to spell out exactly how this is going to work out in their contract, and each side, it prefers to take their chances on how the Federal Circuit's going to rule. It's easier to sell these things if they're not encumbered by these additional license requirements and the manufacturer presumably gets a lot more, but there's a lot of uncertainty, uncertainty that could have been cured by how the contract was drafted, and people prefer to live with that uncertainty and litigate rather than clear it up in the contract.",
  "Fine, and the person who wrote that provision knows that the question of how the patent-exhaustion doctrine applies is the subject of great confusion, so much confusion that the Supreme Court's going to have to decide it, and yet they put that in there rather than spelling out in the contract exactly which they had in mind, whether or not you could impose these further restrictions or couldn't.",
  "Well, it wasn't clear to the Federal Circuit, I guess.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Mahoney. Mr. Hungar?",
  "Although you think it can be overridden simply by providing in the contract that the same rights and remedies would be available?",
  "A mere license can prevent the application of the patent-exhaustion doctrine?",
  "And it would be patent infringement by the use of the product by the people that Intel sold to?",
  "That would sound like your friend on the other side, the Respondent, had actually won in this case.",
  "Well, I think that's an important question. I understood the argument at page 16 of your brief to say that the patent-exhaustion doctrine doesn't apply in that situation and that you, therefore, can't have the rights and remedies under patent law. You told me earlier that if the person to whom Intel sells the product uses it contrary to the license stipulation, they would be liable for patent infringement. Your answer to Justice Breyer suggests to me that you're saying only that they're liable to -- for contract infringement, and that's a very big difference.",
  "Sale from whom to whom?",
  "But what you - - well, but what you say in your brief is that in the situation we're talking about the licensee stands in the shoes of the patentee. Now, if that's right it seems to me that you're telling me that the patent remedies are available and not simply contractual remedies.",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, or, more pertinently, it can only sell if the person they sell to agrees not to use the product in a certain way.",
  "Exactly. That's the critical point. You're telling me that if the buyer, in other words, the kind of third person in this chain, uses the patented article in a way that is contrary to the license that was given to the second person in the chain, then he is liable for contributory infringement under the patent laws and not, as I understood you to answer to Justice Breyer, only under contract law.",
  "Do you sue under patent law or just contract law?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hungar. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Well, but there's nothing to do with these chipsets other than use them in the computers. I mean, you don't put them on your shelf. They're not good for anything other than using in the computer. So saying there's a separate patent for how you use them with the other systems doesn't seem to be very significant.",
  "Mr. Phillips.",
  "Mr. Phillips?",
  "What in the world does clause 3.8 of the license mean? It says, \"notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its licensed products.\" In other words, the patent exhaustion doctrine may not apply for all the reasons that we've been talking about, but it applies in the way it would apply if we just sold these licensed products. That seems to me to give away everything you're talking about.",
  "That's what the notice says.",
  "Well, then - -",
  "That argument didn't prevail last year in the KSR case, right? I mean, we're -- we've had experience with the Patent Office where it tends to grant patents a lot more liberally than we would enforce under the patent law.",
  "Mr. Phillips - -",
  "And the way you achieve that result is to condition the sale. What you're trying to do is expand what you get under a condition to what you get under a notice. And the reason that troubles me is because if you had imposed a condition on the sale, Intel wouldn't have paid you as much for it. But you say, all right, we'll take the money because -- additional money because there's no condition, but we want to achieve the same result because of the notice.",
  "Well, they're happy with that because the notice says you can't -- you can only use this with Intel products. So they're happy with that solution as well.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Mahoney. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case No. 06-1321, Gomez-Perez v. Potter. Mr. Guerra.",
  "No, it's not. I mean, a company could have a policy of firing everybody who complains about anything and the fact that a worker is over the age of 40 and is fired does not mean that he is being fired because of age.",
  "Of course the statute that covers age discrimination in the private sector does have an express provision addressing retaliation. The one that governs Federal employees does not, and that's the government's main argument, that it's expressed in the private sector, it's not there in the public sector and so you shouldn't imply one. What's your answer to that?",
  "The Federal employee, though, has all of the remedies under the Civil Service Reform Act for any type of employment practice. Those remedies are elaborately reticulated and almost impenetrable, and yet this would add complication. In other words, despite all the remedies under the CSRA that says in some cases you go here, in other cases you go here, and you get different types of review depending on the facts, all of that would be wiped away if you can bring a direct action under the age discrimination statute.",
  "But not retaliation claims. In other words, although the direct claims, as you put it, may or may not be carved out, a retaliation claim fits under the employment practices provisions of the CSRA, regardless of the basis for retaliation. In other words, you took personnel action against me for an impermissible basis and therefore I'm entitled to the various civil service remedies.",
  "But it does that for a reason. We have a lot of cases in the Federal Circuit and the D.C. Circuit that addresses a lot of these problems say that when the CSRA excludes certain types of claims of employees, they do it for a reason. In other words, it's not simply that they didn't cover them or inadvertence, but they make the decision that the remedies that they've provided don't apply in a particular case. And to say that those people who are excluded under the CSRA nonetheless have remedies for employment practices seems to me to undermine that - - that judgment.",
  "When you qualified your answer by saying that the employee can control, was that a way to dismiss the collective bargaining rights?",
  "What about review under -- by the Merit Systems Protection Board?",
  "So when you're talking about the Office of Special Counsel - -",
  "Well, another reason it's not that simple is that under the Age Discrimination Act you have a private remedy that specifically provides for retaliation. And that is noticeably absent from the Federal remedy. And I thought that was the strongest argument on the government's side.",
  "I thought there was a more express incorporation in Title VII of the private anti-retaliation remedy, and you don't have that in this case.",
  "So that makes it not precisely the same situation.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre.",
  "Do you agree with your friend that this employee has no remedy under the Civil Service Reform Act?",
  "Why is that? I mean, if you have the private -- the private sector remedy is not so limited, right?",
  "Well, if we imply or incorporate into the Federal anti-discrimination remedy an anti-retaliation provision, I assume it would be in the same scope as the private anti -- the private anti-retaliation provision.",
  "Isn't this an unusual retaliation case in that the person allegedly retaliated against also has substantive anti-discrimination claims? And I gather -- I think it would take a particularly incompetent lawyer that couldn't phrase retaliation in those cases as underlying discrimination.",
  "Are those, are those mostly witness cases?",
  "In other words, it's a witness saying I think so and so was fired because of his age.",
  "That does bring up Justice Alito's point. I mean, tomorrow you're going to argue the exact opposite, right?",
  "Or else that distinction between conduct and status would require you to lose.",
  "Counsel, I would have thought the answer to Justice Breyer's question would be: This is an unusual situation where you have the employer writing the law about what the employees can do, and Congress realized, perhaps unlike the situation in Title VII, everybody over 40 would be covered; and every time somebody over 40 was fired or disciplined or didn't get a raise, they could claim that it was age discrimination; and Congress decided that they as the employer didn't want to face that disturbance, particularly since they have the Civil Service Reform Act already.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Guerra, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Is that because they may not engage in collective bargaining, or because they have chosen not to?",
  "I suppose that's consistent with whatever prohibition it is that precludes them from engaging in collective bargaining.",
  "So you think we do have to decide the Title VII question if you are to prevail.",
  "Thank you counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 06-1431, CBOCS West v. Humphries. Mr. Hawkins.",
  "Now, is your position that in that situation a retaliation is not covered by 1981?",
  "I would have thought that you could argue that it's direct discrimination. In other words, if you're fired, whatever form the retaliation takes, that, as Justice Ginsburg suggests, that that would be on the basis -- basis of race. And I thought your position, or at least your position could be narrowed to say it's only when the individual against whom the retaliation takes place is not the individual complaining of the direct discrimination that your position would be pertinent.",
  "Well, that's right. That's why I thought the person directly discriminated against would be able to phrase the retaliation claim certainly as a discrimination claim.",
  "We do have those recent cases, but we also have the Sullivan case interpreting -- interpreting 1982, which arose under the prior approach to these questions. And my question for you is: Under principles of stare decisis, which body do we follow, the earlier case interpreting 1982 under the more freewheeling approach to statutory interpretation or this later body of law that says we're not going to do that any more?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Hyndman.",
  "Counsel, if we rule in your favor, why would anyone ever bring a Title VII action if they could bring a 1981 action?",
  "All right. So if you bring -- you'd at least bring them both, right, because - -",
  "-- 1981 allows you to get out of the Title VII cap on damages?",
  "Or isn't that rendering Congress' careful -- I mean the 1991 legislation was a careful compromise. In exchange for the expansions of Title VII, they put caps on the damages. You would allow them to keep the expansion, but do away with the caps.",
  "Well, you're just begging the question. You're assuming you have the right that's at issue here today.",
  "Well then, why do they put the caps in? I mean, I do think that is a limitation on the remedy they provided. They provided a damage remedy with a very clear cap and it's not a particularly generous cap, either.",
  "And you would allow them to completely obliterate that cap under any case that could be brought under 1981.",
  "When you agreed with Justice Breyer that we're looking for a word that couldn't be there, you said yes, but it is in fact a word that is there in about 37 other statutes, right?",
  "The word could be there. I'm not saying whether it has to be there or not. But it certainly could be there, and it's not here.",
  "Yes.",
  "But they provide a specific cause of action for retaliation, correct?",
  "Is this -- the question I asked your friend and I'll ask you as well. I think you have a case under Sullivan, which recognized, although it's 1982, this type of action. But Sullivan would not come out the same way today given Alexander against Sandoval and our new approach to statutory interpretation. So if you're concerned about stare decisis, which body of law do you give effect to, the Sullivan case or our more recent cases on how to read statutes?",
  "Of course, by 1991 our new approach to reading statutes was pretty clearly established.",
  "So if Congress were looking at both of those bodies of law, then wouldn't the normal care be for it to put in a retaliation provision?",
  "To the extent your argument relies so heavily on Sullivan, I went back and read it, and rather than an implied right of action case it looked to me like a third party standing case.",
  "But I think - - that's right. Now I get back to another stare decisis question. Do I rely on what Sullivan actually said, or I do I rely on Jackson's reinterpretation of Sullivan?",
  "You agree, though, that the language in the opinion focuses on it as a third party standing question.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. General Clement.",
  "So, if you have - -",
  "If you have an employer who fires everybody who complains about practices at work, that would not be covered retaliation?",
  "Do you think it's unusual for employers to have a practice that anybody who alleges that I've committed a violation of Federal law, I want to get rid of them?",
  "You don't have any doubt that Sullivan would come out differently today under our current analysis?",
  "The correct reading of Jackson or of Sullivan?",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Hawkins, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-1456, Cuellar versus United States. Mr. Beard.",
  "Well, he certainly concealed the location. They were secreted in the car, under the goat hair and everything else. The location of the money was certainly concealed.",
  "But why -- why isn't this transporting to conceal the location or the ownership in this sense? Suppose you have someone the police suspect of engaging in drug activities. They know he sold, you know, so much marijuana or whatever and got cash back. They think it's there, and they're going to investigate it, but this fellow comes in and they transport the proceeds across the border. Isn't that transportation to conceal the location or the ownership?",
  "Well, they think it's there, but they're not sure, and they -- you know, that would help them make their case, to find out that the guy they think sold the drugs has $80,000. So they get a search warrant or whatever, and it turns out he doesn't, because it's been transported to conceal the location or ownership.",
  "Counsel, can I ask you to go back to Justice Stevens's line of questioning? If -- do you conceal the nature of proceeds if you conceal the proceeds?",
  "Well, that -- that doesn't seem to follow. I understand the argument with \"nature.\" In other words, you're not concealing the nature; it's just not there. But when you're hiding it, you are concealing the location.",
  "Well, that gets me to a question. Several times you've referenced the attributes. Are you saying that the statute would have a different meaning if it just said \"location\"?",
  "Well, you better explain that a little more for me.",
  "Because they seem to me the same.",
  "Okay, so hiding location assumes it's going to come up later.",
  "And if you just hide the money, you assume he's just going to leave it somewhere and forget about it?",
  "Well, the \"more\" is they don't hold it under your name. They hold it under a numerical account number. Then that changes everything?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Beard.",
  "Ms. Schertler.",
  "Why isn't that enough? If, for example, he's being -- he thinks he's being watched by law enforcement because they know he's up to something, but his brother isn't, why isn't that concealing?",
  "During the course of the transportation. That is not what you say in your brief. I'm looking at page 41 and what you say is: \"If no independent evidence establishes that concealment or disguising of the pertinent attribute of the proceeds would occur at the point of destination, then a factfinder would lack a reasonable basis for inferring that the transportation was designed to conceal or disguise.\" In other words, in the hypothetical Justice Scalia just gave -- in other words everybody knows he's a drug dealer, he spends the money -- there is no concealment or disguising the pertinent attribute at the point of destination.",
  "So there is no money laundering if they conceal the proceeds in a suitcase that's in the trunk of the car? Is that enough?",
  "Is that concealing the money?",
  "Does use of a suitcase provide that evidence?",
  "When I use a suitcase I'm using it to carry my clothes, not to conceal them.",
  "So if this fellow were driving to Canada would that be a different case, because Canada does not have the sort of cash economy we've heard about in Mexico?",
  "So, what if the fellow says: You know, there are dangerous roads between here and Mexico. I'm hiding the money so that if, you know, a gang comes up they don't find it. And you say: No, we think you're hiding it because it's illegal proceeds? Is that enough to get to the jury?",
  "How many co-sponsors were there?",
  "Why don't you finish your answer?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Schertler. Mr. Beard, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Beard. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument today in Case 07-214, Allison Engine Company versus United States ex rel. Sanders and Thacker. Mr. Olson.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Stewart.",
  "Mr. Stewart, I don't understand that point. Let's say Allison Engine is defrauding Bath, but Bath makes ships for a lot of people, boats, whatever they make. Allison Engine is defrauding, saying these engines, you know, work this way and, in fact, they don't. It doesn't know Bath is going to use some of them in a government ship as opposed to a private ship. So you're saying in that context, since there's no intent to defraud the government, there's no liability?",
  "It just sells them engines. It doesn't know what Bath is going to do with them. They are going to put some in private boats and some in the government boats.",
  "Well, how far down the line? I mean, let's take that hypothetical. The government gives money to the State to build a school. The school has to be painted as part of that, so the school contractor, the prime contractor, takes some of the money from the Federal Government and pays the painter. The painter needs to buy paint. So the painter takes some of the Federal money and pays the paint company. The paint company has to get the chemicals from somebody. So the paint company takes some of the money and pays the chemical company. And at that point, the chemical companies fraudulently added, you know, a dollar on to the cost of the chemicals. So that dollar goes all the way through. So the Government ends up paying a dollar more because of the fraud five, six, seven times down the line. Can an uninterested person bring a qui tam action against the chemical manufacturer because of that fraud?",
  "It's not a presentment requirement. That's in (a)(1. It's that the claim be paid, the fault claim, be paid by the government. And what you're saying is when the government pays the State, that pays the school, that pays the contractor, that pays the paint -- blah, blah, blah -- that that is payment by the government of a false claim because the chemical manufacturer six or seven steps down the line commits fraud.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Helmer.",
  "So your argument - - your understanding of the scope of the statute is exactly the same if the words \"by the government\" were replaced by \"with Federal funds\"? You think those are -- you think the statute is exactly the same if it said \"with Federal funds\" instead of \"by the government\"?",
  "So when the government -- when the phrase \"by the government\" was added -- was it in '86?",
  "There were a lot of statutes that said \"with Federal funds,\" right?",
  "So why did the Congress add the phrase \"by the government\" instead of \"with Federal funds\" if it meant the same thing?",
  "Right. So I guess I get back -- you read \"by the government\" as if it said \"with Federal funds\"?",
  "So if in fact, as you suggest, Allison submitted the certificate to the Navy person at the shipyard, then the question presented in this case is not in fact presented here? Because the question presented assumes that there had not been a submission to the Federal Government of the false - - false claim.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Helmer.",
  "Now, Mr. Olson, four minutes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 07-219, Exxon Shipping Company versus Baker, et al. Mr. Dellinger.",
  "So the shipowner is, I suppose, the owner of Exxon or the hundreds of thousands of shareholders, right? So you have to have a shareholder driving the boat before you can assess liability?",
  "So it's not quite correct to say only the owner. In other words, it is a certain level of employee, because corporations only act through individuals. It is a certain level of employee in the company. Now, where do you draw the line between the CEO and the cabin boy? How do you do that? And I would suspect, just instinctively, that somebody driving one of these huge tankers is a lot closer to the CEO than the cabin boy.",
  "That is only true if you lose on your second and third questions as well, right?",
  "The answers to your second and third questions preclude a new trial?",
  "Well, the City of Milwaukee involved the displacement by Federal statutory law of Federal common law. Your case involves the displacement of Federal maritime law by Federal statutory law. Federal maritime law is routine. Federal courts do that all the time. Federal common law is unusual, and in the City of Milwaukee was resorted to simply by necessity. Doesn't that suggest that whatever the Federal maritime rule on punitive damages is, it's a harder showing on your part to conclude that it's displaced by the statutory process?",
  "Mr. Dellinger, did you say you had a second and a third point?",
  "You going to get to them?",
  "All right.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher.",
  "What if it's the lookout posted -- I don't know if they have one -- but the lookout posted in the front of the ship, and he is drunk, and doesn't see the reef or something? Is the corporation liable in that case?",
  "So you regard the ship as a business unit?",
  "That's different if they say that it's -- depending on how they categorize the different units tells whether they are liable or not?",
  "That was a question that I asked, not a statement. Well, how do you draw the line? I mean, is the second in command on the boat a man responsible for policy?",
  "Mr. Fisher, you - - your friend says in his reply brief that you cannot cite one U.S. maritime case that has allowed vicarious liability for punitive damages. Is this the first one?",
  "What's your best case?",
  "Well, let's take - - take the Ludlow. Mr. Dellinger says that's a case where the court found that the owner is not vicariously liable.",
  "What is your position of how to look at the case if you have a managerial employee who acts contrary to corporate policy? Is the corporation still exposed to punitive damages?",
  "In a case like this.",
  "So what can a corporation do to protect itself against punitive damages awards such as this?",
  "Well, and assume it has a policy that we will hire fit and competent people?",
  "And you're saying - - that's the question I'm asking. What if there is a breach of the corporate policy? I don't see what more a corporation can do. I mean, your --- other than - - other than what? I mean it has to say that the policy is this, and if somebody breaks the policy, they're liable for compensatory damages, which can as this case shows be in the billions of dollars, and of course the individual is liable for punitive and other awards. But what more can the corporation do other than say here is our policies? And try to implement them.",
  "At that level -- at that level, the president, I think you would have an argument that the policy was being changed. It's not clear that that argument works when you're dealing with someone at Mr. Hazelwood's level.",
  "I suppose that would go to how consistently and how effectively the policy is enforced. If the president of the company isn't following the policy it's not going to be taken very seriously. That's different than saying you have a situation where on an episodic and sporadic basis a firm company policy is breached, the individual is breaching the policy.",
  "A while ago you were about to make a point on the Limitation of Liability Act.",
  "A little while ago, you were about to make a point on the Limitation of Liability Act.",
  "But I was -- I would have thought that cuts heavily against you on the third point. In other words, if we're looking to guidance, you look to Federal law. And whether it's directly applicable or not, the Limitation of Liability Act reflects a very strong Federal policy about restricting liability on shipowners, adopted at a time when it was intended to encourage maritime -- the maritime economy. And why isn't that something we should look to, at least under question three?",
  "Well, that means they don't get the really quite extraordinary protection that the limitation of liability gives. It doesn't mean that we should ignore the reflection of that policy outside the confines of the Limitation of Liability Act.",
  "The argument is not that the Limitation of Liability Act should apply. It's that it would be very strange to say, where Congress has radically reduced the exposure of shipowners in one area, that we as a matter of development of Federal common law, Federal maritime law should allow dramatically expanded punitive liability in another area of shipowning liability.",
  "It was a different jury. And the jury is the one that set the amount of punitive damages.",
  "Right.",
  "This is the same judge who approved the instruction that said Hazelwood's negligence and recklessness is automatically imputed to Exxon, right?",
  "So he was operating that under understanding of the law.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fisher. Mr. Dellinger, you have four and a half minutes.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1204, Republic of the Philippines v. Pimentel, et al. Mr. Rothfeld.",
  "Why couldn't -- why couldn't the Philippines, not having been a party in this action, pursued whoever did get the assets from this action - -",
  "-- in normal litigation, if they objected to the resolution.",
  "I guess they weren't there for the adjudication on the merits.",
  "Well, is it -- is it fair to the private claimants here in the United States to say, wait until the Philippine court renders a judgment in favor of the Philippines, and then they can come in and enforce the judgment against Merrill Lynch or whomever is holding the assets?",
  "Well, under the determination of the Philippine court. But the court here could determine that they're the private claimants' assets, as it did.",
  "Well, you just told me that the Philippines court may judge the opposite without the participation of the private claimants.",
  "That seems to me to be an argument on the merits, rather than with respect to which case should proceed first.",
  "Would the private claimants be able to undermine the added force of the judgment in the Philippines, assuming a proceeding is brought here, on the ground that they were not allowed to participate in the proceeding in the Philippines?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, getting back to your previous point, why isn't the Philippine National -- why don't -- why doesn't the Philippine National Bank adequately represent the interest of the Republic? Under Philippine law, as I understand, any recovery by the bank in this case would be the property of the Philippines.",
  "Well, they are - - they're certainly subject to Philippine law, and I understand that there's no dispute that under Philippine law the assets would be taken from the Philippine National Bank for the benefit of the government.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Swift.",
  "So there might be a different situation in your hypothetical with respect to bankruptcy. In effect, there's an administrator against whom the Philippines could proceed, unlike the situation here, where you have a class and which the prospect of the Philippines proceeding later is not realistic.",
  "Because aren't those issues that could be addressed when the Philippines attempt to enforce a judgment they would get in the Philippines if they do in fact get such a judgment?",
  "Counsel, before you sit down, you haven't mentioned anything about your argument that the Philippines don't have the right to raise this. Are you throwing in the towel on that one?",
  "Well, the Philippines National Bank and Arelma were, and of course they've appealed. And I understand the law to be they can raise these arguments. We don't have need to have an independent basis for the Philippines.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld, you have three minutes remaining.",

  "Counsel, how can this -- how can this be part of an adversary proceeding when there's no other adversary on the field? The prosecution's not present. They don't even know anything about this.",
  "Well, in Jackson of course the charges had already been filed by the prosecutor, so there was an adversary on the field.",
  "Well, I suppose -- I suppose you could you have an adversarial proceeding without the prosecutor present, but it would depend on the nature of the proceeding. And here the magistrate simply advises the individual of the charges against him, repeats the Miranda warnings, advises him that he can have counsel if bail is denied or if he can't make bail. What about that is adversarial?",
  "Well, I guess I'll get back to the point I raised earlier, that in Jackson charges had already been filed by a prosecutor. The prosecutor was aware of this proceeding. I think that's a fairly significant distinction.",
  "The two are kind of related. If in fact there's not a right to counsel upon the magistration, but, as you said earlier to Justice Alito, it attaches at the end of the magistration, it seems to me like you're asking for counsel to be an investigator rather than to participate in the trial proceedings.",
  "Why not, if they initiate charges against them? You're saying, in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, you're charged with, for example, trespassing or conducting a demonstration on the court grounds, and that's a crime. You're charged with that, but we are not going to hold you, so, you know, come back in a month.",
  "Before he said no, I don't want an examining trial. As soon as he says that, then he can have one, and you're saying he should have had a lawyer before he said that?",
  "But he could do it; anyone else could do it. And you would say, once he does that, he's made it into a critical proceeding, and so you have to have counsel before he gives up that right?",
  "Well, then -- but then you are saying that he has a right to counsel at the magistration, because that's when the magistrate says: Look, you have an examining trial coming up, and you can waive your right to that.",
  "What does he say about the examining --",
  "What does he say about an examining --",
  "Well, not exactly these facts, because in Jackson the prosecutor had already filed charges.",
  "But the prosecutor wasn't involved here. The prosecutor was involved in Jackson.",
  "Yes. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Coleman.",
  "But it would be a violation of some liberty interest beside the Sixth Amendment.",
  "I mean, the answer -- your answer is that the Sixth Amendment is concerned with the fair trial, not the detention of individuals, and he has other constitutional rights that would be implicated, but his right to a fair trial is not one of them.",
  "Well, couldn't he point out -- I mean, if this is a probable cause determination and he knows a particular fact, couldn't he say, well, Magistrate, you should know this, and the magistrate would say, well, I didn't know that, so there's no probable cause?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Spinelli, you have three minutes.",
  "So Texas would be better off if they didn't have a magistration proceeding at all, if they didn't have a proceeding to alert the individual of the charges against him; they did not have a proceeding to read him his rights; they did not have a determination of probable cause. They would be better off if they didn't do any of that?",
  "Well, what's in it for the State to provide this additional layer? Because, of course, the person gets Miranda warnings when he is arrested. And so why -- why should the State do this?",
  "Why don't you take an extra minute? We have eaten up your rebuttal time.",
  "Thank you, Counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument today in Case 07-290, District of Columbia versus Heller. Mr. Dellinger.",
  "If you're right, Mr. Dellinger, it's certainly an odd way in the Second Amendment to phrase the operative provision. If it is limited to State militias, why would they say \"the right of the people\"? In other words, why wouldn't they say \"state militias have the right to keep arms\"?",
  "But if that's right, doesn't that cut against you? If the militia included all the people, doesn't the preamble that you rely on not really restrict the right much at all? It includes all the people.",
  "Well, that may be true, but that concedes your main point that there is an individual right and gets to the separate question of whether the regulations at issue here are reasonable.",
  "Well, but your reading of the militia clause, the militia clause specifically reserves concern rights to the States by its terms. And as I understand your reading, you would be saying the Second Amendment was designed to take away or expand upon the rights that are reserved, rather than simply guaranteeing what rights were understood to be implicit in the Constitution itself.",
  "Well, the militia clause, Article I, Section 8, says certain rights are reserved to the States with respect to the militia. And yet you're telling us now that this was a very important right that ensured that they kept arms, but it wasn't listed in the rights that were reserved in the militia clause.",
  "What is -- what is reasonable about a total ban on possession?",
  "So if you have a law that prohibits the possession of books, it's all right if you allow the possession of newspapers?",
  "The regulation - - the regulation at issue here is not one that goes to the number of guns. It goes to the specific type. And I understood your argument to be in your brief that because rifles and shotguns are not banned to the staple extent as handguns, it's all right to ban handguns.",
  "Well, I'm not sure that it's accurate to say the opinion below allowed those. The law that the opinion, the court below, was confronted with was a total ban, so that was the only law they considered. If the District passes a ban on machine guns or whatever, then that law -- that law would be considered by the court and perhaps would be upheld as reasonable. But the only law they had before them was a total ban.",
  "Are you allowed to carry the weapons that are allowed? I read the \"carry clause\" to apply without qualification. So while you say you might be able to have a shotgun in the home, you can't carry it to get there.",
  "Why don't you remain, Mr. Dellinger. We'll make sure you have rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dellinger. General Clement.",
  "Well, these various phrases under the different standards that are proposed, \"compelling interest,\" \"significant interest,\" \"narrowly tailored,\" none of them appear in the Constitution; and I wonder why in this case we have to articulate an all-encompassing standard. Isn't it enough to determine the scope of the existing right that the amendment refers to, look at the various regulations that were available at the time, including you can't take the gun to the marketplace and all that, and determine how these -- how this restriction and the scope of this right looks in relation to those? I'm not sure why we have to articulate some very intricate standard. I mean, these standards that apply in the First Amendment just kind of developed over the years as sort of baggage that the First Amendment picked up. But I don't know why when we are starting afresh, we would try to articulate a whole standard that would apply in every case?",
  "But this law didn't involve a restriction on machine guns. It involved an absolute ban. It involved an absolute carry prohibition. Why would you think that the opinion striking down an absolute ban would also apply to a narrow one -- narrower one directed solely to machine guns?",
  "Thank you, General.",
  "Mr. Gura.",
  "So a conscientious objector who likes to hunt deer for food, you would say, has no rights under the Second Amendment. He is not going to be part of the militia. He is not going to be part of the common defense, but he still wants to bear arms. You would say that he doesn't have any rights under this amendment?",
  "Is there any parallel - -",
  "Is there any parallel at the time that the amendment was adopted to the machine gun? In other words, I understand your point to be that, although that's useful in modern military service, it's not something civilians possess. Was there anything like that at the time of the adoption, or were the civilian arms exactly the same as the ones you'd use in the military?",
  "Why isn't the trigger-lock provisions that are at issue here, why aren't they similar to the various provisions that Justice Breyer mentioned like the gunpowder restriction? In other words, for reasons of domestic safety, they said you can't store the gunpowder anywhere but on the top floor. Why isn't the modern trigger-lock provision similar to those?",
  "Well, there is always a risk that the children will get up and grab the firearm and use it for some purpose other than what the Second Amendment was designed to protect.",
  "Well, right. But, I mean, you don't necessarily expect a young child to be able to reassemble the pistol.",
  "What about -- what about age limits -- you've got to be over 18 or you've got to be over 21 to get a license?",
  "Is the age limit necessarily the same nationwide? Maybe 16 in Wyoming makes more sense but 21 in the District.",
  "-- you would define \"reasonable\" in light of the restrictions that existed at the time the amendment was adopted.",
  "You know, you can't take it into the marketplace was one restriction. So that would be -- we are talking about lineal descendents of the arms but presumably there are lineal descendents of the restrictions as well.",
  "Thank you, Gura. Mr. Dellinger, 10 minutes.",
  "Well, before you start with it, how many minutes does it take to remove a trigger lock and load a gun? Because both the gun has to be unloaded; it has to have a trigger lock under the District laws.",
  "No, disassembled - -",
  "In either case it has to be unloaded, correct?",
  "Well, the law, as I understand it, says that the gun has to be unloaded. So under your hypothetical, I assume that would violate the District's law if the gun is still loaded.",
  "So how long does it take? If your interpretation is correct, how long does it take to remove the trigger lock and make the gun operable.",
  "Is it like that? Is it a numerical code?",
  "So then you turn on the lamp, you pick up your reading glasses - -",
  "It may not matter, but I'd like some idea about how long it takes.",
  "Well, if proportionate, in other words you're saying your interest is allowing self-defense in the home - -",
  "Does it really make sense to say the best self-defense arm is a rifle, as opposed to a pistol?",
  "It's a related point. Do you understand the ban -- the carry ban to apply if you carry the firearm from one room in the house to another?",
  "Why is the -- why is the D.C. law phrased in those terms? In other words, if you can't have a handgun at all, why do you have a separate provision saying that you can't carry it anywhere?",
  "Why isn't that covered by the provision that you have the right to keep arms?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dellinger. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1717, Richlin Security Service versus Chertoff. Mr. Wolfman.",
  "I'm sorry. Is your point there that most associates are billed at less than $125 an hour?",
  "Too much money proportionally.",
  "Okay.",
  "I'm sorry. \"Traditionally subsumed in the lawyer's rate,\" are you suggesting, when this statute was passed, they weren't billed separately to the client?",
  "But that's -- I saw that analysis. This Act only applies when the government's position is not substantially justified. People are not going to structure their billing arrangements assuming the government's position is not even going to be substantially justified.",
  "That point makes some assumptions about the relative abilities, say, of junior associates and senior paralegals, and I'm not sure are well founded.",
  "Is that pertinent - - is that pertinent on the cap questions we've been discussing too? I mean, if you're representing a disabled veteran, is the lawyer typically charging more than $125 an hour?",
  "And of course they may mean -- may have meant costs to the client.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Yang.",
  "You say the relevant one was of course on a legislation that wasn't passed, right?",
  "Well and it might be quite different for private practitioner. Your benefits for health care will probably cost you a lot less than private practice and doesn't that make the paralegal fees quite different than the other items of expenses that are listed? You know, expert witnesses, you get a bill, that's how much it costs the lawyer. Studies, analysis, engineering reports, you don't have to figure overhead benefits with respect to any of those. All of a sudden you throw in another item, paralegal costs, you put those under costs, and now you've got to go through this elaborate calculation that is going to be not worth it, almost, for a typical firm representing a small client.",
  "Well, in most firms an engineering report would be outside the - -",
  "Well, but that wasn't Justice Kennedy's question. His was the outsourced paralegal is better at a particular task.",
  "Counsel, your - - this question only arises when the position of your client was not substantially justified. Now under those -- and it was designed, to some extent, to penalize you because -- because of that fact. Why should we adopt a construction that, in effect, penalizes the client who has had to face the Federal Government when the Federal Government's position was not substantially justified? They are going to have to pay the paralegal fees at market rates, but they are only goes to get compensation at cost.",
  "It's kind of a stretch to suggest in a situation where they pass a law that only applies to individuals or small businesses where they put a cap in and so on, that another way that we are going to prevent damage to the fisc was to treat paralegal expenses as costs rather than at market rate. I suspect that was not foremost in their mind.",
  "Well, it assumes that when they said \"costs,\" that they meant costs to the firm as opposed to costs to the client. And that, I think, is entirely an open question.",
  "Not to belabor the point it meant that the people who drafted the Senate report may have meant that.",
  "Do we know what the President's view was on that question when he signed the legislation into law, which is what he was required to do before it became law and which he did not do under the prior bill?",
  "Well, maybe this is the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I haven't - - I didn't grasp the answer. Under your system it would make sense for lawyers to charge separately for photocopy services, telephone services, so on because then they are not going to be subject to the attorney fee cap. And they may think, look, the difference between cost and market rate is relatively small; the difference between our hourly rate and $125 is large.",
  "Well, I'm just saying if we adopt your position, isn't it going to be, I guess, worse for your client because firms will, as I've been told firms sometimes do, charge separately for things at a higher rate than their cost? They will charge higher rate for photocopy services because they try to factor into it overhead and things like than cost.",
  "Well, I would say - - I would say that it's now traditional for firms to charge, say, more for their photocopy services than it cost them.",
  "Well, I think you missed my point. It was even if you're right, 50 cents and they can only charge 15 cents, they have an incentive to separately charge for photocopying, because they get the 15 cents, and otherwise it's going to - - they are going to lose it over the cap if you say no that's part of the attorney's fees.",
  "Counsel, there are occasions, aren't there, when the government is entitled to attorney's fees?",
  "Do you know how you bill paralegal times -- time in those situations?",
  "You often don't bill them separately.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Yang. Mr. Wolfman, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Well, but I think Justice Breyer is correct, isn't he, that there was no reason for the Senate to sort of redo a report that they had already done on a bill that was substantially identical?",
  "There was no Senate report because they had done it just the previous year.",
  "Thank you, Counsel, the case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 06-939, Chamber of Commerce versus Brown. Mr. Goldsmith.",
  "Well - -",
  "That's not the State's fault.",
  "Well, they can do business with other entities beside the State.",
  "Thank you, counsel. You've got a friend on the other side still.",
  "Mr. Hungar.",
  "What about the spending clause question? You -- the Federal Government has a lot of programs where they use their own money and they come with a lot of conditions, and you -- your office frequently argues that those are justified under the spending clause. Why isn't what California is doing here similarly justified?",
  "How do we tell whether they are using their spending power to regulate as opposed to simply attaching conditions to what's done with State funds?",
  "On a case like Rust versus Sullivan, is the Federal Government acting to promote policy, or is it simply acting in a proprietary capacity?",
  "I'm talking about spending power versus regulatory power in general.",
  "Well, give me an example of a spending clause provision that would be acceptable, not necessarily in this context, but in general, because you would say, well, that's not trying to implement a policy at all.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hungar. Mr. Gottesman.",
  "Well, so was anyone who hired a company to do any kind of work, right? Because the Federal policy meant that they couldn't try to restrict what activities the company engaged in with respect to union organizing.",
  "No, that's not quite accurate. They moved for summary judgment on the ground that what the State was doing was in effect regulating labor relations - -",
  "-- and that that activity was pre-empted.",
  "No, but the policy -- the policy is they don't want employers to talk about unionization.",
  "How is that -- how is that different from saying there's a Federal rule, an OSHA requirement you've got to have certain protective devices or whatever, and the State says, well, we want to get the most out of our money, so our money cannot be used to put in these federally required safety devices; you can use somebody else's money for that. Why isn't that the same thing here? You're saying there's a Federal labor policy that allows this, and we don't want our money to be spent implementing that policy or pursuant to that policy.",
  "Why - -",
  "You're saying it doesn't give favoritism to one side or another?",
  "So that depends, as a practical matter, on the view that there are at least some employers who would be arguing in favor of unionization?",
  "Yes, but my point is that there are precious few who argue in favor of it.",
  "What if there is a warranty for another year, say if these tables break you have to replace them?",
  "I want to get back to your responses on the procedural costs of the case. You said we don't know what the regulatory burden would be with respect to accounting rules.",
  "Does it make any difference if the argument is which is what I understood it to be, that you can't regulate at all? It's not simply that you can't regulate so long as it's particularly burdensome, but you don't have the authority to regulate in this at all.",
  "That gets to the - -",
  "That gets to the spending clause question. We're not -- I mean, we can address that without deciding whether the regulations are particularly burdensome. You were saying well, the accounting is not a big problem.",
  "But it doesn't mean that it's necessarily spending as opposed to regulation.",
  "That doesn't seem to me to be responsive to my question. Your point was well, we don't know how burdensome a particular regulation is. If you lose on the question of whether it's spending or regulation, we don't have to wait to see how burdensome it is if we think you're not entitled to regulate at all.",
  "You're getting back to the spending question.",
  "I'm putting that aside.",
  "Regardless of whether -- regardless of whether it's burdensome regulation.",
  "If it's regulation why isn't that appropriate to deal with on summary judgment. Not the spending question we have -- that's a different issue. But if there is no difference with respect to regulation whether it's burdensome or not, so we don't have to have further proceedings on whether it's burdensome.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Goldsmith, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "What about the Lyng case that Mr. Gottesman cited in response to that argument?",
  "Well, Lyng said that the -- that Congress was being neutral not that it was making a choice on how to spend its funds. And I understood Mr. Gottesman's point to be that so too, here, California is being neutral.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Goldsmith. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-11429, Burgess versus United States. Mr. Fisher.",
  "Well, but if the rule of lenity depends upon of course some ambiguity in the term, the definition says \"'felony drug offense' means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year.\" It doesn't say anything about State classification.",
  "Well, obviously one is a definition of \"felony\" and the other is the definition of \"felony drug offense\" and the term that's at issue here is \"felony drug offense.\"",
  "Just on that -- just on that last one, are you saying that if it doesn't say \"debtor's residential structure,\" you'd think it was somebody else's residential structure?",
  "I don't understand the point.",
  "Well, in a provision of the Bankruptcy Code that deals with debtors I don't think there's any question about whose residential structure they would be talking about, even though they don't repeat \"debtor.\" It strikes me as quite different than the provision we have before us today.",
  "If it's such a vexing problem, why would Congress have incorporated the problem into the definition of \"felony drug offense\"?",
  "Well, you seem to suggest that it's a vexing problem that \"felony\" is defined differently in different States. And, yet, you say that the term \"felony,\" which relies on how it's defined by different States, was incorporated in the felony drug offense, which seems to have a quite clear definition of punishable by more than one year. If they don't want to repeat the problem that \"felony\" is defined differently in different States, they would not do what you're suggesting, which is incorporate it wholesale into the latter definition.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Is \"drug\" a nested term in that? It doesn't really define \"drug.\" Do they look somewhere else for that definition?",
  "Is there a place you would -- is that a place you would look if you didn't know what they meant by \"drug\"? If an issue arose whether, you know, a natural narcotic, I mean is that a drug or not?",
  "So that is nested in this definition, \"felony drug offense\"?",
  "What do you do with your friend's argument that the classification -- or the term, more than one year or less than one year, doesn't always have to do with how serious they view the offense, but they may impose a sentence of more than one year to allow time for rehabilitation?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Saharsky. Mr. Fisher, you have four minutes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fisher. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 07-308, United States versus Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Company. Mr. Jay.",
  "Could the IRS say that the statute -- or Congress, I guess, say the statute of limitations is one month?",
  "Yes, and anything after that, any constitutional violation after that, is just not remediable?",
  "Five weeks before.",
  "We're talking about -- we're talking about the Constitution here. And in effect -- I mean, I assume I could run through the usual routine. I mean, you wouldn't say they could have a statute of limitations of two days, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Millett.",
  "So why do you -- I take it, though, that you concede the six-year statute of limitations under the Tucker Act, right? I mean, your brief says this is an unbending and unqualified prohibition on the use of exports except up to -- if it's before six years and one day. You are taking an adamant position with respect to three years but you give up six years.",
  "So -- so, the rhetoric in your brief how this is a constitutionally based prohibition is not pertinent? You're saying if the statute was clear and it said three years, that would be fine, even though it's a claim under the Export Clause?",
  "Plus you get interest.",
  "You give all of this up when it comes to the statute of limitations. I mean, the government's argument could be just as implausible as you suggested it is here. But if it involves a claim six years and one day out, it's just too bad. It doesn't matter that it's a constitutional claim. It doesn't matter how erroneous the government's position was, because the government can impose limitations like that even on the assertion of constitutional claims. That's all they are doing here.",
  "We say just as unanimously a couple of things last year on -- term as well in Jencks and certainly the Federal circuit's decision wouldn't have come out the same if they had had Hinck's term of trust on the books.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Millett. Mr. Jay, you have 15 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted. We'll hear the third case beginning this afternoon.",
  "We will hear argument next in Riley, Governor of Alabama, versus Kennedy. Mr. Newsom.",
  "It's pretty hard to argue something wasn't in force and effect when they have an election under it, isn't it?",
  "So if the circuit court had gotten the State law right, then there never would have been an election?",
  "Now, counsel, since you mentioned section 5, perhaps you ought to look at it. It says that you have to preclear standards, practices, whatever, different from that in force or effect on November 1st, 1964. Now, the Respondents in their brief accused you of making the argument that since this isn't different from what was in effect in 1964 you don't have to preclear it. And you said, no, that's not what we're saying; we take no position on that. Why in the world did you say that? It says quite clearly the standard has to be different from that in force or effect on November 1st, '64. At that point these people were appointed.",
  "Well, in your reply brief on page 8 you say you take no position on that question.",
  "Well, there wouldn't be a different baseline for judicial changes than there would be for legislative or executive changes, would there?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Newsom. Ms. Karlan.",
  "Why did Alabama have to preclear anything? On November 1st, 1964, this was an appointed position. This is not a change from what was, quote, \"in force or effect\" on November 1st, 1964.",
  "Oh, no, no. Those decisions are all dicta.",
  "So something else changed - -",
  "-- whether they are membership elections or at-large elections.",
  "The argument you made in your brief was that this was already decided in Reno versus Bossier Parish. I didn't see the - -",
  "Is the argument that this was not, in fact, a change in your brief?",
  "No. They had the argument -- you at least thought they did - -",
  "You quote in your brief Reno versus Bossier Parish and one other case. I'm thinking of one other.",
  "Yes. And you raised the argument -- you criticized them for raising this argument; that this wasn't any different; but you did not say that it wasn't any different.",
  "I think you're quite right on the DOJ regulations and the House report, but I just don't see how that squares with the statutory language.",
  "So because we've ignored the text in other areas, we should just forget about it here?",
  "I thought that - - they ratified -- these cases were ratified by Congress, but Congress did not change the language in the statute.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Karlan. Mr. Shanmugan.",
  "What if the district court -- circuit court I guess it is in Alabama. This action is filed before the election and the circuit court says: You may have a successful claim here, but I'm not going to disrupt the election, there isn't time; so this election can go forward and during that period I'll be considering the law. We do that all the time, or three-judge district courts do, saying we're going to look at this question, but we don't have time to stop the election so it's going to go forward. In that case, would that lead to the same result?",
  "Well, sure, but not always. You know, if it's a week before the election or something, even if they think it's a serious claim, they sometimes say: We're going to allow the election to go forward because we're going to look at this and perhaps the State Supreme Court has to look at it, and we don't want to hold up the election.",
  "Counsel, you talk about force and effect. Of course, the statute says \"force or effect on November 1st, 1964.\" Do you have anything to add to Ms. Karlan's response on my quaint fixation on the language of the statute?",
  "Well, that can't tie our hands in properly interpreting the statute.",
  "I don't see how - - regardless of how consistent the interpretation is, how can you read \"November 1st, 1964,\" to mean anything other than that date?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Newsom, four minutes.",

  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1666, and the consolidated Case 07-394, Munaf versus Geren, Secretary of the Army, and Geren versus Omar. Mr. Garre.",
  "So once again you're relying on a concurring opinion by Justice Douglas?",
  "And I suppose if he were -- it would make a huge difference whether such an individual were released in the United States as opposed to being released in Iraq.",
  "Is there a limit to your proposition? In other words, let's stipulate that the individuals are going to be released in a situation where you know that they won't receive anything resembling due process and will be subject to abuse. What happens in that case?",
  "And do you agree that -- do you concede that habeas is concerned with the safety of the individual as opposed to his custody?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Margulies?",
  "Did General MacArthur have effective jurisdiction and control in Japan?",
  "So a habeas court here has to look at all those different factors and come to a determination of whether it has jurisdiction? There's no bright line? It has to look at whether hostilities have ceased or haven't ceased? It's got to look at how far the prisoners have been removed from the zone of hostility?",
  "So what is the bright line that determines whether there's habeas jurisdiction or not?",
  "So the control in the middle of a zone of hostilities of a foreign national allows -- creates habeas jurisdiction? That's your bright line?",
  "Well, then it's not just control. It looks to citizenship, which brings up the questions Justice Stevens was raising.",
  "So that's pretty far removed from the bright line. I mean, now you've got to decide whether it's in the zone of hostilities or not. You've got to decide if this is within the time period that the Court should not exercise jurisdiction or not. And what's going to happen, of course, is that the district court is going to look at this and say, I can't decide all of that right away. Let's enter an injunction, a preliminary injunction such as at issue here, while I decide these questions. And that's going to have the effect of intruding quite extensively on the exercise of executive authority.",
  "Let me try and move you to the merits.",
  "I had thought that the historic purpose of the Great Writ was to challenge custody. And it seems to me that the last thing your clients want in this case is to be released.",
  "You don't want the district court to say you win, you can be released tomorrow at noon.",
  "Well, I thought you wanted to block the transfer. I mean, the Iraqi authorities can pick him up at the gate.",
  "I thought the relief that was awarded by the district court also enjoined prosecution.",
  "You want -- I'm sorry. I just want to make sure I understand. You want the relief in both of these cases to be, okay, we will release him tomorrow at noon? And by the way, we're going to notify the Iraqi authorities because we think we're releasing a dangerous criminal and want to make sure they have the opportunity to do whatever they want?",
  "And don't tell - -",
  "And don't tell the Iraqis where that's going to be?",
  "Well, that's within the executive's discretion. I want to know if you are saying that the district court in this case can require the custodian not simply to release the person, but to release them somewhere else and to keep the point at which they're going to release someone whose been determined by the MNF-I tribunal to be a dangerous criminal, to keep the point of his release secret from the Iraqi government.",
  "Okay. Now the determination that the transfer would be unlawful, I - - again, I get back -- maybe I'm repeating myself. I have always understood habeas to be concerned with custody, rather than this broad range of determinations about what's lawful and unlawful, other than as are necessary to rule on the question of custody. In other words, of course, if there's been a Fourth Amendment violation, you bring a habeas action, you determine whether the custody is lawful or not. Here you want a determination whether the transfer is unlawful or not.",
  "Whether it does or does not, I just question whether habeas is an appropriate remedy in that situation, again because it's not concerned with the legality of transfer; it's concerned with the legality of custody.",
  "So if you had filed it -- if you had filed it six months rather than a year after, would there be habeas jurisdiction.",
  "You see where I'm going. Three months?",
  "The bright line is getting awfully fuzzy, as far as I'm concerned.",
  "Mr. Margulies, let me make sure there are no other questions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Margulies.",
  "Mr. Garre, seven minutes.",
  "The the 20,000-plus people being retained, are they all in connection with security threats? Or do they involve what I guess we could call common criminals?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Garre. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 07-455, United States versus Ressam. General Mukasey.",
  "Your argument relies on the notion that the word \"during\" in the statute is solely temporal. In other words, it just refers to the time?",
  "So -- that's not always the case. If I say, you know, I hung lights during the holiday season, you wouldn't think that I hung a chandelier, right? There'd be not simply a temporal connection, but also a relation.",
  "Why is there in the statutes a difference between possession of explosives in this circumstance and possession of firearms?",
  "Is there any --­",
  "Is there any policy limitation within the department not to charge under this provision unless there is a relationship between the underlying felony and the use of -- the carrying of explosives?",
  "The ten years, though, is mandatory, correct?",
  "So if a prosecutor asks for it and there is an underlying felony and there is an explosive, that's an additional ten years, no matter what.",
  "So if you get -- the underlying felony is of the sort Justice Scalia was talking about, and let's say the person gets probation on that because, you know, it is the first offense, no harm, he still gets ten years.",
  "Well, but how many cases are there likely to be -- this isn't one of them -- where you have no \"in relation to\" connection whatsoever?",
  "Or any historical record that you're familiar with.",
  "I mean, in this case, as you point out, there was, of course, a connection. And I would have thought in most cases where the prosecutor is interested in charging -­ because, as you have indicated, this case is -- there would be an actual connection. Now, you may have, as you suggest, problems with proof or -- or evidence; but, as a practical matter, I'm just wondering how often the question we're concerned about arises.",
  "But I mean the interesting thing is that you're -- the cases where this is going to arise is not where you're really worried about the explosives; it's going to -- because in that case, presumably there is going to be a relation, and you can use it as you used it in this case. The cases where this is going to be problematic is when you are really interested in the underlying felony.",
  "You know, the guy who's driving in his car and calls his broker and is guilty of insider trading and has some firecrackers in the trunk, you're not worried about the firecrackers, but you want to crack down on the insider trading.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Attorney General. Mr. Hillier.",
  "Well, but just -­ just as \"during\" has more than temporal -- can have more than temporal significance, I think \"in\" can have temporal significance.",
  "We write \"in the holiday season.\"",
  "I assume -- I haven't looked at the dictionary -- but \"during's\" first relationship -- first definition, I suspect, is temporal.",
  "Your friend indicated that this issue doesn't come up very often as a practical matter. Do you disagree with that?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Attorney General, you have 14 minutes remaining.",
  "Counsel, could I ask you, do you have an answer to your friend's point about the \"in which\" language?",
  "I understood his point to be that it's surprising that they refer to use of the explosives or carrying of the explosives with reference to the underlying felony, \"in which\" the -­ suggests that the explosive was used or carried with respect to the underlying felony. And I understood your position to be that it doesn't have to be.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Attorney General. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-208, Indiana versus Edwards. Mr. Fisher.",
  "What would happen if you started out with pro se representation and then the trial turned into a farce? Start over again, but he would have to accept counsel at that point?",
  "So your standard of coherent communication, you would not require the defendant, for example, to understand the hearsay rule, or other things of that sort?",
  "Well, even if you don't, I mean, how is he going to effectively participate in the trial? Does he have to know, for example, that he has the right and understand that he has the right to cross-examine witnesses?",
  "What if he -- what if he wants to communicate not self-defense, but that, you know, Martians did it? Is he -- and he can coherently communicate that. There won't be any doubt on the judge's part or the jury that he thinks Martians did it? Would that qualify?",
  "Well, I mean, I'm trying to find some level that is above competency. I mean, there are people who believe in Martians, but above competence to stand trial, but also that would still be coherently communicated, but would show that it's a ridiculous defense that's not going to be effective in representing himself.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Mr. Stancil.",
  "Do you argue that the State has no interest to be considered in this calculus? In other words, it is solely the interest of the defendant in representing himself and that the State has no interest in ensuring a credible process?",
  "Well, but an individual doesn't have to know and appreciate the rules of courtroom procedure to be judged competent to stand trial.",
  "Well, but that's suggesting to me that you give no weight to the State interest. In other words, so long as he's held to those rules, that's basing your determination solely on his interest and no weight given to the State's interest in ensuring that you have a trial where people are observing the rules.",
  "Can I ask the -- it's really the flip side of the question Justice Scalia asked. Why shouldn't we be concerned that if you have the same standard that trial courts are going to elevate the competency showing beyond what really is required? In other words, if they have to have the same standard, they don't want a proceeding where you've got someone who -- you know, whatever the standard is - - is not going to be as competent or reasonably represented as he would by a lawyer, so they're more likely to find the person incompetent to stand trial in the first place? These are addressed to two different, entirely different questions. And rather than having a problem with merging the standards which results in one of them being cheated, why don't we have two different standards?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well then, why don't they have the choice of elevating the standard for ability to represent themselves in a coherent way at trial?",
  "That's what understood Godinez to say, that you certainly don't have to elevate your standard, but I didn't understand it to say you can't.",
  "Well, it actually doesn't say that.",
  "It seems to me that both sides are kind of raising these, taking the arguments to extremes and they don't have to do that. If you -- if you accept the fact that there can be a higher standard than competency to stand trial, that doesn't mean that the judge can say you can't make the decision if you have tattoos.",
  "Well, but you're putting a heavy burden on the State to say, all right, now -- and the prosecution -- to say, now we've got to look out for what this guy is going to say, and now we've got to appoint standby counsel. And I'm not sure how your response deals with the guy who says: I was indicted for 93 counts because it's 1993. I mean, is the prosecutor supposed to stand up then and say: Objection, that's ridiculous?",
  "Yes, that the State has to incur these extra burdens?",

  "Well, why does there have to be -- there has to be a filing for bankruptcy before you get a plan confirmed, but I didn't understand that to be the threshold before -- what does that mean, there has to be a filing for bankruptcy? That the confirmation of the plan can't go back before that?",
  "It goes back before then in a lot of cases to look for preferential transfers and things like that.",
  "I thought your answer to Justice Breyer was saying there's another key event and that's the filing of the petition for bankruptcy.",
  "Counsel, I'm not sure I understand the practical consequences of your position. I assume that if you're right, people who have an interest in buying the bankrupt business will wait or have to wait until after confirmation of the plan, because the tax liability is going to save them a lot of money. Is it going to work in that case?",
  "I mean, will the effect of your plan be that it will discourage people who come along and want to buy a bankrupt business?",
  "I don't understand why this is a big deal. Assuming that was news to me, that this only arises after the filing of a bankruptcy petition, and you are looking forward to confirmation of the plan, this tax only applies at the transfer of title. Why don't you just get your deal together and just say, well, the closing is going to be the day after confirmation of the bankruptcy plan?",
  "And that's when you transfer title, and that's when you have to pay the stamp tax.",
  "How long does it typically take from the filing of the petition to confirmation of the bankruptcy plan?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Brunstad.",
  "Is it often the case -- and I don't know, but is it often the case that the people who are engaged in one these asset purchases are, in fact, the creditors themselves? In other words, they are owed a lot of money and said, well, let's - - basically, let's take over the business and run it ourselves?",
  "Well, I assume that the creditors have an interest in that as well. I don't know how -- I mean, they are the ones who could move quickly to get the confirmation of the plan, because they are the ones whose interests have to be addressed before the plan can be confirmed. So wouldn't they have an interest in the melting bananas, or whatever?",
  "I understand your arguments about the desirability. How do you squeeze it into the statutory language?",
  "Under a plan and you're suggesting that it's under the plan before there is a plan.",
  "Your argument there is that \"under a plan confirmed\" means something different than \"under a confirmed plan\"?",
  "Do you -- do you agree with the proposition that you only go back so far as the filing of the petition? Well, what in your argument suggests that that's a logical stopping point? It seems to me that if you don't take the date of confirmation, I don't know why all of your policy arguments wouldn't cause you to go back further.",
  "Yes, but we've already shown a willingness to abandon that type of limitation with \"under a plan confirmed.\" So, you know, the consideration of the prior transfer is going to take place in the context of a bankruptcy case.",
  "How do you know whether to pay the tax or not? I mean, you know that the bankruptcy petition has been filed, but you really don't know whether there's going to be a plan confirmed under Chapter 11. How do you know whether to pay or not?",
  "I assume there are penalties if you don't pay on time.",
  "But this doesn't happen for some time down the road, right?",

  "Counsel, what - - would your position be different if the county were, in fact, injured; we didn't have the zero-percent situation but different percentages? Your client would not be able to sue them, right?",
  "Well, what does that do to your statutory argument? In other words under your statutory argument, you still could sue; but because of other considerations you can't?",
  "Well, what happens -- what happens if some of the bids were more than zero, and some weren't? You get to sue for part of the damages, and the county gets to sue for the rest? Or how do you divvy that up?",
  "Well, but I suppose since we are talking about a rotational rule, you could have -- what are these, monthly or annually -- one, possibly, cycle where it's all zero percent, and then others where it isn't, and then another where it is. And that would affect the rotation in a way that would injure your client but would also injure the county.",
  "I suppose that every other bidder in this situation is a viable plaintiff.",
  "Well, I suppose in other cases where if we adopt the rule you argue for, that wouldn't be confined at all. For example, in a situation where a competitor is defrauding a supplier, every competitor no matter how many there were, could bring a RICO action.",

  "Well, what is a tribe supposed to do? Let's say there is a gas station on the reservation. The tribe has a tax. Anybody doing business -- it's, you know, 1 percent of gross proceeds. And at the end of the year the gas station owner says, well, I'm just not going to pay it. What do they do then?",
  "So you think there would be -- there would be tribal-court jurisdiction in the case I hypothesized?",
  "So your case, your entire case, is based on whether or not there's consent to dealing with the tribe by the nonmember?",
  "Well, your clients could they fully protect themselves. What if the tribe sought to enforce tribal law against them, can they bring that claim in State court?",
  "Right. Well, just like this and there was a choice of forum provision, says, well, you've got to bring this in State court. I thought there were restrictions on whether or not tribal law can be enforced in State courts.",
  "Even if it -- well, that's if it's a contract claim. What if it's a discrimination or Indian common law claim arising out of the contractual relationship?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Frederick.",
  "Where do I look that up in tribal law?",
  "I'm sorry; I don't understand. I'm looking at joint appendix 191 to 192. You have special interrogatories, including number 6 but also number 4 and then they have damages. And it's not clear whether those damages are based on the finding of liability under 4 or 6.",
  "Who wrote that? You gave us the benefit of the author of the Ninth Circuit, but not the First.",
  "And, presumably, tribal -- whatever tribal precedent there may be, as well.",
  "Well, neither could -- and neither could anybody, right? I mean if anybody could find it, you could. It's because it's not published anywhere, right?",
  "One of the points you mentioned earlier is that this is an Indian corporation, and that's a concept I don't understand. If Justices Scalia and Alito form a corporation, is that an Italian corporation?",
  "I understand the concept of a minority-owned or an Indian-owned corporation, but the point here is you are trying to say that the corporation is a member of the tribe. And I just don't know. And I certainly don't think the State, when it incorporated this entity, said: You're a different type of corporation than every other; you're an Indian corporation.",
  "How would a normal -- I guess a non-Indian or non-Italian or non-Irish - - corporation dealing with the Long Family Land and Cattle Company know that it was an Indian corporation - -",
  "-- putting apart the particulars in this case?",
  "Well, I know the BIA says that. But if you're a bank and somebody comes in and says: I'm a corporation; I would like a loan, is the bank supposed to start asking questions about whether there are Indian shareholders, and how many, and all of that?",
  "So they should have a check box on their loan application that says: Are you an Indian?",
  "I'm asking you about: In a general case, let's say they don't require BIA loan guarantees. They require, just as in this case, collateral.",
  "Well, I am sure the facts here matter. I have a hypothetical question. A bank dealing with an Indian-owned corporation, how are they supposed to find out, or may they find out, whether it's an Indian-owned corporation, particularly when under your approach, when they do form that contract, they are subjecting themselves to tribal-court jurisdiction?",
  "And do they subject themselves to tribal-court jurisdiction because they are dealing with, as you call it, an Indian corporation?",
  "So that if the bank had two -- two different types of loans, in one situation the corporation comes to the bank. It is an Indian corporation, if there is such a thing; and the bank deals with it, although it doesn't know that. In the other situation are the facts, as you suggest here; and the -- dealing through the normal, collateral consequences and operations of a contract with a bank, they want to know the collateral, and all of that, that constitutes consent, but a commercial relationship with a member does not.",
  "It's an odd sort of basis on which to predicate jurisdiction. We usually - - when you're dealing with jurisdiction, we usually look for a bright-line rule.",
  "You said earlier - - I am sorry. You said earlier that this was a straightforward application of Montana?",
  "Yes, given the facts. But isn't it true that this would be the first case in which we have asserted or allowed Indian tribal jurisdiction to be asserted over a nonmember?",
  "What about -- what about their point that, under our system, governing is based on the consent of the governed, and in this case the bank has no role to play in the nature or establishment of the court to which they are being subjected?",
  "Well, what if the tribal law has certain cultural principles such as fairness and equity of a sort that aren't recognized under Federal or State law in this type of contractual relationship? Does that preclude the State court from giving comity or not?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Gannon.",
  "Well, you agree with your friend Mr. Frederick that Montana did not address jurisdiction over a nonmember and that this would be the first case in which we'd recognize such jurisdiction?",
  "What happens if the bank deals with a corporation that is not an Indian corporation, and then that -- the shareholders of that corporation sell their shares to Indians?",
  "Does the bank now have a consensual relationship with an Indian corporation?",
  "Well, but the only reason -- the only reason the bank is on the reservation is because the land was collateral, right?",
  "They didn't want to buy land on a reservation; they wanted to make a loan and get the interest or whatever, and it just turned out that the Indians defaulted, and therefore they were left with a land on a reservation. Is that consensual?",
  "So if it's a different -- the Indian -- the corporation is owned by members on the reservation, the collateral they put up is off the reservation, is there consensual dealings with the corporation then?",
  "Yes, but the subject of the contract is loan to a corporation owned by Indians on the reservation. The collateral put up is other land that the corporation owns or the individuals own off the reservation. Jurisdiction or not.",
  "I guess, what I meant, what do you mean by the subject of the contract?",
  "What about a home equity loan for home on the reservation.",
  "Yes.",
  "Whatever home equity loans are for.",
  "Well, they are going to add -- add a new wing onto the -- new room on to their home.",
  "So if Chase Manhattan gets a home equity loan application from somebody and they grant the home equity loan, they are now subject to being sued in tribal court?",
  "What if the tribal court has a rule that forum selection provisions are not enforceable?",
  "Does the judgment here that the bank discriminated against the Indian corporation because they didn't give them as favorable terms as they gave someone who hadn't defaulted on a loan impede dealings with Indian corporations by outside members -- outside nonmembers?",
  "What was the basis for the finding of discrimination?",
  "It had nothing to do -- the bank's justification had nothing to do with the fact that the entity had defaulted earlier?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Banker, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 06-7517, Irizarry versus United States. Mr. Madden.",
  "You may not have had notice of the issue of whether or not an alternative procedure and medication audit would help, but you certainly knew that future dangerousness was going to be on the table. And if you had a response to that, which is, well, if he took his medication, it wouldn't be a problem, I assume you would have prepared for that.",
  "Well, yeah, I -- but in terms of what issues might suggest themselves to a judge sentencing this particularly defendant, I would have thought future dangerousness. I mean, you have an individual who has leveled particular threats with some degree of certainty that he intends to pursue them, I would have thought that would have been one of the first things a sentencing judge would look at.",
  "Does the defendant have an obligation to give notice, both to the government and I suppose to the judge, saying at the - - at the sentencing hearing, we're going to say this? So the judge can get ready for it? Or the government can get ready for it?",
  "What about the point made by Chief Judge Boudin in his recent opinion, is that now that we look more carefully at the 3553 factors, counsel has to come in prepared to address all of those?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Roberts.",
  "The rules advisory committee is currently considering whether or not to change this, right?",
  "Nobody in that process has suggested, well, it's too bad you've already decided this in 32(h)?",
  "A lot of judges objected to the idea they would adopt the position you're urging here.",
  "It's not inferring from the failure to act. It is just a recognition that these things are looked at very carefully by the rules committees and they look at it in a broad way and take in all the information. We know they're doing that now. And we would be kind of jumping the gun and short circuiting that process.",
  "How can that be? They're talking about an expert and all that. He's not going to be hanging around the courthouse.",
  "Well, that all goes -- that all goes to the harmless error question. Is that the only time in which notice at the sentencing hearing is going to be adequate?",
  "But you're really asking them to sentence first and hearing afterward.",
  "Maybe the whole purpose of the hearing is to find out what factors are pertinent and all that. You're asking the judge to come to that determination before the hearing.",
  "So you disagree with the Petitioner on the specificity of notice required?",
  "Well, if you think you have a particularly good case that they are, again you make that point to the judge.",
  "If you can see what the last report about these programs was like, you wouldn't think that. And I think a reasonably competent judge is not going to say, I don't want to see it. Or maybe he will based on his own experience in dealing with those types of - -",
  "I suppose we'll have --",
  "I suppose we'll have a lot of appeals about the adequacy of the notice. You and the Petitioner disagree on that, and appellate courts will have to address that as well.",
  "Yes. This may be - -",
  "I'm sorry. This may be an easy case, but you can imagine others that aren't going to be.",
  "Continue. Finish.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rutledge.",
  "Do you accept Chief Judge Boudean's safety valve as well? In other words, if the basis for the variance is going to be a matter of surprise, then notice is required?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Madden, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Counsel.",
  "Mr. Rutledge, you briefed and argued the case as amicus curiae in support of the judgment below upon appointment by this Court, and we thank you for undertaking and discharging that assignment. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first today in Case 07-330, Greenlaw versus United States. Ms. Howe.",
  "I would have thought it would depend on what the mandate from the court of appeals said. If the mandate said the sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing, it seems to me that leaves open the full range of legitimate sentencing.",
  "Well, but the court of appeals -- if your argument is correct, the court of appeals is limited solely by virtue of the failure to file a notice of cross-appeal. That -- that's a limitation that wouldn't apply in the district court.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Howe. Ms. Maynard.",
  "Well, usually the mandate in these cases simply says, you know, the case is remanded to the district court. If that's all the mandate says, does that authorize the district court to do the right thing under the law?",
  "So the -- the defendant who is appealing has to be very careful about the relief he requests? He says I don't want the sentence vacated; I want the sentence reduced to five years instead of 10. And nothing else? That's the only relief I seek?",
  "In that context, aren't -- aren't you concerned about enlisting the court of appeals in doing something illegal? I mean, they know that what they're authorizing, or imposing really, as a sentence is illegal.",
  "I'm reminded of what we do in statutory cases. If one party says this is, it should be read A, and the other party says it should be read B, we've had cases where we say, well, they're both wrong, and we're going to read the statute as C because we the Court want to do the right thing.",
  "No, in my hypothetical they weren't agreeing. One side was saying B, the other side was saying A.",
  "And the right answer was C.",
  "Is there problem of getting the Solicitor General's office to authorize the appeal?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Maynard. Mr. Jorgensen.",
  "Well, if it's discretionary, how would you -- I assume it's reviewable for abuse of discretion.",
  "How would you know whether it's an abuse of discretion or not? I mean, the issue is going to be the same in every case. There was no cross-appeal. If there had been, we would have increased the sentence, and one court of appeals says, well, we're not going to do it; and the other court of appeals says, yes, we're going to do it. Which one is reversed for abuse of discretion?",
  "I thought you might say that. But I mean - -",
  "But if it's such a - -",
  "If it's such a plain error, it's fair to to ask why the Government didn't cross-appeal. If you - -",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Howe, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Miss Howe. Mr. Jorgensen, you have briefed and argued this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below on appointment by the Court. We thank you for undertaking and discharging that assignment. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 07-343, Kennedy versus Louisiana. Mr. Fisher.",
  "Well, speaking of Roper and Atkins, is it -- is it only work in one way? How are you ever supposed to get consensus moving in the opposite direction? In other words, you look to the number of States under Roper and Atkins who impose it, and you say, well, most of them are abolishing it, so we think it's unconstitutional, combined with other factors. Now, if there's going to be a trend the other way, how does that happen? As soon as the first State says, well, we're going to impose the death penalty for child rape, you say, well, there isn't a consensus, so it's unconstitutional. And do 20 States have to get together and do it at the same time? Or how are they supposed to move the inquiry under Atkins and Roper in the opposite direction?",
  "And the trend since 1995, '90, has been more and more States are passing statutes imposing the death penalty in situations that do not result in death.",
  "Well, let me ask - - we will put that to one side, but how much movement you need. I'm more interested in the analytic question: How does it happen? I mean because your position would be every one -- a case in every one of those States, whatever the number is, is unconstitutional because we've said the trend is the other way. Well, how does a trend ever get started in the opposite direction?",
  "But you want to say this is -- you want to say this is unconstitutional because most States do it the other way. And I assume if a similar case arose in Texas involving capital punishment in a nondeath case, you would say well, most go the other way. In other words, if you knock them down one by one, it is kind of hard to get a trend going.",
  "If somebody in this case is tried and convicted under that law, you would say: Well, that's unconstitutional because there is not a sufficient trend in favor of that. And it just seems to me that that understanding of Atkins and Roper prevents the development of the law except in one direction.",
  "I know, but, as I pointed out, it is very expensive to run a regime in which you have the death penalty. And I can see the legislators in those States saying, well, we've got Coker on the books. We've only got one State. Why would we want to be the second State and go through this process and then have the Supreme Court throw it out? You know, everyone is waiting for the next State. I mean it's a very difficult process, it seems to me, to run the evolution of the law in both directions. And then if you're insisting on a trend of whatever -- I don't know what the number is, 15, or 20, or 30 States -- it just can't materialize when you have Coker there and you have Atkins looking only in one direction.",
  "I wonder if Atkins and Roper are qualitatively different, considering the mental retardation of the offender, the youth of the offender. Those are issues that go, as we said in Roper and Atkins, to culpability. In other words, they are focused on the offender. This is quite different. It is focused on the nature of the offense. And I wonder if that's more something on which we have less basis for determining the issue than a legislature. We can look at the question of characteristics of the offender and make a judgment about that. I don't know how we decide this for the reason you were just saying: What crimes are more serious than others? I wonder if it brings into play our jurisprudence on things like the three-strikes law and others where we sort of say: We can't judge how serious crimes are and which ones are more serious than others, and so we leave that to another branch.",
  "But we're talking about - -",
  "-- if were talking about evolving trends, I think it's fair to say that society's recognition of the seriousness of the crime of rape has evolved even since, the period since Coker. Now isn't that something that we should take into consideration?",
  "It certainly involved -- evolved since the time of Blackstone and even since -- as I say, even since Coker. So while Coker may have thought rape of an adult wasn't serious enough to warrant the death penalty when the legislature had made a contrary determination, perhaps that would be addressed differently if -- differently today; and certainly rape of a child would be understood not to be not included in Coker's analysis.",
  "Coker, of course, repeatedly in the statement of the facts and the analysis, repeatedly referred to the victim as an adult woman. It seems to me the Court was taking -- was being very careful to leave open the question of what would be the analysis in the case of a child.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fisher. Ms. Clark.",
  "Why is it sufficient -- why isn't it sufficient narrowing, even after Coker, that they make the death eligibility rape of a child under 12 as opposed to under 16?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Clark.",
  "Mr. Cruz?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cruz. Mr. Fisher, we'll give you five minutes.",
  "I thought -- the bulk of your argument, though, it seems to me, would not -- would be the same in a recidivist case, because, of course, that doesn't result in death either.",
  "I mean, I don't - - it is sort of a factual distinction but I don't see how it helps your argument.",
  "I'm not sure that the sort of trends that they look to in Roper and Atkins -- I mean, you had different crimes that carried the capital punishment as well. I don't think we're looking at trends in that regard.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fisher. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 07-371, Taylor versus Sturgell. Ms. Rosenbaum.",
  "When you have a situation where it is an associational standing case, and an individual is the one that's relied upon give the association standing, in that case is the individual, even though he's not bringing the suit, is he barred by the association's case?",
  "What about if it is the executive director of the association, and the suit is brought in the name the association, and they lose. Can he bring suit as, you know, I'm just Joe Blow, but I happen to be the executive director, but I'm bringing this in my own name?",
  "Well, let's say that it is somebody above him, you know, the president of the association, who decides what lawsuits are brought, and he's just the executive director?",
  "But he recommended to the president, said we ought to file this lawsuit. The president said okay, and they did, and then they lost. Can he go ahead as an individual?",
  "Well, that means your statement implicates very serious questions of standing under Article III, whether Congress can say create the injury by saying you've been denied records and, therefore, you have standing. I think that's -- I wouldn't go ahead assuming that that was correct.",
  "What if you have a situation where a client has retained a law firm to do something and the law firm as part of its normal activity files a FOIA request? They think something useful is going to come up there, and it's denied, and the law firm on its own, and not as the -- not as retained by the company files a FOIA suit? In that case, is the company bound by the determination in the case? Or can they then file another action?",
  "No, the law firm - - the law firm files its own FOIA request, and it is denied, and they litigate that, and then they lose, and the company brings a FOIA action.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "But -- I guess to be fair to my hypothetical, it was the company that was paying for what the law firm was doing. It just wasn't the -- the filing of the suit. The law firm went off on it own. Maybe it does it all the time when they have a case, they think this might be helpful and they are filing a FOIA request.",
  "Is it purely a formal inquiry? In other words, let's say the company is paying the law firm to represent, but the law firm just filed in its own name? Does that make a difference?",
  "Well, it's a company - -",
  "Let's say some group, say, Public Citizen Litigation Group sends a fundraising thing around saying we think all our members ought to contribute to a special fund so that we can bring a lawsuit under FOIA. Are all of those individual contributors then bound by the result?",
  "So it make as difference if it's one company as opposed to 40 donors?",
  "Well, then in the previous hypothetical there was no authority to represent. They just said, \"I think this is a good idea, here's the money. Here.\"",
  "Well, controls. So there are three companies, and they each have -- you know, they can vote. They each have 33-percent control. Are they each bound, or because they didn't control it none of them are bound?",
  "Well, they said, yes, you can represent us, and we're three different companies, and, you know, it's a majority vote as to what you can do.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Did you make your friend on the other side aware that you'd be - -",
  "Even if he's the individual that brought the case with club standing, associational standing?",
  "Is this an approach that only applies in FOIA cases? I would assume in every other case you have the normal Article III requirements of injury, which limits exactly who can sue.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Stetson.",
  "Well, what about the associational cases: The association brings a suit in the interests of the members? Are those members bound?",
  "Association standing cases we talk about germane, right?",
  "Is that enough?",

  "What if two people get together who want the same documents for the same purpose, which is they think they're going to make money off of it. And they say which ever gets it we'll share with the other and we'll split the money we're going to get?",

  "Do you think we need to remand this for consideration of whether or not there was an agreement, if we conclude that what we see from the court of appeals opinion isn't enough? As I understand, the court of appeals didn't think an agreement was necessary. So regardless of what the district court said, al thought that was an issue that was litigated, it was not passed on by the court of appeals.",

  "So in that case -- and then let's say you're at trial, and you ask: Did you fire this person because she punched in late a few times? I take it hat the objection would be that that's irrelevant, and that would be sustained.",
  "No, no. The record shows she was -- a few times she punched in late.",
  "But you're going to have to articulate it in Federal court. You emphasize it's a deferential standard, it's not -- but every case now -- every case of an employee firing, in fact every case of employee not getting as big a raise as he thought he was entitled, that's now a Federal case.",
  "But Title VII, there's no --you know, there is no, \"because you don't like me,\" it's not because I'm a particular race or --",
  "I'm not worried about a frequent filer. I'm worried about 40 million single filers.",
  "Can I ask you more -- perhaps a more abstract question about this class-of-one? Doesn't that have the effect of adding an equal protection claim to every violation of law? In other words, you have a Fourth Amendment search and seizure claim, and you're treated illegally; you say well, everybody else was treated legally and I wasn't, so it's an equal protection violation? You get -- you know, the zoning ordinance, it was improper under the zoning law, and because everybody else was properly treated, it's a violation of equal protection.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Katyal. Ms. Metcalf.",
  "No, but, as your friend points out, the constitutional provision says \"any person.\" It doesn't say any person who is a member of a particular class or any person who is exercising a fundamental right. It's \"any person.\"",
  "Well, isn't that an odd system? I mean, you have -- like our time card example, you're going to have litigation over whether she was late for work or was not late for work, and in fact that's got nothing to do with the reasons she was fired at all. And yet the government puts it out, well, this is a conceivable reason, and then the other side says, no, it's not, and they fight. It just seems so otherworldly; it has nothing to do with the reason at all.",
  "Well, but that's with respect to legislative or regulatory action, where there are important reasons not to inquire into the motives of the legislators. It's not clear to me that that same rationale applies here.",
  "What exactly is the analytic basis of that? I mean, do you think that -- you don't think the Equal Protection Clause applies at all to this situation where it's just a class of one? Or do you think that the clause is always -- the claim of violation under the clause is always rebutted automatically? What is the --",
  "Oh, but that's very different, because those cases say that those individuals have no First Amendment rights. In other words, in the public employee context, talking about their official obligations, there is no First Amendment right to do that. I think it's quite a different situation to say there is no equal protection right in government employment.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Metcalf. Ms. Blatt.",
  "Well, I agree with all of that, but -- so the Equal Protection Clause doesn't apply?",
  "So you think the Equal Protection Clause applies --",
  "-- in any case of public employment -- what -- that's satisfied?",
  "But the Equal Protection Clause doesn't balk about classes. It talks about any person.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Mr. Katyal, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "What is your answer to their Batson analogy?",
  "No, but you're adding the class aspect. If the rationale of the prosecutor is, I don't like this person, under Batson you don't get to bring an equal protection challenge to that.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-320, Davis v. The Federal Election Commission. Mr. Herman.",
  "There is no restriction whatsoever on the wealthier candidate. He can spend as much of his money as he wants.",
  "Well, what if, for example, somebody takes out a television ad that says smoking this type of cigarette is actually, is not harmful to you. The government is free to take out a contrary ad saying, no, it is and so you shouldn't do it, right?",
  "So governmental responses to the exercise of free speech are not automatically -- don't automatically burden the exercise of that speech.",
  "Well then, why does it burden it for the government to make it easier for private citizens to respond to that speech.",
  "What case supports that proposition?",
  "Government can't engage in political speech.",
  "You don't think that would be any more constitutional than this, do you?",
  "Counsel, you said earlier that money is -- money is speech in this area. So I take it you think that the restrictions, otherwise applicable restrictions on the less wealthy candidate, raise problems under the First Amendment?",
  "So this law eases those problematic restrictions. It's less violative of the First Amendment.",
  "Well, but your candidate isn't subject to any restriction at all on what he can spend and his opponent is subject to less restrictions. It seems to me the First Amendment comes out better.",
  "I think -- I mean, obviously you're correct that this system benefits incumbents, but it benefits your client in a particular way as well. The parties are certainly interested in candidates who will fund themselves because that presents less strain on the party's resources.",
  "I'm not sure we need characterizations of the political candidates --",
  "-- in this forum.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Herman. General Clement.",
  "General, we haven't talked yet about the disclosure, the special disclosure requirements in that money is speech, and in a First Amendment area it strikes me as very problematic that the government requires you to disclose in a differential way how you intend -- when you're spending a particular amount of money and on such precise day-by-day requirements. I mean, is there any other area -- if you're writing a book, you don't have to disclose to the government when you're going to publish it and how far along you're getting in the draft. And yet, it just seems this is the same sort of thing in the election context.",
  "But those are applicable across the board. These are special disclosure requirements for people who are going to engage in additional speech.",
  "So wouldn't you think they would require more detailed and more expeditious disclosure of the associational link than of the self-funding? And yet it's the exact opposite?",
  "What if the -- what if the restriction were more tailored, if Congress decided the one area where the wealthy really have an advantage is buying television time, so that's what we're going to restrict. If the wealthy individual buys a certain amount of television time, we're going to allow contributions to the less wealthy candidate to buy television time. They think the money is not as big a deal in the other areas. Would that be all right?",
  "So what if Congress decided that a debate on a particular issue was distorted by the wealth of owners of newspapers? And so it passed a law saying that people who are responding to that are relieved of the tax burden they would otherwise have to pay, on whatever their -- you know, sales tax on pamphlets that they want to sell. Would that be all right?",
  "To level the playing field on the debate on that particular issue?",
  "No -- so you can tax -- you can tax a newspaper, but you cannot -- you don't have to tax people who are responding to the newspaper?",
  "The taxing power is an -- is a limit on the exercise of First Amendment rights?",
  "But that's any -- any organization that engaged in lobbying.",
  "So is there no limitation on the rationale of leveling the playing field throughout the First Amendment?",
  "Well, it's trying -- it's certainly trying to chill self-financing by burdening it when it reaches a certain level.",
  "What if the law expressed a displeasure at the introduction of self-financing and said that, as you have these very rapid disclosures, that the less wealthy candidate can accept contributions whatever, twice the amount of whatever the self-financed candidate is spending on his campaign? Is that all right?",
  "Well, he -- you know, the millionaire, as we are talking about, spends -- discloses that he has spent $500,000. Then the contribution limits are off the table for the less wealthy candidate to the tune of a million dollars, in other words twice as much as the self-financed candidate.",
  "Well, why not? Because as -- your point in this case, rather than the hypothetical, is that the self-financed candidate is not burdened in any way, but simply that his opponent has benefited. And it seems to me that would be true in the case of my hypothetical as well.",
  "I would have thought all the arguments that you gave before, like the self-financed candidate wants to be able to say he doesn't rely on contributions and so on, those would still be equally applicable.",
  "So it's not a -- it's not a qualitative argument you're making but a quantitative. At some point, the benefit to the opponent gets to be too much of a chill on the self-financed candidate, but under this system you think it's below the line.",

  "There was a dying declaration rule at the common law; wasn't there?",
  "Well, that didn't require any inquiry into the intent of the person responsible for the death, or the imminent death, right?",
  "Well, if the dying declaration rule didn't require intent, why should yours?",
  "Under the -- the testimony of someone who heard her say something, was that admissible?",
  "No. No. Under the common law.",
  "Like in the case of an unavailable witness?",
  "How do we know in this case that part of his intent was not to prevent her from testifying at trial? I mean, it's obvious that he was upset about something else, but maybe in his mind he is saying, oh, boy, if she has talked to people about how I'm going to kill her, I'd better do it so that she can't testify.",
  "How are we ever going to know that in a typical case?",
  "Well, take a case like this, I don't understand how that finding could have been made. He knew that she had reported -- that she had said to her friends he is going to kill me; he is going to kill me. And then he figures he'd better do it or it's going to -- his self-defense claim is going to look a lot weaker.",
  "No, I'm sorry it doesn't. It means that that may have been part of his motive, to kill her. Because I'm not just going to beat her up this time; I'm actually going to kill her because otherwise I'm going up the river. Here he gets a great benefit from murdering her which is that her testimony is not available. We usually under our system don't try to give benefits to murderers.",
  "I understand that, and you've said --",
  "Excuse me, Counsel. You've said that already. And what I'm saying is that I don't understand under the legal standard we might adopt, how that sort of finding makes sense. I mean, you don't ask him why did you kill her; was it to prevent her testimony or not? That's not available in the inquiry. So how can that sort of factual finding be made?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Burkhardt. Mr. De Nicola.",
  "I would suppose that there are a lot, a lot of situations in which a dead victim has made statements pertinent to the murder. So wouldn't your rule drive a pretty big hole through Crawford? This is not an isolated instance where the victim said something about the murderer. That would seem to be a fairly common situation, because most murders involve people who know each other.",
  "I think you're -- it's certainly true that this issue would come up in domestic abuse cases --",
  "-- but I'm not sure that it would be at all limited. I assume you have, you know, gang cases --",
  "-- any case in which have you familiarity between the victim and the defendant, which, as I understand it, is the most typical case, but it's not simply in any way limited to the domestic abuse cases.",
  "No, I know your rule wouldn't --",
  "-- but the situation in which the case arises --",
  "-- also would --",
  "-- certainly not. It comes up quite frequently, I would assume --",

  "Well, your friend, of course, makes the point that the age discrimination prohibition is narrower in scope than Title VII, that there are more likely to be instances in which a reasonable factor other than age came into play than there would be a basis for discrimination on the basis of race.",
  "Well, but the facts -- I mean, given discovery, that doesn't seem a very compelling case. Once you require the employer to come up -- in other words, the burden of production -- and say, well, the reason we did it was this, then it's just a matter of discovery. The plaintiff can say, oh, well, then let me depose that person who is the head of, you know, whatever the department. If it's for safety reasons, for some reason, or training issues, well, then we depose the person who is in charge of training or safety and ask them those questions. And it doesn't seem to me that the fact that the employer possesses the information, given very liberal discovery we have, is much of a factor.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Joseffer.",
  "These are not words. They are operative provisions of law.",
  "Counsel, I was surprised not to see Chevron cited in your brief. What -- what sort of deference do you think we should give the EEOC regulations here?",
  "I'm sorry. I thought Auer deference tells you how to interpret the regulation. And having once interpreted the regulation, you need to know what to do with it.",
  "We know what the regulation -- we give it deference; we know what the regulation means. Now, does that regulation, as understood in light of Auer deference, get Chevron deference or something else?",
  "Why is it proving a negative? They would just have to prove that it was or was not a reasonable factor other than age.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman.",
  "But then he is not -- he didn't do it to discriminate against old people. He did it because the foreign country requires him --",

  "How does that work? I don't understand. You go through, you've got a decision, whatever, it's a health insurance decision that this procedure -- to determine that this procedure is not covered under the, the plan, that the fiduciary has the discretion to make that determination. But you say, aha, he's got a conflict of interest, so that's a factor we take into account. Well, how does -- what does that mean?",
  "All right, you've got two cases, one where the person does not have a conflict of interest under a particular plan, the other where he does. It's the same decision: We're not going to cover this procedure. How is the review different in each of those cases as a practical matter?",
  "I guess I don't see an answer to my question yet. How does the review differ as a functional matter? He says he looks at it and says, well, normally that would be within the discretion, but I've got to remember he's got a conflict, so I'm going to determine that this particular procedure should be covered because of the conflict.",
  "Counsel, Justice Souter's question and Justice Alito's question highlight for me what I think is the central issue. Justice Souter had asked you whether the conflict comes into play, you know, when it's a tie. And you're right on the fence, and you say, well, the conflict's a factor, so it tips over in the employee's favor. Justice Alito's question asked you whether or not the conflict has to play a role in the decision. I don't know how that would be, but let's say, for example, the insurance company is doing well and so they say, well, we allow coverage for this procedure. All of a sudden, the insurance company looks like it's not doing so well, it's not going to meet the quarterly targets or whatever, so it says, well, we're no longer going to allow coverage for that procedure. In other words, it is the conflict itself that affects which way it comes out. Now, which is right: Justice Souter's case in which the conflict tips the scales, no matter what the reason is; or Justice Alito's case where the conflict plays a role in the decision process?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz.",
  "Well, but trust law doesn't take into account what we have said repeatedly in our ERISA decisions, which is we want to encourage people to set up ERISA plans. And that has affected the standards that we've adopted, for example, that we even allow a conflict of interest like this to exist. And it seems to me that your position is going to hurt beneficiaries under ERISA plans because people are going to say, as they're perfectly free to do -- people, the employers, are going to say, as they are perfectly free to do, you know, I'm just not going to do it; if we're going to have judges looking at these claims decisions on a de novo basis, who knows how much it'll end up costing me, so I'm not going to set up these plans.",
  "Do you -- which position do you adopt? It was only posed as hypothetical, so I don't mean to attribute the position to you; but the Justice Souter hypothetical or the Justice Alito hypothetical?",
  "Well, that sounds like the Justice Alito hypothetical. In other words, the extra scrutiny has to be consonant with the purpose. The purpose is to protect against the conflict. So if the scrutiny doesn't reveal that the conflict played a role, then it's -- then it's not an abuse of discretion.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "We've heard a lot of talk about judicial eyes today, but it doesn't -- it makes it sound as if abuse-of-discretion review is nothing, and with the added factor you want to look more closely. Courts undertaking abuse-of-discretion review don't do it blindly. They look at it. It's just a question of whether they give deference on the judgment calls. And I'm still not -- I still don't understand how the added factor or, in your case, the added seven factors affects that issue of deference.",
  "But under trust law - -",
  "-- we don't have - - we don't have an established policy of encouraging people to establish trusts. We do have reflected in our decisions an established policy of encouraging people to set up ERISA plans.",

  "We'll hear argument first this term in Altria Group v. Stephanie Good. Mr. Olson.",
  "Mr. Olson, what if the state law claim did not require any inquiry into the relationship between smoking and health? Something along the lines of saying our studies show that light cigarettes are healthier for you, and in fact their studies show the opposite. So all you, all the plaintiff would have to show is that there was a deception, a disconnect between the studies and the ad. It wouldn't matter whether light cigarettes were healthier or not healthier. Is that the type of action that could be brought?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Frederick.",
  "How is that consistent with what the Court said in the Riegel case where they said, and I'll quote: \"We have held that a provision pre-empting State requirements pre-empted common law duties\"? That's no suggestion that this is a distinction between a focused common law duty, which would be unusual anyway, and general common law duty.",
  "You say Riegel wasn't referring to the particular text of any statue. It was making a general point. The Court said: We have held that a provision pre-empting State requirements, which is exactly what this one does, pre-empted common law duties.",
  "So as a general proposition -- I understand your position to be that this particular statute doesn't pre-empt the common law duties, but the distinction I thought you articulated in response to Justice Alito's question was that general common law duties are not pre-empted; specific tailored ones are.",
  "You agree that a general common law duty can be pre-empted by a particular statute?",
  "So you're -- so you're saying that we should -- the difference in your case is that the language here is narrower. It says \"no statement relating to smoking or health.\" I don't see how that language is narrower.",
  "Okay. So 1334(b) says \"no requirement or prohibition with respect to.\" Isn't that just as broad?",
  "How do you tell - - how do you tell whether it's deceptive or not if you don't look at what the relationship is between smoking and health? They have an advertisement that says light cigarettes are better for you than regular cigarettes. You have to know what the relationship is between smoking and health to determine whether that's deceptive.",
  "That's the relationship between smoking and health.",
  "Mr. Frederick, did I understand you earlier to say that your complaint did not seek injunctive relief?",
  "Page 42A of your amended complaint says you ask the Court to grant such injunctive relief as may be appropriate.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frederick.",
  "It will not surprise you that my first question is, why did the United States not address the express pre-emption argument and, second, what is the position of the United States on the express pre-emption argument?",
  "All right. Well, that's why you didn't address it. Now, what is the position of the United States? It's a statute that is directed to an area in which the Federal Government has an extensive interest in regulation, and I would have thought there'd be a position on that. It is logically antecedent to the implied pre-emption. You would consider whether there is express pre-emption before implied pre-emption.",
  "Well, it's not anymore. I understood -- I understood Mr. Olson to give up on implied pre-emption in his opening argument.",
  "Implied pre-emption is all that you address, right?",
  "So it should be pretty easy for you to win on that.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Olson, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "You just didn't want to argue it.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 07-610, Locke v. Karass. Mr. Young.",
  "Even though -- even though there may be a great disconnect between the premiums and the needs of the particular unit? I mean, let's say the particular unit has -- I don't know -- has always had a history of good relations with the employer. It has never had to call upon litigation in 20 years, and they don't anticipate it, and yet their insurance premiums rise dramatically because of very hostile and extended litigation by another unit. Do you -- do you concede that case?",
  "He is not trying to help you.",
  "I thought the distinction you were drawing was whether or not the collective bargaining agreement applies to the particular union. If it's a different unit with a different agreement I thought you were saying that that can't be charged, but if it's the bargaining agreement that binds the particular unit, I thought you said that was chargeable.",
  "Of the particular unit.",
  "And I suppose you would also concede that if the bargaining agreement is exactly the same, you know a number of units have exactly the same bargaining agreement, which I would suppose is a not uncommon situation, but litigation with respect to the terms of the bargaining agreement even though it happens to involve a different unit is also chargeable to the particular unit.",
  "Thank you counsel. Mr. Collins?",
  "But that's not what we are talking about. It doesn't have to go it alone. It simply can't force members of another unit that can decide they are happy to support it but the members who don't want to support it who don't like unions, they can't be forced to pay for it if it does not relate to their collective bargaining agreement.",
  "If the litigation is not germane to the unit where people object to that unit's collective bargaining agreement they are not free riding on anything.",
  "What if there is no -- I guess I'm getting into the solace thor general's position here. What if the unit with the objective members does not have a right to call upon the pool? Either, or has never called upon the pool in its unlikely that it will. Isn't there, it's not simply subsidization. It's their compelled fees being used for something that doesn't Ben fate their collective bargaining arrangement.",
  "Exactly -- I'm sorry. I was just going to say exactly so I regard that issue as still open. It was not addressed at all in Lehnert.",
  "So if you have a situation where there is a provision in the collective bargaining agreement that the union thinks requires the employer to provide air conditioning in the plant, the local up in Nome, Alaska has to support that extra - - extra-unit litigation even though it will never have any benefit for it?",
  "I thought it meant -- I didn't think Lehnert held that the unit would have to support that type of extra-unit litigation. I mean, I - -",
  "Yes. Yes, there is a provision that is ambiguous, which frequently happens, and the union says that requires air conditioning, and the company says no, and there is a big fight about that.",
  "Well, sure, because that negotiation is germane to the Nome, Alaska collective bargaining agreement, if they are negotiating it there for that unit.",
  "Do you think as a covenant of support you have -- however many -- about a thousand individual units. You think each of those, you have a covenant to support them when they all get -- get involved in separate litigation? You can't possibly.",
  "So it's quite unlike, for example, insurance. If you have insurance and you as the unit have a particular obligation, you have a right to have that covered. There is no similar right here.",
  "So we are talking about an infringement on the objecting members' first amendment rights, and your answer is trust us, we'll treat you fairly? I understand that it's a different answer if you say you've got a right. We can impose the contribution requirement on you, even though you object to it because under this agreement, you have a right to call upon our services. That's a different case. But if your answer is simply trust us we'll treat you fairly, that's not the usual standard we apply to infringements of First Amendment rights.",
  "That's different. That's a little bit more stringent than saying trust us. That's saying let's look at the last year and we'll figure it out.",
  "So if we determine as a matter of First Amendment law that such a requirement is necessary, then you lose, because you're saying we can't possibly fashion the test?",
  "Lehnert didn't address the question of litigation.",
  "Well, that's not right. Again we have to postulate that we are dealing with members who don't like unions at all. So while the members may think this is perfectly fair, the nonmembers whenever their money is forced to be used for union activities, it's unfair.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Collins. Mr. Young, you have four minutes.",
  "The test is not whether it's political, is it? It's not a negative test. It's an affirmative requirement in which the burden is on the union that they have to show the expenditure is germane to the particular collective bargaining agreement?",
  "Well, do you have a response to Justice Kennedy's concern? Do you have a fallback position or are you also in the all or nothing - -",
  "Thank you counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Vaden v. Discover Bank. Mr. Ortiz.",
  "That simply means that you can't bring an action in Federal court because the agreement says you can't. The agreement says you've got to arbitrate. So if you throw the agreement out save for such agreement, the question is whether or not you could then bring the action in Federal court.",
  "This is a tough - - it's a tough sell. When you say \"save for such agreement,\" which I agree with Justice Stevens seems to me you've put the agreement aside and then you say right away then you look at the agreement to see if there is Federal jurisdiction and only the agreement, not through that. So you're throwing it out and then you bring it right back in. It seems - -",
  "Of the arbitration agreement?",
  "Right. And I guess it's -- I mean, you say if it said save for the historic doctrine of ouster, then it would be easy to say, and then you look at the arbitration agreement. But it says \"save for such agreement\" and then you look at the agreement.",
  "But you do think - - you do think we should look through to determine diversity and the amount in question? In other words, not in the Federal-question context, but if it's diversity, you say we do look through the arbitration agreement.",
  "Can I hold up just a second to make sure I understand it. You are saying that, let's say, Person A has an arbitration agreement that implicates Persons B and C. C is diverse, but B is not. They could decide to compel arbitration with respect to B and leave C out of it. But if you follow the look-through doctrine, you would say, well, the dispute is between A and B and C; and so you would be depriving A of their right to frame their own complaint in a way that doesn't create Federal jurisdiction.",
  "Of course, I suppose how that works depends on what the rules are about how you frame the dispute once you do look through. I mean, if there is a pending State suit between A and B, even though C may -- you could have sued C as well, I mean the judge can say, well, I am only going to look through to what the -- the actual litigation is; and if I look at that, that's not a Federal case. And -- and -- and so your position follows.",
  "Yes, and what really leapt off the page at me in that opinion, he gets to the end, I think he basically presents your position and then he says: Thus, on my reading the relevant portion of section 4 could be rewritten this way. Well, I mean that to me is a confession of error if you have to rewrite the statute to get to your position.",
  "Well, his rewriting doesn't look very much like section 4 to me.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Phillips.",
  "Who gets to frame - - who gets to frame the complaint? Normally if you're a party and you have a dispute that may implicate Federal law, you have control over the complaint. You don't have to have a -- you don't have to well plead it in a way that implicates a Federal question. You can go out of your way to do it in a way that does not implicate a Federal question; and therefore it would not be, you could not bring it in Federal court. Just as in the diversity example, you can specifically avoid suing people who would create diversity. But in your position the judge has to in his mind write a complaint and see whether there is jurisdiction or not; and how does the judge decide whether to sue diverse parties or not to sue diverse parties?",
  "What's hard to figure out, you have, let's say, a franchisee, and you have a dispute with the franchisor. And the franchisee says it's an antitrust violation, and I'm going to sue you under the California antitrust law, and he does. And the Federal court says, we've looked through and says, well, you could have sued under the Federal antitrust law. And you -- yes, I could have; I deliberately didn't. And then they say, well, this is something that could have been brought in Federal court. And that really deprives a plaintiff of his right to frame his complaint as he sees fit.",
  "No. But you just say, is the dispute one that could have been brought in Federal court?",
  "It's a violation of the Sherman Act.",
  "Of course, it could be brought in Federal court.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Ortiz, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "I'm sorry, what do you mean would still be covered?",

  "Didn't they have some regular system for updating the computer base? I mean, I assume it was updated at some point.",
  "So people who are, you know, the warrant is served, they're arrested, they go to trial, they're in jail, their name still shows up as having a warrant out for their arrest.",
  "Well then, how did this warrant clerk, I guess is what I'd call her, discover the error? She discovered it within 10 or 15 minutes, right.",
  "Why did the first - - first person in that scenario need a physical copy of the warrant?",
  "Well, there was something done in this particular case, though, right? The warrant clerk notified -- was it the Coffee County people?",
  "-- that the warrant -- that the information she had given 10 minutes before was inaccurate.",
  "How is it going to keep - -",
  "It's a separate question. It may be an illegal arrest, but the question is the separate one of whether or not you exclude the evidence collected incident to that arrest. And we have, in several cases, separated the two questions, and I guess it's difficult for me to see if no one has done anything wrong, no one, why you would suppress the evidence in that case.",
  "No, but you have this difficulty: Do we have to get into negligence, or should we assume, as I understand to be your theory, as Justice Breyer put it, that you would still suppress the evidence when no one has done anything wrong?",
  "Well, that's just rephrasing it. It's probable cause based on the existence of a warrant, and it turns out to be there is a mistake in the warrant.",
  "So, you would impose a burden on the officer on the street serving a warrant? When he gets the call saying there's a warrant, he's supposed to say, \"Are you sure? Did you double-check with the clerk? When was the last time they updated the computer system? I don't want to go through all this if the evidence is going to be suppressed.\" At every chain in command, you would impose that burden.",
  "Yes, but I mean I don't know what the situation is like - -",
  "I don't know what the situation is like in Dale County. They probably don't have the latest version of WordPerfect, or whatever it is. They are probably making do with whatever they can under their budget and doing the best they can.",
  "Well, you said this wasn't anything in the record about what type of program they might have, whether they were updated. They found the mistake in ten minutes.",
  "Sure.",
  "But the Coffee County people aren't called \"support officers\" for the Dale County police.",
  "Now you keep saying this when you did this in your brief. You just call everybody \"police,\" \"police,\" \"police,\" when the question is whether there's a distinction between the Coffee County police and the Dale County police for purposes of applying the exclusionary rule.",
  "So you are back to arguing that there was negligence, and that that's pertinent.",
  "Thank you, Miss Karlan. Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear now from you.",
  "Do we assume on the basis of the record that there is negligence in this case?",
  "Now, Ms. Karlan made the point -- and I'd like to get your response to it - - that if we adopt something that depends on the showing of negligence, that that will require extensive hearings in every case into exactly what their computer update system was, and so on.",
  "We know what the cost was here, right? I mean, not just a drug peddler, but somebody with an illegal weapon found in his car, a weapon that presumably he would use on an occasion in which it was in his view appropriate to do so.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Miss Karlan, you have eight minutes remaining.",
  "Not the procedures of the police. The officer is on the stand and you say, all right, you've been here a while, how many times have these warrants turned out to be wrong, just as simple as it was in this case? And he says, gosh, this is the first time that I've had this question.",
  "Okay. Cross-examine people. These people are under oath, you cross-examine. You say, I don't think that's right. How many times? It's not that big a deal to find out on what basis the arresting officer was acting.",
  "So that's assuming bad faith on the part of the police.",
  "They want to arrest him, so they follow him until they find a motor vehicle violation.",
  "But you're suggesting it's bad faith - -",
  "-- because they - - because they don't want to have to worry about getting a warrant that might be wrong?",
  "What was the point of -- well, sure, as long as I'm asking the questions, you can answer.",
  "What was your point then? You're saying, well, they want to get this guy and they don't have to go through the warrant or anything else. They can follow him, find the broken taillight and then they would have gotten that guy. I thought that was the point you were trying to make?",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you Miss Karlan, the case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Kennedy v. Plan Administrator for DuPont Savings and Investment Plan. Mr. Furlow. I'm sorry. We won't.",
  "It's still early in the term. Case 07-542, Arizona v. Gant. Mr. Maziarz.",
  "Counsel, if you don't have -- I thought the whole point of a bright-line rule is that you don't have to justify in every particular case applying the -- the rule. So you are certainly going to -- if you -- the point is if you have a fact case-by-case inquiry, you're giving up the bright-line rule.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Yang -- Mr. Maziarz. Now Mr. Yang, we'll hear from you.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you Mr. Yang.",
  "Mr. Jacobs.",
  "You're looking at the specific facts of Belton. Belton adopted a bright-line rule. The whole point of a bright-line rule is that you don't look at the specific facts and it presents a problem here you say the guy is handcuffed and in the back of the car? Well what if he is in the back of the car but not handcuffed? What if there are five people around who might break open the police car and free him? What if there are three people around? You have exactly the same case by case inquiry that Belton said we are not going to do.",
  "Which one is not.",
  "Are those all preThornton.",
  "Well in Thornton of course the guy was handcuffed in the back of the police car.",
  "I guess my question is what is left of the Belton bright-line rule when you are done.",
  "We have to have a to determine a threat to officer safety.",
  "Assuming the decision is wrong.",
  "Just not to get back -- Mincey was 1978. Belton was 1981.",
  "Yes, but I'm trying to see -- you cited three cases. And my question was whether those survived Belton. Now, were all three of those before Belton?",
  "Just to explore that, that does seem to me to be overruling Belton to the extent Belton adopted a bright-line rule. What you're saying is, well, in these circumstances Belton applies, and in these circumstances, it doesn't. But you're overruling Belton when you say there's no longer a bright-line rule.",
  "So you think after Belton -- you think after Belton, we still have to look and see what's reaching distance on a case-by-case basis?",
  "I don't understand that part: \"Arguably within the reach.\" I don't understand that to be part of Belton. I thought that's what Belton did away with, and thought Belton was saying, look, we are going to have a bright-line rule, because we don't want to say he's five feet away, he is not within the reach; two feet away, he is.",
  "Do you think Belton kept the requirement that the person be arguably within the reach of the compartment?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Maziarz, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 07-636, Kennedy v. The Plan Administrator for DuPont Savings and Investment Plan. Mr. Furlow.",
  "I'm sorry; six weeks before what?",
  "Well, but how does the plan know that?",
  "But the plan terms say that if you want to change the beneficiary, here's how you've got to change the beneficiary; and we are going to pay the beneficiary until it's changed.",
  "I would have thought your friend on the other side would be quoting that language.",
  "But that's -- that's a bit of a stretch, isn't it? It says no beneficiary designation is in effect. If you look at the plan, he's got a beneficiary designation.",
  "It's in the opinion of the company. That sounds -- and this is a plan -- as we've said often in ERISA cases, we want to enforce these according to the terms of the plan because the companies don't have to set these up at all. So it makes perfect sense for the company to say, well, if we think this, then we can do this. So, in other words, there's a doubt and we don't want to give it to somebody who might not end up being the person, but if we don't think there's a doubt, that's it.",
  "Well, of course you only think the Solicitor General is right so far to a certain extent.",
  "Then you throw them under the train because you don't -- you certainly don't think they are correct by saying, look, the only way you can do this is by modifying the plan. I still don't know how the plan administrator is supposed to know that the person whose name appears on the plan documents, which the plan participant can change at any time, isn't the person that they are supposed to send the benefits to. Now, you tell me here they knew about the divorce and all that stuff. Maybe, maybe not. But we are trying to develop a rule for all cases and it seems to me the easiest, most administrable rule is to say whoever's name appears there gets the money, and if they are not supposed to because of some collateral dispute, well, they can sort that out in litigation. Maybe Kari has a suit against Mrs. Kennedy or her estate, but that's not a matter for the plan to worry about.",
  "I must have missed -- where did Watergate come from.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kruger.",
  "Am I right in understanding that there is a fairly sharp circuit split on that question, even that majority of the circuits are contrary to the Government's position?",
  "And which circuits are on the other side?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Levy.",
  "No, no. But is that a case in which the question the court decided was presented in the petition, the court said we are not going to take that question then they decided it on that ground anyway.",
  "I guess you agree that it's a question of which the circuits have split, so presumably there are good arguments on both sides, and it's one that your friend hasn't had a full opportunity to brief here. So we'd have to be pretty confident of the answer, I think, to go ahead and decide it.",
  "Well, why -- why do they have to worry about that? The simplest thing is for the participant to change the designation, and if there's a divorce, the divorcee is no longer a spouse under the terms of the plan, so he is free to do that. It seems odd to me that they have this elaborate QDRO provision when it shouldn't be necessary.",
  "But another alternative is that all you can -- you can cross out this name and put in another, or you can go to court, get this, qualify it as a QDRO, file it with the plan. I mean, why would anybody do that?",
  "Not, not obviously. I mean it depends what the divorce is. She got the Mercedes, right? I mean, she can get -- it depends on the divorce arrangement, not anything under ERISA, once she is a nonspouse.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Furlow, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "They look at it and say, is this a QDRO? And if no, then they go back to the other provision, I guess on page 21a in the red brief, and say: If it's not a QDRO, ignore it.",
  "Do you have anything more to say on the plan document, the plan document issue than what you've said here.",

  "Well, but, you know, that's why we ask hypotheticals that aren't related to the specific facts, because we're interested in how broadly the proposition you're asking for goes. I'd still like to find out where you draw the limit. What if the person says: Mr. Jones would never do anything like that, but if he did that would be terrible. Now, is that actionable as opposition?",
  "And those are overlapping but not whatever it -- concurring - -",
  "-- positions. You can oppose without participating. You can participate without opposing.",

  "In that case, doesn't the opposing employee herself have a direct cause of action under Title VII? Given what Ms. Crawford described, you know, \"that happened to me, too,\" she could proceed under Title VII herself.",
  "Would you go as far as Mr. Schnapper in determining what constitutes \"opposition\"? I mean, do you agree with him that a case where somebody says, \"oh, Mr. Jones would never do that, and if he did, I think that would be awful\" -- is that \"opposition\"?",
  "Yes, yes, I know, but -- I know, but - -",
  "Facts that would constitute unlawful activity. What about facts that -- I mean, many of these cases, of course, are he-said/she-said cases, and what about the facts that you are reporting confirm one side or the other? They just ask you, look -- and, you know, the person says, \"Well, every day at three o'clock he came in and do this,\" and you're outside. And he says, \"No, I wasn't there.\"",

She can initiate it, go in and say, \"I oppose what's going on,\" or if somebody just asks her, you know, \"how do you feel about what's going on,\" she says she opposes it. It seems to me in either case you look at the statement and not what led to the statement.",
  "That's why my hypothetical uses the word \"oppose.\" In the first case, she goes in of own volition and says, \"I oppose\"; in the second case, she says \"I oppose\" in response to a question. Congress used the word \"oppose,\" and my hypothetical in both cases used the word \"oppose.\"",
  "Right. Well, is it real a magic word? She comes in and says, \"you won't believe\" -- you know -- \"you think that's bad, wait till I tell you what he did to me,\" and goes on tells -- it's quite obvious from the context that she opposes it.",

Why didn't you just make -- why didn't you just go ahead and do an EIS from the outset if you were going to engage in such effort with respect to the environmental assessment?",
  "But why -- I don't know if this is Justice Souter's question, but why CEQ? I mean, NEPA doesn't really give anybody any regulatory authority -- EPA, CEQ. And it seems to me that CEQ is an odd entity to be doing this. They're more or less an office in the White House, rather than a free-standing agency.",
  "An environmental assessment.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Kendall.",
  "Well, with one important qualification. The question was the balance of those equities on a preliminary basis. In other words, before we reach a final decision, we're going to prevent the Navy from engaging in the sonar exercises that they think are necessary. Not even after we have decided they were wrong, just because we think there is a likelihood that they might be wrong.",
  "Well, I thought that would have been the whole ball game until I read your brief. Your brief does not spend a page defending the decision on the merits of the lower courts. Nothing about emergency circumstances or CEQ. Instead, you raise other arguments on which the district court did not rely in finding likelihood of success. So given that, I would have thought we would have a lot more to talk about when it gets to the permanent injunction on the merits.",
  "Oh, yes, yes. You certainly raised those issues. I'm not saying that. What I am saying the district court didn't rely on those in finding likelihood of success.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's what the district court relied on. Where in your brief do I see a defense of the district court's analysis, as opposed to the very coherent argument about Hayburn's case and everything else, issues the district court didn't reach?",
  "It would have increased exponentially the area that the Navy had to scrutinize to determine if there were marine mammals there.",
  "Well, the increase -- you keep saying it's just 1,000 yards. But it's 1,000 yards of circle. And if I remember high school geometry right, that's a squared increase.",
  "And there are people in airplanes?",
  "Not just straight ahead.",
  "I guess my question was, that increases the area exponentially that has to be scrutinized. And I don't see why, as you said, that was wrong.",
  "Well, that's very unfair. There were six conditions imposed by the district court. The Navy didn't even appeal four of them. They gave up on four out of the six issues. That's not insisting on having it their way.",
  "The other ways it struck me how the district court relied on the fact that the Navy had taken actions to protect marine mammals in the past to say well, there can't be any problem with adding more protection. No good deed goes unpunished.",
  "They had already taken actions unilaterally to protect marine mammals. Now you say that wasn't.",
  "But they were taking some actions.",
  "Can I -- can I derail you a little bit to get back to the balance of equities question? As I read the opinions most of the balancing here was done by the Ninth Circuit, not the district court. I found the district court's balancing in only one sentence. The court after all of its prior -- the court is also satisfied that the balance of hardships tips in favor -- favor of granting an injunction. \" It goes on. But it's just one sentence. The Ninth Circuit talked about deferring to the district court but in fact it supplied all the balance of the analysis for the balance.",
  "Suppose it's still fair to say that on all of those it focused most of its attention on likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm rather than a balancing of the equities.",
  "I think that's -- I think that's quite right. My question, though, is that at no point that did the district judge undertake a balancing of the equities, putting on the one side the potential for harm to marine mammals that she found -- and that's your point about the record -- and putting on the other side the potential that a North Korean diesel electric submarine will get within range of Pearl Harbor undetected. Now, I think that's a pretty clear balance. And the district court never entered -- never went into that analysis.",
  "Even the district - - even the district court recognized, in the words of her opinion, that it would propose \"a substantial challenge\" -- that's a quote -- for the Navy to shift the regime that she imposed in the injunction.",
  "Mr. Kendall, you wanted to respond to some comments by the Solicitor General. I wanted to make sure that you've had an opportunity to do that. I -- you were derailed by questioning, but I know you responded to some. Are you - -",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre, have you one minute remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 07-463, Summers v. Earth Island Institute. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "And that was before the project was undertaken?",
  "Your friend on the other side says that that doesn't make too much sense because the issue in every case is going to be the same, a purely legal issue, and so waiting for the application doesn't make any sense.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Kenna.",
  "The Ninth Circuit relied on it at least as an alternative ground, correct?",
  "Counsel, to read just one sentence to you from the National Wildlife Federation case, because I think it's the biggest hurdle you face. It's on page 15 of the government's brief. It says: \"A regulation is not ordinarily consider the type of agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA until the scope of the controversy has been reduced to more manageable proportions and it's factual components flushed out by some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant's situation.\" It seems like a high hurdle for you to surmount.",
  "That's the Abbott Labs exception, isn't it? I don't think anybody suggests that that is applicable here.",
  "But that's when his primary conduct is nonetheless going to be affected?",
  "You know, the drug companies have to do something. Well, they don't -- you know, they have to do it before they can -- they don't have to wait until they are sent to jail to say that their conduct has been affected.",
  "But you have not pointed to a particular fact under any of these affidavits when it was applied to any of the plaintiffs. In what the National Wildlife Federation case said, \"Some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant's situation. \"",
  "You haven't shown any standing with respect to the Burnt Ridge Project on an ongoing basis because that has been settled. It's outweighed -- it's out the door.",
  "So it's in for a penny, in for a pound. If you show standing with respect to discreet action D, you can challenge A, B, and C?",
  "Counsel, I now have footnote 2, and it refers, as you say, to a particular measure that applies across the board to all individual classifications. It goes on to say, which is final, \"and has become ripe for review in the manner we discussed in the text.\" Then we say, or Justice Scalia says, \"it can of course be challenged under the APA by a person adversely affected. And although that may have the effect when they get a general decision invalidating a program, it says that a quite different from permitting a generic challenge to all aspects of the program as though that itself constituted a final agency action.\" So you still have to become ripe for review in the manner discussed, which was the sentence that I read to you earlier, and the challenge can only be brought by a person adversely affected. I don't see how footnote 2 undermines the sentence I have read to you at all.",
  "Well, it says -- it says, if it's become ripe for review in the manner discussed in text. In other words, if it has been applied to a particular individual adversely affected then, quote, \"a person adversely affected may bring a challenge. \" And I don't -- that seems to me to be a restatement of the sentence I read you earlier.",
  "That would be like in footnote 2, the general program. Yes, they are saying these types of activities we don't do the notice and comment and appeal. That's the general program. But you have to wait until it's applied to a particular individual who is adversely affected.",
  "You cut down a tree in the national forest without approval?",
  "Oh.",
  "And where is \"there\"? He would like to go back where?",
  "This isn't one of those after-submitted declarations, is it?",
  "Well, don't we generally not look at after-submitted declarations in determining standing?",
  "So if you -- if yesterday you submitted a declaration, we would look at that?",
  "The later filed, where along the district court proceedings were they filed?",
  "So if you lose that again, you figure, well, I've got some more -- I can get some more declarations. The reason we don't look at after-submitted declarations is because there has to be under the normal rule, an end to litigation at a particular time. It seems to me this would be an endless process. You know, every time the district court identifies a particular flaw, you would say okay, here's a declaration, and then they say, well, here's another basis, well, here's another declaration. I'm not sure that that's what our cases sanction.",
  "You filed them after judgment, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, you have three minutes.",
  "Thank you Mr. Kneedler. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-689, Bartlett v. Strickland. Mr. Browning.",
  "How can you say that this brings us closer to a situation where race will not matter when it expands the number of situations in which redistricting authorities have to consider race?",
  "It seems to me to be a criticism of the majority-minority district approach in the first place.",
  "What about influence districts?",
  "Do you move - - you've moved from majority-minority to crossover districts. Should you continue to move to so-called influence districts?",
  "Well, I would have thought the possibility of coalition districts would be evidence that the Voting Rights Act has succeeded, rather than evidence that you need to apply it more broadly.",
  "Well, I mean, the obvious question when you say 15 to 30 percent is what number of crossover voters would you say demonstrates that you no longer need to consider race in shifting a coalition district?",
  "Of course, it could be 70 percent that don't vote for a particular candidate. At some point you have to conclude that it's based on the candidate rather than on race.",
  "What is the answer? What percentage of crossover voting would make this not actionable under section 2?",
  "So you don't have an answer to Justice Alito's question?",
  "Under your theory, it would be possible to challenge a majority-minority district on the ground that you could draw a different coalition district, maybe more than one coalition district. Let's put it that way. If you could draw a majority-minority district and you could draw two crossover districts, does the Voting Rights Act impose a limit on the choice?",
  "That's an easy -- I suspect that's a common hypothetical. You could draw a district with 80 percent minority voters or you could have, as you have here, two 40 percent districts. And the Voting Rights Act requires what?",
  "We are fighting over -- the district that you want to draw, the crossover district, would have 39 percent African-American voters. The district that complied with State law of the county line would have 35 percent. Where the assumption is that you have a significant degree of crossover voting, is that really a difference worth changing the Voting Rights Act jurisprudence for?",
  "What do you mean by \"workable\"?",
  "Because it's 4 percent less than the district you propose?",
  "So it gets back to the Justice Scalia's point - -",
  "-- that this is designed to protect incumbents.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Browning. Mr. Thurman.",
  "Why in the -- why in the world would you stipulate to bloc voting in a situation where you have nearly 20 percent crossover voting?",
  "Well, but it seems to me you have complicated situations on a rather critical point, what seems to me a basic conundrum, how can you have bloc voting and at the same time have significant crossover voting? You take one of those off the table, it's kind of hard to address the basic issue in the case.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Joseffer?",
  "Do you have a view on how we should approach the stipulation adopted below?",
  "Thank you Mr. Joseffer. Mr. Browning, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "But it's a necessary predicate to his very question that the majority group, the white group does not vote cohesively. Under your hypothetical at least 11 percent have to swing over.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in case 07-751, Pearson v. Callahan. Mr. Stirba.",
  "Well, because the Fourth Amendment principle of consent was well established? In other words, if a police officer goes to the door and says \"May I come in,\" that is -- that is perfectly acceptable. Is that -- that the level of generality that you think we ought to analyze this issue at?",
  "Counsel, in every - - given the posture of the ultimate issue in this case on the underlying constitutional question, you do not have to prove that you are right; isn't that correct? You have to establish that the contrary principle is not clearly established?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Stewart.",
  "Why isn't it -- why isn't it an advisory opinion, if we do not have to decide -- to decide the ultimate question whether this is constitutional or not, but simply whether or not it was clearly established whether it was unconstitutional? Why isn't it purely an advisory opinion to say whether it's constitutional or not?",
  "No, no. Those are different grounds, it seems to me. Those are two independent, as you said. Here it's kind of a -- it's a progression. You first ask, either, under somebody's view, I guess, Saucier, whether or not it's constitutional or not and then whether it's clearly established. I just don't know why the first question isn't purely advisory, because you don't have to know whether it's constitutional or not.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Metzler?",
  "YOU -- was Mr. Stewart correct that you concede that if this person entering the house were in fact a police officer, that this would have been okay?",
  "That's a tough -- at least I find it a very difficult question. I do not find it necessarily a terribly difficult question whether that -- whatever the answer is -- whether it was clearly established, precisely because I find the underlying questions difficult. So you have a handful Court of Appeals decisions, you have got a factual variation; the issue is whether to extend the police coming in to a confidential informant, all of those questions are very difficult; but precisely because they are, it doesn't seem that the rule, whichever rule is adopted, is clearly established. Why don't -- and yet if I were on the lower court of appeals, you would say -- or Saucier would say, I have got to decide that very difficult constitutional question and then decide what's a very easy qualified immunity question. Does that -- why does that make sense?",
  "Well, I know you don't because you are arguing one side of it.",
  "But concede for purposes of argument that it is a difficult question. Why don't we just tell the lower courts -- we do it, we go right ahead to the qualified immunity question by not granting cert on one. Why shouldn't the lower courts have the same luxury?",
  "Why, because we need to provide guidance on that question?",
  "Well, do you think it can't come up any other way?",
  "Yes.",
  "Or a -- or a suit against the political subdivision, right? You could have sued some other political entity other than the officers individually, right?",
  "Well, but that was my question. There are other ways for the law to develop. The issue can come up on merits in the suit against the municipality which doesn't raise the qualified immunity question. If you come up -- if you have a search where a person sues to get whatever was seized back. You know, if there's a -- and also the option is, if the question of which order want to proceed is optional, the law can develop if the courts for good and sufficient reason decide to reach the constitutional question first. I -- I'm just wondering what benefit there is in an absolute rigid rule that courts of appeals -- I had a few of these cases in courts of appeals; I thought it was very odd that I had to go and decide a difficult constitutional issue and then not worry about it because in one sentence you say well, but the issue is not clearly established and so it's qualified immunity.",
  "Well, but my point though is that at least in my experience it was unworkable, or at least frustrating, in that we had to decide not just a factual question but a constitutional question in a context where it wasn't necessary.",
  "Doesn't the fact that there is a circuit split almost by definition mean that it's not clearly established?",
  "If the Tenth Circuit says this is not allowed, and every other circuit since the Tenth Circuit's decision has held that it is, is that clearly established that it's not allowed in the Tenth Circuit?",
  "Then it is irrelevant. Then it is irrelevant that ten other circuits have decided it differently.",
  "Well, right, but do the police officers get to decide that? Do they get to decide that not only Judge Posner thinks this, but ten other circuits think this, and it has been five years since the Tenth Circuit. I mean, do they have to go through that type of analysis?",
  "Do any of the other cases involve -- the other circuit cases involve confidential informants as opposed to police officers?",
  "Yes.",
  "So at the time every circuit other than the -- you know, if there is a police officer and a confidential informant, I think that could be considered a police officer because he is going to call the police in -- every court of appeals decision involving a confidential informant said it was okay.",
  "And in those circuits, did the court focus on the distinction between the police officer and the confidential informant?",
  "Do you believe that -- what is the appropriate level of generality to look at in addressing this question, a case involving a confidential informant?",
  "Why is that?",
  "Why isn't it that the issue hasn't come up, this question of a confidential informant is one that hasn't come up? Why would we say that is presumptively unconstitutional?",
  "No, but then he is going to get sued.",
  "How do you decide whether the confidential informant should be considered an employee of the police? Let's say this is the tenth undercover operation he has engaged in. They give him $100 after every undercover operation. I mean, is he an employee of the police department?",
  "Why doesn't -- that doesn't make him an agent of the police?",
  "He wasn't acting on his own. He was acting for the police. He didn't decide I'm going to do this and -- because you know, I want to do it, and it just so happens the police are involved as well.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stirba, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel, the case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 07-901, Oregon v. Ice. Ms. Williams.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lannet.",
  "Could I get back to the question Justice Scalia asked about Apprendi. Is it -- is it your position that if the offense, based on all facts found by a jury, carried a maximum sentence of 30 years, but there was a provision that the judge could determine that if a firearm was not used in the offense, you would lower it to 10 years, would that pose a problem under Apprendi?",
  "Then it does. All the facts authorize a punishment of 30 years. And if it's going to be a reduction, that's for the judge. But I would suppose it's not the problem -- we didn't interpose a jury between the defendant and the State with respect to every element, but only those elements that increase the punishment.",
  "What if under the law the judge upon sentencing is supposed to make a determination of where the defendant should be sent, which facility, based on determination of which one has the most room. Is that a determination that has to be made by the jury?",
  "Even if one was, you know, the most horrendous prison in history and the other was one of -- a country club?",
  "Yes, but here in my hypothetical it's something that a judge puts in the sentence. It's just like you've got to, you know, make restitution, you are not eligible for parole, you are going to this place rather than that place.",
  "What if the -- what if the rule were that all sentences should be concurrent unless the defendant has been convicted of a prior federal offense and then the sentence runs consecutive to the federal sentence?",
  "Even if it's subject to judicial review for judicial review for abuse of discretion?",
  "That doesn't give you an entitlement to that, to the exercise of discretion that isn't abused?",
  "Ms. Williams. You have four minutes.",

  "We'll hear argument next in Case 07-544, Hedgpeth versus Pulido. Mr. Friedlander.",
  "It seems to me that you're arguing one of two things: First, that there was no error at all under Stromberg; or second, that if there was error, it was harmless error. And I thought the case was about whether or not the Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that harmless error analysis didn't apply to a Stromberg error.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shah.",
  "Suppose it's not, in the abstract anyway, necessarily true that this case follows a fortiori, because here, at least you have a valid theory. That may make it a harder case, because the jury had based its entire verdict on an invalid theory. It may be more difficult than a situation where you've got a theory of the case that is invalid because a particular element is missing. And you can look and see whether or not that was harmless or not.",
  "Well, I guess, though, the point is when you have invalid and valid theories, it would be a little harder than Neder, because they don't have to make any findings under the valid theory. You know, because you don't just have to fill in a missing piece of the puzzle, as in Neder. You have to -- they might have been working on an entirely different puzzle.",
  "So what we are talking about, in other words, is the application of harmless error, which may or may not be harder in the multiple theory case, and not the question of whether harmless error analysis should be applied.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Shah. Mr. O'Connell.",
  "So the error wasn't harmless. And that's an argument you can make before the Ninth Circuit on remand.",
  "Well, why don't we just take them at their word? As you say, they are applying the wrong nomenclature. It would be easy enough for them when they get it back to say, oh, we meant, you know, harmless error under Brecht. But that seems to me to be at least an open question.",
  "Under Brecht, you have the burden of showing a substantial injurious effect.",
  "So you think you win under Brecht?",
  "You think the Ninth Circuit, although it didn't use that label, actually applied the Brecht standard?",
  "Sure. Well, then it seems to me you agree with your friend that the Brecht standard -- and the government -- that the Brecht standard applies.",
  "And all the fight is over is whether the Ninth Circuit applied that standard or not?",
  "Why don't we just send it back and ask them? Say: We can't tell. The parties are having disagreement about what you did. What did you do?",
  "Thank you, Mr. O'Connell.",
  "Mr. Friedlander, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Friedlander. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-772, Waddington v. Sarausad. Mr. Collins.",
  "But you think it was right?",
  "It doesn't -- your point is that it doesn't go to the \"aiding\" issue.",
  "But even, again, I think you are taking on too high a burden. You don't have to show that the jury properly understood it. You don't even have to show that it's reasonable. You have to show the opposite -- or your friend has to show the opposite, that there is no way that the jury could have understood this correctly or applied the correct constitutional law. That is, if there is a way, then it's -- it's not objectively unreasonable.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher.",
  "Well -- but is that the standard? You said there is -- they are saying that it's not reasonably likely, but that's not the standard. They have -- you have to show that it's objectively unreasonable to show that the -- to assume that the State got it correct.",
  "You might be able to and you might -- as I understood you to say earlier, you could read it one way or you could say it another way. And if that's the case, it's hard to say that reading it one way is objectively unreasonable when the State court reads it that way.",
  "So it is not objectively unreasonable for the State to instruct jurors as they did? If that's all you had, then that would be the point.",
  "I don't think that your reading of question three is definitive. I think it's like the instruction, the jury could read it one of two ways. If you look at question three, the issue could be whether others could have had an intent, in other words, others in the group, not simply -- it doesn't show that the accomplice doesn't have to have the requisite intent.",
  "That's not the question. There are a number of areas, and I think the first two questions point in the opposite direction. They do not say we don't know whether it's \"the crime\" or \"a crime\". Their questions, neither one, two or three focus on that. It's a more general question that we could read the opposite way. Perhaps you can read it the way you are, even though it doesn't say is it \"the crime\" or \"a crime\". But there again, I think it's incorrect to say it's quite clear that the question -- and certainly not questions one and two, I mean question three is your strongest one -- but it's still not clear that they are focusing on the \"the/a\" issue.",
  "Counsel, AEDPA of course requires that this be an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law. What is the clearly established Federal law that was unreasonably applied?",
  "So that's articulated at a fairly general level.",
  "In Yarborough, we've said that the more general the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in a case-by-case determination. So you have a very general rule, and to find an unreasonable application, the court has broad leeway because it is a general rule. And you've already said that the instruction does not establish unreasonable application. Given that, isn't it pertinent, although people have objected -- you've objected to the idea that, well, all they did was send them back with the instruction. So they sent them back with something that you said could be reasonably interpreted correctly. So why isn't that -- why doesn't that -- given the leeway the State court has because this is a general rule, why isn't that sufficient to refute the idea of unreasonable objective? Yes.",
  "You've already said that the instruction doesn't get you there. And I just heard you say that, with respect to the questions, we can dispute what the jury was asking. So it's hard for me to see where you get the objectively unreasonableness if you can read the instruction correctly, if it's -- if you can't tell what the jury was asking, you don't know that they were reflecting the confusion you have here. So is all you're left with the prosecutor's statements?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Collins, you have four minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1249, Wyeth v. Levine. Mr. Waxman.",
  "I'd like you to address the distinction between the medical device area and the drug area because in the medical device area, of course, you have an express pre-emption clause, while here in contrast you don't.",
  "If that's true you would have expected the Federal Drug Act to have a similar express pre-emption provision. And one reason perhaps that it didn't is that when the Drug Act was passed you had an established background of State actions; when the Medical Device Act was passed you didn't.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Frederick.",
  "What about the various portions of the label in the record that Mr. Waxman addressed and Mr. Kneedler, representing the FDA, said they specifically considered IV push risks?",
  "Well, they have to. When they determine that it's safe to use it under those circumstances that necessarily includes a consideration of the risk. People can say it's safe for you to walk down the sidewalk. That doesn't mean there is no risk that you get hit by lightning or something else. It just means in evaluating them together, they determine that it's worth the candle in particular cases where a physician determines that that's the indicated method.",
  "I thought your -- I thought your theory was that this type of administration of the drug should not be allowed. The label should not say here are the risks, here are the benefits. You - - your jury theory was you cannot suggest in the labeling that physicians should have this available.",
  "Well, it simply says that if you go ahead with the label like this, you don't have to pay $10 million whenever it comes wrong. That's having the effect, as our case has established, imposing a limitation on the label.",
  "So your case depends upon us determining that the risk at issue here that was presented to the jury was a new risk that the FDA did not consider?",
  "Suppose - -",
  "So now, your friends on the other side said there was specific consideration of IV push as opposed to simply arterial exposure, and that that is laid forth in the labeling. So, as I understood your answer to be, all we have to do is simply look at the record, and if we think the FDA considered specifically IV push risks as opposed to general arterial exposure, then you lose, and if we determine that they did not, then they lose.",
  "Well, I don't know if the Vermont Supreme Court was emphatic about it. I mean, the record is either -- addresses the FDA -- I'm more interested in what the FDA was emphatic about, and they either address IV push separately or they don't.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman, you have three minutes remaining.",

  "What about -- what about the additional definition in section 19 of \"tribe,\" which is not limited the way the first sentence is?",
  "My understanding - - maybe I've got this wrong, but there was not then, as there is now, a list of tribes that are recognized and under Federal jurisdiction. So how -- how do you tell in 1934 who is under Federal jurisdiction?",
  "But I guess the point is that, given the weight that you are placing on the word \"now,\" you would think there was some clear way to say who was recognized before then and who was recognized after that. And I -- I just don't know what the test of recognition was in 1934. But if they were drawing -- if Congress were drawing a sharp line, presumably, it would be based on a sharp distinction; and, yet, as I understand it, there is no real sharp distinction.",
  "No. No. No. That's not true, because now you have a very clear system. You are recognized if you are on the list. If you don't -- you know, maybe you shouldn't be on the list; maybe you should be. But you are recognized if you are on the list. That wasn't the case in 1934.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Maynard.",
  "So -- so the statute reads the same whether \"now\" is in there or not? You read it as saying any recognized Indian tribe under Federal jurisdiction.",
  "So you're saying the only way that makes sense is to read it as if it weren't there.",
  "Oh, so you're applying now, when you're talking about who is of Indian descent - -",
  "-- Indian descent of those in 1934, but not when it's determining -- in other words, you say the Indian descent as of when?",
  "Oh, I see.",
  "What do you do about United States v. John? There the Court in describing an Indian, Indian descent, went out of their way to include in brackets the phrase \"any recognized in 1934 tribe now under Federal jurisdiction\"?",
  "Well, but it -- it may have shown it's ambiguous, but it shows how -- shows how we resolved the ambiguity.",
  "This is -- we are talking about an extraordinary assertion of power. The Secretary gets to take land and give it a whole different jurisdictional status apart from State law and all -- wouldn't you normally regard these types of definitions in a restrictive way to limit that power instead of saying whenever he wants to recognize it, then he gets the authority to say this is no longer under Rhode Island jurisdiction; it's now under my jurisdiction?",
  "Well, how do we know which one of them benefits the Indian? I mean, have the Indians benefited from Federal jurisdiction in the last 50 years?",
  "What are the plans the Indians have of doing with the land once it's determined to be Indian land subject to trust of the Federal Government?",
  "Yes, of course, the use of that land would not be limited to housing, right? They could engage in other activities that Indian tribes can engage in, correct?",
  "Of course, your friend on the other side says the exact opposite. It was backward-looking. They had had the allotment policy, which they decided was not a good idea, and yet, that had resulted in Indian land being turned over to in fee simple, and this is a way to compensate for the discredited allotment policy. So, if you weren't recognized in 1934, you were not penalized by the allotment policy, so you didn't need the benefit. I think that backward-looking perspective seems to make perfect sense.",
  "An Indian -- an Indian community. Now, if we are looking for a definition of \"Indian,\" we go back to the first sentence.",
  "Well, if it does it four times, you ought to give effect to it at least once. It says \"Indian tribes now under Federal jurisdiction.\" It seems to me that that is the key restriction, and that it's not taken away by that last sentence, which again reiterates that it's \"Indian tribe.\" And then in the last clause to which you refer, it's still \"Indians residing on one reservation.\"",
  "It's a defined term.",
  "Of course if we just -- I'm sorry to jump back to the other provision, but if we disagree with your interpretation and Congress thinks we are wrong they can pass another one of these 15, 16 provisions that they have that says this tribe is -- is recognized now.",
  "Well -- I'm sorry to keep you there longer than you may want to be.",
  "Why -- why else - - why would Congress then enact these 15 or 16 separate provisions if they think the -- if in this provision they think it's not necessary?",

  "I think Justice Stevens's question highlights for me one of the confusing parts of this case. You sort of paired off a number of the people who would otherwise be covered, and you are left with the county employees. If you had started with the county employees, is this how you would have gone about telling them they can't do this? I mean the county employers. Would you have passed a law saying that the county employers are not allowed to have this checkoff? If you think they are part of the State, I guess you could have just written them a letter and say don't do this, right?",
  "Yes, because the State couldn't - -",
  "No other organization other than the Federal, State and local governments.",
  "Are there other areas in which the State exercises the authority you're asserting here with respect to county employers, telling them what they can and can't do?",
  "I mean more generally. Your assertion is that this is part of the State, and therefore, as I gather, it's conceded on the other side, this is acceptable with respect to State employees but not other public employers. Are there other areas in which you act like the counties are part of the State?",

  "I'm looking for a specific example. I mean, maybe counties or municipalities, you know, contract for trash collection or water services and maybe the State tells them, look, you've got to deal with these people, you've got to do it by open bidding, whatever.",
  "Well, that's - - since I asked the question, I think it's necessary. So what's the best example where the State exercises control over what the counties would otherwise have discretion to do? You mentioned school districts. Is that -- is that an area?",
  "I -- I didn't hear you. You think that's what?",
  "That depends -- I mean the whole case turns on -- and the response to Justice Kennedy, I think, would be -- if the Federal Government is simply saying you can do it if you want, that's one thing. If the Federal Government is saying you must do it because it's covered by the Federal Power Act, or whatever, that's different. If it's just a grant of permission, I would suppose the State can say, well, fine, it's okay with the Feds, but you can't do it because we don't want you to.",

  "Since our questioning has taken away from your time.",

This is -- this is something that governmental entities and private entities do, and they can either exclude this type of activity or they can't. And the problem with the forum analysis is it's all or nothing. I mean -- and both parties seem to agree: If it's a State forum, you could do it; if it's a private forum or if it's an open forum, you can't. That's not how we usually analyze these things.",

  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-582, Federal Communications Commission versus Fox Television Stations. Mr. Garre. Solicitor General Garre.",
  "Do you think, in terms of our legal review, it makes a difference whether it's a change or whether it's a continuation of a prior policy?",
  "I guess my question is, do you think a different legal standard applies when an agency changes a prior position as opposed to articulating its position for the first time?",
  "I suppose the most difficult case for you is the \"Early News\" case where you have just a fleeting expletive, unlike \"Saving Private Ryan\" and the others. I mean, how do you distinguish the \"Early News\" case from the ones before us?",
  "So the same -- if you had a news report about Nicole Richey and the Cher exhibits, they -- they could use the actual language, even though they can't during the -- the awards shows?",
  "But that is an entirely voluntary -- I mean, the Commission would have no objection if the F-Word were used on a regular basis after 10:00 o'clock?",
  "Well, I suppose the broadcasters' own voluntary determination not to use that -- that language 24 hours is a reflection of what they think about community standards.",
  "Still, I gather that's at issue with the constitutional questions. Does that still have the same force today when the broadcast medium is only one of several that are -- that are available? In other words, it seems to me that the Commission might not be accomplishing terribly much if it regulates a particular medium when all sorts of other media, media, are available that don't have the Commission's oversight.",
  "Thank you, General Garre. Mr. Phillips.",
  "What the Commission said is that the prior decisions or guidance was seriously flawed and we reaffirmed that it was appropriate to disavow it. It seems to me that is recognizing a change and rejecting it. It's at page 82a.",
  "That seems to me to be the same question that I asked your friend: does it matter? Don't we look at the Commission's order and determine whether it's a reasonable explanation, whether they view it as a change or not? It seems to me that they kind of said you can view it as a change because the staff had these decisions, and there was dicta; or it's not a change. But the point -- important point is whether or not they provided a reasonable explanation for their current position.",
  "What it says in State Farm -- what it says in State Farm is that an agency's view of what is in the public interest may change either with or without a change in circumstances.",
  "The reason there is a change is they looked at it and they decided it was wrong.",
  "You agree it's enough of a justification for the change that they think the other policy was wrong? They don't have to say circumstances have changed, the facts are different; it's enough to say, \"well, whatever the Commission used to thing, we think differently\"?",
  "And then explain why.",
  "But that's not the Commission's position. The Commission's position here is not when these words were used, people necessarily thought of a literal meaning; instead, its position is that the reason these words shocked is because of its association with the literal meaning. That's a different question than what was being addressed in Cohen.",
  "Then why -- why do you think the F-Word has shocking value or emphasis or force?",
  "Because it is associated with sexual or excretory activity. That's what gives it its -- its force.",
  "How is that consistent with Vermont Yankee?",
  "So, you are saying that we add to the APA when we are dealing with a particular area. Which of our cases - -",
  "Which of our cases supports that?",
  "Well, maybe sometime --",
  "-- to be in a position to argue your constitutional issue, but we can't assume that you are right on the Constitution in applying the APA.",
  "Well, when you talk about the rule of lenity, I mean, the point is that this change -- if there is a change in policy or whether it's adequately explained -- simply gets you in the door. They say then, once you are there, we just look at all of the circumstances and the context. So, we don't - - it seems to me in their enforcement decisions, their decision not to impose sanctions, their decision not to have this count against you in future proceedings, they are being very lenient.",
  "And this is where the context comes in. At least with impressionable children, that's dramatically different from saying here is an awards show, here is a celebrity, I want to listen to what they are going to say because I listen to their music, and he comes out with that, as opposed to a football. They know that, you know, somebody says a bad word in the middle of the interview. The context makes all the difference in the world.",
  "They perceive that. They know. I mean, it's one thing to use the word in, say, Saving Private Ryan, when your arm gets blown off. It's another thing to do it when you are standing up at an awards ceremony.",
  "Why -- the young football player is not a celebrity that they follow.",
  "The point is whether they are or not is the contextual determination that the FCC can undertake. All they are saying is that just because it's used once doesn't mean you are out of the -- out of the woods altogether. Let's look at it, and if it turns out there's no -- I mean, this is the point they make, that in one context, it's completely gratuitous; in the other context, it's not.",
  "Then why do your clients not use these words between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.?",
  "Why do you think it affects audience share?",
  "If you can take that into consideration, why can't the FCC make the same determination, that there may be some people offended by this, and if there are some people, as part of our statutory responsibility, we are going to look at it. Not that they automatically impose - -",
  "Not that they automatically impose a sanction, but that they're going to look at it.",
  "But that is not the appropriate approach.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. General Garre you have two minutes.",
  "Thank you, General. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 07-6984, Jimenez v. Quarterman. Mr. Goldstein.",
  "So, does your position depend upon the proposition that we are not free to consider sort of a second direct appeal as part of the collateral review process?",
  "I guess it doesn't -- or does it really make a difference? I mean, if you view the direct appeal that is the result of the collateral review process as part of the collateral review process, that time is tolled. And if you take your view and regard it as not final to trigger the process until you have another final decision, it kind of leads to the same result, doesn't it?",
  "But does that really matter? I mean, the whole purpose of the Federal statute of limitations is to make sure these things get done within one year. And if he waits a year before filing, then he's out of time under AEDPA.",
  "Right.",
  "Oh, but is that right? I mean unless you count, as I gather your friends on the other side would do, the period of direct appeal as part of the collateral review process?",
  "What about the State convicting, penalizing the defendant despite the fact that his constitutional right to competent counsel was -- he lost that right because of the failure of notification?",
  "Is this just a dispute about the label? Because Texas chooses to call the proceeding that you get if you are successful on collateral review a second direct appeal, you would count finality one way; if they just switch the label and say that is the collateral review appeal process, then you would agree with them?",
  "Well, except that you kind of elide the point that Congress and AEDPA quite clearly wanted these federal claims to be brought within a year. This seems to allow the State processes to trump the one-year requirement.",
  "You said that it's unusual for the Texas State to grant these. But presumably you could challenge the determination five, ten, 15 years later by the Texas court not to grant you a direct appeal.",
  "Yeah. Let's say this fellow -- the State court says, well, you know what, we are not going to give you another direct appeal. And he says, well, that decision was made in violation of my federal constitutional rights. What happens then with respect to federal habeas?",
  "But is he challenging the first conviction, or is he challenging the failure of the State court to give him another direct appeal?",
  "Well, that's I gather if he is granted the collateral -- the direct - - second direct appeal. What if the Court says no, we don't agree that you were denied your right to a direct appeal; we think you had it so you don't get another one. And he says that determination has been made in violation of the Federal Constitution.",
  "Well, doesn't it depend upon the allegation he wishes to make? Say he comes in in one of these proceedings four and a half years later and says, you should give me another direct review, I didn't have it. And the court says, well, no, we're not going to give you one. And he says, well, you give it to all the white criminal defendants and you are not giving it to me, so that violates equal protection?",
  "I guess my hypothetical supposes a new constitutional violation. And I am just suggesting that the fact that Texas doesn't grant this relief freely doesn't mean that that's a sufficient answer with respect to the abuse of federal habeas.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jordan.",
  "Can't we leave that -- and you suggest that it is a Federal rule. I am not sure that's right. Why don't we just leave that up to the States? I am not -- if I don't accept your friend's determination that this is a matter of substance rather than form, States have it -- excuse me -- within their control. Here -- your State calls it another direct appeal. Why don't we just take them at their word? And if they don't want to get into the business of having a Federal review of a second direct appeal that they choose to allow, they just call it something else. Call it a -- you know, the collateral review of a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and file whatever. And then, you know, under AEDPA that wouldn't count as a new final judgment.",
  "Well, I -- I was just going to stop you there. It doesn't say that starts to run at the expiration of direct review. It says on the date the judgment became final.",
  "-- by the conclusion of direct review.",
  "Do you have a case to cite for that? Because I understood your friend to say the opposite: That wouldn't count as an impediment.",
  "How do I resolve that dispute?",
  "When you say \"the first habeas petition\" you mean the first State habeas petition?",
  "Okay. I'm sorry.",
  "I'm sorry. What do you mean, \"(d)(2) tolling still applies\"? That the direct appeal time does not count against his one year?",
  "Well, I thought, Counsel, that your response to that was when you have a failure of counsel, that that is imputed to the State. So it is a removal of an impediment created by the State.",
  "So, do I understand correctly that, based on your answers and your friend's answers, there is no difference between the way you two in substance read these provisions? He relies on (d)(1)(A); you rely on the combination of (d)(2) and (d)(1)(B) and (d); except in the situation where you have a non-diligent prisoner, and in that case, his theory leads to a different result than yours. He excuses the non-diligence because the State chooses to label the second opportunity as final. You do not excuse the non-diligence because in the absence of diligence, (d)(1)(B) and (d)(1)(D) do not apply.",
  "Then it comes down -- it does come down to his, where he began his argument, which is he said that this is an unusual case where Texas is being overly generous to convicts, because you choose to label it as direct appeal and therefore that means someone that the States allow to have another direct appeal, even though they have been non-diligent, get the benefit of the -- of a new finality date.",
  "Thank you Mr. Jordan. Mr. Goldstein, you have four minutes.",
  "What about -- he cited most prominently the Evitts case.",

  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-499, Negusie v. Mukasey. Mr. Pincus.",
  "I take it your position is that there's no ambiguity in the way the term is used in the statute, as opposed to no ambiguity in some abstract sense?",
  "I'm sorry. Where - - the plain language dictates the result, where do I see that?",
  "If -- if they say that the plain language of the statute dictates a particular result, I say -- I suspect that that's a concession we are in Chevron step one, rather than two.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Pincus. Mr. Katsas.",
  "Where you stopped - - you stopped in the part that interests me, \"participated in persecution on account of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular group. When these people are forced to engage in persecution, it's not because of the victim's race or religion; it's because someone's got a gun at their head. So, you ask them, \"Well, why did you do that? Why did you, you know, whip that person? They will say: Because they were going to kill me. They are not going to say, I -- you know, because I was biased against his race or religion.",
  "Well, how do you know that? Why can't it just as easily modify \"incited,\" \"participated in\"? You have persecution. Did they participate in the persecution on account of race; or did they participate, again, in the persecution on account of what the -- what the force exerted against them was?",
  "Well, that just bring you back to what \"assistance\" means. If you - - normal statutory canon, you have got \"ordered,\" \"incited,\" \"assisted.\"",
  "\"Assistance\" can be read in the same sense as ordered or incited with terms of an active -- I don't know what it is - - predisposition or desire. Or it can be read in the manner you suggested, somebody who's just doing it for -- for the paycheck. So, if we read it in eiusdem generis terms, then I think your response falls short.",
  "Well, but that argument is at one extreme, where if this does apply as the way Petitioner suggests we assume the Attorney General can exercise his discretion and not afford relief. But on the other hand, it could go to some of the horrific examples that Mr. Pincus suggested; and in those circumstances the Attorney General could exercise his discretion to afford relief.",
  "And so too would, I gather, the person who is threatened with harm if he doesn't build the prison walls, right? He knows they are going to be used to persecute people and hold them in. I mean, if -- you know, if you push the extreme interpretations they go either way.",
  "Does he -- does he persecute people on account of race?",
  "We have a prison here; we are going to hold members of a particular racial group here, and we are going to force you to build the walls.",
  "Well, speaking of - - to get back to the language, what's wrong with saying, you have a clause that says \"otherwise participated,\" right?",
  "So that must mean, I gather, or could mean that \"assisted\" does not have as broad a meeting as you suggest, because otherwise the \"otherwise participated\" language would be unnecessary and redundant.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I'm not sure that's right, because if \"otherwise participated\" covers -- \"assisted\" does not include \"otherwise participated,\" and I understood your broad reading of \"assisted\" to cover the prison walls, and if it does, then I would say \"assisted\" needs to be interpreted with \"ordered\" and \"incited,\" and if it is, then \"otherwise participated\" should be interpreted along the same lines.",
  "So you think there was just a -- it was a belt-and-suspenders redundancy?",
  "What I may have missed, what was your answer to the prison walls? The guy who builds the prison walls?",
  "Is he or is he not participating in the persecution?",
  "Your concession - - statement earlier on, that there are going to be situations for judicial line-drawing - -",
  "And it suggests to me that BIA's discretion isn't applicable here under Chevron step two. Because what you are saying is this is not a situation where the statute never applies. In a situation where you can logically determine and your answer on the knowledge question is pertinent, you can logically draw a line between what a person's doing and persecution; and yet you said the c courts are going to have to draw lines. So BIA -- the board might get discretion with respect to where that line is drawn and when, but they do not get discretion on the question of does it ever apply. And what your position is, that this never applies, whenever there is a but-for logical intention between the action and persecution.",
  "But you would say the woman who cuts the hair does participate in the persecution if there is a guideline that says look, we are not going to execute anybody unless -- before their hair is cut, right?",
  "You would view that as a case that's not covered by the statute, even if the person is not going to be executed unless the woman does her job?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Katsas. Mr. Pincus, you have four minutes.",
  "Do they typically have views on the underlying persecution issue that is at issue?",
  "Yes. I mean, it is not at all unreasonable, if you have a clash between two ethnic groups in a particular country, that the interpreters are going to have views one way or the other. They are going to come from one of the groups of one or the other.",
  "It's not actually an answer but go ahead.",
  "You finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 07-854, Van De Kamp v. Goldstein. Mr. Coates.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Coates. Oh, excuse me. Sorry about that. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Is there such a constitutional obligation?",
  "I think you have the flip side of the same problem your friend has. In other words, the further it is removed from the constitutional violation or an allegation of a constitutional violation, the less need there is for immunity. The closer it is or the closer we must assume it is to a constitutional violation, then the immunity argument is stronger.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Rosenkranz.",
  "Why isn't - -",
  "Well, but that goes to the merits, doesn't it? I mean, if -- I -- you could develop and make the same point, saying U.S. attorneys are instructed in complying with Giglio and Brady in this way. But if there is a decision not to -- I mean, immunity is only necessary when you assume some -- there has been some violation. And so the fact that somebody else avoids a violation, it seems to me, is not a good argument to deprive other people of immunity.",
  "You drew a distinction earlier on between a determination by a prosecutor not to turn over certain material, which is absolutely immune, and said this was different. But what if the purpose of the policy is to not provide prosecutors with material so they can't turn it over? Why doesn't that go into the same prosecutorial core function?",
  "Why isn't that the same as the determination by the supervisor that, don't turn this information over. Here's all -- we are not going to share informant information because we don't think that should be turned over to comply with Giglio. The individual prosecutor they have says I'm not going to turn it over. Why isn't it exactly the same?",
  "I was surprised by your answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetical, because I thought it undermines your case. You said that you don't have to show that the data system is unconstitutional. You just have to show that it caused a constitutional violation. But it would cause a constitutional violation as applied in a particular case. And you would object to it in that case, and perhaps all this data sharing information system would be very good evidence in that case. Look, he didn't turn over this document. The reason he didn't turn it over is because they've got a policy of not giving them the document. But your objection would have to be based in a particular case. And we have already held that in that case there is absolute immunity.",
  "Exactly. Now, doesn't that just confirm the concern that has been expressed that all you're doing is circumventing the absolute immunity we recognized at trial.",
  "Even though the data system, as you've said, doesn't cause a constitutional violation. It's the application of it at trial. Now, I know that's immune. You say, well, I'm going to get around it.",
  "But you began this dialogue by suggesting that you don't -- I am saying - - you don't have to prove that what you are complaining about causes a -- is a constitutional violation. You just have to prove that it causes a Constitutional violation.",
  "In all the examples you just gave me, it seems to me the allegation would be that - -",
  "Well, but that gets -- it seems to me a fundamental tension in your case. When you are talking about the conduct, you need to link it to a particular constitutional violation. The data system has to be linked. But when you are talking about immunity, you want to say, oh, it has got nothing to do with the constitutional violation. It's just shuffling paper.",

At that point would we look to see what the crime of escape was typically like, most of them were breakout or most of them were the other thing? You have, I gather, two separate provisions, but what if you don't?",
  "I'm sorry. If that's the case, I'm looking at 720 Illinois Statutes 5/31-6. It's reproduced a page 2a of the Government's brief. And they don't -- it doesn't seem to be a separate provision, whether it's a breakout or a failure to report.",

  "No. No. No. No, I'm saying that he would testify, I guess: I run the lab, these are the people I hire, they know you how to do these tests, and this guy did the test. And since he was the one that the Government decided to -- on whose affidavit they decided to rely, that's the only person you could get. Now, you could -- to impeach him, you say, well, did you do the test? No. But you say, well - - but I mean you don't have a right to an analyst at a particular level.",
  "Well, a good defense lawyer would love to have the guy there. The first thing you say is: Do you remember testing Mr. Diaz's sample? The guy is going to say no. Just as was pointed out, I, you know, test thousands of samples. Well, how long have you been working with the lab? You know, just what -- what was your scientific background? When did you -- how does this test work? You put three drops of the acid in there. It turns color, whatever it does. How do you know that? What is the chemical? I mean, you spend three hours with the guy until the jury just doesn't think there is anything to the case at all.",
  "You're talking about the defendants or the lawyers?",
  "How do we know that this was prepared in contemplation of litigation? I mean, let's suppose the lab occasionally does analyses for other -- research purposes. They get a sample, they want to know what it's -- they want to test it, however they do it. Are we just assuming that it's prepared in contemplation of litigation because it usually is, or - - you can imagine a situation where the analyst really has no idea, other than perhaps supposition, why he is being asked to test the sample.",
  "Well, the question is it could be law enforcement purposes to test it for the police to use and educational programs that want the rookies to know what the cocaine looks like.",

Now why isn't that a suggestion that there is some leeway and subjective interpretation, and you might have different analysts coming out differently and so you need to get the fellow there and ask him well, how often do you -- how often do one of your fellow analysts disagree with your conclusion? Or this is subjective; I guess some people read it one way or the other one way; which way do you always read it? That kind of stuff.",
  "Well, I didn't -- I didn't go back and read the scientific treatise you cite, but you say some interpretation is required. So what type of interpretation?",
  "I think California did not join the amicus brief.",
  "What if it's the central issue in the case? The defense says, \"That stuff I was carrying was not cocaine. Either I was trying -- you know, I was going to stiff the person I was selling it to or whatever.\" That's the sole defense. That's not cocaine. All you've got to do is submit an affidavit from the lab guy saying, \"I tested it; it is\"?",

  "Counsel, I understand your objection to the reading that your friend would have us adopt, but you have the same sort of problem. I mean, you've got a -- if it reads the way you would have it, then the word \"that\" after \"an offense that\" doesn't quite work, and have you to add \"is\" before \"is committed,\" if you're going to keep the \"that.\" So it seems to me that this doesn't work grammatically either way.",
  "But you've changed the word. You read it as if it says \"an offense that committed.\" So either the \"that\" is out or you've got to add the word \"is.\"",
  "Okay. You use the word \"that\" in the first example, but you skip the word \"that\" in the second. \"That\" appears in the line and then comes (i) and (ii). In other words, that modifies both of them, and you're reading it that it's an offense committed, and yet under the statute it has to be an \"offense that committed.\" So you've either got to leave \"that\" out the second time but not the first or you've got to add the word \"is\" as it appears in (i).",
  "Romanette?",
  "I've never heard that before. That's -- Romanette.",
  "How do you -- I'm sorry. I'm not following why \"element\" is singular. The argument on the other side, I understood, is that the element is the use of physical force committed by a current or former spouse. So \"element\" is still singular. I -- maybe I'm missing something. What change would you have to make to the word \"element\" to adopt their reading?",
  "Well, but I thought the whole point of this was to get at violence committed by a family member, and if that's the critical element, you don't have to have two different elements, \"violence\" and then \"committed.\" It's violence committed by a family member.",
  "If we think that there are two awkward readings, yours and your friend's, and both of them require surgery, don't we resolve that under the rule of lenity?",

  "Well, it seems there is no Federal misdemeanor that covers this particular type of assault, in other words?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, how does that relate to the rule of lenity? I suppose, to get back to Justice Kennedy's point, you're saying that the lawyer would not only be obligated to read this, but in advising his client would be obligated to go back and read the drafting history and the legislative history. Do we really use those types of materials to trump the -- the rule of lenity?",
  "So the lawyer advising his client in the typical assault case is supposed to know at the time that only 17 States had this type of provision?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Giatras.",
  "Well, I agree with Justice Stevens. Read it without the word \"committed.\" It not only has the same effect, but it's more natural, because it's \"use of force by a current or former spouse,\" as opposed to \"use of force committed by.\"",

  "Well, if I could stop you there. The very first sentence in the United States Code, 1 U.S.C. section 1, says the singular includes the plural.",
  "I know, but basically what you're saying is we don't follow 1 U.S.C. section 1 because our reading is correct. If they said, well, it doesn't -- you know, in context it doesn't fulfill the purposes and therefore we read \"element\" as singular only rather than according to section 1 of the United States Code.",
  "And, again, not to beat a dead horse, but it's footnote 8 of your brief on page 23 that lists the 17 States. They include California, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia. That wouldn't be a useless act by Congress to cover everybody in those States.",
  "I know, but you point was this doesn't do any good because it's only 17 States. Those are -- there are a lot of people in those States.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 07-1223, Bell versus Kelly. Mr. Bress.",
  "Well, weren't the facts merely cumulative evidence of his claim that was before the State court?",
  "Well, I think that supports my suggestion, which is that the evidence was cumulative. There was a dispute on that issue. There was evidence on both sides. And now you say, hey, we've got more evidence.",
  "Mr. Bress, your - - you're argument that this can't be brought up assumes that it is a new claim rather than the same claim, right? Because if it were just the same claim then the question would be it is simply cumulative rather than new?",
  "Right. And I guess it gets back to Justice Ginsburg's question. We usually don't consider claims different if there is just new evidence, but here didn't the Fourth Circuit necessarily determine that this was the same claim in deciding to defer to the State court findings?",
  "And if fact you got more than you were entitled to, because it did look at the new evidence, albeit through the guise of deference, but it shouldn't have even looked at that at all.",
  "So if we think that they were right -- and we are, I think we are getting away from the question presented -- if we agree that they are right, that this is the same claim and it's just additional evidence, then you lose.",
  "I know, but they're -- your underlying theory is that if you get a lot of new evidence, that somehow changes the claim. And again, I think Justice Ginsburg -- I'm having trouble getting my arms around that, and particularly since it's problematic in this area where there is always new evidence. You're looking at someone's childhood. You can always find a new anecdote, a new concern going either way, that you know, this was unusual because he was a good child, or this is excused because he had such a bad upbringing.",
  "All right, well just -- we've got two but just to stop you on one. The fact that they excuse your failure to raise and present the evidence in State court doesn't mean that when you get the evidence you have a new claim. It just means that they are going to let you raise a claim you could have raised before.",
  "I've gotten over it.",

I mean, the more you say that the monument is Government speech to get out of the first, free speech -- the Free Speech Clause, the more it seems to me you're walking into a trap under the Establishment Clause. If it's Government speech, it may not present a free speech problem, but what is the Government doing speaking -- supporting the Ten Commandments?",

  "How far do you push that? I mean, what about the hypotheticals on the other side? I mean, you have a Statue of Liberty; do we have to have a statue of despotism? Or do we have to put any president who wants to be on Mount Rushmore? How do you answer those?",
  "So, it's frozen into time. Everything up until now is okay, but anything going forward is not?",
  "Well, I thought you said the Government can accept what's there and say that's our speech. But you're challenging the ability to do that going forward.",
  "Well, but it does all the time. The -- you don't get equal time -- the cigarette companies don't get equal time because the Government says the Surgeon General has determined it is bad for your health. It always suppresses alternative viewpoints.",
  "Does it depend on - - given the focus on public perception, does it depend on the content of the speech? In other words, if you came across a monument and it said, \"The Eagles are a lot better than every other organization, you should give money to the Eagles,\" someone is going to walk by that and say, \"Well, that's probably not the City, that's probably the Eagles.\" But the Eagles, you know, for all the good they do, did not come up with the Ten Commandments, and somebody is going to look at that and say, \"That's probably the City.\" They are not going to look at that and immediately say, \"That's what the Eagles believe.\"",

  "It wouldn't be unilaterally imposing, right? He would say if you're going to work for me, you've got to arbitrate, and that could be negotiated theoretically, and with individual employee. And -- I mean, the whole point, the whole benefit of collective bargaining is that that doesn't happen. You say, well, the employer has a lot of leverage if he wants to insist upon that, but it would not -- it would be a matter for negotiation between the individual and the company.",
  "Well, isn't that kind of conflict always present whenever you have collective action? I mean, you may be a particularly good worker and could demand a higher wage than the union has negotiated, but you're still bound by the collective bargaining agreement. That happens in every situation where you have collective action.",
  "Well, they don't have to be vindicated in particular ways. The individuals can agree to arbitrate these claims, and they would be -- the arbitration would be binding.",
  "Well, they may go the other way. They may say: Look, we don't like to arbitrate. In fact, the arbitration is of great benefit to workers, but it is very expensive to bring these claims, even with the prospect of recovering fees. Most of them like the idea that the union is going to stand up for them and take it to management, but they could say: Look, we don't want it. If -- if you are discriminated against, you know, sue us.",
  "But under my scenario, the employer wouldn't have to pay for arbitration. There would be -- there would be no arbitration at all.",
  "No. There is no arbitration. The employer says: Look, I don't think I discriminate. I've got a good record. I'm not going to agree to arbitrate claims. I'm going to make people go to court because there will be fewer claims brought.",
  "But the point is there are benefits to employees from arbitration as well.",
  "The employer may not agree to it. If he doesn't have any protection, if it doesn't buy him anything, if employees can still go to court, what's the -- what's the point?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Gannon.",
  "You have -- you have focused on the fact that Congress has given individual rights. But for the many matters that you say are the subject of collective bargaining, you don't need a statute. I don't need a statute to negotiate with someone whether I get paid $20 an hour or $15 an hour for a particular job. And, yet, that is something that you give up when you join the union, and you are subject to collective bargaining.",
  "Well, why isn't it -- why isn't it the same with these statutory rights? Why aren't they subject to collective bargaining as well?",
  "No. No. I am - - the -- the forum for asserting the right.",
  "Why would any employer want to agree to arbitration under this system? He gets nothing from it. You said you get the ben -- to arbitrate except when you don't arbitrate.",
  "That just begs the question that your interpretation of Gardner-Denver is correct.",
  "Your position -- so their position is going to hurt most employees, because assuming that the employer wants to arbitrate, the union gets something in return for agreeing to that. I don't know what it is, another 50 cents an hour, if you agree to arbitrate all these claims. Well, you don't get that anymore, because and employer is not going to agree to arbitrate if it -- if the employees don't have to arbitrate.",
  "Well, the employees have no -- no leverage. I mean, if the -- if the employer wants to say, look, if you want to work here, look, you got to arbitrate -- I mean, the employees don't have bargaining leverage. That's the whole reason you have a union.",

  "It also says \"clerk.\" We may not be judges, but we certainly have a clerk.",
  "I take it the usual practice is for the parties to settle this matter and submit an agreed amount to the Special Master; is that correct?",
  "So why didn't -- - then are we here? We are talking about limited amounts. So much more is at stake on the merits and why wouldn't the parties just say, well, when it comes to Special Master fees this is what we are going to agree to. It doesn't have to be limited to $40. You can agree as part of a global settlement to whatever you want.",
  "I haven't seen -- I mean the $40 limitation makes absolutely no sense, does it? I mean I never saw an expert who would agree to spend the day appearing in court worth being called an \"expert\" for $40. I mean the fact that -- I guess I'm just repeating Justice Scalia's question. The fact that Congress has picked an arbitrary number with no basis in reality doesn't mean that we should do the same.",
  "When we award the - - the special master's fees in original cases, do we specify who will bear those fees?",
  "Do we include the special master's fees as part of the costs that are allocated?",
  "Well, why -- why did the parties agree to it if we do it? In other words, if we say in our orders who bears the special master's fees, why -- why would the parties agree to it?",
  "Right.",
  "You mean Congress has done that?",
  "Thank you, General. General Suthers.",
  "So what if they said in original actions no fees shall be allowed to any special master appointed by the Supreme Court?",
  "If we allow -- if we allow Congress to regulate fees in our original jurisdiction in that matter, it seems to me that we've given up the principle and we are just negotiating over price.",
  "Isn't this an area, though, where we should be particularly sensitive? In other words, one reason that we were given original jurisdiction in these cases is that the States were afraid of what Congress would do in its own courts, the courts it set up -- might set up under the Constitution. I think it would be surprising if you told the States at the framing that Congress gets to regulate this original jurisdiction where you, for example, can sue the Federal Government, that -- I think that would be surprising. It would not be regarded by them as a significant safeguard.",
  "Well, we would want to get into the business because it's our business; and it seems to me that if you yield on a basic point like this, that you're giving up, who knows how much?",
  "What if -- what if Congress had done nothing? In other words, let's say they haven't addressed costs at all. Would we be able to set what we think are reasonable attendance costs?",
  "Pursuant to what authority?",
  "Well, if we have inherent authority over original jurisdiction cases, how does it -- how come it disappears whenever Congress decides to legislate in the area?",
  "Is a substantive level of fees a mode of proceeding?",

And the reason they don't have all these limitations and restrictions is because they didn't put in the cause of action. We implied it from the statute, and so it seems kind of awkward to say: Well, there are no limitations, as I said, when there was no cause of action.",
  "Did we rely on that provision in implying the right of action under Title IX?",
  "We will give you an extra ten seconds.",
  "Well, of course, Title IX is Spending Clause legislation, and that, under our precedents, imposes certain limitations on how we interpret it that would not be applicable under Section 1983.",
  "Well, the point is that that would then allow 1983 actions to circumvent those limitations on the Title IX remedy.",
  "I take it they don't have to bring these actions together. They can sue under Title IX; if they lose, then they can start a whole new lawsuit under 1983?",
  "Even if you have different -- I guess would you have a different set of defendants, right? You would have the school in the Title IX case, the individuals in the 1983 action?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Hodge, we will hear from you on behalf of the Barnstable School Committee.",
  "You are not arguing that the agency regulations have the effect of precluding the 1983 action.",
  "So -- I'm sorry, so you seem to be saying that they were right, that 1983 actions are not always precluded, depending on whether there is a difference in the issues that are presented or whatever. So you should never say that Title IX precludes an action under 1983. In fact, you should say that sometimes the issues that are litigated under Title IX may result in the fact that you don't have available -- you don't get relief under 1983, but there is still a cause of action.",
  "It's kind of odd to say that -- as I understand what you are saying, you are saying that whenever there is issue preclusion, the consequence is that 1983 is precluded in the sense that actions were precluded in Smith. Well why -- I guess I've gotten -- maybe I am repeating the question. Why do we have to decide that, and we would just say there is a 1983 action, but you may not be able to pursue it, I guess is the way to put it, if your claims are precluded or the issues result in the fact that you don't recover.",
  "Well, that's because we're still in the business of implying rights of action under Bivens. And it's different to say -- you know, if you say we are applying it, but as soon as Congress does something, we are not going to do that. That's quite different than construing a provision like 1983 which Congress has enacted.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Hodge. Mr. Rothfeld, you have five minutes, remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first today in Case 07-588, Entergy Corporation v. Riverkeeper Incorporated, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Joseffer.",
  "Of course, in the other provision it specifically required consideration of costs and benefits and it didn't do so in this provision.",
  "But just to get back to your television hypothetical, if you told somebody that you were going to buy the best TV available nobody would think you meant that you were going to buy a very cheap TV because, considering the costs and benefits, that was the best one. They would think you are going to get the fanciest TV you could.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Mahoney.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Lazarus.",
  "Isn't that -- isn't that exactly what they did here in listing what they call a suite of technologies or approaches that is available? I thought that was exactly what they did. They said for different locations, different technologies may be the best available.",
  "Counsel, your argument is focused on proving that your interpretation won't lead to insane results, as you put it. But you have to do a lot more than that. I mean, you have to establish that this is not ambiguous language.",
  "Well, if you get to that money in the bank, does this mean that best technology available changes over time? I mean, maybe the industry could have borne these costs two years ago, but they probably can't today. Nobody has money in the bank today.",
  "So you think they could have said, two years ago, this is what you have to do, but today they would say you don't have to do that anymore - -",
  "-- even though the technology is still available.",
  "Counsel - -",
  "You would have to agree, wouldn't you, that the panel's decision in this case overruled the prior panel's decision in judge Katzman's decision in Riverkeeper 1?",
  "Well, in Riverkeeper 1 what Judge Katzman said is that we think EPA was permitted to consider costs and energy efficiency in determining the best technology available. He was deciding it on the basis of availability, too.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Joseffer, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel, the case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 07-10374, Haywood v. Drown. Mr. Murtagh.",
  "Well, except in - - they said except in cases where the guards are acting outside the scope of their employment.",
  "I guess there's a difference. I mean, obviously Felder is significant help to you. But I suppose it's a difference to say they've redefined the cause of action under Federal law and said they are just not going to hear it at all. It may seem paradoxical, but the latter may be from a constitutional point of view the sounder characterization, because it's obviously not the responsibility or the authority of States to say, well, this is how the Federal law is going to be applied. But it might be their -- their -- within their authority to say, look, this is what our State court system provides and if you don't like it for a Federal claim, you have always got the Federal courts.",
  "Yeah, but `they are not really or at least you can view it as they are not discriminating against the Federal cause of action, because they don't allow the State cause of action of the sort you want to pursue either.",
  "Well, that's - - that's true. And Howlett does say that. But as we've pointed out on many occasions, \"jurisdiction\" is a term that covers a lot of different things. And at some point something starts to look jurisdictional, which is, look, we're not going to hear your case at all. In other areas, even if they call it jurisdictional, it really doesn't seem that way, such as, well, you've got to give this much notice or you've got to -- you know, maybe those things aren't really jurisdictional. But saying you can't bring the case at all strikes me as really jurisdictional.",
  "So if this were at the beginning of whenever New York was establishing a court system, and they said from the outset, look, we are not going to hear these types of cases, then this would be okay?",
  "No, no, that's mixing the two points. Your point I understand it - -",
  "-- is that once the court has opened it up to a particular type of claim, they can't say, say no more. So if they are setting up -- obviously we are not going to go back to whenever the New York State courts was established. But if they suddenly said, we are going to revise our court system or - or modernize it, and from now on we are not going to do this?",
  "So it's done exactly what the Federal system has done. So that if you have a money claim against -- that is going to be against the Federal Government, here's what you do: You go to the Court of Claims, you have to go to the Court of Claims; and in that court all sorts of special rules apply about notice and other things.",
  "Well, but in the Federal system if you sue a Federal official or a postman and in fact in reality it's going to be a claim against the United States, that has to go to the Court of Claims, too.",
  "I guess my point is that there's nothing fishy about what New York has done here. Which leads me to think, well, maybe it's not really discrimination against the Federal claim, it's a rational way to handle claims against the State treasury, just as the Federal system is a rational way to handle claims against the Federal treasury.",
  "Well, that just goes back to our previous colloquy about what jurisdiction is and what it means. I mean, are you saying that if we look at this and we decide yes, this does really look like jurisdiction in the real sense, rather than just a jurisdictional label -- if we do that, then you lose?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Murtagh. Ms. Underwood.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Murtagh, you have four minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1216, Philip Morris v. Williams. Mr. Shapiro.",
  "I suppose one reason -- one reason to think it may not have been decided is that, unlike the other situations you have discussed, it would not have been a bar to our consideration of this case the last time because, just as you raise the question in your second question presented that whether the award complies with due process, we may have thought there might have been an adequate and independent State ground on a procedural question, but we were going to go ahead. We granted cert on the substantive question on whether the damages award was unconstitutional.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Shapiro. Mr. Peck.",
  "You don't dispute that it's a Federal question whether that procedure is adequate and independent?",
  "Well, I -- yes, that's exactly right. And I think the purpose for the rule is to avoid confusion about the ground of decision for the trial court. If you have got two errors, and she says the instruction's no good, on appellate review you don't know which basis was at issue. There is no doubt here the basis on which the trial court was ruling, is there?",
  "To move -- to move from the trial court to the appellate court, if you are correct that there is this routine, clear rule of State procedure, why would the appellate court say, in its head, well, I could rely on that, but I want to decide this complicated, difficult rule of Federal constitutional law instead?",
  "So you think we just made a mistake in going ahead and reaching the Federal procedural rule that we reached because it was barred by this adequate and independent State ground that the Oregon courts had relied upon?",
  "But then I think your - -",
  "But I think your answer -- go ahead with your but.",
  "Well, I'm sorry. I still don't see that answer. You are saying they said yes, there was this rule of Oregon law, but you can still reach -- there might still be a Federal due process issue, so we just can't rely on that. And if that's true, then that seems to me to be a concession that this is not an adequate and independent State ground that would bar consideration of a Federal constitutional issue.",
  "I guess I think it's the more routine practice for a court, if you have a - - again, as you argue -- a clear procedural rule that bars addressing the substantive issue, to go ahead and rely on that. Now, if the procedural rule is difficult and of uncertain application, maybe you go ahead and say, well, we we're going to decide on the merits anyway. But it seems to me, under your presentation, it's the other way around. It's a clear and easy procedural rule, difficult Federal and State intertwined constitutional rule, and yet the court says, well, I'm going to do the hard work rather than the easy work.",
  "There is, of course, another way to protect our constitutional authority in this case. We are talking about procedures for addressing the substantive due-process challenge to a punitive damages award. That is the second question presented here. If we went and granted that question and considered that issue, we would have protected our authority to reach that question despite the procedural objections alone. Why don't we just do that?",
  "I'm not asking you to argue here today the second question presented.",
  "But if we have some concern, if there is something malodorous about the fact that the Oregon Supreme Court waited until the last minute to come up with this rule that was before it all the time, which was a State court rule that you would expect the State court to be addressing as a matter of course, then -- then we -- we can avoid having to address what we do in a situation, having to characterize the nature of that -- that consideration, simply by saying: Look, we are going to go ahead with the questions presented. We can decide it in this case; and to avoid having to reach that, we will go ahead and do it.",
  "I -- I thought -- Mr. Peck, I thought you just told me that there has been full and adequate briefing on that question.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shapiro, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "I wasn't asking to you argue it, either but I mean I suppose the procedure the parties would prefer, if we were interested in that, would be for us to grant the second question and then have the normal briefing in consideration.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1209, Peake v. Sanders et al. Mr. Miller.",
  "You basically have four cases in the courts of appeals to support that proposition, right?",
  "Well, but this is -- I mean, it's kind of the -- it's the first notice. It gets the ball rolling. I think it's like, you know, two teams and you don't tell one of the teams when the game starts and then you say, well, it doesn't matter because they would have lost anyway, there is no prejudice.",
  "Well, usually, when you have an appellate court, with a hard question, is easily divided, the case is resolved on the basis of the standard of review. What is the presumption, if it's a close case? And why isn't that all sort of what we are talking about here? It's a close case, and the judge - - the panel says, well, this side has the burden of persuasion, so we're going to come out the other way.",
  "Well, what if what they would have done differently is get different medical tests, or done something like that, or have the doctor in the prior testing who prepared the diagnosis look at something that they didn't have them look at before? In other words, it's not simply the absence of documents that they know they can submit or could have submitted. It's that type of question where nobody knows. I mean, you don't know what would have happened if they had the doctor look at the issue that now turns out to be critical, but if they had gotten the right notice they might have had time to do that.",
  "You know -- it's easy to look back and view this in the abstract legal terms, but we are dealing with lay people who are trying to get something from the government, which is always a difficult thing. And you have one notice saying you have got to show that this was during the service, then they get another notice or decision saying it wasn't severe enough. Why is it so difficult, when the government made a mistake in dealing with this layperson who is just trying to get benefits to which they are entitled, to say that the government has to show that it didn't make any difference, rather than requiring the layperson to do that?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Miller. Mr. Meade.",
  "No court is going to accept as a showing of prejudice the idea that, here, look at my client as a layperson who didn't know what to do. That's not going to be adequate, is it?",
  "What's wrong with Mr. Miller's response that at the very first level of review, you can start all over; and at that point you know precisely why your claim was denied?",
  "That was my question. Is it -- is it -- I take it it's more than just a stamp saying \"denied,\" right? There is some explanation in every case?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Meade. Mr. Lippman.",
  "You started earlier, at one point, to say how this actually worked out in your case. Could you just spend a minute to explain that?",
  "How it makes a difference in your case.",
  "So why wasn't that enough for you to establish prejudice, regardless of who had the burden?",
  "Uh-hmm.",
  "Well, you would phrase the prejudice in terms of what you would have done and what you weren't able to do, and which you can now go back and do if it's remanded. You don't have to have the evidence that three people would say he was complaining about the vision loss at the time. It just seems a reasonable thing to -- you know, maybe it is reasonable, maybe it's not; but the Veterans Administration has more knowledge about that.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Miller, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "So you think it's perfectly clear from that what gaps need to be filled in?",
  "When you have been saying \"entitled to a lawyer,\" do you mean entitled to a lawyer or allowed to have a lawyer?",
  "You can finish your - -",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next this morning in Case 07-512, Pacific Bell v. LinkLine Communications. Mr. Panner.",
  "You are probably feeling pretty good about your chances since your opponent has given up, right?",
  "Any question should we have about the Article III status of this aspect of the dispute?",
  "Well, you might be right, but, you know, with respect to standing we have held that that is an issue-by-issue inquiry, not a live case broadly conceived.",
  "Is there any way in which the resolution of their price-squeeze claim would affect their Brooke Group Section 2 claim?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Maynard.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Yes. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Blecher?",
  "Counsel, I am confused - -",
  "I am confused about what you mean when you say \"the price squeeze claim.\"",
  "Is that any different -- is that any different than a Brooke Group claim?",
  "So you still want to be able to argue that - -",
  "-- above-cost retail prices - -",
  "-- somehow violate Brooke Group?",
  "And you -- you agree that that requires - -",
  "That requires below-cost retail pricing?",
  "Is the wholesale price claim that the Ninth Circuit looked at in -- in the case below, in the decision below, a necessary or significant or partial element of your Brooke Group claim, or is it totally irrelevant?",
  "Well, I guess it would have been nice if you thought the case was essentially moot, to hear about that in the cert opposition.",
  "You didn't argue that the decision below was essentially moot in your opposition to certiorari here.",
  "Justice Breyer's draft judgment said we would vacate the decision below. Shouldn't we reverse it, because if we think on the price squeeze claim, as distinct from the Brooke Group claim, the Ninth Circuit was wrong. You don't just throw it out and let everybody go home. You say whether it was right or wrong. And if you are saying it's wrong, we would reverse.",
  "You are saying we don't have to cross the Rubicon because your Brooke Group predatory pricing claim will say that the prices here were below cost?",
  "So we don't have to consider, I guess, what I thought we had to consider - -",
  "And you are not going to amend your complaint to raise such a claim on remand?",
  "Which you understand to require that the retail prices be below cost?",
  "But the reason you think we should vacate is not because the Ninth Circuit didn't decide the question, but because you are willing not to press it?",
  "So, I guess -- I guess that's where we are about to go. But in answer to Justice Alito's question, if you think the Ninth Circuit was wrong and don't want to see those claims raised again, we need to address the merits and reverse?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Brunell.",
  "Well, that means they don't have to deal. They don't have to sell you the stuff if they don't want to.",
  "You mean a Brooke Group retail price squeeze claim?",
  "You can finish your sentence there.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Now, Mr. Panner, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is now submitted.

  "There is also a third thing that's uncontested, which is there is no Brady claim on the merits. That's not at all included in your question presented. The district court and the court of appeals concluded that there was no Brady violation on the merits. I don't know what would happen if we sent this case back. They would conclude it again.",
  "Well, but don't stop there. On page 25a, they've been talking about those federalism issues. They say: \"We need not be delayed by these interesting questions of federalism, however, because in all events the documents discussed in the dissenting opinion that were allegedly withheld are not Brady material.\"",
  "Well, but don't - - you've resolved your dilemma by not raising anything at all about the merits in the question presented?",
  "Well, let's start on page Roman xi, where the questions presented are. There's nothing in there about the merits of the Brady claim. It's all about the procedural objections that you have.",
  "I -- I guess what I would say is you've got - habeas review of that claim because the district court decided it on the merits and the court of appeals decided it on the merits.",
  "Okay. It seems to me you either did not raise the question or you did.",
  "If you did not, then we don't address the procedural issues that you raised. If you did, then also we have to resolve the question on the merits, a very fact-specific Brady claim that we would not normally take without reaching those procedural issues. So, I don't see why the procedural issues are before us.",
  "Our -- our cases clearly hold that when you have alternate holdings, neither one is dicta.",
  "Well, that's fair for the Respondents to say, look, there's no reason to take this procedural -- complicated procedural issue, because we win on the merits. And the court, as their view articulates, the court decided that question.",
  "I guess it's -- my questions and the questions and the points - -",
  "-- that was raised about the time are related, because one reason these things drag on interminably is that you are -- exactly why you're raising this issue here, it's a procedural nicety or a procedural difficulty that arose some time ago in the State courts. But since then the Federal courts, both the district court and the court of appeals have addressed it, and -- and that that's a good jurisprudential approach to say, particularly in a complicated case like this that is 26 years old, here's our answer on this, but so that we don't have to go through this again, if we're reversed on that, here's our -- our alternative holding; and they said right after the sentence I quoted, we said this before, and we now say it again: This is not Brady material.",
  "That would -- that would then depend on us agreeing to review a very fact-bound, necessarily fact-bound, Brady question when the questions presented focused on a procedural issue.",
  "I didn't look, counsel, at your -- I don't know if it's yours or your predecessor counsel's brief in the -- appealing from the district court here to the court of appeals. Did that raise a discussion of the Brady claim on the merits, saying that the district court was wrong?",
  "That was -- that was not a friendly question. My point is that you argued the merits of the Brady claim not only in the district court but specifically on appeal as well.",
  "So this wasn't sort of sua sponte addressing - -",
  "-- the Brady claim as kind of a safety net on the procedural - -",
  "Yes. No, my -- my concern is not that you didn't brief the Brady claim; it is that -- whatever the non-pejorative synonym for \"smuggled\" it in -- is you smuggled it in on a case that purportedly presented a procedural objection and a conflict on a procedural issue.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Smith.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein, you have three minutes.",
  "Is there anything in the court of appeals' treatment of the Brady claim on the merits that suggests it also treated them separately in the different silos, as you put it?",
  "Where do they say that they're only considering the categories separately?",
  "That's the 2001 opinion. Do they do that in the 2007 opinion?",
  "Thank you, counsel. I'm sorry, Mr. Goldstein, one moment.",
  "Did you raise - - cite Kyles in your petition for cert?",
  "Oh, I see it. Yes. Pages 30 and 32. Okay.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1122, Arizona v. Johnson. Mr. Parkhurst.",
  "Do you agree that there's a point in an interaction that begins with a traffic stop, begins with a seizure, at which the nature of that interaction is changed so that it's no longer - - so that it becomes a consensual interaction?",
  "Maybe I should rephrase the question. Do you agree that it would be unconstitutional for an officer to conduct a pat down after an initial seizure while that same interaction still continues?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Heytens.",
  "Do you agree that there is a point at which the encounter initiated by the traffic stop changes in some way that a pat down is no longer justified?",
  "Well, if the encounter is -- by \"the encounter is over,\" do you mean that they separate; they're no longer together? My question is whether or not it's a continuing encounter but transforms somehow in its quality so that the pat down is no longer justified.",
  "I suppose there is an argument, anyway, that even though the initial seizure is over, the consensual encounter continues. And at some point the officer, as a result of whatever happens during that consensual exchange, becomes concerned for her safety.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus.",
  "What if -- we've been talking about the officer approaching somebody on the street who has the bulge in his pocket, what if the person with the bulge in his pocket approaches the officer? Can the officer at that point, even if he has no suspicion that crime is afoot, conduct a pat down?",
  "This is -- this is like the rule in the Old West that the sheriff has to wait for the defendant to draw first?",
  "So in response to my --",
  "One moment. In response to my hypothetical, even though the officer reasonably thinks he is in a situation where he could be shot, he can't do anything about it, not even a simple pat down, even though he did not initiate the contact, somebody comes up to him?",
  "No, no, let's just say it's like this case: The guy's coming up, he's wearing the colors of the Crips gang and he has a bulge in his pocket. It's not a crime to wear that type of clothing; it may not be a crime to have a bulge in your pocket; but he nonetheless has a reasonable suspicion that he's being -- he's in a threatening situation, even though he has no basis for thinking that a crime is being committed.",
  "You're giving up a shield here, I take it? If instead of a pat down, the officer said, where were you last night at 10:00 o'clock, without Miranda warnings, you would say, well that's just -- that's just fine?",
  "Well, if you look at the first part of that, what somebody in Mr. Johnson's position would believe, how does he tell? I mean, even if the other officer goes to the window and starts asking the driver, \"Can I see your insurance papers,\" there's no representation that's why we stopped you, that's all we're interested in. They may have stopped him because they have reason to believe that that car was involved in criminal activity. They don't have to disclose immediately what's involved. So how can the passenger know why the officer is stopping the person in the first place? Hypothesize that he has been involved in criminal activity. He may think, well, they've caught me and they're just going through this charade to try to get information about it and make the people feel comfortable, whatever. I mean, just because he says, \"You don't have insurance papers,\" that's -- I don't think it's reasonable for the passenger to say, \"Oh, this is not about me. I can get up and leave.\"",
  "Well, what else?",
  "He is supposed to assume that it's not about him because of her tone?",
  "Your hypothesis about why she -- why he was free to leave is because of the tone of the arresting officer? The tone of the - -",
  "And there's no finding about the tone of the officer, right?",
  "Why isn't the -- why isn't the \"seizure\" and the \"consensual\" aspect also mutually reinforcing but kind of blurring into each other? It seems to me it's an awfully difficult decision for the officer to make. I stopped this person. I know under Brendlin that he is seized, and I'm engaged in a dialogue, and I have to worry that at some point he thinks he is free to leave.",
  "Well, you seem - - your argument assumes a fairly bright line between the point at which the individual is seized and the point at which the interaction becomes a consensual search. And I'm just saying that in the running line of cases, that line is going to be very blurry.",
  "No. The converse situation is that so long as the interaction continues, it is a seizure, and the officer can take reasonable steps, the pat down to protect, her safety. That doesn't have a line-drawing issue.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Parkhurst, you have a minute remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1015, Ashcroft versus Iqbal. General Garre.",
  "You don't -- you don't dispute that, whatever the policy was, that it was approved and condoned by the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI?",
  "Well, it may -- it may very well be, but isn't it, for purposes of a complaint, sufficient to raise a due process claim by saying what they say? In other words, you -- you may have a very good defense to it. You may have something that does not ever get beyond -- get them beyond the point of summary judgment. But for them simply to charge that there was a policy in which they picked up people and they held them until they were cleared, i.e., sort of demonstrated to be innocent in some way, that at least on the face of it seems to -- to state a due process problem under the Fifth Amendment, doesn't it?",
  "That -- that sounds like an argument on the merits of the Bivens claim, rather than an argument going to qualified immunity.",
  "Reading the Riot --",
  "Reading the Riot Act to the lawyer is protection against the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI after they're hauled in for discovery or subjected to depositions and the judge finds out --",
  "I'm sorry, Mr. Garre. -- the judge finds out that there wasn't in fact a sufficient basis for it, and that -- that will show them, if they get read the Riot Act by a judge?",
  "Thank you, General.",
  "Mr. Reinert.",
  "Well, that's a little bit different -- if I could interrupt you -- than saying, make the conditions of confinement as harsh as possible. It's saying, make the conditions of confinement such that they will not be able to communicate with alleged -- alleged -- other prisoners that -- that might be part of the same group connected with the activities on 9/11.",
  "Do you agree that -- to follow up on Justice Breyer's questioning of General Garre, do you believe that the same pleading standards apply in the action against the president of Coca-Cola as apply to the actions of the Attorney General and Director of the FBI on the evening of September 11, 2001?",
  "I'm sorry? Certainly or certainly not?",
  "So the pleading standard -- let's leave the president of Coca-Cola out of it. The local manager of the Coca-Cola distribution center, you can state that the same rigor required in the complaint that applies to him also applies to the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI in the wake of 9/11?",
  "But your -- your response then focuses solely on the merits of the underlying claim, not any requirement of -- of heightened pleading.",
  "Well I thought -- and others may know better in connection to Bell Atlantic, but I thought in Bell Atlantic what we said is that there's a standard, but it's an affected by the context in which the allegations are made. That was a context of a particular type of antitrust violation and that affected how we would look at the complaint. And here, I think you at least accept, don't you -- or I understood from your answers to the question on Coca Cola that maybe you don't -- that because we're looking at litigation involving the Attorney General and the Director of FBI in connection with their national security responsibilities, that there ought to be greater rigor applied to our examination of the complaint.",
  "Do you -- do you disagree with the notion that Bell Atlantic at least established that the level of pleading required depends on the context of the claim -- the context of the particular case?",
  "But that's also not the --",
  "Absurd and bizarre is also not the pleading standard, and how are we -- to follow up on Justice Souter's question -- how are we supposed to judge whether we think it's more unlikely that the president of Coca-Cola would take certain actions as opposed to the Attorney General of the United States?",
  "I was just going to say the -- the difficulty with wrestling with the case through the perspective of the hypothetical of the mice in the bottles is that it's -- it's by its nature particularly absurd, but what if the allegation is that the president of Coca Cola is individually involved in a particular price-fixing scheme? Then does this case seem so terribly different from the level of specificity Bell Atlantic would require?",
  "But that's easy. I hope that the Attorney General and the Director of FBI -- of the FBI knew of and approved whatever the policy was. What you have to show is some facts, or at least what you have to allege are some facts, showing that they knew of a policy that was discriminatory --",
  "-- based on ethnicity and country of origin.",
  "I'm sorry -- swept up? You mean they were in -- in prison because they had violated immigration and other laws, right?",
  "You can finish.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, General Garre --",
  "-- Mr. Reinert. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 07-543, AT&T Corporation v. Hulteen. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt.",
  "Before you -- do I understand your answer to Justice Stevens's question to be yes, it would be legal to adopt this seniority policy today?",
  "I understand, but we're --",
  "But even adopting the policy today -- which I thought was Justice Stevens's question, and maybe it's not -- that would be acceptable? In other words, it's not simply the fact that this -- the leave policy -- the seniority policy was adopted during the time prior to Gilbert?",
  "They couldn't adopt the leave policy. Could they adopt today a leave -- a seniority policy today based on -- today, based on the pre-Gilbert situation?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Mr. Russell.",
  "Could you -- could I pause? I'd just trying to understand your earlier answer. It just took me a little while before you got off on the other point. You're saying it was lawful at the time to deliberately discriminate on the basis of pregnancy -- Gilbert -- but that that was somehow unlawful if in fact your deliberate discrimination had a disparate impact?",
  "Well, maybe I'm missing it. Isn't it a bit unusual to say it's perfectly all right to discriminate intentionally, but if it has a disparate impact, that's not all right?",
  "No, I -- I don't think it's every disparate impact case. In a disparate impact case, it's because you can't show, typically, deliberate discrimination, so you look at what the impact was. But I guess I've never heard of a case where it's okay to do something intentionally, but it's illegal -- to discriminate intentionally, but it's illegal if that has a disparate impact.",
  "Well, but Gilbert said it wasn't discrimination on the basis of sex, because it said that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not discrimination on the basis of sex; and yet you are saying if there is a disparate impact on the basis of pregnancy, then it is discrimination on the base of sex.",
  "Is your -- is there any other -- can you cite a case to me where we have held there is discriminatory treatment, but that's lawful, but the discriminatory impact of that is unlawful?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Russell. Mr. Phillips, 3 minutes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 07-615, Ministry of Defense and Support For the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran versus Elahi. Mr. Bederman.",
  "Well, they could have agreed that they have a bank account somewhere and any amounts would be set off by that. That wouldn't make that bank account at issue with respect to their claim.",
  "So it doesn't matter that Iran recognizes that this would be used to set off a judgment it might obtain, because you just said, well they could -- a bank account could be used to set it off and that's not sufficient.",
  "That's the -- that's the only basis for your argument? I thought it was a broader suggestion that these are, to some extent, substitute assets for the assets that are at issue?",
  "Can you -- can you articulate a general test in a sentence or two about how you decide whether particular assets are at issue?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Bederman. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.",
  "But it's not our job to help you -- it's not our job to help you in other tribunals. If a -- if a judgment is moot, it's moot. We are not going to go back and tell the Ninth Circuit to revise its opinion just because that's helpful to you.",
  "So is it your position that that -- that is moot?",
  "So why isn't the consequence that you are so worried about under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act that this is going to hurt your position by the tribunal, the same consequence that is going to come from the fact that these assets are blocked?",
  "But - -",
  "I guess this may be the same question Justice Breyer asked. I mean, where do you cut this off? You've got the proceeds from the sale to Canada that presumably go to Cubic, and then Cubic, you know, builds a new facility somewhere with those proceeds and then sells it to somebody else. I mean, are those still assets at issue in the claims before the tribunal?",
  "Well, that's kind of a -- that's a broad assertion. In other words, so long as you and Iran get together and say this asset is at issue in a situation where whether it's at issue or not saves you money and gives money to Iran, that seems to be a very self-serving legal test.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "So that if you had these military assets, which are clearly the assets that are at issue in Iran's claim - -",
  "Cubic is worried about what to do with it and so they sell them to the Canadians but they keep the proceeds in escrow, under the theory that look we may end up owing this to the Iranians under the tribunal. Under the setoff, this may not be our assets, which -- I mean the Iranians have a claim to these. Would those -- would those escrow funds be assets at issue?",
  "Well, why is that very different from this situation, where you have an arbitration award saying that you, Cubic, owe the equivalent of what you should have -- what you would have provided to Iran, if there hadn't been the revolution?",
  "The agreement between who -- between who - -",
  "So Iran, I assume, would say, look, we entered into this agreement to take the place of what was at dispute. Which is what they owed us because they didn't ship us the arms that we paid for. I don't see that that adds anything to your argument.",
  "Right, so Iran says, look, you are not going to ship us the planes, whatever it is, you are not - -",
  "You were not going to give us the money, right?",
  "And we still have a dispute. So, I tell you what, you are going to sell this stuff to Canada, you are going to get some money from them, and we have got an agreement that that money is ours.",
  "Well, why would Cubic enter into a contract with Iran to give them money if it wasn't taking the place of the money they owed them in the original agreement?",
  "Do you know why it was pending for ten years?",
  "So the stayed because it was at issue before the Iranian claims tribunal?",
  "Well, but the point is, depending on how it comes out, once you give a argument to the Iranians that they can raise with the claims tribunal that will affect far more than your one single case. We -- the argument would be the United States is not living up to the obligations it undertook in the Algiers Accords.",
  "What provision - - can you cite me the provision where the Congress said put your thumb on the scale?",
  "11a. And how does that -- the title of the section says statutory construction. I just don't see what follows as statutory construction.",
  "You don't see any - -",
  "You don't see any problem with Congress telling us how to conduct statutory construction?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Bederman, you have two minutes left.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 07-8521, Harbison v. Bell. Ms. Chavis.",
  "Your interpretation would make all of the provisions of subsection (e) applicable in state proceedings, so long as there's been a 2254 petition filed?",
  "I'm sorry. Where are you reading, the first part, \"available post-conviction process\"?",
  "Well, that doesn't modify what comes before it, does it? New trial, appeals? In other words, if at the end of the habeas proceeding things start all over then presumably the appointed counsel represents the defendant throughout all those new proceedings?",
  "I'm sorry. I'm sure I'm missing something here, because the statute does say \"all available post-conviction process.\"",
  "So you're just saying a new trial because you succeed on habeas is not post-conviction process?",
  "Well then, if you look up earlier in the statute, it says \"shall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceeding.\"",
  "Why doesn't it fall under that?",
  "No, no, no. That doesn't work. The language you just quoted is simply to say when you get somebody appointed.",
  "You are financially unable so you get somebody appointed. Then you go back and say that person shall represent you through every subsequent stage. It doesn't say that, oh, if you suddenly get somebody else appointed, you know, then you can -- then he doesn't have that obligation.",
  "Well, then why don't we interpret the clemency provision the same way, as being limited to Federal?",
  "But then the use of \"Federal\" -- we were just talking about.",
  "I don't know why you just didn't take the position and say, yes, it applies to all these provisions. That doesn't seem to me a - - to doom your position at all. Once have you somebody appointed who helps you on the Federal habeas - - presumably they do a lot of work, they get up to speed on everything -- they ought to represent you through the next stage of available proceedings.",
  "Well, you see why -- I mean, if you say, well, the first part is implicitly only federal, that makes it very hard for you to argue that the second part is not also implicitly only federal.",
  "If you step back and look at the structure, it seems to me unusual that your interpretation would be correct. It seems to me that it would be more likely that Congress wanted this counsel to continue on in State proceedings, trials. The clemency thing seems a little bit more removed. It's a different argument -- you know, we're guilty, but show us mercy -- than what may well be the same sort of argument on the subsequent State proceeding as was raised in the Federal habeas. I mean, if I were writing this, I would want them to continue in the subsequent State proceedings before I would want them to continue -- before I would want to have them represent the defendant in clemency.",
  "It says \"adequate representation.\" And then later on it says the lawyers we appoint here has to have five years of experience, three years experience in felony trials. I think that is a lot better than most of the attorneys who are going to be appointed under the State system. So I would say: Look, this statute itself recognizes that this person you have appointed under the State system is not adequate. They say you have got to have five years/three years, so I want one of those.",
  "You put a lot of weight on -- I mean, the problem arises because Congress did not specify whether it was limited to federal or state. And yet you are saying they were -- what they clearly meant to do when they said \"executive or other clemency\" was to signal implicitly that it must cover state because there is no other kind of clemency. It's -- it's kind of a real round-about way to make that point, isn't it?",
  "Somebody's not going to sit there and say, oh, we put \"other\" in because we know that in the federal system it's only executive, but in the State system there might be others.",
  "That guy wouldn't suddenly say, well, maybe we should say this is meant to cover the State system.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jay.",
  "You don't doubt in the scenario Justice Stevens hypothesized that the federal defender would in fact represent the person before the State court. You are in an emergency stay situation. He's -- he's allowed to go to federal court. He does so. The federal judge says, you got to go back to State court. There's 12 hours left. He's not going to say, you know, get another lawyer. He's going to represent the person before the state court. And I gather he can do that; he's just not going to get paid for that.",
  "So he presumably - -",
  "So he presumably is spending a huge amount of time and resources on this - - in the nature of these proceedings, and you want to go back and say, all right, on this day you spent six hours redoing your papers that were filed before the Federal judge to file them before the State judge, and you don't get paid the whatever -- how -- what do CJA attorneys get paid these days?",
  "So he goes back and says: Look, you don't get that; you know, you get the $15,000 you spent on the last ten days on this but you don't get the $810. That -- does it seem reasonable to impose that burden on the public defender?",
  "Since you know as a practical matter, because of professional responsibility that person is going to represent the defendant in the State court proceedings.",
  "I'm sorry. Counsel, you lead.",
  "We direct our questions to counsel.",
  "What do you do with \"other\"? I mean, there is no \"other\" clemency for Federal defendants, right? It's just executive clemency?",
  "Counsel, you don't really think the fact that this provision was recodified helps your argument at all, do you?",
  "When I see that argument, particularly in a gray brief, that strikes me as tantamount to a confession of error.",
  "You were earlier resisting the notion that the particular legislative history here showed anything because of how broadly it may have been familiar, but there is no evidence at all that when Congress recodified this language it was in fact aware of the different court of appeals decisions you cite, right?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Jay. MS. CHAVIS, you have a minute left.",
  "How often has clemency been granted in Tennessee?",
  "One time in the last how many decades?",

  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Waldo.",
  "Of course, the provision that authorizes permits begins by saying \"Except as provided in sections 1328 and 1344,\" and 1344 is 404. So why doesn't that just take the 404 regime completely out of what you were just talking about?",
  "The discharges we are talking about have to be discharges of effluent, right?",
  "My question is, does it apply to solids?",
  "Well, I guess, I mean, does suspended solids mean there is some liquid involved?",
  "Like the discharge here. Now, I think Mr. Olson said these are 55 percent solid by volume.",
  "Is there a point at which it's proper to speak of it as a solid rather than a suspended solid? I mean, 90 percent by weight or by volume, whichever it is, solid?",
  "Right.",
  "You wouldn't think something that's 90 percent solid is wastewater?",
  "So if they were just putting whatever it is that doesn't have any water, concrete, into this lake, then you agree that it would be just the Corps of Engineers through the fill -- fill provisions that would govern that?",
  "And so, if they chop up the concrete and put a little water in so that it's easier to move, then all of a sudden it comes under 402 and the EPA's jurisdiction?",
  "I guess I'm just curious how that makes any sense, since we are talking about putting something into water. I mean, does it really matter whether you add the water before it goes into the lake or just the lake adds the water when you put in the solid?",
  "Even when they - - even fill -- even when they fill a lake?",
  "So when EPA regulates has regulated these for 40 years, which I assume is up until 2002, then it's -- it's because they don't go into lakes; it's because they go into settling ponds?",

  "Would that -- would that principle have to be clearly established by one of our decisions?",
  "Well, isn't that - - the fundamental question is what level of generality you look to determine what law has been clearly established? Certainly Strickland is clearly established.",
  "But as far as I can tell, the \"nothing to lose\" issue has not been addressed by us and is not clearly established. So why do we look at it at the latter level of generality as opposed to the former?",
  "So you think -- I guess it's not open to us to issue a decision on the \"nothing to lose\" question or we don't have to. It's the only -- the way we have to decide the case is to determine whether the Ninth Circuit's determination on the \"nothing to lose\" question was clearly established by one of our cases.",
  "I don't understand why you keep talking about Strickland. We sent this case back to the Ninth Circuit for further consideration in light of Carey v. Musladin. In that case we said that the grant of relief was unreasonable because of the lack of holdings from this Court regarding the potentially prejudicial effect of spectators' courtroom conduct of the kind involved here, which seems to me a much narrower focus on the level of generality than Strickland. I would have thought you would have said - - maybe you are saying -- that because we don't have a precedent from this Court rejecting the \"nothing to lose\" case, that that should be the end of it.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sevilla.",
  "And you reject it as well, I take it - -",
  "Well I -- I don't under -- I didn't follow that answer. You're saying if he does have nothing to lose, it is objectively unreasonable for him not to go ahead with it?",
  "So we have to look at this counsel's performance under Strickland, I guess, and determine whether it was objectively unreasonable in light of Strickland filtered through Yarborough?",
  "Counsel, talking about -- in Strickland -- right here. In Strickland, we said that if a decision by counsel is made upon, quote, \"thorough investigation,\" it is, quote, \"virtually unchallengeable.\" Now, which of these facts in the Petitioner's brief is wrong: That Wager retained eight expert doctors to evaluate Mirzayance's mental health; he retained jury consultants; he conducted a mock trial in which he presented mental health defenses to two juries; he hired a private investigator to interview friends and associates; he consulted with Mirzayance's parents and their attorneys; he discussed the case with a retained expert doctor after decision and his co-counsel? Now, that sounds like pretty thorough investigation of the defense you say he should have raised.",
  "So all the points that your friend began with, which shows his conscious deliberation, his knowledge not only about how to go about killing somebody, but also guilt, the recognition of the wrongfulness of what he had done -- all that under California law doesn't enter into a consideration of insanity?",
  "I understand that, but counsel here at the time retained eight expert doctors to evaluate his mental health. He conducted the mock jury trial. He interviewed the parents. He hired an investigator to interview friends. What you're saying is, well, here's -- if he had hired a ninth expert, he might have come out differently. That sounds like a thorough investigation under Strickland.",
  "So isn't that - - aren't you back to the \"nothing to lose\" argument? He conducted this investigation, which under Strickland we said makes the decision virtually unchallengeable, and you're saying, well, he has an obligation to proffer it.",
  "So he's got nothing to lose?",
  "I guess that gets me back to what -- what I thought the case was postured in, which is whether or not a case from this Court clearly establishes when you have nothing to lose, you've got to go ahead and present the defense, or it's a violation of Strickland. And what case is that?",
  "Well, I -- I understood your responses to the various questions here to, in effect, be arguing for that standard. You are saying, look, he was going to get the same sentence anyway. You know, all -- all your answers sound to me like nothing to lose.",
  "He made a determination -- he made a determination after a thorough investigation of the various points I went through with you earlier that it was not a credible defense. Now, maybe that was reasonable or unreasonable, but it doesn't seem to me to be -- under Strickland we said it is virtually unchallengeable, and it doesn't seem to me to be objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law from this Court.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Mercer, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "What would he have gotten in the high term?",
  "Why don't you - -",

  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1529, Montejo v. Louisiana. Mr. Verrilli.",
  "I'm sorry to interrupt, but isn't there a third, which is that you just don't assume anything and you wait to see if he makes -- says, \"I want to talk to my lawyer,\" or he could well say, \"You've told me,\" as was the case here, \"I have a right to a lawyer, I don't have to say anything, I want to talk some more, I don't -- okay, there's a lawyer, fine, I want to talk without my lawyer, I want to waive my right to counsel.\" Which he can do.",
  "Right. If you prevail and you say silence constitutes saying \"I want to talk to my lawyer,\" that's right. I'm saying that's a false, a false alternative.",
  "Well, but the rule you're asking for would apply across the board. How would it apply in a case where the defendant is given Miranda warnings, says, thank you, I don't want to talk to my lawyer, I want to talk to you. He's talking to the police. All of a sudden they bring a note in and say: They've appointed a lawyer. The police says: I just got a note; you've been appointed a lawyer. Do you want to keep talking? You would say that's a violation, right? And then he says yes and continues to talk.",
  "That's a violation, even though he knows that if he wanted a lawyer he could request one, he knows one's been appointed for him, and he's been warned that if he doesn't want to talk without a lawyer he doesn't have to, and he's in the middle of a conversation that he initiated, and the police says, do you want to keep talking? That's a violation?",
  "Early on, before the lawyer was appointed, he's given Miranda warnings and he says: I want to talk. He's talking. They say: Now, we just got the word; a lawyer has been appointed; do you want to keep talking? He says yes. That's a violation?",
  "Well, I'm trying to -- which stage are you talking about, before the lawyer was appointed or after? I'm telling you before he was appointed, the police did not initiate the conversation. They told him he didn't have to talk. He says: I want to talk. Now, you're saying it counts as initiating the interrogation if they say: You've got a lawyer; do you want to keep talking?",
  "How is he -- where is the initiation? Is it when he says, yes, I want to keep talking, after being told -- asked do you want to keep talking? Or is it way back at the beginning?",
  "At the outset.",
  "Isn't that what happened here? He had been given his Miranda warnings, right?",
  "Again, you are arguing the facts of a particular case, and we are looking at a rule that is going to apply across the board. In a particular case, as you say, the Louisiana Supreme Court said this almost violated his Fifth Amendment right. There are protections against the actual coercion, which it seems to me you're arguing. As I understood Justice Scalia's question, he says: Don't you have to assume that there is coercion even in the mildest case, not the most extreme one, but the mildest one?",
  "A right that you can relinquish, a right that you can waive, and all that's being suggested is that it is not totally determinative whether the police say: Do you want to keep talking, or if the defendant says: I want to keep talking.",
  "Right, and whether or - -",
  "-- whether or not your -- your dialogue with my colleagues about overruling Jackson -- putting that to one side, what you are arguing is an extension of Jackson from the context in which it arose to this context.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Landry.",
  "No, no, I didn't understand you to be doing that. I thought your position was once there's a request, there's a request, and that's enough.",
  "So I -- I suppose what the dialogue simply establishes is that like in any situation there's going to be factual issues about what's a request or not. I mean, he could say, the court says I'm appointing Johnson, and he says, \"Johnson? Is that the best you can do?\" And the question is, is that accepting Johnson or not? He says is that the best you can do? Maybe it is, maybe it's not. I mean, but the point is whether or not you establish a rule that requires some request, and in the odd case there will be a debate about what's a request or not, but the issue is the general rule.",
  "Counsel, why don't you answer Justice Alito's question?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Verrilli. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-88, Vermont v. Brillon. Ms. Rainville.",
  "It may have been a good concession below. I mean, it would -- as I understand it, the problem arose because of change in the contract, right?",
  "I mean, that may well have been attributable to the State.",
  "I suppose you are willing to concede that there are situations where the delay would be attributable to the State because of systemic problems?",
  "The State has so many cases, and it's only willing to hire one lawyer. That lawyer can't possibly handle all the cases.",
  "I suppose -- I'm not sure that we necessarily want to get into the particular details of a very complicated record, but there are several points in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion where it says that the failure of assigned lawyers to do anything to move the case forward is attributable to the State. And I thought the fundamental principle we were debating is whether or not assigned lawyers who fail to move a case forward, whether that is attributable to the defendant or whether it is attributable to the State because they happen to work for the State. And I would assume one way to dispose of the case would be to decide that general question and send it back for the Vermont Supreme Court with that guidance that they were wrong, as a general matter, to assign delay caused by the counsel to the State, to sort through the record themselves.",
  "Thank you, counsel. We'll hear from Ms. Kruger first.",
  "Ms. Kruger.",
  "Counsel, I'm sure you have gone through the record and, agreeing with Justice Stevens that the periods where there wasn't a contract, the State couldn't provide somebody, do count against the State, but disagreeing with the Vermont Supreme Court that when an assigned counsel fails to move the case forward that is attributable to the State and not the defendant, what's the difference in time?",
  "Yes?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Nelson. ON BEHALF OF the RESPONDENT",
  "Sorry to delay you.",
  "What is the -- what is the distinction in your theory of the case between delay and failure -- failure to move a case -- what did -- what did the Vermont case say: Failure to do anything to move the case forward? When do we know that that's attributable to the defendant, and when is it attributable to the State?",
  "Of course, if the lawyer is a do-nothing lawyer, then I suppose there's an ineffective-assistance claim?",
  "In the abstract, you have a lawyer who is a public defender or hired as a public defender, and he keeps asking for continuances - - continuance, continuance. How do we tell that that's the State's problem as opposed to what the defendant is doing through his lawyer?",
  "This is not an unusual reason for criminal defense lawyers in the private sector to ask for a continuance. It's quite common for the lawyers to go before the judge and say, look, I've got this other case going to trial next week, I've got this and this, can I get more time, and judges give them the first two but not the third. And why in a case simply where you're dealing with a public defender do you presume the opposite and blame the State for what's a quite common practice in the private part?",
  "My point is, I guess, how do we tell? I mean, if this is normal -- I think it is normal, I think it's quite unusual for a defense lawyer to be prepared to go to trial the first time the trial date is set. If it is normal, how do we tell?",
  "Yeah, but -- again, I assume that's -- there are probably cases in the private bar where that's true as well.",
  "What does your - - your argument do to the fundamental and I think quite vital principle in Polk County that public defenders work for their clients; they don't work for the State?",
  "Well, I guess fairly read, it does say the failure of several assigned counsel to do anything to move the case forward is attributable to the State, because they didn't do anything, I guess is the touchstone.",
  "Do you agree -- just following up - -",
  "I'm sorry. Just following up on your latest answer, do you agree that it has to be a systemic problem? I mean, you gave us that -- the situation where the lawyer says I've got 150 cases, I need a -- need a continuance. What if there's none of that? They've got, you know, 500 public defenders, and the -- but the guy still delays. He's responsible for not doing anything to move the case forward.",
  "Is it still attributable to the State?",
  "Well, when is that? The -- you have the same situation, the defense counsel appointed by the State does nothing to move the case forward, that's as I understand it the Vermont Supreme Court touchstone. When is that attributable to the State and when is it not?",
  "Well, I - -",
  "It does sound to me, then, that you're saying there has to be some systemic problem, that the rule that I understand the Vermont Supreme Court to have adopted, that when assigned counsel does nothing to move the case forward, that that's attributable to the State, you would disagree with? You would say no, there has to be a systemic problem, not the -- not just the individual lawyer, but they're not assigning enough defenders, they're not supervising them, whatever.",
  "So your 14 months, just so I understand, that includes the August 2003 through June 2004, when Moore was representing him?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Nelson. Ms. Rainville, you have a minute remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument in Case 07-1309, Boyle v. United States. Mr. Fernich.",
  "So all you have to do, to pick up on Justice Scalia's hypothetical, is just not the Brinks job, but you have to have one more crime, and that's it; then everything you've talked about is satisfied?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fernich. Mr. Yang.",
  "So then you'd have an easy time before the jury. And same thing with respect to the individual. All that's saying is that when you are dealing with one person, it's pretty easy to prove that he, you know, directs himself or, you know, has an ongoing plan, but that doesn't mean that it's not a separate element that the jury should have to find.",
  "Well, you say that it's not distinct from the underlying offenses.",
  "But they don't have to be separately instructed that they have to find that, do they?",
  "What is the instruction that the Seventh Circuit and the Eighth Circuit give that you don't think is necessary?",
  "I thought an individual -- I thought an individual could be the enterprise?",
  "An independent contractor rather than an employee.",
  "In fact, your friend said that the period the jury found was just a couple of months.",
  "Not at all; not at all. That would make a lot of sense, because RICO is not intended just to bring in the crimes. They are look for something else. They are looking for an organization that is involved in these types of things.",
  "You say enterprise. I mean, the objection is that the enterprise is no different than the various predicate acts.",
  "Thank you Mr. Yang. Mr. Fernich, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel, the case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first today in Case 07-9712, Puckett v. United States. Mr. Isaacson.",
  "And there is nothing theoretically inconsistent with the government -- you can feel remorse. I mean, you're not going to do it again. You going to feel remorse every time you do it, but that doesn't mean he didn't feel remorse from the crime he was pleading to.",
  "I suppose Justice Ginsburg's point is relevant, though, on the question of prejudice. If the judge gets up there and says, I don't care what the government says, I am not going to give anybody a departure when they have committed another crime, then you haven't been prejudiced by the government's breach.",
  "It would not be cost-free for you, because if you just sit there and say, you know, the agreement is void, the government is going to say, well, fine, I will see you in court; and we will have a trial; and you are going to get twice as much as you would have gotten anyway. You have some interest, since you entered the guilty plea, in going forward with the plea.",
  "Well, but let's put it this way. Maybe this is the same question anyway. Let's say it is the same facts as we have here but instead of saying, I can't do this, the judge says, I'm going to do this. And, look, I think you are remorseful. I'm going to give you three points. And that's all you agreed with the government. The government says we'll recommend it, and the judge says, well, you're going to get it anyway. I think you should get it. The agreement has still been breached, right? The government didn't recommend.",
  "So in that situation, you think you can withdraw the agreement?",
  "Well - -",
  "Thank you, counsel. We will give you a couple minutes for rebuttal.",
  "Ms. Schertler.",
  "It's clear, isn't it, that the defendant in this case was in fact prejudiced? The judge -- Judge Sanders said it's very rare, he said, that you would depart -- or I forget whether it's depart or - -",
  "So rare -- I thought he said \"rare to unknown,\" \"to be unknown\" -- you are right.",
  "But I suspect it's probably rarer still for the government to recommend that. So you can't really say that he wouldn't have done this or he certainly wouldn't have considered it. It's one thing to say I've never heard of that. It's another thing when one of your colleagues is there saying, this is what you should do.",
  "Yeah, but none of us can know what the judge would have done. I mean, we have had cases here where the government's recommendation of downward departures has been pretty surprising to me as well, and it's because they were informants or whatever and they have engaged in some pretty bad conduct; and I don't know what Judge Sanders would have done.",
  "I may have gotten lost in the dialogue. As you understand it, Justice Breyer's suggestion was that you win, right? You get plain error, and then sometimes you apply it and it comes out one way, and sometimes you apply it the other.",
  "So you are happy to go along that.",
  "But that's a big difference, right? As you said earlier, harmless error, the government has the burden; plain error, the defendant has the burden. That's certainly going to change how you approach however many different factual contexts.",
  "I think it's very clear that there has been a breach here. And it's not fanciful to say he felt remorse and then he went and did it again. That happens all the time. You know, when I have a rich dessert I shouldn't have, I feel bad about it afterwards. It doesn't mean I will not do it again. I mean, why isn't that the case here?",
  "And you can put that before the judge. You are supposed to go there and say, \"Look, we agreed to recommend it and we do recommend it.\" You could say, \"And by the way, you should know that he's gone out and done this again.\" But you most -- you certainly prejudiced him by not doing what you said you would do.",
  "No, but isn't it the fact that we can never know what Judge Sanders would have done if the government had what it said it would do. And because -- why shouldn't you bear the burden of showing there is no prejudice when you can't tell because you're the one that breached the agreement?",
  "Maybe Judge Sanders would look at this kind of the way that we have been discussing it, and he would look and say, boy, it's - - it's -- he committed subsequent conduct, how can you recommend that I depart? He says, but on the other hand, every plea agreement I have seen you always say if he commits subsequent conduct that is illegal, that all bets are the off. You didn't say that here, so I'm going to take the recommendation seriously. I don't think it's -- maybe I am repeating myself, but I don't think it is at all clear that the result wouldn't be different here.",
  "He wasn't -- was he convicted of this new crime?",
  "It was just an allegation, right?",
  "Why did we assume anything anyway? I assume he denies the allegations.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Isaacson, why don't you take two minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first today in Case 07-10441, Corley v. United States. Mr. McColgin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. McCOLGIN",
  "Or it may just mean that the confessions beyond six hours may be excluded solely because of delay. In other words, if the judge says, look, I don't want to hear about all this other stuff, it's just too long, he can't do that beyond the six hours, but he can within the six hours.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Mr. McColgin, you have four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. McCOLGIN",
  "Well, it may not have been intended to do that but doesn't its language on its face cover that?",
  "Well, but that - - that sort of flagrant conduct would not be an issue if it had been done within six hours, right? Assuming it was a voluntary confession?",
  "The purpose of the law enforcement officers, if it's voluntary, is irrelevant under six hours.",
  "Well, doesn't it seem odd that the focus on flagrant conduct at 6:01 as being as important as you are emphasizing, but not - - but totally irrelevant at 5:59?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 07-1356, Kansas v. Ventris. General McAllister. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Well, you say there is no deterrent value, since the police are -- are not going to do this if they know they are not going to be able to use this in their case-in-chief. But there is also no down side, is there? I mean, you say it's only for impeachment purposes, but, you know, why not? He -- he may take the stand. He may lie. It is better to have this in the bank instead of not.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Edge.",
  "Counsel, do I understand the first sentence on page 6 of your brief to concede that there's no deterrent value from prohibiting the introduction of these statements for impeachment? The sentence says, \"A Sixth Amendment exclusionary rule that allowed use of uncounseled statements for impeachment would not deter violations of the right to counsel.\"",
  "You agree with the representations on -- from your friends on the other side that there is no case of ours where we have excluded a statement of evidence submitted for impeachment, even though it would have been excluded in this case in chief? If you prevail here, it would be the first time that any evidence or statement has been excluded when submitted for purposes of impeachment?",
  "Counsel, you've - - you've emphasized that what distinguishes this case from the other ones where we have allowed evidence that would be excluded from the case in chief and for impeachment purposes is that this is a trial right. But the Sixth Amendment says in criminal prosecutions you have a right to the assistance of counsel. Well, he had assistance of counsel here, and one of the things that counsel did was point out the problems with relying on the snitch's evidence and all the bad things that he did. But -- but just like in the case of a Fourth Amendment violation where we allow the evidence to be admitted at trial, this Sixth Amendment problem, you know, it doesn't -- I just don't see the -- the strength of that distinction.",
  "Well, it seems to me you are getting away from the basis for your distinction, then. Saying well, it's not just at trial. Well, these other constitutional rights where we have allowed the evidence to come in for impeachment are indistinguishable from the Sixth Amendment right, outside of trial.",
  "Just to pause on that, it affects his decision to testify because it makes it more likely that he will testify truthfully if he is going to testify.",
  "The focus -- the focus on the context is at least a double-edged sword because the harm that we are facilitating under your rule is to allow perjured testimony.",
  "Yeah, and if he has the assistance at trial consistent with the Sixth Amendment, those -- those problems could be pointed out. He was -- he was he is not lying now. The reason he said something different then was, you know, he likes to brag in prison or whatever the basis is.",
  "I think -- I think that's quite right. But I don't see how excluding the evidence even on impeachment helps that. I mean, they've still got the statement, and they -- I mean, you know -- I guess your point, you know, maybe they will get some leads from it even if they can't use it. But excluding the evidence for impeachment purposes doesn't eliminate that harm.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. McAllister, you have six minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Nken v. Phillips. Ms. Harrison.",
  "Counsel, I'm not sure this matters very much, But do you know if -- are stays usually granted in this type of case? Not this type of case: A removal case as opposed to an application to reopen.",
  "No, no, I understand it. I am just saying if you happen to know empirically if most people who are facing removal get a stay.",
  "Okay.",
  "Is it possible in this case to kind of split the baby? You have a more appealing fact case than is typical, because yours involves a denial of a motion to reopen and doesn't really go to the ultimate merits. Most of the petitions I think do go to the ultimate merits, and it's easier to see that (f)(2) may apply there as opposed to your case. Now, is there a coherent way of saying that? In other words, in your type of case, you apply the traditional stay standards, but in a case where the issue that is before the court is whether to order removal or not on the merits, the other approach applies.",
  "Well, but that's just really saying the way that you avoid that is to say you win across the board. I mean, it -- my understanding is that in situations in which they are going to be seeking an injunction to enjoin are quite limited. They are typically just seeking to vacate the legal order.",
  "No, I think I understand that point when they're seeking to have the order -- the removal order vacated. But here you are seeking the reopening of the proceedings, which I guess is a little different, isn't it, than the underlying decision on the merits?",
  "Is that right? How can that be? I mean, you have an order of removal, and then you move to reopen the proceedings. Aren't they two separate things?",
  "Where does it say that?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, that's - - that's kind of a systemic challenge, but you wouldn't have a situation where you get an injunction in far more typical individual cases, right?",
  "Maybe I'm missing something but -- and, again, I don't know which way this cuts, but the dispute strikes me as very academic as a practical matter: Judges looking at whether someone is likely to prevail on the merits versus judges looking at whether the person has shown by clear and convincing evidence that he shouldn't be removed. The judge that's going to find one in one case, depending on the standard, and the opposite in the same case I can't visualize.",
  "It doesn't? You're talking about equities or irreparable harm?",
  "Both standards?",
  "Same thing. And you cannot consider that at all under (f)(2)? There's no way in which the removal would be prohibited as a matter of law under provisions that are concerned, for example, about whether the person would be tortured or something like that?",
  "Because the objection is on this procedural matter?",
  "But if the objection is that I am going to be tortured so you shouldn't order my removal, he would be able to -- the court under (f)(2) would be able to consider that, wouldn't it?",
  "Don't they get to pursue that even after they are sent back? There are provisions that -- that their case does not abate just because they have been removed?",
  "Well, I guess that's why -- I guess that goes back to my earlier question, which is, I see that if they are killed the case is probably not in very good shape. But -- but the situations in which they are likely to face that sort of difficulties upon removal it would seem to me are situations where the removal would be prohibited by law.",
  "So you think references to equitable relief and restrain are clear enough to cover the Court's authority to grant a stay?",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Kneedler.",
  "Do you -- do you agree with your friend that the basic difference between your two positions is that under the stay factors you are allowed to consider irreparable harm but are not allowed to consider that under (f)(2).",
  "So I take it at least in the Seventh Circuit these things are usually granted?",
  "So in this -- in this case involving a denial of a motion to reopen, what the court of appeals is supposed to do is to look ahead and see if this person has shown by clear and convincing evidence that they shouldn't be removed; and if they haven't, then their -- their removal can't be blocked, even for example if the court of appeals thinks, well, yes, they should have gotten their motion to reopen.",
  "This provision applies to us as well, I take it, right?",
  "So if there is a cert petition filed on behalf of an alien subject to removal, and he asks for a stay of removal, we have to decide whether he meets the clear and convincing evidence standard.",
  "We should have -- we should have done this in this case, but I assume you suspended removal of the Petitioner on your own?",
  "It's pretty close to it, though.",
  "Thank you, General Kneedler. Ms. Harrison, you have seven minutes remaining.",
  "I guess General Kneedler's point is that clear and convincing shifts a little, depending on how long you've got to look at it. If you've only got a day or a few hours before the removal is going to take place, you can say this is convincing enough based on what I have had a chance to look at. But -- and therefore you could enter, I guess, what may be called the temporary stay to get more briefing from the government or whatever. But you may find out when you look at it a little more deeply that it's not clear and convincing. What's wrong with that?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Harrison. General Kneedler, Ms. Harrison, the Court entered a very expedited briefing and arguments schedule in this case that unfortunately fell over the holiday season, and we appreciate very much that this must have imposed a burden on you had and your colleagues.

  "We will hear argument first today in Case 07-1410, United States v. Navajo Nation. General Kneedler.",
  "Well, it said \"pertinent or relevant,\" but surely that's limited to the statutory provisions that we examined in the case.",
  "I -- this may be a purely academic distinction, but you talked in terms of liability. Are you suggesting that the trust principles do not set a standard to which the Secretary is bound, or simply that they don't constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity?",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Phillips.",
  "I'm sorry. Where is the specific reference to mineral leases, mineral resources?",
  "It says \"resources.\" I don't remember it saying \"mineral resources.\"",
  "That's a big difference, don't you think?",
  "But you knew all of that -- that's not -- that's not something you discovered on remand. You knew all that before.",
  "And that affidavit was before or after our decision the first time around?",
  "Even if you are right about the duty-creating aspect, what -- talk a little about the money-mandating aspect, the second stage of the analysis under Navajo I.",
  "Before we find a waiver of sovereign immunity opening up the Treasury of the United States, we usually insist on something a little more specific than general trust principles.",
  "Well, that's not how the Secretary reads 635. Isn't he entitled to Chevron deference?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Kneedler, you have nine minutes remaining.",
  "I'm not sure that's responsive to justice Stevens's question. I mean, you are arguing the merits, but those haven't been decided.",
  "Thank you, general, the case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 07-9995, Rivera v. Illinois. Mr. Leven.",
  "But would it have to be -- would it have to be structural error? I -- I don't know why you don't argue that it's structural error when the error is a wrongful denial of a peremptory challenge, because it is impossible for you to establish the harmfulness of error because, as Justice Scalia pointed out, a peremptory challenge is just a hunch on your part; you don't need any more. But if it's something like he was in Dupage County rather than Cook County, maybe that's something where it's fair to put the burden of showing harmfulness on the defendant.",
  "Well, maybe that's true. My point is that may be true with respect to a peremptory challenge, but it doesn't seem to me to be terribly difficult to say, well, he lives in Dupage County and not Cook County, so what's the big deal?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Scodro.",
  "So your answer to Justice Scalia's question is what?",
  "Well -- but how do you -- there is no way to tell. I mean, presumably the State has a reason for restricting the jury pool to the neighborhood, and that type of limitation does go back to Blackstone, the vicinage of the crime. So -- and the there's no way to tell. There's no way to tell whether the juror from DuPage County is going to have a different view of a different perspective or affected it in a -- or that it affected the verdict in a particular case.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Roberts?",
  "No, but maybe - - maybe you have an -- you know, the irrational juror. You know, the holdout is not going to convict for any reason.",
  "Well, even assuming your premise, isn't it pretty difficult to know what a rational juror would have done?",
  "That's because there is no way to tell.",
  "But a jury is a fundamental protection of individual liberty, and in your analysis you are having a judge decide what the jury would - -",
  "The judge is making a determination that a juror that should have been sitting would act like the juror who was sitting instead.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Leven, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 07-1437, Carlsbad Technology v. HIF Bio, Inc. Mr. Rhodes.",
  "I think there's no need to dress up anything. I mean, as Justice Stevens point, you wouldn't have to dress up anything; if you send it back, it's not reviewable.",
  "Well, \"woodenly\" is a bit much. I mean, they're going to read it not to say what it says. And Thermtron involved the court saying: I'm not going to take this because I'm too busy with other things. I mean, it could be limited to that unusual situation, couldn't it?",
  "And it would solve the problem Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, that this way you don't get to appeal big things like no subject matter jurisdiction, but you do get to appeal picayune things.",
  "You thought the Respondents asked us to overrule Thermtron. On page 22, you say, \"Respondents' implicit request for this Court to overrule Thermtron should be rejected.\"",
  "So this gets a lot of attention across the street? The reviewability of remand orders gets - -",
  "I mean, in one of those provisions they said this was only technical amendments, and if they're just doing technical amendments that doesn't mean they have to look at it and approve the whole thing.",
  "Well, they don't have a choice, right? They can't say, I don't like the Supreme Court rule so I'm not going to apply it, other than the Federal Circuit.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Allison.",
  "So your idea is there is jurisdiction, but when the Federal claims fall out then there is no jurisdiction?",
  "Okay, but that seems to me to echo the fundamental misperception that if you have Federal jurisdiction based on a particular event - - let's say if you're dumping chemicals in the water; that gives you a Federal cause of action; you have Federal jurisdiction, there's a trial; it turns out you weren't dumping chemicals with it. You don't then say \"there is no jurisdiction; there was jurisdiction before, but once the finding is made that the facts didn't support it, then there was no jurisdiction.\" You say, \"there was jurisdiction all the time and you lose.\"",
  "Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Mr. Rhodes, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "I suppose, though, if it would be an abuse of discretion for the district court to retain jurisdiction, then maybe there is - - there never was jurisdiction, right? You said they have discretion to exercise or not. If it turns out they don't have discretion to exercise, you know, because it's a huge State claim and a tiny Federal claim, why wouldn't that properly be regarded as an absence of jurisdiction?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in case 07-1601, Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company et al. v. United States. Ms. Sullivan.",
  "What if your shipper here knew that every time he delivered one of these truckloads of the chemical, one-third of it would end up on the ground and seeping through the ground, and no doubt about it, he knew that, and yet they kept sending it? Wouldn't that be arranging for the disposal of at least a third of the shipment?",
  "But your argument assumes a sharp distinction between useful product and waste. Yet it's quite common to talk about there being waste associated with a useful product. When you use up so much of this, there's going to be a certain percentage of waste.",
  "That's making it too easy for you. It would mean all of those people would be liable when in the course of delivering stuff they know there's going to be a certain amount that's going to spill, and even, perhaps the Justice Alito hypothetical, they could have easily chose the truck that causes more spill rather than the one that causes less. It's not simply here's the product, we're gone, see you later, and all of a sudden there's a spill.",
  "No, no, i know. But I'm trying to reach the extent of your argument. So in that type of a case would there be arranger liability?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Mahoney.",
  "What if -- what if you have a situation where it's clear under apportionment one party is liable for one-tenth and the other is liable for nine-tenths, but one-tenth is enough to pollute the -- the water. Do you have apportionment in that situation?",
  "Well, I assume it's not a linear, if that's the right word, progression, because once you've got to start a clean-up, you've got to start a clean-up, whether it's, you know, caused by one-tenth or -- or nine-tenths.",
  "What about the issue of insolvency? You have talked about the Restatements. There's the comment H to one of the Restatement provisions that says you don't apportion if one of the other parties is insolvent.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart.",
  "On the question of apportionment, is it really your position that because of the precision you would require, that if there's a big fight over whether it's 10 percent responsibility or 30 percent and there's no way to tell, that if the parties said, look, we'll take 40 percent, that that's no good?",
  "Isn't that what happened here? I mean, whatever -- I guess the railroads said 6 percent, and the district court said, well, just to be on the safe side, we'll give them 9 percent.",
  "But that still doesn't address the question, if you have varying degrees of whatever you want to call it -- fault or causal relationship -- that that's a sensible way to apportion the liability.",
  "Well, what -- what about Ms. Mahoney's three answers, when I asked that question of her?",
  "She also said that the Restatement comment h that you rely on cites no cases, and the Third Restatement backs away from that comment.",
  "So you don't think that the insolvency should prevent apportionment if you have a situation where a party is 1 percent responsible and the 99 percent responsible party is insolvent?",
  "And what do we have in the way of findings on that question?",
  "But is that right? I mean doesn't it -- aren't you challenging the whole basis for apportionment? I mean there is -- I don't think when you're apportioning responsibility, you allocate whether or not the actors independently caused the harm. I thought the assumption was, yes, everybody's -- all of this group has contributed to the harm, but now we're going to apportion their responsibility.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Sullivan, we will give you five minutes.",
  "I'm not sure I know what it means to say it's a divisible harm.",
  "So that means that whatever percentage of responsibility the parties have, that's the percentage of cost that they - -",
  "So does that mean that, let's say, the -- how does that work when it costs $2 million to sort of start a clean-up, no matter who, and then, you know, the more stuff there is, the extra million it is? Is that -- is -- is the initial cost a divisible harm?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in case 07-1372, Hawaii versus the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. General Bennett.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Jay.",
  "What do you think on the question-presented issue? Are all of the Federal laws on which the Hawaii Supreme Court relied to say there was a cloud on the title before the court.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Jay.",
  "Mr. Shanmugam?",
  "So, they relied on federal law to create the fiduciary obligation. So if we think that federal law did not create the fiduciary obligation, what should we do?",
  "All Federal law? All Federal law? In other words, not simply the Apology Resolution but the other Federal provisions?",
  "Do you think those -- yes.",
  "You would object to that?",
  "What about the Newlands Resolution and Admission Act and the Organic Law, do you acknowledge that if the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on those, that also would be inappropriate?",
  "They relied on them the same way you say they relied on the Apology Resolution, to give rise to a fiduciary responsibility under State law.",
  "So you would have no -- just to carry on the opinion-drafting process, you would have no objection to an opinion that said no source of Federal law gave rise to a duty under State law, fiduciary or otherwise; that any further proceedings on remand should be based solely on State law?",
  "It's not simply a question of the source of the fiduciary duty. It, presumably, in the course of saying what the Apology Resolution, the Newlands Act, the Organic Act, and the Admission Act had to say, we may well say something to the effect that, because it conveyed perfect title, it's inconsistent with the cloud of that title, under a fiduciary obligation created by State law or anything else.",
  "But if we told them that these various Federal resolutions, including the Apology Resolution, conveyed title to the State in a particular way that precluded the burdening of the State's title on the basis of Federal law, then they would have to find a basis under State law that was not inconsistent with the Federal law's conveying of perfect title.",
  "But then it would also have to just -- the opinion we're drafting would go further, I suppose, and since we are interpreting all these Federal provisions, it may not be sufficient to say that it did not create this obligation and the Hawaiian Supreme Court was wrong to do that, but that it precluded the creation under State law of this type of obligation.",
  "And if the Hawaiian Supreme Court wants to create, under State law, a particular type of fiduciary obligation grounded on the status of the land prior to admission, then it has to run -- under the Supremacy Clause, it has to be consistent with the Federal provisions.",
  "No, I'm not saying they did. That's the first question. I'm not saying they grounded it on Federal law; I'm saying we would have to determine whether Federal law precluded the grounding of the fiduciary duty under the status of the land prior to admission.",
  "So the decision of the Hawaii Supreme Court would then be vacated.",
  "Under Munnsingwear.",
  "Well, what is - -",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, just as a matter of curiosity, do you know what percentage of the Hawaiian population is comprised of Native Hawaiians?",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Bennett, you have a minute remaining.",
  "Thank you, general. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-108, Flores-Figueroa versus United States. Mr. Russell.",
  "How about so and so stole a car that belonged to Mr. Jones. I suppose you could say that the person knew it was Mr. Jones' car, but more likely somebody stole the car that turned out to be Mr. Jones's.",
  "Well, that doesn't help you much because it can't be knowingly manufacture something is the crime. I mean, you do have to go on to have that make any sense. You don't have to go on to make your provision make any sense, that he knowingly, you know, uses a means of identification.",
  "No, I guess --I guess basically this is what I was trying to say earlier as well. You have in your statute in between there, the modifier \"without lawful authority.\"",
  "So that means that it can stop at a lot more number of earlier places then can the statute you were just citing in appendix D.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Russell. Mr. Heytens.",
  "Shouldn't it - - shouldn't it -- is it time to revisit the Court's decision in Hayes?",
  "Yes, but in this particular case, when you talk about identity theft, it is inconceivable the defendant would not know about fact that there is another person involved. And so the - - the mens rea issue is easy in this case. The only time it's -- it's difficult is when he didn't -- when he did not use it for an identity-theft purpose.",
  "Well, but in that case you tell them, look, the person's got 10 years. Right? If they find the guy, he is going to face up to 10 years for identity fraud.",
  "Well, the problem with that is the statute says identity theft; it doesn't say anything about victims.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Russell.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 08-214, Atlantic Sounding v. Townsend. Mr. McCreadie. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE",
  "Of course, your friend on the other side distinguishes that argument by noting that death is different. As he puts it, we're all going to die, so - -",
  "-- you have different considerations under the maintenance and cure.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sullivan.",
  "What is the pre-Vaughan case that awarded punitive damages - - awarded punitive damages in a maintenance and cure case?",
  "I am -- what - - which --any case from this Court?",
  "All right.",
  "Well, if -- if the -- if the existence of the punitive damages and maintenance and cure were as well established, why wasn't that mentioned in terms in the Vaughan majority? It only comes up in the Vaughan dissent.",
  "I'm not sure as sure -- I'm not sure I follow that. In other areas where we allow punitive damages it hasn't resulted in the cases going away. Quite the opposite. It seems that it has given rise to a variety of claims on both sides.",
  "Yeah, but the normal medical malpractice area has given rise to a lot of punitive damage litigation. I don't know why this would anybody different.",
  "Well, I mean, it - - whether it gives rise to more litigation or not, it is still a significant and will give rise to greater costs on the part of the shipper which will be passed on, as is the case in a lot of areas where you have punitive damages, it will be passed on to the consumer.",
  "No, no, even if they're not. In other words, you were saying, look, to avoid punitive damages, the ship owner is going to make sure that there -- that that more expensive test is provided.",
  "That doesn't mean there are no costs involved in ruling in your favor.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. McCreadie, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-6, District Attorney's Office for the Third Judicial District v. Osborne. Mr. Rosenstein.",
  "Does the State routinely keep evidence of the sort Osborne is seeking available? Or is there a cutoff point at which they dispose of the evidence.",
  "Justice Breyer.",
  "Thank you, counsel. We'll afford you rebuttal time since the Court used up your time.",
  "Mr. Katyal.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Neufeld.",
  "Well, there was a more reliable one at the time of trial as well, and his counsel made the tactical decision not to use it because, I assume, she was concerned it would show his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.",
  "Well, but the whole point is that, Justice Ginsburg brought out the point, that he hasn't asserted his innocence under oath. So there's no cost to him for asking for the DNA evidence. If there's -- if we're writing up a new constitutional right and we require as part of that that he assert his innocence under perjury, and if he fails to do that, he'll be prosecuted for perjury, that might at least put some limitation on the number of people who can assert the right.",
  "So if it is so clear - -",
  "Sorry, counsel. If it is so clear that this is the right way to go, that the Federal Government, 41 States -- does it make sense for us to devise a constitutional right to displace what the legislatures have done?",
  "It is exactly a question of displacing what the States have done because now this question is going to be subject to constitutional law and it's going to be litigated in a variety of cases with a variety of claims. Do you get the right to it when you confess? Do you get the right to it when you've waived it at trial? Do you get the continuous right to it as technology advances and makes the test more sensitive? All of those matters will be Federal constitutional questions for us to decide.",
  "Well, but the whole question -- it is kind of along the same lines I've been talking. The reason they might -- they're saying don't adopt that test, is because the question is whether it should be adopted as a matter of constitutional law. They may, and I suspect they do since they represent the government, think Congress's balancing makes perfect sense. It is a different question here.",
  "So, just to get back to the point you were making earlier, it really doesn't matter what the Congress said. It is a question of rationality under the Constitution.",
  "Was his assertion before -- his confession -- his confessions before the parole board made under oath?",
  "So he's guilty of perjury one way or the other, either before the parole board or in his assertions of actual innocence here.",
  "Well, wouldn't it be ironic - -",
  "Excuse me, counsel. Would it be ironic to say that you do not have access when you're guilty of perjury one way or the other?",
  "Do you have a - -",
  "Do you have a constitutional right to the DNA evidence if the accuracy of the test was the same as the one that your counsel submitted at trial?",
  "In other words, limits it to -- what was it -- 16 percent or something like that?",
  "Well, all right. Then, obviously, the next question is at level of accuracy does your constitutional right no longer apply?",
  "Well, just so to follow up on that -- so you -- if -- if the evidence showed that there was -- would show that there was a one out of two chance that your client was innocent, then you think you still have a right -- a constitutional right of access to that evidence?",
  "So fingerprint - - fingerprints apparently are covered by it. They have fingerprint evidence that they are not releasing. So do you have a constitutional right of access to that evidence?",
  "No, I'm sure - -",
  "I'm sure they're not as accurate as the DNA tests. I'm trying to figure out what the limit of the constitutional right you're asserting is.",
  "Sorry. I'm sorry. With the different questions asked, I have lost where the answer is. You say it is still part of the constitutional right if he forewent the test at trial, or it is not?",
  "What if there was a videotape? Is that covered by the constitutional right you are asserting?",
  "Are there photographs or other evidence that - -",
  "That's a good point. What -- how long under the Constitution does the State have to retain this evidence?",
  "Would that be a corollary of the constitutional right you are asking for here?",
  "And I agree that would be -- that -- yes. I am just wondering if there would be any objection to an absolute rule that says what: After two years, after one year of conviction?",
  "Was he released on parole with respect to this offense?",
  "And was his confession a necessary predicate to that release?",
  "So a confession that would be perjurious if he claimed actual innocence now was responsible for his release?",
  "I understand that.",
  "But he's been - - other than other crimes he committed, he's been released on the basis of what you say is an unprincipled confession. And now he is - -",
  "So his parole was revoked because he committed another offense?",
  "Okay. Thank you, counsel.",
  "Now, counsel, we'll give you three more minutes.",

  "What if, instead of having the focus on one, we're dealing with a trade group that's making the donation. Ten companies form a trade group. Is the judge recused in the case of every one of those companies?",
  "Well, let's just take this case, the same amount of money, except it's not from an individual, not from that individual's company, but from ten different ones, and divide it up by ten.",
  "Well, okay. Now, I'm sure you know where I'm going next. What if it's five companies in the trade group? When do you decide that there's a probability? I take it if there are two companies, under your theory there would be a probability of bias?",
  "Well, can I stop you right there, \"When their case is pending.\" The Massey Company has a lot of cases pending, so is it only those cases that were pending on the day of the election?",
  "Well, then we shouldn't talk about pending cases.",
  "Well, but that's the whole distinction that your friend on the other side makes. Those cases involve financial interest and the recusal rules are, you know, if you have one share of AT&T stock and it's in AT&T, you have to recuse. But this is different. This is a probability of bias, not financial interest.",
  "What about the United Mine Workers. If they give a contribution to somebody's campaign, is that judge then recused in every labor case? Or I don't know if they give contributions or not, but a group like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, because they think the other judge is too lenient in DWI cases, so they give contributions. Is their preferred judge recused in every DWI case?",
  "Or are those all factors and circumstances we have to look at?",
  "Well, also, if there is a big -- a big United Mine Workers case, or not even United Mine Workers, involving particular union members, and the UMW gives large contributions to a judge, that -- that judge is recused?",
  "Counsel - -",
  "Are the States - - are the States really free to do that? We have recognized First Amendment interests in participating in the electoral process before. I mean, would your approach constitutionalize McCain-Feingold at a State level?",
  "Well, this -- this --",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frey.",
  "Mr. Frey, why don't you take a shot at answering it?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Olson, five minutes.",
  "What about - -",
  "What about protective donations? You actually give, not three million, but a couple hundred thousand to somebody you don't want deciding your case. And it comes up, and you say, you have to recuse yourself because - -",
  "How do you know? I mean, are you saying it's going to be clear in every case that the judge is going to rule against the particular entity?",
  "Is that a reasonable person that's making that inquiry, is that the standard?",
  "Okay. Would a reasonable person think it's a ground for recusal if the lawyer and the judge were very close friends?",
  "You don't think so? A reasonable person comes up and says I socialize all the time, you know, they were at each other's weddings, whatever it is, we know that that's not a basis for recusal.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 08-192, Abuelhawa v. United States. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "You keep talking about phones and you began by saying this covers phones, but this was -- language was added in 1970?",
  "Well, there weren't cell phones of the kind you have now. I think this was directed at the beepers, right, when those were around then, or land-based phones or something like that. And the technology has so expanded that the reach of the statute has so expanded in a way that brings in a lot more casual users than was the case before, and I just don't know how that issue of statutory interpretation is supposed to be resolved. Assuming I'm right that the technology has dramatically expanded the reach of the statute, even if you think it's covered by its terms, how is that issue addressed? What's the right answer there? Is it because the terms still cover it, the breadth has expanded, or because this is something new technologically that the statute shouldn't be construed that broadly?",
  "Well, I know, but let's assume I don't agree -- let's assume I agree with that only in the context of the 1970s technology.",
  "What's the answer then?",
  "It reminds me of these old hypotheticals. You know, before you had automobiles, you had to have someone with a lantern walk in front of your carriage, and they don't change the law and it still turns out to be the law when you're driving your car and it doesn't make any sense. Is there a case of ours that says what to do in that case, in such a situation of statutory construction?",
  "Well, but I mean it's natural to view the woman in that situation more as a victim than as someone facilitating the crime.",
  "I'm not sure that would extend to your case.",
  "This really isn't the transformation of a misdemeanor into a felony. It's a separate, separate activity and an activity that facilitates the commission of a crime. It's much easier to carry out your drug distribution business if people are calling you on their cell phones than if they have to meet you in person or call from a land line.",
  "Your gloss on this statute makes -- gives rise to some difficult questions of proof. What if it's -- I don't know -- ten pounds of something, and the guy says, well, I was just buying in bulk for personal use, like a Costco dealer.",
  "So you would have lost this case before 1970 because the incongruity on which you rely - -",
  "-- didn't exist then?",
  "Right. So the scope of this language was changed sub silentio?",
  "I know, but this language, \"facilitating,\" covered purchasers using a telephone in the period before 1970, but not after 1970, because of the changes in some other sections?",
  "That question goes to whether or not the distribution was a felony.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Miller.",
  "So two people across the park, they know there's a drug dealer on the other side, the one waves and the dealer comes over, the other calls on the cell phone and the dealer comes over; the other gets four more years? The phone user gets four more years?",
  "Suppose he calls three times. He's exposed to 12 more years, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-5274, Dean v. United States. Mr. Forster.",
  "I think one of the stronger arguments against you is the use of the passive voice. It doesn't say anybody who discharges a firearm. It says a firearm is discharged. And that seems to me to take it away from the element of intent that you're trying to focus on.",
  "So you think it's different -- I don't remember the grammar too well. You think \"if firearm is discharged\" is different than \"firearm discharges;\" is that your point?",
  "Well, I'm not sure that's right. I mean, if in fact the bank robber tries to flee and the security guard is forced to use his firearm, increasing the danger to everybody else in the bank, I'm not sure this statute wouldn't cover that as well.",
  "Your -- your argument would give rise to very serious problems of proof. Every time a gun goes off, the bank robber would be able to say it was an accident. I mean, we had a particularly klutzy robber here that everybody agrees it was an accident, but, you know, in many cases it won't be clear. Yes, I was pointing the gun at the person, but I didn't mean to fire it. It just went off. And he's sad about it just as everyone else is. And that would get to the jury in every case. Just because it was easy here doesn't mean it's going to be easy every time to draw a line. And it gets back to Justice Souter's point. If you pose the risk that the gun is going to go off, that's additionally punishable conduct.",
  "That's not my question, really. The question is the problem of proof. Yours is an easy case. Most cases it's not going to be. Most cases when the gun goes off, the robber will be able to say, I didn't intend that it discharged. It was -- it was an accident.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Maynard.",
  "What about the police come in and say, \"Drop it\"; he says, \"Oh, my robbery's over\"; he drops it, and it goes off?",
  "So that's the line between is it going on. But assuming the offense is - - the bank robbery is still going on, like he's got confederates gathering up the money or something, does that fall under your theory that the gun is discharged?",
  "So even if the police officer -- the police officer disarms the robber and ten minutes later mishandles the gun and it goes off.",
  "Well, assuming it is. I mean, he has got the one guy neutralized but the others are still, you know, under the teller's window, and that isn't over. So then the guy who is captured already gets an extra three years because the officer mishandled the gun?",
  "Well, there probably aren't a lot of cases where the bank robbers are such klutzes that they're fumbling with the gun and it goes off, either.",
  "I interrupted your answer.",
  "It's entirely fortuitous; you have two bank robbers, they both do exactly the same thing, in one case the gun goes off and the other it doesn't. Does that -- does it seem -- does it seem fair to add three years onto the sentence of the one whose gun happens to go off but not on the sentence of the one whose doesn't?",
  "Yes, they both did. That's my point, they both did exactly the same thing.",
  "You get three extra years for having bad luck?",
  "Well, is this guy likely to get life for a bank robbery, the gun accidentally goes off? I don't know whether it's his first offense or not.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Forster.",
  "Thank you, counsel, the case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument today in Yeager v. United States. Mr. Buffone.",
  "Counsel, if Powell extends to subsequent prosecutions -- I know you argue that it doesn't, but if it does, isn't it unusual that the defendant is in better shape if a jury hangs on the non-acquitted count than if he is convicted on the non - acquitted count?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "You are asking us for a pretty dramatic extension of Powell. Powell is not a case involving subsequent prosecutions.",
  "Well, that's because in the same proceeding you have two different jury verdicts, one going the other way and one -- obviously, one way and one the other way. So to protect the jury's conclusions, you couldn't give effect to one without undermining the other. It's a very different case here. The only jury determination you have is the acquittal. If you give effect -- if you don't give effect to the findings in the acquittal, you are undermining the jury, the only determination by the jury.",
  "Well, the -- the point about the big extension, you were rather coy in your brief about what you think about Ashe v. Swenson. Are you asking us to revisit that?",
  "Well, you're not going to talk about -- you're not going to talk about the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, are you?",
  "If we rely on that the case is pretty easy, isn't it?",
  "The person was in jeopardy on the hung offense as well.",
  "Under this Court's decisions, but not under the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause.",
  "I think that's right, and your argument depends upon that interest balancing against the interest in giving effect to the acquittal verdict. Now, what if I think, under the Seventh Amendment that's -- that what is important is protecting jury verdicts? And the interest in the irrational case, when you have a conviction and acquittal, is that you have two jury verdicts and you can't go one way or the other without undermining one of them. Here, however, you can give full effect to the verdict of acquittal without undermining another jury verdict. You certainly undermine the government's interest in prosecuting after a hung jury, but if I think what's important under the Seventh Amendment is the jury verdicts, then the case comes out the other way, right?",
  "Well, he -- he carried that burden before the court of appeals.",
  "Revisiting of that issue was not included within the question presented.",
  "So if we -- if we agree with you on that proposition, then the conflict that we granted cert to resolve would still continue.",
  "Your -- your theory depends upon viewing a hung jury as constituting some action by the jury. Now, obviously it does in some sense. But if you view -- if you accept the proposition that juries only act by returning verdicts, and that's the reason you can retry, because with a hung jury the jury hasn't really done anything in the way jurors act, then the case comes out -- then the defendant prevails, right?",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Buffone, you have six minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument today in Case 08-205, Citizens United v. The Federal Election Commission. Mr. Olson.",
  "Counsel, I think you have kind of shifted your focus here from the difference between a 10-second ad and a 90-minute presentation and how that presentation is received, whether it's over the normal airwaves or on this Video On Demand. What - - what is the distinction between the 10-second commercial and, say, the 90-minute infomercial?",
  "So this argument doesn't depend upon whether this is properly characterized as express -- the functional equivalent of express advocacy? Your contention is that even if it is, that because it wasn't in the factual record in McConnell or before Congress, it is a type of functional -- it is a type of express advocacy that's not covered by the Act?",
  "Well, that's - - that's why I'm trying to figure out, the distinction in your argument. I mean, if we think that this is the functional equivalent of express advocacy, are you contending that it is nonetheless not covered in light of the record before the Court in McConnell and before Congress?",
  "Well, that's because it's mandatory appellate jurisdiction. I mean, you don't have a choice.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart.",
  "Well, the length of the advertisements wasn't remotely at issue in either Washington Right to Life or McConnell or before Congress when they passed this law.",
  "Any discussion either in McConnell -- any citation either in McConnell or the Congressional Record to those types of documentaries?",
  "Well, I mean, how do we know it was a known phenomenon in terms of the evolution of the statute and the decision of this Court upholding it? There is no reference to it.",
  "So -- so if Wal-Mart airs an advertisement that says we have candidate action figures for sale, come buy them, that counts as an electioneering communication?",
  "If it has one name, one use of the candidate's name, it would be covered, correct?",
  "It's a 500-page book, and at the end it says, and so vote for X, the government could ban that?",
  "No, I'm talking about under the Constitution, what we've been discussing, if it's a book.",
  "Right, right. Forget the - -",
  "Take my hypothetical. It doesn't say at the outset. It funds -- here is -- whatever it is, this is a discussion of the American political system, and at the end it says vote for X.",
  "And if they didn't, you could ban it?",
  "No, but if we accept your constitutional argument, we're establishing a precedent that you yourself say would extend to banning the book, assuming a particular person pays for it.",
  "To write a book, to pay for somebody to write a book?",
  "Not just a -- I suppose a sign held up in Lafayette Park saying vote for so and so. Under your theory of the Constitution, the prohibition of that would be constitutional?",
  "Again, just to follow up, even if there's one clause in one sentence in the 600-page book that says, in light of the history of the labor movement, you should be careful about candidates like John Doe who aren't committed to it?",
  "Well, it does by its terms, doesn't it? Published within 60 days. It mentions a candidate for office. What other qualification is there?",
  "Even though that type of case was never presented to the Court in McConnell and was never presented to Congress when it considered BCRA?",
  "Counsel, before you run out here, can I -- we haven't talked about the disclosure requirements yet. You understand the test to be that disclosure is not required if the names of those disclosed -- if those people would be reasonably subject to reprisals?",
  "How do we apply that test? Is it inconceivable to you here that people contributing to such a clearly anti-Clinton advertisement are not going to be subject to reprisals?",
  "That doesn't work, because maybe they are going to change the nature of the documentaries that they fund, or somebody who gave a contribution 5 years ago may decide, boy, I don't like what they're doing. I'm not going to give anymore. It --",
  "The fact that they've disclosed in the past by compulsion of law doesn't seem to answer the question of whether they are going to be subject to reprisals.",
  "But that seems to me you are saying they've got to wait until the -- the horse is out of the barn. You can only prove that you are reasonably subject to reprisals once you've been the victim of reprisals.",
  "That is saying - - that is saying that the test in McConnell is unworkable, if you say the alternative is to say they are categorically - -",
  "If the Boy Scouts run an ad and they're subject to disclosure, are the donors who support that ad reasonably subject to reprisals.",
  "Before you sit down, any other? Thank you, counsel. Mr. Olson, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 08-267, United States v. Denedo. Mr. Shah.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Freedus.",
  "What -- which case of ours establishes the proposition that there always has to be an available avenue of relief?",
  "Well, that's different than saying there always has to be available relief. That's saying you think Congress usually intends there to be available relief. And that would be a doubtful assumption here, given the rather clear expressions of finality that -- that are -- that are in the UCMJ statutes.",
  "You don't -- you don't think there's authority for the proposition they can do it?",
  "I'm looking for authority that says they can't do it.",
  "I'm sorry - -",
  "I don't like it very much. But what is -- your argument is that the Constitution does not require that this person have, right now, an available avenue of relief, your position?",
  "So then it comes, as Justice Kennedy suggested, a question of whether or not we should read the statutes here in a particular way to avoid confronting that question?",
  "Well, but the collateral consequences of the conviction are pretty dramatic. In this case they decide whether the guy stays in the country or is deported.",
  "Well, so I think Justice Breyer's question is still on the table. Why would Congress intend to afford greater relief and remedies to somebody who's outside -- was within the military system and is now outside, than to an ordinary civilian under Article III jurisdiction?",
  "Within -- within the military system?",
  "All within the system. I mean, the difference with this case is that you're talking about somebody who is, I guess that's the issue, out of the military system. The problem with your position is that it would dramatically expand the jurisdiction of the military system. It would sort of follow everybody they've dealt with around for their life, right?",
  "At any time somebody who is out of the military system, whose judgment is supposedly final under the provisions that Congress has established, he could come back and knock on the door 20 years later and say, I want to review my conviction.",
  "And he would be within the military system.",
  "Right.",
  "And he's back in the military system, 20 years later.",
  "For someone still within the military system?",
  "So the answer - -",
  "-- to Justice Ginsburg is that we have never held that with respect to a situation like the facts here, where you're dealing with somebody who is outside -- long departed from the military system?",
  "This is -- this is at a hearing. This isn't a Member of Congress, obviously, that we're talking about. It's not even a single Member of Congress?",
  "Under the specific - -",
  "Under the specific provision that was at issue, which is accompanied by very strict finality provisions. There's no suggestion in his testimony that the availability of the relief that he's talking about continues after the individual is outside the military system. He's channeling -- he says these are channeled through a specific provision applicable only within the military system.",
  "I'm sorry. I've had the chance to go back and look at the Senate report, and like Mr. Taft's testimony, there's no suggestion in there that the relief he's talking about continues after someone is out of the service.",
  "Well, a final judgment is subject to review in the appellate courts within -- in the military system, just like you have - - a final court of appeals judgment is subject to review in our system.",
  "Well, you have review in the appellate system. Someone is -- the judgment is they're to be discharged, and they seek review. Are they discharged while the review is going on?",
  "You -- you don't think that if you prevail in this case, we're going to see a lot more coram nobis petitions than we did before?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Why don't you briefly make your fourth point.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-295, Travelers Indemnity Company v. Bailey, and Common Law Settlement Counsel v. Bailey. Mr. Ostrager.",
  "So if part of the settlement -- I mean, Travelers says, we need to get more out of this before we're going to put in all the policy funds; the bankruptcy judge says, well, you are going to be immune from any traffic accident liability; and there is a traffic accident and Travelers said: Well, the bankruptcy court said I don't have to pay. Is that all right? It's within the jurisdiction as you read it because it involves Travelers it's related to the funds they submitted into the trust account. Is that - -",
  "No, I know they that didn't intend anything with respect to traffic accidents. But my question is how far does your theory reach?",
  "So there would be jurisdiction in the hypothetical that I posed?",
  "Right, on direct appeal. Are you suggesting it would be barred -- that Travelers would have protection under a collateral attack?",
  "Why is that? It - - it involves one -- it involves the insurance company, its coverage of Johns-Manville. And the Travelers is saying: Look, we are not going to do it unless you give us this -- this broader immunity, and the bankruptcy judge does it. I don't know why it would be outside the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. It is clearly related to allowing the settlement to go forward.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Issacharoff.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cohn.",
  "Why doesn't the Due Process Clause fully protect you? If the bankruptcy court made a mistake and purported to exercise jurisdiction over your claims, then I suppose you have, in particular cases if you can establish it, a due process claim that fully protects you.",
  "I saw in the -- I guess it was in the Travelers' reply brief, the suggestion that there was a future -- somebody representing future claimants.",
  "Where is that?",
  "Where is that limitation spelled out?",
  "Is that a description of the clients at issue here? They've been -- they've all been exposed to asbestos?",
  "I know, but I'm asking about the claimants.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Ostrager.",
  "Thank you, counsel. That case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument this morning in Case 08-441, Gross v. FBL Financial Services. Mr. Schnapper.",
  "There is some disagreement among the parties, of course, what \"direct evidence\" means, whether it means direct as opposed to circumstantial, or direct in the terms that for example Judge Collatin put it in the decision below.",
  "So you are telling us we never required direct evidence, but you are not taking a position on what direct evidence is?",
  "I mean, you may be right or you may be wrong. But we kind of have to know what we're dealing with.",
  "Well, in your petition, you asked -- you used the phrase \"direct evidence,\" and I just want to know in what sense you mean that?",
  "In your response to Justice Souter's question you said you're only focusing on the direct evidence threshold. But if direct evidence is the threshold to give you the benefit of shifting the burden of persuasion of the employer, is it really fair for you to be able to say, we are only going to take out one side of the behalf, we are going to leave the other side of the balance there? It seems to me that it's artificial to separate the two requirements, the two aspects of the Price Waterhouse inquiry.",
  "I understand the difficulty of figuring out who is controlling in -- in Price Waterhouse. But at least as it has been applied, my understanding -- I understand it has been applied in different ways. My understanding of what people mean when they say \"the Price Waterhouse approach,\" which is that there is a higher showing of evidence, direct evidence, whatever -- people don't agree on what that means. But if you meet that showing, then the burden of persuasion shifts to the employer on the issue of causation.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt.",
  "Why don't you - -",
  "I will let you get your third reason in in a minute, but why -- do you really think it's fair to pick one part of a complicated test that the court has constructed and say, well, this one doesn't make any sense, and pull it out? I mean, maybe it only makes sense in the context of the whole construct, or maybe none of the elements actually make sense. But it seems to me very artificial to focus on one aspect and say, let's fix this, without assessing what its impact is on the rest of the text.",
  "That was -- that was because -- that was because of the 1991 Act which addressed Title VII and quite deliberately left ADEA out.",
  "You are asking us to overrule the aspect of Price Waterhouse involving direct evidence, at least if you look at Justice O'Connor's opinion.",
  "What -- what would be the position of the Solicitor General on just saying let's get rid of all these artificial court constructions and say this is like any other case, the plaintiff has the burden of persuasion and the defendant can come up with what defenses he has, including that, I did this for some other reason, it wasn't because of age, and the jury looks at it and decides who they believe?",
  "The statute -- the statute has language. It says \"because of.\" Tell the jury that.",
  "Go ahead and make your third point briefly.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips?",
  "Can I get back to Justice Stevens's hypothetical? You have two people making a decision; one says it's because of age and the one says it's because of something, and -- a legitimate factor -- and you acknowledge that could get to the jury?",
  "And is it under an instruction that simply says \"because of\"?",
  "Well, but I mean - - you say - -",
  "You say \"but for\" causation, but my understanding of Justice Stevens's hypothetical is that it's going to be very hard to say that one would not have had -- the discrimination, the alleged action, would not have happened but for one factor or the other if they are just two different factors. You would just leave that up to the jury to say because of?",

I mean, what if the Framers - - couldn't they be have been more concerned about making sure that there is a free flow of commerce, that ships go, and the fact that everything is taxed would be less of a concern to them? But you're -- you're willing to say that if it's nondiscriminatory, even if you would call it a \"tonnage tax,\" you lose?",
  "But you don't -- you don't suggest that it matters, right? You -- you have talked to some extent in the briefs about the bad - - evil motive.",
  "But you are not going to suggest that the same tax could be valid or invalid depending on why it was enacted.",
  "I was going to say, even if it's a flat fee?",
  "Every vessel has to pay, you know, $1,000.",
  "Well, but just on a -- maybe this doesn't matter. I have seen the capacity of cargo planes described in terms of tonnage. Does this clause apply to those?",
  "It is that we have an evolving Constitution, after all.",
  "Well, then, do you know -- it's not an entirely frivolous point. I mean, do you know if States, localities where airports are located charge things that might be viewed as Tonnage Clauses on airplanes?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Olson.",
  "Counsel, if you - - if you are right that any type of ad valorem tax is okay, well, then why in the world would the Framers have adopted a prohibition on a tonnage tax, if you could just say it's a tax on value, which is going to have the same impact on commerce?",
  "Well, putting aside what the Court has said, I'm looking at what the Framers have said. What good does a tonnage tax prohibition do --",
  "-- if you are right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Where -- where does the money go? If the City of Valdez collects it, where does it go?",
  "Well, then I think we ought to regard it as a city tax, not a State tax.",
  "They collect it; they keep it; that sounds like a city tax.",
  "Well, I suppose the State can regulate what cities and municipalities and counties can do throughout the State. That doesn't make everything those cities and counties do the actions of the State.",
  "How -- under your view, how is a city supposed to impose a property tax on a vessel?",
  "So -- so you think we should resolve the tax by seeing how generally applicable property taxes are in Valdez?",
  "Well, but your - - your brother suggests that other items of property are taxed under other provisions of the tax ordinance.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1090, Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, and the consolidated case. Mr. Franklin.",
  "I take it your argument would be no different if this involved some other area. It doesn't depend upon the deference under the foreign affairs - -",
  "That is before the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.",
  "Well, you don't doubt, in absence of the waiver, that this is a claim that could proceed under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act?",
  "And that claim could --",
  "Putting aside the waiver, that claim could proceed despite the fact that there has been a change in the governing authority in Iraq?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein.",
  "Well, there may have not been a new one, but there certainly was not the old one either.",
  "But that's -- that's just a belt-and-suspenders act. I mean, he -- he has the authority here, and he -- although it may look difficult, he has to envision there may be people who challenge that -- his interpretation of the law. So there's the other provision that will make it inapplicable under that as well.",
  "If I could just pause - -",
  "-- for a moment. The -- the President in exercising this waiver purported to act not only under the statute but under the Constitution as well. So if we were to accept your argument, we would have to decide whether or not he had the power under the Constitution.",
  "Well, it's not presented because your friends on the other side think the -- on a narrower ground, that the statute applies. But if we agree with you and disagree with that, it seems to me that he has an argument -- the President has the argument that he has this authority under the Constitution.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Franklin, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-289, Horne v. Flores and the consolidated case. Mr. Starr.",
  "Very much true. Counsel, why don't you try and answer?",
  "Well, I still don't have an answer to Justice Breyer's -- I guess Justice Scalia's question following up on Justice Breyer's. What are the parameters or the -- the data with respect to the figures Justice Breyer gave you?",
  "So the answer is that Justice Breyer's figures are correct with respect to the appropriate bases of children. You are just saying that you want to use a different test than the one that he was quoting?",
  "Right. The figures are accurate. You just think a different test should be used?",
  "You lost me.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "But I guess, as I understand Justice Alito's question, if the prior order is based on funding a particular plan and the State comes back and says, this is a new approach. It could be for any number of reasons, and say that, you know, the plan is not working, or there have been other budgetary crises in the State that strain what we can afford to spend on this particular program. Here's another plan. The funding levels are different. You should look at it.",
  "What's wrong with that?",
  "It's not a question of progress; it's a question of the plan and the approach. And I understood the Ninth Circuit -- I'm looking at page 72a -- it talks about the ELL's specific funding that was based on the prior order. And what I understood the State's submission to be -- look at what the superintendent has done in this particular case, and so on, so that those specific funding levels aren't applicable. And I would have thought it an extraordinary enough thing for a district court to tell a State legislature: Pass this budget, and you, Legislature, pass it, and -- I guess -- you, Governor, sign it, or you are not going to be in compliance. And if they've come up with a different way with different funding requirements, I don't know why that's not a changed circumstance that justifies looking at the judgment - -",
  "Well, I don't think the State -- I didn't understand the State to disagree that there's still work to be done. I thought that the plan -- the point was that their approach had changed, including by No Child Left Behind, that they don't have to reach the same specific funding levels that the district court order required. And what I understood the Ninth Circuit to say is, no, those specific funding levels are still in place.",
  "Is there any - -",
  "Does -- then does that stay true without regard to what is happening economically to the State? In other words, the district court can say: You've got to spend this much money on this program, and I don't care what it means for jails, roads, anything else, when there are profound changes in economic circumstances of the sort that everybody's experiencing lately.",
  "But I gather it's often the case in institutional litigation of this sort that the political figures, whether it's the Governor or the Attorney General, can't go to the voters say, look, we should spend more money on this. So they go to the district court judge and say, make us spend more money on this. And they get the same result they'd wanted in a non-democratic way, particularly when there's a division, such as here the legislature doesn't want to do something, and the Governor or the Attorney General does. So why should we put a lot of weight on what the representation is when we are at least concerned that it might be a -- I don't mean it in a pejorative sense -- but a collusive piece of litigation?",
  "Well, it's hard for the Attorney General to get funding from the legislature for all he wants to do, and this is a way for him to get it, to go to the legislature and say look, you don't have a choice.",
  "Can I ask just a question that was confusing to me? What standard for changed circumstances do you understand the Ninth Circuit to have applied?",
  "Which is?",
  "I am looking at page 72a of the Ninth Circuit opinion, and the standard they use there is radically changed, not significantly changed.",
  "So, if we have a - - if we are confused as to which standard they applied, because at one point they say significantly changed and at another point they say radically changed, what should we do?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Counsel, when you were starting out I heard you articulate a third standard, materially changed. What is your understanding of the standard applied by the Ninth Circuit? Was it materially changed, significantly changed or radically changed?",
  "Well, I don't either but I see both of them being different from radically changed.",
  "I still have trouble with the idea of district courts ordering State legislatures to fund it. Isn't the preferable approach for the district court to say you have a violation, you have to fix it, and I'm going check to see if you fixed it at particular intervals? And it's up to you, the State, to determine how you are going to fix it. And the State might change its mind. They may start out by saying we have got all of this extra money and that's how we will fix it. Then there is a budget crisis, the kind that we are familiar with, and he says we can't the money, we are going to do it some other way, and here's the way. But that's kind of the judgment of the State, not for the district court.",
  "Why does it order then -- why did its order specify and be linked to the termination of the legislative session, and say you have 12 days left in the session and that's how many days you have to enact this budget?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Starr, you have three minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-479, Safford Unifed School District v. Redding. Mr. Wright.",
  "Any place, even though he had perhaps no reasonable suspicion to suspect that she was hiding the contraband in her underwear?",
  "Any place? I mean, prison inmates, for example, are subject to much more intrusive searches. Are you suggesting that would have been justified in this case?",
  "Can I ask just a follow-up on your answer to Justice Kennedy's earlier question about whether the informant was subject to civil suit. When you said no, did you mean she hadn't been sued or that she could not be sued?",
  "Okay.",
  "When was the -- when was she detained there in relation to the lunchtime period, which was when the other student had said that all the kids were going to take these pills?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Wright. Mr. O'Neil.",
  "Before you get started, do we have to reach the underlying merits or can we just decide the qualified immunity issue?",
  "Should -- should, but must?",
  "That sounds like you --",
  "That sounds to me like the sliding scale that you reject from the Ninth Circuit.",
  "Oh, surely not. You are saying if you have reasonable suspicion that it's in the underwear, you shouldn't even bother searching the pack or the pockets. You should go straight to the underwear. That can't be right.",
  "But if your - - accepting your argument that there may be no reasonable suspicion based on Marissa saying this is the person who gave me the drugs, does the fact that she said kids are going to -- the kids are going to take these drugs at lunchtime, a specific time, does that present a difference in the level of concern that the school should have?",
  "How is a school administrator supposed to know? Marissa says: She gave me these pills. What are they? I don't know. And so how is the -- if it depends whether it's a dangerous drug like crack or a relatively -- not harmless, but a different one like ibuprofen, the search depends on that, how is the school administrator supposed to know?",
  "So what is the school administrator supposed to know when he sees a white pill and doesn't know if it's something terribly harmful, even deadly, or if it's prescription strength ibuprofen? You say in the former case he can search undergarments, in the latter case he can't. So how is the administrator supposed to know what he's dealing with?",
  "I'm sorry, your answer to me was they have to take it seriously. My question to you is, what is the administrator supposed to do? He sees a white pill; nobody can tell him what it is. Is he allowed at that point to search the undergarments or not?",
  "He's not?",
  "Even if it turns out to be -- you know, I don't know, some very deadly drug?",
  "That's what you just told us we should do, in answer to Justice Alito's question.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Wolf.",
  "I don't think the case can begin and end with that because we have the separate issue of qualified immunity. Can we take that off the table? I mean, we have got six to five in the Ninth Circuit, disagreement throughout in this case, and yet you say the rule is so clearly established that you can make these school officials personally liable.",
  "What if - -",
  "What if what Marissa has is heroin? The school administrator recognizes heroin. She says: This is what the student gave me? Search the undergarments or not?",
  "Just to combine it with -- with your answers to Justice Kennedy, you are saying it's unreasonable to take off the outer garments even if your suspicion, reasonable suspicion for justifying the preliminary search is that the student has heroin?",
  "Well, you've made that point several times. In fact the issue here covers the brassier as well, which doesn't seem as outlandish as the underpants, right?",
  "Yes.",
  "Maybe I'm -- maybe I'm not articulating this. You keep focusing on the fact that it's unlikely that the pills would be concealed in her underpants. That doesn't go to the brassiere at all.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Wolf. Mr. Wright, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-660, United States, ex rel. Eisenstein v. the City of New York. Mr. Schor.",
  "You wouldn't have to -- you wouldn't have to do anything like that at all. He would just file before 30 days just to be on the safe side. It's not like he's going to say, I'm going to analyze this 100-page document to see whether I get an extra 30 days to do something as simple as filing a notice of appeal.",
  "And -- and if the inquiry says it's hard to tell, there's a 30-day limit and there's a 60 day limit, I don't know of any responsible counsel who wouldn't file within 30 days.",
  "Why would that - - why would it -- I mean, it would still apply to the government or any case in which the government is a party, where it's not an issue whether is the government a party or not.",
  "Oh, no, no, no, I agree with you that it -- I'm just saying why in a world would the relator want to invoke the 60-day provision if there's at all -- at all a question about whether it's 30 days or 60 days?",
  "So -- yes, but - - you don't have to know that before you file the one-page notice of appeal. I mean, if you need more time, you can get more time, but you don't have to know all of that. It's not going to cost you a lot of money to file the notice of appeal.",
  "So there may be - - there may be a lot of reasons the relator will not pursue an appeal. I don't think there's any reason that the relator would not file a notice of appeal within 30 days or, if he doesn't like 30 days, you ask for an extension of time for another 30 days. Then the whole issue is moot.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rephen.",
  "This is certainly a trap for the unaware, right? I mean, every lawyer loves to win on a technicality, but - -",
  "It says if the United States is a party, it is -- it is 60; if it's not, it's 30. And you have got a situation where the United States -- the action is brought in the name of the United States.",
  "I know, but this is such a -- such a trap for the unwary that you never even raise this point. It was raised sua sponte by the court of appeals.",
  "Well, my point is if it didn't occur to you, how can you claim that it should definitely have occurred to your friend on the other side?",
  "How about -- I'm sorry. Why don't you finish, counselor?",
  "Counsel, how does it work in -- presumably, I guess the government can decide that it wants to appeal the case in which it has not participated below, right?",
  "It has to move to intervene. So let's say there's a judgment and the government looks at it and says: Well, we didn't know we would get a decision like this; We've got to appeal this. The relator doesn't want to appeal it. 30 days goes by. The Government moves to intervene because it has 60 days.",
  "So for all the reasons in the legislative history that you discussed about why the government gets more time, those reasons don't apply in that situation?",
  "Counsel, I -- I pressed your friend about what's the big deal, why don't you just file within 30. It only seems fair to press you on what's the big deal with letting them have for",
  "-- which also solves the problem of the potential trap for the unwary.",
  "Well, I agree with that. I agree with that. But what if we say - -",
  "I'm sorry. What if I say, or whoever is writing the opinion says, this is only for purposes of filing the appeal? We don't decide whether the government is a party in all these other characteristics, but whether it comes to Rule 4(a) - -",
  "Well, it should be construed narrowly. I don't think saying whether it's 30 or 60 days at all implicates that principle.",
  "Well, yeah, but I mean, if we assume you're right, then that's construing it narrowly. But the whole question is that there's some confusion in the rule about who's right, and all I'm saying is it seems to me that it would be the easiest thing to avoid any trap for the unwary with no consequences on the other side, to say 60 days.",
  "Oh, this isn't going to delay appeals, for heaven's sakes. I mean, there's all sorts of scheduling rules about the timing of the briefs and everybody gets an extension on their briefs. This is going to have no effect whatever on how quickly appeals move along.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall.",
  "What -- why do you care? I mean, you're just giving people who might well be confused by this provision another 30 days.",
  "Okay, but, again, we would limit any decision to Federal Rule of Appeal 4 because of the dramatically adverse consequences for the unwary. They lose their right to pursue their case.",
  "Well, I just does did. Under FRAP 4, you're out the door without any hearing on the merits. It's a technicality. The spirit of the rules is that we don't throw people out because of mere technicalities. Now, failure to file a timely notice of appeal is not a technicality in terms of the consequences.",
  "I'm sure that the Appellate Rules Advisory Committee, when they hear this decision, if they haven't already, will put something in the rules about whether it's 30 days or 60 days. So I'm not terribly concerned about clarity going forward. It's going to be made clear by the Advisory Committee and the submission of new rules, and I see no reason that they wouldn't make it clear. I don't know whether they'll think 30 or 60 is the best idea.",
  "So it's just a question of -- in this case and, as Justice Stevens pointed out, what the effect is going to be on other cases. And it seems to me that in that situation, 60 days makes the most sense because otherwise you're disrupting the system solely based on a trap for the unwary.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Wall. Mr. Schor, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument today in Case 07-1428, Ricci v. DeStefano, and the consolidated case. Mr. Coleman.",
  "Are you assuming - -",
  "Are you - -",
  "Counsel, some time ago you said you had two answers to Justice Breyer's question. I would like to hear the second one.",
  "Maybe if you don't mind, you could remind me what the second answer was.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Coleman. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "With respect to both blacks and whites, correct?",
  "So, can you assure me that the government's position would be the same if this test -- black applicants -- firefighters scored highest on this test in disproportionate numbers, and the City said we don't like that result, we think there should be more whites on the fire department, and so we're going to throw the test out? The government of United States would adopt the same position?",
  "Yeah.",
  "That's the part I don't understand. What you're saying is that the department can engage in intentional discrimination to avoid concern that they will be sued under disparate impact. Why doesn't it work the other way around as well? Why don't they say, well, we've got to tolerate the disparate impact because otherwise, if we took steps to avoid it, we would be sued for intentional discrimination? This idea that there is this great dilemma -- I mean, it cuts both ways.",
  "Counsel, this may be the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I'd like something closer to a yes or no answer. Does the government consider promotion of diversity by itself a compelling state interest in the employment context as opposed to the school context?",
  "Can it be - -",
  "Can it be advanced by taking actions to avoid what is perceived as a disparate impact?",
  "In other words, the disparate impact is regarded as something you can intentionally respond to by drawing racial distinctions solely because you would like a more diverse workforce?",
  "It didn't care - -",
  "It didn't care -- it had to draw racial distinctions because it looked at the test and said, we think there's a problem because of the racial makeup of who's going to get the promotions.",
  "It didn't look at names; it just looked at the label of what their race was. That's all they were concerned about.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Meade.",
  "Can I ask you - -",
  "Can I ask you to touch on the distinction between racial discrimination and race-conscious action? The actions that were taken in many of our cases, in Croson and Adarand, Parents Involved, Wygant, were obviously race-conscious actions; there was a reason that the governments in those cases were taking the action. It was because of what they saw as the impact on race. Yet we concluded that was racial discrimination. So what's the -- how do you draw the line between race-conscious that's permitted and racial discrimination that's not?",
  "Well, but if we - - if we agree with your -- I mean, you're assuming, it seems to me in your argument, that the actions that they've taken here are not intentional racial discrimination; and of course if they're not, then you don't have much to worry about. But let's assume that they are, as we found they were in Croson and Wygant and Adarand and Parents Involved.",
  "And the only reason you say that isn't by an individual is that you have blacked out the names?",
  "So your position is what? They threw out the test, so you would have no problem at all if they looked at those results and they were predominantly black rather than white; you would say the city can throw out the test and there's no racial discrimination there at all?",
  "So this case would come out differently, if the list was there with then names and they go down and instead of saying throw out the test, they said Jones, you don't get the promotion because you're white; Johnson, you don't get it because you're white. And they go down the list and throw out everybody who took the test; then that would be all right?",
  "So they can keep - - they get do-overs until it comes out right? Or throw out this test; they do another test; oh, it's just as bad, throw that one out; get another one that's a little better, but not so -- throw that one out?",
  "Well if -- how many times before it's a problem?",
  "You say if they did it over and over again. What if they did it twice here?",
  "Is that -- I am sorry. Is that correct if we -- we conclude strict scrutiny does apply under the Constitution? Compliance with a statute, looking at impact, is a compelling interest trumping strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause?",
  "I guess it would go to how you construe the statute. It seems to me an odd argument to say that you can violate the Constitution because you have to comply with the statute.",
  "Can I get back just -- just -- since I don't understand it yet, the distinction between intentional racial discrimination and race conscious action. I thought both the plurality and the concurrence in Parents Involved accepted the fact that race conscious action such as school siting or drawing district lines is -- is okay, but discriminating in particular assignments is not. Now, why is this not intentional discrimination? I understood you to say it was because you don't have particular individuals being treated on the basis of their race. You are going to have to explain that to me again, because there are particular individuals here. They are the plaintiffs, and they say they didn't get their jobs because of intentional racial action by the -- the city. Why is that not on the racial -- intentionally racial discrimination side rather than the permissible race consciousness side?",
  "Well, that -- you may be right that that's what the question is about. I still don't have in my mind from you a line about how we decide. Because there are many cases, Croson, Adarand, Wygant, Parents Involved, where we said action taken obviously because of race is nonetheless discrimination. So -- and then there are cases where we have recognized that race conscious action is permissible. Again, what -- when I look at something like this, how I do decide which side of the line that's on -- this is on?",
  "But just to take Parents Involved, it wasn't a necessary -- the driving factor was not a specific decision with respect to specific individuals. They didn't care whether it was Jones or Smith that they were citing. All they cared about was the race. And it seems the -- the same here. You maybe don't care whether it's Jones or Smith who is not getting the promotion. All you care about is who is getting the promotion. All you care about is his race.",
  "You just referred - -",
  "I'm sorry. You just referred to a discriminatory test. What you said in the district court, and I quote, the issue is not whether the tests were valid. Are you just changing positions on that?",
  "Justice Kennedy.",
  "What type of -- what type of other things are you talking about there?",
  "Well, the question, I guess, would be whether the program was valid or not under the traditional approaches you take under Title VII.",
  "So does your position here depend on a conclusion that this test is invalid?",
  "So your response to me that you don't have to show that the test is invalid, your argument is you just have to show that there's a basis for being worried that it might be invalid. And then it seems to me the only distinction is how high a showing you require. And you reject the idea that you have to show a strong basis in the evidence?",
  "I understand from -- I guess I should say I understand from your brief if not from your argument that - -",
  "You agree with the strong basis in fact standard?",
  "So I guess, my -- so my -- your position is that you should never have a strong basis in fact standard, because you don't think strict scrutiny should apply, and you think if it's under Title VII, it's only reasonableness?",
  "So your position is that the city -- the -- the government can take action without -- only if it's reasonable. It's a reasonable view of whether or not they might or might not be liable. That's the standard. And then they can engage in race-based action?",
  "Well, what is something less than that, that they might be sued?",
  "Isn't that -- isn't that kind of a blank check to discriminate, if all they need is a reasonable basis to think that further investigation might be useful?",
  "No, I'm sorry - - that's an answer about why it would be okay. I'm just saying, isn't it in fact a blank check?",
  "But - -",
  "I'm sorry - -",
  "I still -- I still don't have absolutely yes -- of what?",
  "Yes, they can - -",
  "Well, just to get back to your answer to Justice Stevens, you say they'd have to certify it. You say that, in that situation, the decisionmaker could not have a reasonable basis for thinking further investigation is required. Why? Just because the second test came out the same way? It's not at all reasonable to think they ought to look at it further?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Coleman, to keep the time even here, I think you have 8 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Nijhawan v. Holder. Mr. Moseley.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon.",
  "Well, but then you just -- you, the government, says -- you know, you'll have a little debate about what the special interrogatory, how it is phrased, and your objection there could be dealt with on -- during that negotiation.",
  "Mr. Gannon, we're dealing with the definition of a particular term, aggravated felony. And yet you say the only thing that you have to prove under the protections of criminal law to prove that this is an aggravated felony is that it involved fraud or deceit. Now, the other elements - - the other provisions here talk about firearms offenses, child pornography offenses, national security offenses, but here it's fraud or deceit. I mean, it's a felony, but there's nothing that strikes -- strikes me that it's particularly an aggravated felony.",
  "And yet that's all you have to prove with the protections of the criminal law as opposed to the civil.",
  "But not subject to the protections of criminal law that you have to show.",
  "Beyond the reasonable doubt, with the jury protections.",
  "Yes, I guess what I'm saying, the only thing that makes this aggravated, the $10,000, in contrast to the other things, which are aggravated by virtue of elements that you have to approve -- you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt -- is that it's fraud ir deceit. And as I said, there's nothing about that that -- it's bad, but it doesn't strike me as particularly aggravated.",
  "Well, that's just -- I think that's kind of begging the question. You assume that those elements, those provisions also don't have to be proved as elements. And what I'm suggesting, I guess, is that if the only thing that makes it aggravated is -- is something you don't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems that we ought to look, well, is that really aggravated?",
  "And when you're talking about firearm offenses, or child pornography, yes, that's aggravated; but fraud and deceit is kind of a run of the mine felony.",
  "Well, I guess I don't understand how that's responsive. It's -- it's - -",
  "-- part of violence. In other words it seems to me you're already in the aggravated area, so it makes sense to say that's what you have to prove.",
  "I -- I guess I don't understand the answer, and I'm sorry if it's - -",
  "-- I'm hard to get through.",
  "It just -- you're saying is that there are exceptions, but I don't see that that detracts from the point that \"crime of violence\" -- you think right away, well, that's aggravated; national security crimes, that's aggravated; firearms offenses, that's aggravated. They're sort of on their own without respect to these other things that you say you only have to prove by the civil -- pursuant to the civil burden requirements. Fraud or deceit -- as I guess I've already said, that doesn't strike me as particularly aggravated.",
  "What makes it aggravated is something as to which you have a much lighter burden.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gannon.",
  "Mr. Moseley, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Bobby versus Bies. Mr. Mizer.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Blume.",
  "How far -- how far down do you go on applying the issue preclusion? Let's say there's a ruling by the court that a particular expert was not credible. I mean, is that binding in a subsequent proceeding?",
  "Well, that's narrowing it to your particular context. I would have assumed that the theory has to be more generally applicable, and not just applicable in the particular Atkins context. If you can have issue preclusion with respect to an underlying factual question under which the loser can assert that, I don't see why it wouldn't apply more generally. That's a theory of the Double Jeopardy Clause, not of Atkins.",
  "Well, this strikes me as the sort of case where their incentives might well be different, as Justice Ginsburg suggested. If you're dealing with a borderline case, you don't -- and you think you have very compelling aggravating factors, you know, why call attention to the -- the mitigating factor of the mental condition when your case can be won on the others?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mizer, you have ten minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "This morning we will first hear argument in Case 08-305, Forest Grove School District v. T.A. Mr. Feinerman.",
  "I remember, perhaps incorrectly, from the prior argument here that the period that they had to try out the school plan was ten days?",
  "Not a hard and fast rule.",
  "So is that -- is that a period that your client's prepared to accept?",
  "Counsel - -",
  "-- why isn't it the case that the school's diagnosis is a related service under the statutory provision? It seems to me to be very important service to the parents to know what the school's diagnosis is.",
  "No, I'm talking about what the parents received. And they receive a diagnosis, and the statute covers -- asks whether they previously received special education and related services. Diagnosis would seem to me to be a service related to special education.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Salmons.",
  "What is wrong with ten days? I mean it's -- it's a big expense you are asking the school district to incur, that will take away funds from other programs. And all -- all they are saying is give it a try for ten days, and if it doesn't work out, then you can go?",
  "Oh, yes, the first day -- the first day they say, look, we don't think this is going to work out, so we are notifying you what we are going to do. And they say, well, you've got to do that in ten days, and they said, okay, ten days.",
  "Well, I suppose that's right, but once the law is clarified, schools that specialize in -- in treating these kids would be able -- they would understand as well, and they would understand you've got to -- the people who are going to be sending -- most of the people who will be sending their children to the school have to wait ten days. And it seems to me that the actual practice on the ground would work out pretty easily.",
  "Well, which way does that cut? It seems to me that cuts the other way.",
  "Here's a -- here's a new plan. We've worked on it. Here it is. At least give it ten days -- two school week tries.",
  "With respect, counsel, what Congress provided is that the child must have previously received special education and related services.",
  "So I think they did provide that you've got to try it out at least for a minimal period.",
  "Okay. So what type of special education services do you think do count as having been previously received?",
  "In reading -- in reading it that way, you are reading the phrase \"who previously received special education services\" to mean also who previously did not receive special education services.",
  "Yeah, so it doesn't matter whether they previously received or not.",
  "So you are saying Congress went to the trouble of spelling out this elaborate provision in (C)(iii) and (ii) and all the other things, but that was not the universe of the situations in which there could be reimbursement? They went to that trouble, but then -- at the end you want to say or some other provisions or some other circumstances?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Miller.",
  "Well, for 10 days, right? Even assuming the bad faith that you are ascribing to the school district, it would only work for 10 days, right?",
  "And then they would have -- then they would have previously received special education services, and they could proceed.",
  "\"Stonewall\" sounds to me like bad faith.",
  "That was the word you used.",
  "Well, let's move to the situation where they have a plan that the parents regard as inadequate.",
  "In that situation all they would have to do is to have the child try the plan for 10 days.",
  "Counsel, this is Spending Clause legislation. Do you have any rough idea of how much of the obligation incurred by the States is reimbursed by the Federal Government? What percentage?",
  "So if this interpretation vastly expands the liability of school districts in that particular area, isn't that a consideration we should consider? Since they accept - - the States accept 10 percent of the funds to incur these obligations and then you are expanding the obligation in a way that we may at least find is ambiguous, isn't that a pertinent factor?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Feinerman, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-453, Cuomo v. The Clearing House Association. Ms. Underwood.",
  "Well, that's correct with respect to a particular loan. It's not respect - - with respect to Federal policy about national banks around the country. It's conceivable and I suppose likely that the Federal regulator would want the same rule to apply to banks in Michigan as to banks in Hawaii.",
  "There is an historic reason for thinking that Congress would be more concerned about States exercising visitorial powers than they would be about private attorneys general or private lawyers. This goes back to McCulloch v. Maryland. National banks were always targeted by the States. They weren't typically targeted by private attorneys. So that incongruity doesn't strike me as terribly significant.",
  "Do you want to talk a little bit about Chevron?",
  "Whatever the arguments may be on the merits, it's not clear to me that visitorial powers has an unambiguous meaning that would pre-empt the authority of the OCC to explain it to us.",
  "Well, but -- I'm sorry, but it certainly is pre-empted with respect to visitorial powers.",
  "This kind of gets us back to where we started.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Stewart.",
  "Is your concern that -- not with the substantive State law, but that leaving enforcement to the States would cause particular problems? I mean there may be a State law provision that says you shall do this, and the way the attorney general elects to enforce it is by shutting the bank down, jailing the bank officers, doing all sorts of things that -- that the -- the Federal Government may not consider appropriate.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Ms. Underwood.",
  "Counsel, why isn't it a complete answer to what I agree is a somewhat unusual situation of pre-empting enforcement but not the substance of law that its enforcement that raises the concerns? That the Federal Government thinks the State law is fine, but when you get attorneys general enforcing it in a particular way, that's what causes the problem. And I mean, the problem arises in a lot of areas. Even within the Federal Government, the FBI and DEA have different ways of enforcing that might conflict with each other. Why doesn't that make perfect sense?",
  "So, why -- why is it a mistake? Why can't Congress or the OCC think that that's where the difficulties are going to arise? In other words, it's kind of a less intrusive approach, and saying, well, you can have your State law but we are concerned about enforcement, so we are going to be the ones that enforce it.",
  "So your answer is because they have different entities that can enforce it, they are sort of in for a penny, in for a pound? If you let anybody else enforce it, you have got to let everybody else enforce it?",
  "Including the entities that have historically have targeted national banks?",
  "No, I suppose the question would not be what we think is a good idea but what Congress has done. And here the OCC has interpreted what Congress has done is to make exclusive the OCC regulation only with respect to enforcement.",
  "I would suppose you would thank them for that rather than criticize them for it.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Underwood. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument this morning in Case 08-322, Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District v. Holder. Mr. Coleman.",
  "It may be -- it may be a political subdivision under those decisions, but it's certainly not a political subdivision under the statutory definition.",
  "Well, presumably you wouldn't have standing to raise it because you wouldn't be subject to the preclearance requirement.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Coleman. Mr. Katyal.",
  "Counsel, the -- the -- our -- our decision in City of Boerne said that action under section 5 has to be congruent and proportional to what it's trying to remedy. Here, as I understand it, one-twentieth of 1 percent of the submissions are not precleared. That, to me, suggests that they are sweeping far more broadly than they need to, to address the intentional discrimination under the Fifteenth Amendment.",
  "Well, that's like the old -- you know, it's the elephant whistle. You know, I have this whistle to keep away the elephants. You know, well, that's silly. Well, there are no elephants, so it must work. I mean, if you have 99.98 percent of these being precleared, why isn't that reaching far too broadly.",
  "Well, let me focus on that historical aspect. Obviously no one doubts the history here and that the history was different. But at what point does that history seek -- stop justifying action with respect to some jurisdictions but not with respect to others that show greater disparities?",
  "Well, so your answer is that Congress can impose this disparate treatment forever because of the history in the south?",
  "When can they - - when can they -- when do they have to stop?",
  "Well, they said five years originally and then another 20 years. I mean, at some point it begins to look like the idea is that this is going to go on forever.",
  "Well, why didn't Congress then extend the Act to Massachusetts, whereas your brother told us the disparity between Hispanic and non-Hispanic voting is far greater than jurisdictions that are covered?",
  "Counsel, I thought -- I thought our opinion in City of Boerne said that the problem that Section 5 legislation addresses has to be widespread and persisting. Do you think the record that is before us today shows widespread and persisting discrimination in voting?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Adegbile.",
  "So is it your -- is it your position that today southerners are more likely to discriminate than northerners?",
  "So your answer is yes?",
  "So -- but I guess that point depends upon the assumption that shortening the time period for early voting is discriminatory as opposed to good policy.",
  "So that was largely to protect the incumbent.",
  "Well, incumbent - -",
  "Incumbent protection takes place in the North as well as the South.",
  "Well, the cases you're talking about include both intentional and impact cases. And the Constitution that section 5 is designed to implement covers only intentional discrimination. So even the examples you have given sweep broadly as a prophylactic measure and then the section 5 preclearance of course sweeps even more broadly. So we do have a situation, despite the evidence that was -- that you have cited, where less than one-twentieth of 1 percent of the submissions that the States make are denied preclearance. Again, it seems to me that that means that section 5 sweeps very, very broadly.",
  "So your position is that it makes no difference if discrimination in the noncovered jurisdiction is more widespread and more persistent; it doesn't matter, because Congress can focus solely on the jurisdictions that have been covered since 1965?",
  "So I guess your answer is that they can address the covered jurisdictions that have been covered since 1965 without looking at all to the rest of the country?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Coleman, have you 5 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear reargument this morning in Case 08-205, Citizens United v. The Federal Election Commission. Mr. Olson.",
  "Counsel - -",
  "Counsel, in your discussion of Austin, you rely on its inconsistency with Bellotti. Bellotti, of course, involved a referendum and Austin expenditures in an individual election. Why isn't that a significant distinction?",
  "Now that we've cleared up that Bellotti didn't decide the question, what is the distinction that -- why don't you think that distinction makes sense? In other words, a corporate - - you don't have a potential for corruption if a corporation is simply speaking on a referendum that may directly affect its interest. If you are dealing with a candidate, what the Court has said in the past is that you do have that problem of corruption.",
  "In other words, why isn't that distinction a way to reconcile Bellotti and Austin?",
  "Where did we say that?",
  "Why don't you tell us now. We will give you time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Abrams. ON BEHALF OF SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL,",
  "And also inconsistent with his later view, correct?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Abrams. General Kagan.",
  "So you are giving up -- you are giving up the distinction from MCFL that you defended in your opening brief? There you said this doesn't qualify as a different kind of corporation because it takes corporate funds, and now you are changing that position?",
  "So I guess -- do you think MCFL applies in this case even though the corporation takes corporate funds from for-profit corporations?",
  "Do you -- do you think it's too strict?",
  "So you want to give up this case, change your position, and basically say you lose solely because of the questioning that we have directed on reargument?",
  "Because of the question we have posed on reargument.",
  "What case of ours - - what case of ours suggests that there is a hierarchy of bases on which we should rule against a party when both of them involve constitutional questions? Extending - - modifying MCFL would be, I assume, by virtue of the First Amendment. Overruling Austin would be by virtue of the First Amendment. So what case says we should prefer one as opposed to the other?",
  "Counsel, what do you -- what do you understand to be the compelling interest that the Court articulated in Austin?",
  "Right. So but you -- you have more or less -- \"abandoned\" is too strong a word, but as you say you have relied on a different interest, the quid pro quo corruption. And you -- you articulate on page 11 of your brief -- you recognize that this Court has not accepted that interest as a compelling interest. So isn't it the case that as you view Austin it is kind of up for play in the sense that you would ground it on an interest that the Court has never recognized?",
  "Where - -",
  "Where in your - - where in your supplemental briefing do you say that this aggregation of wealth interest supports Austin?",
  "Putting it outside, putting the quid pro quo interest aside, where in your supplemental briefing do you support the interest that was articulated by the Court in Austin?",
  "I understand that to be a different interest. That is the shareholder protection interest as opposed to the fact that corporations have such wealth and they -- they distort the marketplace.",
  "So -- so am I right then in saying that in the supplemental briefing you do not rely at all on the market distortion rationale on which Austin relied; not the shareholder rationale, not the quid pro quo rationale, the market distortion issue. These corporations have a lot of money.",
  "So if we have to preserve -- if we are going to preserve Austin we have to accept your invitation that the quid pro quo interest supports the holding there or the shareholder protection interest.",
  "Well, that's not -- I'm sorry, but that seems rather odd. A large corporation just like an individual has many diverse interests. A corporation may want to support a particular candidate, but they may be concerned just as you say about what their shareholders are going to think about that. They may be concerned that the shareholders would rather they spend their money doing something else. The idea that corporations are different than individuals in that respect, I just don't think holds up.",
  "So if a candidate - - take a tobacco company, and a candidate is running on the platform that they ought to make tobacco illegal, presumably that company would maximize its shareholders' interests by opposing the election of that individual.",
  "Well, I suppose some do, but let's say if you have ten individuals and they each contribute $1,000 to a corporation, and they say, \"we want this corporation to convey a particular message,\" why can't they do that, when if they did that as partnership, it would be all right?",
  "Counsel, could I ask, it seems -- to your shareholder protection rationale, isn't it extraordinarily paternalistic for the government to take the position that shareholders are too stupid to keep track of what their corporations are doing and can't sell their shares or object in the corporate context if they don't like it?",
  "You have a busy job. You can't expect everybody to do that.",
  "But it is extraordinary -- I mean, the -- the idea and as I understand the rationale, we -- we the government, big brother, has to protect shareholders from themselves. They might give money, they might buy shares in a corporation and they don't know that the corporation is taking out radio ads. The government has to keep an eye on their interests.",
  "So it is -- I mean, I understand. So it is a paternalistic interest, we the government have to protect you naive shareholders.",
  "It's not investing in our country's - -",
  "I take it we have never accepted your shareholder protection interest. This is a new argument.",
  "Well, I guess other than that, and I think there may be some ambiguity there, but I wouldn't say NRWC is a holding on shareholder protection. So to the extent that you abandoned the original rationale in Austin, and articulated different rationales, you have two, the quid pro quo corruption interest and the shareholder protection interest - -",
  "Austin, I thought, was based on the aggregation of immense wealth by corporations.",
  "Can you -- can you give me the citation to the page in Austin where we accepted the shareholder protection rationale?",
  "Do the words \"shareholder\" -- I don't know, do the words \"shareholder protection\" appear in the Austin opinion?",
  "If they don't - - let's assume they don't, then I get back to my question, which is, you are asking us to defend the Austin or support or continue the Austin opinion on the basis of two rationales that we have never accepted, shareholder protection and quid pro quo corruption?",
  "In the context of contributions, not expenditures.",
  "Is that a yes? Is that a yes? In other words, you are asking us to uphold Austin on the basis of two arguments, two principles, two compelling interests we have never accepted, in expenditure context.",
  "But we don't put our -- we don't put our First Amendment rights in the hands of FEC bureaucrats; and if you say that you are not going to apply it to a book, what about a pamphlet?",
  "Does cover books.",
  "Oh, I'm sorry, we suggested some in the last argument. You have a history of union organizing and union involvement in politics, and the last sentence says in light of all this, vote for Jones.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Waxman. ON BEHALF OF SENATORS JOHN McCAIN, ET AL.,",
  "One of the amicus briefs, I'm not -- maybe it's professor Hayward, if I am getting that right -- suggested the history of this 1947 provision was such that it really wasn't enforced because people were concerned about the First Amendment interests and that the courts to the extent cases were brought did everything they could to avoid enforcing the limitations.",
  "Well, Mr. Waxman, the government did have that opportunity, and the government compiled a record. And when the Citizens United abandoned that position -- you are quite right, they changed their course -- the government and the district court complained that it had to go to all this work to develop this record, and yet we hear nothing about what the record showed.",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Mr. Olson five minutes.",
  "Briefly.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-678, Mohawk Industries v. Carpenter. Mr. Allen.",
  "Some time ago Justice Breyer asked the question of why is this different than the other privileges, and I would like your answer to that.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Resnik.",
  "We will get to that, I think, when the government lawyer gets up. But does that distinction make sense to you?",
  "Government lawyers get the privilege, private lawyers don't?",
  "But we are talking about the central privilege to the maintenance of the adversary system which we've determined to be central to maintaining the rule of law. This is not like the other privileges, priest-penitent, other evidentiary privileges, because it is the privilege that allows lawyers to protect the interests in those other cases. And it just seems to me that -- that to allow a single ruling by a district court judge to undermine the privilege is going to affect people. What -- I mean, the statement of the lawyer could be, look, you are going to lose this case, and you are saying the district court can require the disclosure of that without allowing at least a quick trip to the court of appeals to check it out.",
  "Well, it matters which they do, right? If they are denying disclosure the statistics don't mean much.",
  "But it is a bit of a hurdle, isn't it, since you do have to satisfy the materially advanced -- the litigation and those other criteria?",
  "The usual way that the district court, after denying the recognition of the privilege, insists that people proceed is, they want the lawyer to go to jail. They say, You've got contempt, you can appeal contempt. The district judges, as you've mentioned, they want these things to move on and they tend not to think that their rulings are in error, and the lawyers are frequently confronted with an extremely difficult choice, of violating what they think is their ethical obligation or going to jail.",
  "Well, a protective order isn't going to work -- a protective order isn't going to work at all. You're not going to -- I mean, the lawyers on the other side get the privileged material, so they don't care -- I mean, in terms of the viability and protection of the privilege, it doesn't matter if the clients get it.",
  "Well, but the -- you know, the -- the American Bar Association has said the exact opposite. It will say that the opening up of the privilege and the disclosure, however rare the case is, will, in fact, undermine the -- the value of the privilege.",
  "Oh, sure, the other people are, too, but we -- I, at least, look at a brief of the American Bar Association and view that as a representation of how the people affected here, the lawyers, view the value of the privilege and what will happen to it.",
  "Oh, but the law - - the law professors aren't the ones who deal with this question on a day-to-day basis and have to worry about going to jail, if they want to protect their client's - - what they view as their ethical obligations.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kneedler?",
  "Well, except when the government is the one raising it.",
  "Yes, but, in the government context, what would be in the private context, an attorney-client privilege, is redressed as a different type of governmental privilege. When you give advice to a government agency, you don't call that the attorney-client privilege. You call it a governmental privilege, a deliberative privilege, all these other things. In the private sector, when you are an attorney and you give advice to a client, you can't say, This has got something. It's the attorney-client privilege.",
  "So you are saying that you -- government lawyers cannot seek an interlocutory appeal of any privilege claimed, other than Presidential communications and State secrets?",
  "I'm sorry. There are problems with 1292(b). Are you telling me, when your office writes a letter to the Department of Interior and says, Look, we are not going to appeal - - we will appeal your case, but we think you have got a really bad case, you are likely to lose; and you assert -- the only privilege you can assert is the attorney-client privilege, and, if a district judge says, that's not covered, for one reason or another, you -- you don't get an interlocutory appeal?",
  "You don't think that the attorney-client privileges rises to the level of who gets to -- who has to put up security for costs that was an issue in Cohen?",
  "We are not talking about -- I guess what, perhaps, the case comes down to is, if you think the attorney-client privilege is like every other evidentiary privilege that you have just listed, relevance, materiality, all those sorts of things, or if you think the attorney-client privilege is different, even more important than who has to post security for costs, because it is central to the rule of law, because it is central to how the adversary system functions.",
  "But the review -- I follow your answer but the review on final judgment is meaningless. I mean, the cat is out of the bag.",
  "The injury to the party, but not the injury to the attorney-client privilege.",
  "Putting aside the question of whether the attorney-client privilege has a good pedigree in public law, my experience has been that litigants on one side frequently request and demand in discovery material that they know is covered by the attorney-client privilege, one, precisely because that's where the good stuff is; and two, because it gives them leverage, because they know that the other side is going to have to go through this impossible process and can't get an immediate appeal. Why isn't that a concern that we should have?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Allen, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this term in Case 08-680, Maryland v. Shatzer. General Gansler.",
  "Without regard to the time? A break in custody of one day, do you think that should be enough?",
  "So what if it's repeatedly done? You know, you -- you bring him in, you give him his Miranda rights. He says, I don't want to talk. You let him go. You bring him in, give him his Miranda rights. He says, I don't want to talk. You know, just sort of catch and release, until he finally breaks down and says, All right, I'll talk.",
  "So I thought Roberson told us it's not a different question, that it's the same question. Roberson did not draw a distinction between what crime he was being questioned on the second time.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Heytens.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Davis.",
  "I'm sorry to interrupt you -- interrupt there, and I will let you get back to the answer. They should attempt to do so. The rule here does not allow the police to approach that person, a murder suspect. And you are saying he cannot even be approached to see if he would waive his rights ten years later because he was -- invoked the right in connection with joy riding?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, but not - -",
  "It was one day. He said he wanted the - -",
  "-- to remain silent in the evening, and at 9:00 the next morning they were back.",
  "So then I don't understand why your answer to Justice Alito's hypothetical was what it was, because that person obvious was not in custody.",
  "Well, but the Miranda Rights do not require the police to provide counsel. They have to mean -- mean you have to stop questioning, until the person has right to counsel.",
  "And the one thing this person knew from the prior Miranda situation -- was 2003?",
  "Is that, if he said, \"I don't want to talk without counsel,\" the one thing he knew is that the police would stop questioning because that's what they did.",
  "Well, Miranda doesn't - -",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Well, you say, \"in captivity,\" but you think the rule applies, whether they are in captivity or not. In -- in Justice Alito's hypothetical, the person was free for 40 years, so captivity is not a limitation on your -- your proposed rule.",
  "Well, I suppose, if they are in a pretrial detention center, they know they are still being looked at for the crime as to which they have invoked the Miranda warnings.",
  "So you wouldn't call that -- and I don't understand the other side to argue that that is -- there is a break in custody there.",
  "No. No. I agree with you. There shouldn't be a break there, but, here, the situation is quite different. There is a break between jail for questioning and prison for 15 years - - or whatever your sentence is.",
  "That is a -- isn't that a Sixth Amendment question? That's not a Miranda question, if he has not been provided a lawyer.",
  "Right. Right. And it's the Fifth Amendment we are worried about, and that is directed to coercion - -",
  "-- and that is addressed, if you stop questioning him. You don't even start questioning him, if he says, Look, I don't want to talk without a lawyer.",
  "Talking stopped, as it did the very -- the first time he was approached.",
  "So if he says -- I'm sorry - -",
  "Are you done answering? So if he said, instead of I want to talk to a lawyer, if he said, I want to remain silent, your case comes out differently? He doesn't say anything about a lawyer. He says, Look, I don't want to talk to you.",
  "Well, but all your arguments about he hasn't been provided a lawyer, there is an ethical obligation to provide a lawyer. Those - - those are off the table.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Davis. General Gansler, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-6925, Johnson v. United States. Ms. Call.",
  "What -- what about the government's argument that your interpretation would dramatically limit the reach of this provision of ACCA because of the number of States that define battery in the same way Florida does?",
  "Yeah, but it's - - it's usually easier just to charge the lowest common denominator, the battery that doesn't necessarily require violent force, and the point -- this was the argument that was accepted in -- in Hayes, that the interpretation, say, advanced by the dissent in that case, would mean that there be a vast number of States that weren't covered. I mean, presumably, Congress meant to cover all the States.",
  "But I thought the evidence was pretty clear that Congress was adopting the common law definition of battery here, which doesn't require that higher degree of force or violence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kruger.",
  "Well, then why didn't they say -- why didn't they just say battery, if that's what they meant? It's a lot simpler and also clearer than to say physical force against the person.",
  "Wait, I don't follow that at all. I mean, I understand your argument that physical force means the slightest touching, but I don't understand the argument that the slightest touching presents a serious risk of potential physical injury.",
  "Yeah, but your argument is to try -- is asserting that the slightest physical touching is covered by the statute.",
  "Well, every indication except for the fact that they didn't use the word battery.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Call, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-728, Bloate v. United States. Mr. Stancil.",
  "Could a district judge, as part of his normal pretrial order, say that I am inclined to grant normal motions for extensions, but I think so we don't run into these problems that it's in the best interest of justice that whatever time I grant, I issue an order covered by (h)(7)(A)? That avoids all this problem. I don't have to worry about the Speedy Trial Act when I grant you a motion, because whatever I grant you is going to be excluded under (h)(7)(A).",
  "But presumably, a judge can do it in every case. You are saying they can't tell you in advance this is what they are going to do, but they can do it automatically in every case?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Roberts.",
  "Could I ask a specific date question? Am I right that you would exclude the time from September 7th to October 4th?",
  "Well, that doesn't -- I'm not sure that makes much sense. Before the motion for extension was filed, the hearing date for pretrial motions was September 20. After the extension was filed and granted, the hearing date was October 4th. So the only period of delay that you could say resulted from the extension was from September 20 to October 4, or 13 days. Well, how can you possibly count the time as a delay after he filed his extension up to the point when things would have been due anyway?",
  "Well, but how is that a -- how is the time being spent for preparation a delay, when some of that time was going to be allowed anyway?",
  "In other words, the motions were not due until September 25th. So I don't see how the time he spent before then can be regarded as a delay.",
  "What is the -- what is the proceeding from which you count in determining what should be excluded?",
  "Okay, that order - - that proceeding was initiated and ruled on the same day. The person comes in and says: I would like time. The judge that same day says yes.",
  "That proceeding takes a day.",
  "The additional time flowing from the order is a proceeding?",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "And that's one day.",
  "Ah. Now that -- now -- now I don't see how that's consistent with the other provisions of the act. If you take (h)(1)(A), that excludes delay resulting from any proceeding to determine mental competency. Okay?",
  "And under your theory that would include the time from the filing of that motion to the end of the determination of mental competency, right?",
  "Ah. Well -- yes. Well, or -- yes ---no, I'm looking at (h)(4). Now (h)(4) excludes any period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is -- is mentally incompetent.",
  "It seems to me redundant if you exclude the delay from the examination and then also exclude mental incompetence.",
  "All right. Well, let's look at (h)(1)(G). That excludes delay resulting from consideration by the court of a proposed plea agreement. But then (h)(2) says any period of delay in which prosecution is deferred pursuant to a written - - written agreement with the defendant, for the purpose of allowing the defendant to demonstrate his good conduct, which sounds an awful lot like a plea agreement to me.",
  "If I disagree with you that, when the time that is extended before a hearing on the pretrial motions and the acceptance of a waiver, which runs from 13 days, September 20, the original date, and the date that it actually took place, which is 13 days, and if I think, contrary to your submission, which is that the whole time from the filing of the extension to the final hearing is delay, even though it was only 13 days that was pushed back, then you lose, right?",
  "Putting aside what Petitioners may or may not have argued, if I think that the delay is only how far the date for consideration of a motion and acting on the motion has been moved -- in this case, from September 20 to October 4; in other words, it's 13 days, not 28 days -- then you lose, right?",
  "Well, I guess it would be, take 15 days from what time you have calculated, and that's -- that's under the wire -- or is it above the wire?",
  "In other words, I am contesting 15 of your days, and you figured out how much days you think can be excluded or not excluded.",
  "Counsel, this may be the same question I was asking earlier, but I want to make sure I've got your answer. Let's say the original date for filing motions is, as it was here, September 13th, right? On September 7th, Mr. Bloate asks for additional time. So the judge's, you know, runs a tight ship, and he says, I will give you one day. One more day, so now it's due on September 14th. You would say the delay resulting from that extension was seven days, from September 7th, when he filed it, to September 14th, and not one day.",
  "So the delay -- so saying I'm not going to file any pretrial motions results in a delay from a pretrial motion?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stancil, five minutes.",
  "Counsel, is your friend correct that the issue of the proper calculation is not before us? So that the time I spent figuring that out should be excluded from something?",
  "I would have thought that whether or not you think that type of delay is excludable depends on what that type of delay is, which requires some sense of how it's going to be calculated.",
  "Thank you, counsel, this case is submitted.

  "What would you -- if you could do it in one sentence, what is your test for determining which categories of speech are unprotected by the First Amendment?",
  "Well, but to say that they are not concerned with the content, I -- I think is contradicted by the exceptions. You have to look at the content and make a decision, is this bona fide scientific, journalistic, educational, historical? So you have to look at the content to determine whether or not the speech is prohibited.",
  "How can you tell these aren't political videos? You do have, with organizations, PETA and others, depictions of the same sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support for efforts to prohibit it. Why aren't these videos the exact opposite, you know, efforts to legalize it, and, in each case, it would fall under the political exemption?",
  "Counsel, would this -- would a statute like this apply to humans be constitutional? You can't depict videos of, say, violent muggings or things of that sort?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett.",
  "Counsel, I think -- I think Ferber analytically is the hard case for you, because the Court in Ferber did said -- and I am quoting from page 763: \"The evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interest at stake.\" That was their articulation of the test. Now, why shouldn't we apply that test to this statute?",
  "Well, I mean, but this definition or these exceptions are not drawn out of thin air. They are drawn from Miller, and the Court in Miller recognized that they were significant in causing the restriction of obscenity to pass constitutional muster.",
  "I understood your answers to Justice Alito to acknowledge that there would be situations where this statute could be constitutionally applied, or as you put it, you could draft a statute.",
  "Not this statute. But - -",
  "But if in fact there were situations where we thought a narrowly drafted statute could be applied to particular instances, perhaps the crush videos, perhaps others, why isn't that enough to say that this statute is valid on its face and then we will consider as-applied challenges?",
  "I guess I am just trying to get at what your understanding of what the test is for overbreadth in this area. How much of an area of constitutional application is necessary before you decide that a statute is not unconstitutional on its face, but will consider as-applied challenges?",
  "I'm sorry; you agree you can prohibit it, or not?",
  "So I'm sorry. I'm still looking for your answer to Justice Alito's hypotheticals. Can Congress ban the human sacrifice channel or not?",
  "You are unwilling - - you are unwilling to say that Congress can pass a law, even-handed, straightforward, you cannot have a human sacrifice channel.",
  "So we don't like - - we don't like human sacrifice, and so Congress passes a law saying you cannot have a channel that shows human sacrifice -- real human sacrifice. You think that is unconstitutional?",
  "Well, right, but, I mean, the hypothetical is we can't do anything about it. It is beyond our reach to stop the human sacrifice taking place wherever in the world, so that that argument -- the Ferber argument is off the table. In that situation, you think it's unconstitutional for Congress to pass a law saying there can be no human sacrifice channel.",
  "No. Go ahead.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Katyal, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Did I just understand you to agree with your colleague on the other side, that Congress could not ban the human sacrifice channel because there would be no connection between drying up the underlying activity?",
  "No. I'm saying there is no connection. We can't reach the activity where it is taking place.",
  "So if Congress is - - and we will give you sufficient rebuttal time. So, if Congress is saying, Look, we just don't like what -- is being shown on the human sacrifice channel, we don't want people to see it, they can't do that?",
  "Thank you, counsel, both counsel, for very able presentation. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-103, Elsevier v. Muchnick. Mr. Sims.",
  "This is a lot harder case than Arbaugh, though. Arbaugh involved the definition of an employer and then the scope of the statute. This one says no suit shall be instituted.",
  "I think you are right that Arbaugh at least set forth a clear statement rule, but I think that's significant only going forward. I don't know that Congress, when it passed this provision, could have been aware of the clear statement rule that Arbaugh articulated.",
  "Well, if you are talking about the language, what about John R. Sand & Gravel? That said we held it was jurisdictional when the statute said: \"Suits shall be barred.\" The language here is \"No suit shall be instituted.\" That sounds pretty close.",
  "No, that was -- that was a statute of limitations provision, right? It shall be barred after six years?",
  "We have forms for copyright infringement actions?",
  "Live and learn.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders.",
  "Is your discussion of that, including in your response to Justice Ginsburg and in your brief, do you think that that's within the question presented, rephrased?",
  "Do you have an example of the non-ordinary case? I mean, you seem to say, either -- I guess it's not always after judgment that it shouldn't be implemented, I guess. But when wouldn't it be after judgment?",
  "So it's more -- so it's more or less jurisdictional after judgment?",
  "There really are, in our recent decisions, it seems to me, two different lines of authority. There is the Bowles and the John R. Sand and Gravel, which treats these sorts of things as jurisdictional, and the Arbaugh line that doesn't. And it does seem to me that the language here, \"No suit shall be instituted,\" sounds an awful lot like \"suit shall be barred,\" or the other language in -- in Bowles.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Anders. Ms. Merritt?",
  "I would have thought that cut against you in the sense that the same paragraph Congress used the word \"jurisdiction,\" but they didn't use that in the provision that you are arguing, does deprive the court of jurisdiction.",
  "It's not -- it's not a very big deal to register your copyright, right?",
  "And -- but -- but doesn't that mean that it would be odd to make jurisdiction over an action for infringement hinge on whether you've, you know, dotted an \"I\" and crossed a \"T\"?",
  "Finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Sims, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Merritt, you were appointed by this Court as an amicus to defend the judgment below, and you have ably discharged that responsibility. On behalf of the Court, thank you for doing so. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first today in Case 08-472, Salazar v. Buono. General Kagan.",
  "I would suppose -- I guess I don't agree with your dichotomy, either it's the same action or it's entirely separate. I would suppose it could be some issues carry over and are the same, and perhaps standing is one of those. Other issues are completely new, such as the effect of the legislation, which couldn't have been before the district court since it hadn't been passed. But standing is different. I mean, once it's been determined that there is standing and that is reflected in a final judgment, then I think the later aspects are simply whether the person -- once it's embodied in a judgment, I think that is the basis for standing and not the earlier questions of whether he visited it enough or planned to visit enough.",
  "Before we get - - before your time expires, we would like to spend a couple of minutes on the merits.",
  "And I wonder if you could focus on a particular question. What if the government sold simply one square foot, or whatever the area that the base of the cross is -- is resting on the ground? Would your argument be the same?",
  "Well, why isn't that -- why isn't that the case here?",
  "Well, isn't that an interference or it's singling out someone, private property owner, who's using his property in a particular way, a religious way? You are going to be putting up signs only for people putting up religious symbols.",
  "But it hasn't done anything like that. It doesn't say for other property owners that have maybe something that -- you know, a ramshackle shack, that they want people to know this isn't the government's property. They don't do anything like that. It's -- under your hypothetical, it would be only religious property that would have these special warning signs.",
  "How is the question of -- I don't want to get into your rebuttal time, but briefly, how is the question of whether signs are or aren't valid or required before us in this case? There are no signs there, and you are asking us to consider whether the statute is valid or not.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Eliasberg.",
  "So that under your approach that this is looking to see if the injunction is being enforced or violated, we would be reviewing an act of Congress under an abuse of discretion standard, not -- not de novo?",
  "Have we ever done that before?",
  "Have we ever said that an act of Congress is unconstitutional without a de novo review of the merits of the constitutionality?",
  "So when you get to the consistent with the injunction part -- I thought it was your position that we should review this question solely under an abuse of discretion standard?",
  "Because while the Court did not decide the validity of the act in the first case, it certainly did in the second case, which is why we have the case before us.",
  "Counsel, if -- if - - if the government sold this land to a private party, no cross in the picture at all, and they go to settlement and at settlement the private landowner who is going to buy it says, you know, I'm going to put a big cross up on this property once I get it, can the government still sell it to him?",
  "Okay.",
  "So even though before the sale, even though the government knows there is going to be a big cross on the land with the same situation you have here in the middle of the preserve and all, that's perfectly okay?",
  "I thought you said before the government sold the land if they find out the new owner is going to put a cross on it there is no problem.",
  "Do you disagree with what she told us, which is that the private property owner can tear down the cross at any time?",
  "You say under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. Does that -- do you just mean they have authority to regulate the land?",
  "Well, I suppose they have jurisdiction to regulate a lot of -- lot of land that they don't own.",
  "What else -- what else does the plaque say.",
  "And that's it? Nothing else?",
  "Can I get back to your plaque question? Am I wrong? I think the government told us the plaque reads: \"The cross erected in memory the dead of all wars, erected 1934 by members of Veterans of Foreign Wars, Death Valley Post 2884.\"",
  "That's a big difference. I mean, the whole point is that the plaque tells you, this is not a government memorial, government structure. It was put up by members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Death Valley Post 2884.",
  "The context of my question was what does the plaque say?",
  "All right.",
  "Counsel, this probably doesn't have anything to do with anything, but I'm just kind of curious, why is this cross put up - - you know, in the middle of nowhere?",
  "Thank you. General, you have 2 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-604, Union Pacific Railroad v. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. Mr. Ballenger.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Geoghegan.",
  "\"GAE-gunn.\"",
  "But we have rules like that -- we have rules like that all the time. No matter how clear it is what happened below, if it wasn't included in the question presented, we say you can't raise it. This is just a rule like that. They have a rule saying this is what you have to do, you have got to put the evidence of conferencing in -- in the record at a particular time. You didn't do it, so we are not going to -- the fact that on the facts, on the real facts, it occurred is not an adequate challenge to the procedural rule.",
  "You think there is now? In other words, this is -- rulemaking by adjudication is not unheard of.",
  "So is it -- is - - where is the rule that there has to be conferencing?",
  "So you think -- you think that was where the board erred, in requiring conferencing?",
  "Well, it's -- can the board adopt procedures about how you go about proving conferencing? You say there is no rule because there wasn't a rule adopted in 1934. There is a rule that there has to be conferencing. Does that mean that at any point in time you can just pop up and say, oh, by the way, there was conferencing? Or can the board say, this is how you go about establishing it?",
  "So they can -- the board can never have a rule that says, you have to establish conferencing, you know, before the date of the first arbitral proceeding, or within 30 days? The fact that all that has to happen under the act is that there be conferencing, you are free to establish it at any way you want, at any time you want?",
  "Where -- where does it say the unions have to send in letters requesting a conference?",
  "So could the board -- could the board adopt a rule requiring that?",
  "Just to be clear -- I will take you off the hook.",
  "Just to be clear, you say it's established practice that the railroads normally file their objection at a -- you know, at a particular point, and you think the board is without power to say: Look. This is the established practice. You, railroad, did not follow it, and so we're not going to consider your objections.",
  "No. No. You mean that they -- the board can't do that?",
  "I thought, under the Steelworkers trilogy, the arbitrators has broad deference to adopt these sorts of modes of procedure.",
  "That we would review only for whatever it is.",
  "So the review -- the review of government arbitrators arbitrating provisions pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the standard of review of that is different than private arbitrators under the Steelworkers trilogy?",
  "But you don't think that this is that. I mean, if you say: Look. Here's the rule. You have got to file these things by this date, that is not imposing your own rule of industrial justice.",
  "I'm saying that, if the board adopts a procedure exactly like that, you may challenge it as-- as violating due process because you didn't have notice, any number of things, but you can't say that the board is imposing its own brand of industrial justice. That sort of seems, to me, goes to the merits in the standards of arbitration, rather than procedures like this, unless it's a procedure like was hypothesized earlier, that only applies to one side and not the other.",
  "Presumably, there is none that says they don't have to be. In other words, I take it that this is an issue that is simply not addressed by the CFR rules?",
  "Well, you are just disputing the validity or applicability of the rule. You don't want to comply with the rule. I mean, is it any different than saying: Look, okay, we've got this arbitration that is going to go forward. We are going to meet at 10:00 Monday morning. It is the first meeting. One side doesn't show up and then they say, well, there's no rule that says we have to be there at 10:00 Monday morning; that's just the arbitrator saying that to -- to move the procedure along, so you can't penalize us in any way for not showing up at 10:00 Monday morning.",
  "Do you recall the situation -- do you recall the situation Justice Breyer described, and we can debate about it, whether it's rulemaking by adjudication, which does take place, you would say that in the situation you described, it violated due process, right?",
  "So you think you could submit that offer of proof at any time during the proceeding and the board would have to accept it?",
  "Why wouldn't the other side say we don't have to raise the objection at a particular time. You can't make a rule telling us we have to do that.",
  "So your answer to my earlier question is that you can submit that offer of proof at any time, and it has to be considered?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Geoghegan. Mr. Ballenger, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "You may answer the question, counsel.",

  "Only plead guilty? Not, for example, whether it would be material to the defendant in deciding whether or not to take the stand?",
  "Counsel, I suppose -- before a guilty plea is accepted, the district court judge is obligated to go through a colloquy to make sure the defendant knows the consequences of accepting the plea. I would suppose if you prevail that that colloquy would have to be expanded to include something like: Do you understand the deportation consequences, if any, of pleading guilty?",
  "No, but that's -- I don't see why that doesn't apply to the more fundamental question about whether the district court has to inquire into the plea circumstances in any event. I thought -- your answer to Justice Scalia that, oh, well, all sorts of things can come up at trial and the district judge doesn't have to inquire into those, I think proves too much. It goes to -- and it departs from your focus on the guilty plea. That's all the judge is inquiring about. And I don't know why that obligation doesn't extend to a fundamental piece of information that would -- that would, under your theory, make acceptance of the plea involuntary.",
  "Well, but what you’re saying is he has got to tell him all the stuff that’s necessary to make the decision to accept the plea knowing and intelligent, voluntary. And I thought that was pretty much what the district court was doing when they have the colloquy. That district judge wants to make sure the defendant knows what he is agreeing to.",
  "Oh, and also drug paraphernalia in the cab. And I -- was there some marijuana in the cab, too?",
  "So you -- but your point is an important one. We don't have the defense case.",
  "But you don't have the prosecution case either. You don't know exactly what witnesses they are going to call, what the strength of it is. So you don't know whether there is going to be prejudice or not. When you see -- it seems to me you have to make quite a prediction about what the case is going to look like to decide if there’s prejudice, to decide if the fellow is going to take the plea or not. And I'm just wondering how you do that.",
  "It's -- it's going to require, I guess, kind of a mini-trial to decide if the person would have taken the plea. You've got to know what the case -- his case looked like, what the prosecutor's case looked like, to see if it's something he would have made -- it would have made sense for him to go to trial or not.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, we learn in the first year of law school that the line between an affirmative act and failure to act is a difficult one to draw. What if the lawyer says, you're going to face 5 years, and the defendant says, is that all that's going to happen to me? And the lawyer says yes. Is that a failure to advise or is that an affirmative misrepresentation?",
  "I think when we -- when we decide there's no right to counsel, like on collateral review, we don't even look at what happened, right? We don't look and see whether the advice was ineffective, how bad the lawyer was. The idea is if you don't have the right at all, you don't have the right to an effective lawyer.",
  "Is that right? Okay. Well, these -- when you are talking about collateral consequences, you don't have a right to counsel on -- with respect to those collateral consequences. I assume there's -- maybe there is -- is there a right to counsel when you are facing a deportation proceeding?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, then, if there is no right to counsel, why do we get into whether there is an affirmative misrepresentation or not?",
  "Just like in a collateral -- habeas context, we don't care whether there’s an affirmative misreputation –- misrepresentation, because there’s no right to counsel in the first place.",
  "Not the defendant, but a defendant? In other words, I assume it's an objective inquiry you would make rather than a subjective one?",
  "We assume, for example, that someone who is going to lose the custody of their children would regard that as important. You don't want testimony about this guy doesn't care about the children, so it's not a big deal to him.",
  "Won't -- won't your test result in a net loss to defendants? I assume, if this is adopted as a rule, the affirmative misrepresentation rule, then every lawyer is going to say what you said they should say: I'm here for the criminal case; I'm not telling you anything about anything else --",
  "-- as opposed to saying -- sitting down and saying: Here's what you need to know. And in most cases we expect the lawyer to do a professional job. If you have got an alien, he is going to tell him: Well, what -- you know, this will cause you to be deported. Instead, every lawyer now is going to say: I'm not giving you any advice about anything else.",
  "How do we know that?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Long.",
  "I thought you told Justice Breyer that any good lawyer would give this advice to a client?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kinnaird, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "What -- what is your answer to the situation that I think has been hypothesized, of the lawyer -- the defendant asks him, what are the deportation consequences? And the lawyer says: I don't know. I'm not a deportation lawyer. I'm a criminal lawyer, but my best guess is that you are all right. What happens there?",
  "So you can make a claim when the lawyer disavows knowledge on the question? In other words, he is trying to be helpful, but he also warns the defendant.",
  "\"To investigate\"? So even if he doesn't know deportation and the client asks him, he has to investigate that?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-724, Smith v. Spisak. General Cordray.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Benza.",
  "You say -- you fault him for not talking about performance in prison, prospective performance in prison?",
  "It doesn't look like that's going to be a very strong argument. I mean, he is still talking about people he wants to kill, and you are going to get up there and say he might perform well in prison?",
  "He is on the stand with a Hitler moustache testifying about what a great job he did killing these people, and he says he is going to do it again. I think -- didn't the letter identify particular people he wanted to kill?",
  "And the jury is supposed to believe that this guy is going to do well in prison?",
  "But I guess it gets back to the -- the point, we are talking about what a jury would think and isn't it possible. You are suggesting, I think, he -- he should grasp any straws that are there, this might help. But isn't it possible that that would have a negative effect on the jury? In other words, they see this lawyer telling them this guy is going to do well in prison and the lawyer's credibility is -- is shot.",
  "But, I mean, it seems to me that you are imposing a strategic rule, and the counsel obviously made a decision -- or the record may reflect that the type of advocacy that you are telling us he has to have. Here's why you should give this guy sympathy. Here's why. Here's -- he's a good guy. I mean, there is -- even standing at that podium, there is a different strategy that people sometimes employ, which is sort of the understated -- you know, well, he did some terrible things, don't -- I'm not asking for sympathy for these things, but -- you know, we are very proud of the fact that we don't execute -- you know, it seems to me that this disagreement is over different styles of advocacy. And I don't know how to -- particularly in a case where you don't have much to work with, I don't know how to make a judgment that his choice was worse than the other.",
  "So if you're -- if you're right about that issue on which we haven't had a decision yet, then we would look at prejudice on our own, without deference to the State court findings?",
  "Counsel, the Mills opinion has one of those concluding paragraphs at the end that sort of sums everything up, and it says that we conclude there is a substantial probability that reasonable jurors upon receiving the judge's instructions in this case and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance.",
  "Now how is that clearly established law that your claim is -- is contrary to Mills?",
  "That is on death or nondeath, not on whether a particular mitigating circumstance exists.",
  "Where does that say what your summary was earlier, that they -­",
  "-- can't consider a mitigating circumstance unless they unanimously agree about it.",
  "Well, doesn't every court tell them it's their duty to decide disputed questions of fact?",
  "And you think that includes within it the idea that they -- they cannot consider a mitigating circumstance unless they all 12 agree on it?",
  "Okay, I just -­",
  "I want to make sure I have got your Mills argument.",
  "It is that the sentence that says \"it's your duty to did decide all disputed questions of fact is the same as saying they are instructed that they cannot consider a mitigating circumstance unless they are unanimous?",
  "Okay. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cordray, you have ten minutes remaining.",
  "Is that an argument you made before this Court?",
  "Is this an argument that you've made before this Court in your brief, that we shouldn't consider whether Mills is the controlling standard because Mills came after?",
  "Okay.",
  "What -- what is your answer to your friend's explanation that it's hard to defer when they don't even say anything?",
  "Thank you, General Cordray; Mr. Benza. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 138 in our original docket, South Carolina v. North Carolina. Mr. Frederick.",
  "I thought your friends agreed that the New Jersey v. New York standard applied?",
  "I understand your basic argument that each State should represent its own constituents. But isn't the Catawba River Water Supply Project in a different category? Because it straddles both States, and I think it can reasonably fear that it would be treated as a stepchild by both States.",
  "I -- I guess I haven't heard yet an answer to Justice Ginsburg's first question about whether there was a recommendation from the Special Master or not.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Miller.",
  "And why isn't Duke Power -- why isn't Duke Power on the other side, then?",
  "They have smart lawyers.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bartolomucci.",
  "This is our original jurisdiction. I regard the Special Master as more akin to a law clerk than a district judge. We don't defer to somebody who's an aide that we have assigned to help us gather things here. I think on legal questions of intervention we have to decide de novo.",
  "Counsel, let me tell you what I'm very worried about. This is our original jurisdiction, a delicate jurisdiction that allows us to resolve disputes between sovereign States. And I look out and I see all sorts of private parties intervening in a way that would give them party status. And I think that's compromising what our original jurisdiction is supposed to be about.",
  "You're -- all of the intervenors, prospective intervenors, they want to make sure North Carolina doesn't lose water, right?",
  "Well, their -- well, they want to reduce South Carolina's claim on the water.",
  "Well -- to the extent they have differing interests, why aren't those interests fully satisfied by amicus participation?",
  "Shape the record, but intervention status would give you the right to appeal, right?",
  "Right, and appeal the normal case.",
  "Well, that's my question. If we grant intervention in this type of case and there is no reason it would be three -- I mean, in the next case, it could be 20 different intervenors, and they are filing exceptions every other week that we have to review and adjudicate because they are not bound by whether or not the State that is on their side wants to file exceptions.",
  "And North Carolina, as a sovereign State, can represent the interests of its constituents as it sees fit. You and your fellow prospective intervenors just have to do what citizens do all the time, which is convince North Carolina, one, and you can help them, to get as much water as they can; and, two, when they get it or if they lose it, whatever they are left it, to give it to you, rather than the other parties.",
  "Well, then that’s –- then I just wonder why you are here in an original action. What you are saying is they have all sorts of different interests, and it just -- they get to skip district court. They get to skip the court of appeals. They can just come right in here, as if they were a State, and participate in the case.",
  "You don’t --",
  "Well, what's special about it? I mean, let's say I own a little farm on the banks of the Catawba, and I take water out to -- so the cows have something to drink, why does Charlotte get a special status just because they take a lot? I'm affected by how much water runs through there.",
  "Well, and that relief will affect how much water is available for me to draw out and use on my farm. That's a compelling interest. I -- you know, in times of drought, this water barely trickles by, and, if it's cut back, the farm is going to go down. It seems to me that, when you say they have a special interest, you are just saying they have got a big interest.",
  "Well, let's say the interest -- the dispute is really in effect between company ABC in North Carolina and company XYZ in South Carolina. I mean, do we -- we would not accept an original action if they sued each other, right?",
  "Do we let them just use the States as, you know, a façade to get into this Court and have their dispute adjudicated here?",
  "Wouldn’t it – would it be surprising if the Special Master recommended that all the issue that she was going to address was the relative equitable apportionment between North Carolina and South Carolina, and even though South Carolina wanted an injunction directed against the City of Charlotte, that's up to North Carolina? North Carolina can divvy up its water however it wants.",
  "Thank you, Counsel.",
  "Mr. Browning.",
  "Maryland v. Louisiana involved a specific tax on specific companies, and they were allowed to intervene. This is not that. This is a question of how the equitable apportionment of the water is going to be, and North Carolina can do with the water whatever it will. It strikes me as very different than Maryland v. Louisiana.",
  "As -- as the allocation would in this case, presumably.",
  "Counsel, my basic concern is that -- and I will let you finish if there is more to the answer. I'm sorry. Private parties are going to hijack our original jurisdiction, and it was highlighted for me when I read your motion, the motion of private parties for divided argument. Your proposal was that they be divided 10, 10, and 10. You didn't even want to be here. As they view the case and as you view the case, it's got so little to do with the State that the State didn't even want to come here and argue the case.",
  "You thought their participation here before this Court on a question in original jurisdiction was more important than yours, and you represent the State.",
  "Why can't you represent them?",
  "They are your constituents. You are the State. You are coming here directly, not even going to district court, and you seem to be ceding your sovereignty over to them.",
  "What is -- what's the interest of North Carolina?",
  "You are standing there telling me why Duke has an interest. What’s North Carolina's interest?",
  "So oppose their intervention.",
  "Well, if it's an attack on -- if it's an attack on Charlotte, I would expect the State to be standing there protecting it and not feel that they can't do that without Charlotte, itself, coming into the case.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick, you have 2 minutes.",

  "So there’s no controlling authority.",
  "And then I suppose the district court doesn't know whether to award damages or not until it gets a final decision from -- or a decision from the Seventh Circuit or this Court.",
  "But surely your position is going to be that the statutory procedure pre-empts and takes the place of any Slocum hearing, isn't it? I mean, somebody comes in and files a petition saying, here I'm raising this right under, you know, an early 19th century procedure, and you're not going to say, okay, here's our position or here's the property. You are going to say, wait until the forfeiture proceeding that is provided under Illinois law.",
  "Slocum then is the answer to a very different case. It's a case where you have a class action of people whose cases fell through the cracks and never got the procedures they were entitled to. It doesn't seem at all responsive to the claim that they are entitled to procedures before it falls through the cracks.",
  "We will afford you additional time because the Court's questions have intruded upon your rebuttal time.",
  "Mr. Jay.",
  "Well, I would think you’d begin with the mootness question.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Peters.",
  "Well, but then if it's -- if it's money that is being conditionally released, there’s no security for the government. If it turns out later on it shouldn't have been released, it's probably gone.",
  "What if -- what if at your innocent owner or the hearing that you are seeking, you establish, well, I was going to sell my baseball card to give me the money to -- to survive, to get food? That was my -- I mean, what happens then?",
  "So just to get back to the cars, I thought your answer to Justice Alito was a little abstract. In the absolute concrete case, where the drug -- the suspect is driving the car, there are drugs in the car.",
  "At your hearing, the -- it's not registered to him. The registered owner comes in and says, that's my car, I had no idea it was being used for drugs. Who wins, the State or the registered owner?",
  "Well, aren't they always going to say that? They are going to say, well, we don't know if the registered owner is involved in the drug conspiracy. We don't know how closely he is tied with the owner, so it's reasonable to assume he knew what was going on, and besides, we’ve got a lot of other bigger fish to fry during this period. We are trying to find out the scope of the conspiracy. We are trying to find out where the sales were going to take place. Why do you force us to -- to focus our energies on the relationship between a registered owner and the guy driving the car?",
  "So it’s as -- so it's as applied in every case, which I think ties in a little bit to the mootness question that we began with. Because it focuses on the circumstances of the individual claimants, and if the individual claimants have already had their property returned, I think it accentuates the mootness issue.",
  "Well, that's an interesting -- that's an interesting question. I mean, is it becoming moot through their voluntary cessation or activity when the State law requires them to take particular action?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Castiglione, why don't you take 3 minutes?",
  "I thought your answer is that they didn't all settle.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-970, Perdue v. Kenny A. Counsel.",
  "Counsel, this -- this brilliant second-year associate we are talking about, the way these submissions to the Court are -- the way they're presented, do they carve out her contribution to a particular filing? To the extent I have looked at them they have something like, you know, draft motion to dismiss, and the associate has 40 hours and the junior partner has 10 hours and the senior partner has 5 hours dedicated to that. I mean, if the associate is doing -- in the hypothetical, is doing work at the partner level, how do you know that the brilliance isn't contributed by the 4 hours of the partner rather than the 40 hours of the associate?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Shah.",
  "But it's one of the long-standing traditions of the bar that lawyers are expected to do that in the normal course. So why would that be a special circumstance?",
  "Well, how do you tell -- how do you tell whether a client is popular or unpopular? I mean, a lot of unpopular clients in the abstract sense are in fact -- they have a lot of support in the community. I suppose one of the more unpopular clients these days is a Wall Street banker.",
  "But I mean, you wouldn't say -- you wouldn't suggest that law firms charge more when they represent them?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Clement.",
  "I will let you answer your second point, but just on that, I don't understand the concept of extraordinary success or results obtained. The results that are obtained are presumably the results that are dictated or command or required under the law. And it's not like, well, you had a really good attorney, so I'm going to say the law means this, which gives you a lot more, but if you had a bad attorney I would say the law has this and so he doesn't get a multiplier. The results obtained under our theory should be what the law requires, and not different results because you have different lawyers.",
  "Well, but what does a judge say when he said, you have achieved extraordinary results? That if you weren't there, I would have made a mistake on the law?",
  "Well, I guess that's saying the same thing I said, which if it weren't for how good you are, I would have made a mistake.",
  "Maybe we have a different perspective. You think the lawyers are responsible for a good result, and I think the judges are.",
  "Counsel, this lawyer -- I'm sorry, this judge said they were extraordinarily good, but, I mean, where's the cutoff? If the judge said, this is in the top 10 lawyers I’ve ever seen, or the top 20, where do you get an enhancement and where do you not?",
  "Yes, that's the thing. It's hard to tell.",
  "Well, for 28 years -- the judge was on the bench 28 years, right? Well, if you are in the top 28, is that a rare case or not? It's once a year.",
  "I know, but we are trying --",
  "We are trying to establish a principle, and other judges are going to have to follow this. And do they think, well, this was really good, but it wasn't as good as that law firm or lawyers we had 3 years ago; they were really good.",
  "And I assume -- how long -- how does a judge, who is on the bench in his or her first year, do this? Well, this is the best lawyer I've had in the eight months I have been here.",
  "But how does he or she know that that -- that may be as good as it gets, for the next 28 years?",
  "There is a flip side to the unpopular case situation the S.G. talked about, which is lawyers and law firms sometimes take on a particular high-profile case to increase their profile, and they would have done it for a lot less. We have lawyers who argue here, who are doing it for free, because it's a big deal to be recognized as doing something in the Supreme Court. So when you use prevailing rates with respect to that type of work, you are overcompensating them.",
  "Well, it's also not the term Congress used.",
  "I want to resort to what Congress said, which was --",
  "Oh, I think it does. I think rates are set with -- based on a law firm's record of -- I mean, just because you bill a client doesn't mean that they are going to pay or that they are going to pay at what you billed them. And I think the rates are set to take into account that over the past year whatever you have a realization rate of -- whatever, 80 percent or 85 percent.",
  "Well, but there -- general counsel do that all the time when they get a bill from a law firm. They cut it down. They say you spent -- you’ve spent too much time with this associate only because he or she is a first-year associate and is learning and training; I'm not going to pay for that.",
  "So it's the same-- it's the same thing that happens when a district court looks at the -- the lodestar and cuts it down.",
  "Thank you Mr. Clement. Mr. Cohen, you have 4 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-1008, Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Insurance. Mr. Nelson.",
  "Under -- under your theory, are all of the statutes set forth by the Respondents in their appendices invalid in Federal court?",
  "Well, not half.",
  "Well, it has to apply to individual actions as well?",
  "What if the basis for the restriction is the additional administrative costs of a class action? In other words, it doesn't say you can't bring it, but it says any recovery shall be reduced by 10 percent because class actions cost more than individual actions?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Landau.",
  "Counsel, do I –- do I understand your response to turn on -- let's say the State, for example, limits class actions because it doesn't want vast exposure under the penalty provisions that you could get in a class action. It only wants to pay when they can be brought on an individual basis. But they may also limit class actions by saying, as Justice Sotomayor suggested, that they are not fair and efficient. Do you get one result in the former case and a different result in the latter?",
  "How do you -- how do you tell?",
  "I suppose it's pertinent, then, whether they do it, as I think you were -- was discussed earlier, on an across-the-board basis or on an individual basis?",
  "But I guess --",
  "But -- but wouldn't Justice Stevens's hypothetical suggest that they were less concerned about the impact of -- of the class action procedure than they were about its procedural efficiency? In other words, I understand your position if you're saying, look, we've only got $20 million in this fund to pay plaintiffs and we think it's better to go on an individual basis, because if it's a class action, you know, it would be over in one shot or whatever --",
  "-- but it's not appropriate to say, we don't like the class action procedure as a general matter.",
  "And in Justice Stevens's hypothetical, it applied across the board, which would cause me, anyway, to think it was the latter.",
  "Well, it -- it only reflects a substantive choice -- if it is a substantive choice. If they say, we are not going to allow class actions because we think, procedurally, they are a bad idea because we think lawyers get too much recovery when they recover -- in other words, it -- your -- your position depends upon a characterization of the ban, and the restriction on class actions is either substantive or procedural.",
  "But the question is New Mexico causes of action. Can they decide that they don't want actions from outside of the State to be brought as class actions?",
  "What it would do, it seems to me, is make it clear that was not a substantive decision, but, instead, a procedural decision.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Landau.",
  "Mr. Nelson, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "You can finish your thought, if you like.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-586, Jones v. Harris Associates. Mr. Frederick.",
  "Well, but this is different. I mean, this is part of an expense of a fund. They don't get fees, but -- but they get -- they have to pay for the lawyers, just like they have to pay for management advice. So why wouldn't you review the lawyers' fees to make sure they are fair?",
  "Counsel for the fund.",
  "What if -- if you are having courts decide -- review what is fair, a fair fee, what if the adviser had given such good advice that the fund beat the industry average for his category of fund by 5 percent over the last 5 years. Does he get double the normal compensation of the average fees? Does he get triple? 50 percent more? How is the court supposed to decide that?",
  "Well, surely you think it is. When you say they don't give the money back, you are not suggesting that the amount of the fees should be the same regardless of whether they outperform by 10 percent or not?",
  "Well, but there is different parameters, right, in the sense that you're trying -- the company is trying to attract investors to the mutual fund. If you are advising a pension fund, it is not the case that they are trying to attract pensioners who have other choices.",
  "Do technological changes make a difference in terms of disclosures required? These days all you have to do is push a button and you find out exactly what the management fees are. I mean, you just look it up on Morningstar and it's right there and you can make -- as an investor you can make whatever determination you'd like, including to take your money out.",
  "So we could look at -- you know, as the fund grows bigger and he doesn't get those benefits he can go look at another fund. It takes 30 seconds.",
  "Companies - - companies change who they invest with under the 401(k)'s all the time. The employees are not happy with the return they are getting because the company has limited their choices, they change. It happens all the time.",
  "You told me just a little while ago, or told somebody, Congress wasn't interested in protecting investors; they were interested in protecting the companies.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon.",
  "Counsel, if we are going to have regulation of what fees can be charged, you cite in your brief the various regulations the SEC has issued. It makes a lot more sense to have the SEC regulate rates than to have courts do it, doesn't it?",
  "You are not suggesting the SEC wouldn't have authority to do that, are you?",
  "Counsel, the statute does not say, in considering the rates you look at all the circumstances. Am I right? It says, in considering whether to defer to the board, you look at all the circumstances.",
  "The board.",
  "Right. But isn't that different than saying, in looking at what the rates should be or whether they are excessive, you look at all the circumstances? It may well be that you don't defer to the board, but that doesn't mean it's a free-for-all in deciding what you do look at.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Donovan.",
  "Well, what is \"so far out of bounds\"? In other words, you are saying, you can look at what the directors did if it's, as you said, too far out of bounds, but 10 percent off, 50 percent off?",
  "Double, as they say is the case here?",
  "Double, as they say is the case here?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, then you say: Look to see if it's outside the bounds, and now you tell me there is no way to look to see if it's outside the bounds.",
  "When you say you should look at the range and how far it's off, do you mean that in the Gartenberg sense -- in other words, if it is way out of line, then you assume or can at least look further at whether there was a fair process? Or do you mean it in the normal case, in sort of setting the rates you just look how far it is off.",
  "It's probably - - you're not the person to -- to ask, but do you understand the Solicitor General's position to be your understanding of the Gartenberg sense or something else?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Was your friend correct, that these funds have better than average performance and lower than average fees?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 08-992, Beard v. Kindler. Mr. Eisenberg.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lawry.",
  "Well, but that's because he escaped. He avoided judicial process, and you would have him be in the same position once he's captured and returned and captured and returned as he was before he escaped at all, right?",
  "And you think that -- and you don't think -- you think you can argue that a State rule saying, look, if you escape and flee the jurisdiction, you bar -- your claims cannot be adequate and independent?",
  "Counsel, following up on that, I'd like your answer to this question: Is a State procedural rule automatically inadequate and, therefore, unenforceable when the State rule is discretionary rather than mandatory? Automatically?",
  "So you agree - -",
  "So you agree with the Petitioner's response to that question? Their point -- their question presented is, is it automatically inadequate because there is discretion? They say no, you say no.",
  "Well, but that was the same -- that was the position you took in your opposition to certiorari.",
  "And yet we nonetheless granted -- granted cert.",
  "Well, if some of us -- or I suppose if several of us -- think that that may have been or was what the Third Circuit said, would you have any objection to us vacating the opinion, explaining since you both agree that the rule is not automatically inadequate, make sure they understand that, and then they can proceed however they see fit?",
  "Right. And that is -- your objection is that it wasn't fairly applied. Discretion was abused in this case, to borrow from the Federal law. They didn't treat them the same. They should have treated them the same. But the question is whether the rule is automatically inadequate if there is discretion. You are arguing about how it was applied, which I guess means that it's not automatically inadequate because if they apply it the way you think it should be then it would be adequate.",
  "Maybe I did, too.",
  "But the point is you are arguing about the application -- the exercise of discretion. You say the one guy, Lewis, got the benefit of the rule; your guy didn't get the benefit of the rule; and that's unfair, right?",
  "So you are not arguing -- which would be very odd to argue -- that the discretion always makes the rule invalid because you - -",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, the problem -- Justice Stevens' question brought this up. I mean, how do you address that question if you don't have very many applications of the rule?",
  "Say it's the first one that comes up.",
  "Well, but your reasoned explanation - -",
  "You don't doubt that it would be an independent and adequate State rule to say whenever anybody escapes they waive their claims?",
  "What is -- what is the Federal fugitive rule?",
  "Has discretion?",
  "Does the discretion that the Pennsylvania courts have here -- is that similar? Can the Pennsylvania Supreme Courts exercise that discretion in a calibrated way, not all or nothing?",
  "Well, he got the windfall of being free for eight years, right? I guess that gets back to the point of your friend, which is he is in no worse position because he escaped and spent eight years on the lam than if he had stayed in prison.",
  "No, no. Obviously if the State prevails he's in a worse position. But under your view, he's in this -- he's in no worse position. He hasn't waived all his objections and claims, procedures.",
  "Well, I'm sorry, if I could just nail down the point. As far as his rights and proceedings in this case, he is in no worse position under your theory having escaped and been out for eight years than if he had stayed put?",
  "Finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Eisenberg, you have four minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.

  "Well, that would be a remarkable coincidence if her equipment happened to be worth exactly what Congress said she could exempt, which is a very odd way of reading what she's put in the schedule.",
  "I would have thought the most natural way of reading it is that she's claiming the equipment because she thinks that's the value of the equipment.",
  "Well, thank you, Mr. Goldblatt. I'll afford you rebuttal time.",
  "Mr. Wall.",
  "So what does she put down if she thinks this is what the property is worth, but she doesn't know for sure? I mean, I don't know how you would accurately value a bunch of kitchen equipment. What is she supposed to do?",
  "But that goes through -- I think as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, you have to go through a long process if you're going to have an auction, and for this sole proprietorship, it seems like a waste of money and time.",
  "Well, that's right. I mean, this is a government form, and you say, even though it says \"Value of the claimed exemption\" and \"Current market value,\" that these debtors should know, oh, you should put in, as your friend said, put in an asterisk and write something else in there.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Wall. Mr. Brunstad.",
  "So if it turns out that this business equipment was worth $100,000 and the trustee looks at it and says, oh, she's only claiming -- you know, less than she's entitled, $10,000, and doesn't object, she gets that dramatic windfall.",
  "Oh, no, no. She -- she -- and it may be even in good faith or -- or bad faith, depending on the rule we -- we adopt, but she gets that incredible bonus because it turns out her business equipment is worth a lot more than she put down.",
  "Well, this -- the trustee doesn't know. He doesn't know. He looks at it and says, oh, that sounds like kitchen equipment might be worth that, and so he doesn't object. What you're doing is, I think Justice Kennedy pointed out, you're requiring the trustee to object to everything, lest he lose the $100,000 that it turns out this is worth.",
  "No, but the point is, that drags out the whole process. You're imposing a burden on the trustee. He loses everything if he doesn't object, and I think the idea is that these things move as quickly as you can, and you don't want the trustees -- you know, I may be severely prejudiced; the creditors might if I don't object, so I'm going to object to everything; we'll sort it out later.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Now, Mr. Goldblatt, 2 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 08-674, NRG Power Marketing v. Maine Public Utilities Commission. Mr. Lamken.",
  "It's a bit much to say that the importance is to preserve the stability of two parties' contract, and, therefore, a third party who didn't sign the contract is bound to the two parties' contract.",
  "Well, so why don't you -- why isn't it restricted to some type of direct, parties directly affected, as well as -- I mean, you complain about the hordes of people who will be able to challenge these. Well, it assumes that anybody can challenge it.",
  "I'm sorry? What do you mean, an exemption for noncontracting parties?",
  "You don't agree that FERC has the authority to exempt noncontracting parties from the binding effect of the contract rates, do you?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Miller.",
  "Your -- your opening statement about what this Court should do is a change from your statement of what we should do in your briefs. In your -- you just said the Court should remand for further considerations other issues. In your brief, you say the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed insofar as it granted the petitions for review. You've changed your position on what we should do.",
  "But that's a change. Before you didn't think there were other issues that affected the determination or might. You said we should grant -- reverse the determination insofar as it granted the petitions for review. If we say that the petitions for review should have been denied, then we don't send it back.",
  "And just to follow up, you think we should not address either of those --",
  "-- whether it's a contract or whether you have authority to make an exception to the Mobile-Sierra doctrine?",
  "You don't get to reserve time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Miller.",
  "General Blumenthal.",
  "You're in a very tough position because of the way this has progressed. I think you can make a strong argument that you shouldn't be bound by these contract rates if FERC doesn't have a lot of discretion to let you go. If FERC has a lot of discretion to let you go, your argument that you shouldn't be bound is a lot weaker. And the way the case has been presented, we're pushing on only one -- one side of that.",
  "Well, but if we ruled that --",
  "If we decided it on that basis, we would be giving FERC a victory on the question of its authority to depart from Mobile-Sierra, even though that wasn't presented in this case.",
  "Oh, I know --",
  "-- but Justice Breyer was hypothesizing that sometimes they can be, and sometimes they can't be. And you accepted his proposition. And what I'm saying is that's a very significant question. FERC wants to argue it here, but it's not before us.",
  "It's also a third question that's not presented, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lamken, you have 3 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this afternoon in Case 08-969, Hemi Group v. The City of New York. Mr. Barnhouse.",
  "Why -- why isn't the money property?",
  "Well, isn't a lawsuit with a potential recovery regarded as property of an individual?",
  "Does your answer to Justice Kennedy depend upon a notion that the causation standard as -- in RICO is different than general proximate cause standards in tort law?",
  "But you don't -- you don't think that proximate cause is satisfied only with respect to the person who is supposed to be paying the taxes? If there's some way in which someone else contributes or makes it feasible or makes it more likely that the person is not going to pay his taxes, that's not automatically outside the scope of proximate cause, is it?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Koerner.",
  "I'm sorry, because of -- because of what?",
  "But it was injured by the consumer's failure -- it was injured by the consumer's failure to pay the taxes. That is an intervening cause.",
  "Now, why shouldn't that be the end of the causation chain?",
  "You're suing him for setting up the ambiance?",
  "Does it -- does it affect your ambiance theory that the website has the language that your friend told us is on it, that you have to -- you know, this is -- viability varies from State to State or whatever the exact language is?",
  "That still creates the ambiance?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, but the definition and giving scope and meaning to the concept of proximate cause is one that's in our bailiwick.",
  "Well, but that's because in every one of those cases, or at least in many of them, we kind of wring our hands and say, well, we don't have any choice, this is what Congress did, and we're faithful to that intent. But I guess, as I tried to point out earlier, this is a different question. This is the usual judicial application of concepts of proximate cause, and I would have thought concern about how broad RICO was written and how broadly it has been interpreted would cause us to look very carefully to the proximate cause question.",
  "No -- I don't understand that. The injury is directly caused by the consumers who don't pay the taxes.",
  "So it's a mail order house and they put a little line on it, says: By the way, if you live out of State, no taxes, no sales taxes. Then they're also subject to RICO prosecution?",
  "To whom was the permanent misrepresentation made?",
  "I don't want silence to be interpreted as acquiescence, but - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Just to get back at maybe the same point Justice Kennedy was raising, which is you're focusing on -- you keep saying: The whole purpose of this, look at their website. But the issue is proximate cause, and if you've got to go through the individual consumer, it's either proximate cause or not. And if the -- if the indirect nature of what they're doing because the direct cause is the consumer's failure to pay, it doesn't seem to me that their intent is pertinent.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Barnhouse, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Isn't it -- well, I don't know, maybe it's more -- but isn't it a proposition that you don't rely on illegal conduct, that the -- the assumption of illegal conduct cuts the chain? In other words, there's only proximate cause if you assume people are going to not pay taxes that they're due, contrary to law, and that that breaks the proximate cause chain?",
  "No, that you have to -- in order to maintain -- this is a helpful question. In order - -",
  "In order to maintain the chain of connection, I thought you cannot rely, for one of those links in the chain, that a party is going to commit illegal action.",

But you have no idea how many of these claims are asserted and dismissed at an early stage or -- or whatever. You're saying, what, that there haven't been many Second Circuit opinions on this question?",
  "Do you think there will be -- do you think there will be more if we agree with your theory?",
  "Well, but it's also you don't really know, right? In other words, we're concerned about the chilling effect on the prosecutors. We don't know what the impact of the Second Circuit's decision has been on the prosecutors.",
  "What -- what is the basis for the 1983 claim without the submission at trial?",
  "Well, you know I'm not talking about the Fourth Amendment violation, which is complete whether there's a trial or not.",

  "I guess the question is where is it complete, or do you say it doesn't have to be a complete violation?",
  "Well, let's say that you -- let's say that you can't because we read Imbler as conferring absolute immunity on what goes on at the trial. And if you can't advert to that, you don't have a constitutional violation, right?",
  "Against -- against the judge?",
  "Well, that's the distinction here in this case, isn't it?",
  "In terms of the chilling impact on the prosecutor, what difference does it make whether it's at trial or pretrial for use at trial?",
  "Well, we thought it was -- I'm sorry. Why don't you finish your answer?",
  "I was going to suggest in response to your point that -- you know, qualified immunity is really significant. Of course, it is, but we've recognized, in a number of contexts, in the judicial area, for example, that it's -- it's not enough. We have also recognized that in the prosecutorial area, and trying to draw the line where you do -- I think this was one of the points Justice Alito was making, is that, sometimes, you're investigating and preparing your case at the same time. You don't just sit back and say, I'm -- I'm just going to look and see what I can find. You have particular areas. The prosecution requires you to show four things, So you are looking at those four things. You are preparing your case, and you're investigating.",
  "Well, your approach, then, encourages prosecutors to be trigger happy. They're prosecuting right now because they know, then, that everything else, they have absolute immunity, so - - you know, shoot first and ask questions later.",
  "No, just begin the formulation. I'm -- I'm starting to prosecute this person, rather than saying, let's look, let's investigate, let's interview, and then decide who we're going to prosecute.",

  "That's under - - you've given yourself an easier case because you're going -- you're getting over the threshold under (d)(1).",
  "The problem is (d)(2) refers to determination of facts - -",
  "-- and asks whether it's unreasonable. (E)(1) talks about facts and has a whole different test, and I -- I guess the difficulty I've had is -- is reconciling the two. To the extent you can articulate their differences, why would you do both?",
  "Thank you, General.",
  "Mr. Scanlon, you have three minutes remaining, but I'll give you more, since I would like to start with a question. My first question was whether your petition was under (d)(2), and during the argument, I went back and looked at the petition. And I see the exact language of (d)(1) quoted in paragraphs 45, 52, 58, 63, 71, 76, 82, 90, 94, 97, and 104, (d)(1), and, unless I'm missing it, nowhere do I see the language of (d)(2). I see the language of (d)(2) in your cert petition questions. Now, I think there's a huge difference between (d)(1) and (d)(2). We've been talking about (d)(2) in a case that was only brought under (d)(1).",
  "Is the language - - but then I -- you knew to quote the language of (d)(1). You did it -- I think it's more than a dozen times. You never quoted the language of (d)(2). Now, going back, you can say, well, we talk about these facts or those facts, but that is also relevant to the application question under (d)(1).",
  "Well, yes, I find it hard for you to -- to understand how you can say it was focused on when you quote (d)(1) twelve times and never quote (d)(2). It would seem to me that the focus was on (d)(1).",
  "Do you think there's a difference between a (d)(1) case and a (d)(2) case?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-7412, Graham v. Florida. Mr. Gowdy.",
  "Thirty-eight States allow this sentence, though, don't they?",
  "Thirty-eight, 39. I know you have a little dispute, but the vast majority of States allow the imposition of this sentence.",
  "I would have thought that would be strong evidence that they appreciate the gravity of the sentence in the particular circumstances of juveniles and therefore only impose it rarely.",
  "What about -- what if it's the -- pursuant to the usual State parole system, and it turns out that grants parole to 1 out of 20 applicants?",
  "It seems to me that your -- your argument suggests that you are, quite rightly, focusing on the particular facts that have life without parole. But if you concede that it's all right to have a sentence of 50 years and then a consideration where 1 out of 20 people are granted parole, I think it suggests that the line you would draw is -- is pretty artificial -- or certainly suggests that the next case we will get is somebody with life with parole after 50 years.",
  "Are you saying there is something in the Eighth Amendment that draws a distinction between 40 and 50 in that case?",
  "We have -- you are arguing for a categorical rule.",
  "Your friend on the other side is arguing for a categorical rule, always permissible. But we have a precedent that suggests in -- in an individual case, you assess the proportionality of the sentence to the crime. Now, we know from Roper that death is different, and we know from Roper that juveniles are different. Wouldn't it make sense to incorporate the consideration of the juvenile status into the proportionality review? So that if you do have a case where it's the 17-year-old who is 1 week shy of his 18th birthday and it is the most grievous crime spree you can imagine, you can determine that in that case life without parole may not be disproportionate. But if it's -- and I know you would argue that these are the facts here -- if it's a less grievous crime and there is, for example, a younger defendant involved, then in that case maybe it is disproportionate. Why -- why doesn't that seem more sensitive? And it avoids all of the line-drawing problems we have been discussing.",
  "Oh, I understand. But I don't think they'll say that we can't make that determination at 17 years 51 months, but we can make that determination at 18 years 1 month.",
  "But that is because, as they told us, death is different. And you do -- once you decide that, you do have to draw a line somewhere. I'm just wondering why we have to go all the way in with you or all the way with your opponent when our precedent allows us to consider an issue of this sort on a case­ by-case basis.",
  "The logic in Roper was very straightforward. It says, \"Death is reserved for the worst of the worst.\" I think that was the quote. We know that juveniles are not the worst of the worst, for the reasons you have articulated, that they are not fully developed, don't have moral sense to the same extent as an adult. But life without parole is not reserved for the worst of the worst, and so it seems to me that the logic of our precedent suggests that you can't necessarily rely on the juvenile status to exempt them from a penalty that is not reserved for the worst of the worst, but perhaps it makes sense to consider in a particular instance whether the penalty is disproportionate, given the juvenile's characteristics that you suggest.",
  "Well, there wasn't prior to our death penalty jurisprudence, either. And I thought we reviewed proportionality as a matter of Federal law in the Solem case.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, so did I, but we are talking about constitutionality under the Eighth Amendment --",
  "-- which is Federal law.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gowdy. Mr. Makar.",
  "Well, but you are arguing for a categorical rule of your own. You are saying that under a -- under -- juveniles under the age of 18, what, it's never -- it can be never determinative that they are juvenile in setting the sentence as a matter of Federal law?",
  "But then the -- what is your objection to an approach that when you are dealing with life without parole, for the reasons that your brother has articulated, you must as a matter of Federal law consider the juvenile status of the defendant before that sentence is imposed?",
  "In other words, not a -- not a categorical rule that it automatically makes a difference, but not a categorical rule that it can never make a difference?",
  "And -- and there's -- well, I guess that answers my question. He is not required to as a matter of Federal law. He can say: I am not considering the fact that this is a juvenile because I think his crime should be treated as an adult crime.",
  "Well, that's what we are arguing about.",
  "In -- in your earlier response to Justice Sotomayor's question, you said age certainly matters. As -- as a -- as a matter of what law? In other words, I understood your submission to be that there was nothing in Federal law that requires different consideration of age. So when you say age matters, why?",
  "Under the authority of what law? Age matters in a particular case because of --",
  "Because of the Eighth Amendment?",
  "I'm sorry. Why is that? If you go down on a case-by-case basis, there are no line-drawing problems. You just simply say age has to be considered as a matter of the Eighth Amendment.",
  "Well, we apply the proportionality review that we articulated in Harmelin, and Solem and Ewing.",
  "It's already there.",
  "Well, along those lines -- and, again, maybe this was in the amicus briefs. Do you have a study about what age cohort is responsible for most violent crime?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Makar. Mr. Gowdy, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "One reason States --",
  "One reason States and the Federal government moved to abolish parole in -- in recent decades was, with depressing regularity, prisoners released on parole committed crimes again. And I'm just -- is there any empirical evidence that tells us how often people, say, from 17 -- 17-year-olds, when released, commit crimes again, as opposed to 18- to 20-year-olds?",
  "But isn't that -- I remember some of those studies that -- I mean, the cutoff, there’s sort of a magic age at some point, where people over the age of 35, or whatever, typically don't engage in violent activity.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-7621, Sullivan v. Florida. Mr. Stevenson.",
  "Why won't the next case we get be an argument that for a juvenile, particularly one as young as -- as your client, 40 years is too long; 40 years doesn't recognize his capacity for moral development within a reasonable period?",
  "No, but -- I mean, you look at the Federal Government allows this sentence, right? Thirty-eight States allow this sentence. I just don't understand how you can say there is a consensus --",
  "-- that this type of sentence is unconstitutional.",
  "So it would be -- it would be reasonable under your approach to have a different result in these two cases? A difference in terms of consensus or when sentencing is allowed would result in a different result in your case than in Mr. Graham's case?",
  "It seems to me, once -- excuse me.",
  "It seems to me that one way to take that into effect is through our normal proportionality review and in a case by case. Your –- your client -- his crime is horrendously violent. At the same time, he is much younger than in the typical case. And it seems to me that requiring under the Eighth Amendment consideration of his age, as I said earlier, I guess, avoids all these line-drawing problems which seem -- the arbitrariness of the line-drawing seems inconsistent with the notion of the Eighth Amendment.",
  "Well, I thought -- I would have thought your argument that this is so rare suggests that maybe that analysis, to the extent it’s permitted under State law, has worked well for children.",
  "Well, that's because death is different, is what we said, and because death is reserved, as this Court said in Roper, for the worst of the worst. And we know that life without parole is not reserved for the worst of the worst.",
  "So your line is 13, and for obvious reasons. Another line is going to be 16 for obvious reasons. When the 15-year-old comes in, he is going to say 15, the 17-year-old -- and that it seems to me is why drawing the line on the basis of the Eighth Amendment -- there’s certainly nothing in the Eighth Amendment that suggests there is a difference between 16 and 17. Everybody with a different client is going to have a different line, which suggests to me that it ought to be considered in each individual case.",
  "Well, but that's because that's a policy judgment by the legislature. Here we are talking about the dictates of the Eighth Amendment. And the idea that the Eighth Amendment draws those kinds of arbitrary distinctions is one that I don't understand.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. Mr. Makar.",
  "Which of these cases is worse? A 16-year-old committing the crimes that Graham committed; a 13-year-old committing the crimes that Sullivan committed?",
  "My point is, if you had to consider youth as one of the factors that we consider under proportionality analysis, how do you come out?",
  "Off the charts on age or off the charts on violence?",
  "My --",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Would -- would the standards applied in that situation be any different than the standards that would apply if you prevailed on his reading of the procedural bar?",
  "I'm just trying to see if this jurisdictional issue makes any difference. If you are saying -- it sounds to me like you're saying, well, if he wins, he wins, and, if he loses, he loses. I don't think he cares whether it's under the procedural bar or some other basis.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Makar. Mr. Stevenson, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stevenson, Mr. Makar. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 08-964, Bilski v. Kappos. Mr. Jakes.",
  "What -- I'm looking at your claim 1, in Joint Appendix page 19 to 20. How is that not an abstract idea? You initiate a series of transactions between commodity providers and commodity consumers. You set a fixed price at the consumer end, you set a fixed price at the other end, and that's it. I mean, I could patent a process where I do the same thing. I initiate a series of transactions with sellers. I initiate a series of transactions with buyers. I buy low and sell high. That's my patent for maximizing wealth. I don't see how that's different than your claim number 1.",
  "Well, but your claim 1 it seems to me is classic commodity hedging that has been going on for centuries.",
  "What -- I'm sorry. Just -- what are the physical steps? Initiating a series of transactions between commodity provider and market participants?",
  "You get on the phone and you call the baker, and you get on the phone and you call the grocer and say: I can set up a deal for both of you.",
  "So you reject -- you reject the substitute. You think you can patent an alphabet because it is a process of forming words.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Jakes. Mr. Stewart.",
  "Mr. Stewart, I thought I understood your argument up until the very last footnote in your brief. And you say this is not -- simply the method isn't patentable because it doesn't involve a machine. But then you say but it might be if you use a computer to identify the parties that you are setting a price between and if you used a microprocessor to calculate the price. That's like saying if you use a typewriter to type out the -- the process, then it is patentable. I -- I -- that takes away everything that you spent 53 pages establishing.",
  "No, no. That's just saying instead of looking at the -- in the Yellow Pages, you look on the computer. And that makes all the difference to you?",
  "But if you look at your footnote, that involves the most tangential and insignificant use of a machine. And yet you say that might be enough to take something from patentability to not patentable?",
  "So you think it's a hard question. If you develop a process that says look to the historical averages of oil consumption over a certain period and divide it by 2, that process would not be patentable. But if you say use a calculator, then it -- then it is?",
  "But your footnote -- I don't mean to dwell on it -- it says to identify counterparties to the transactions. So that if what you're trying to get is the -- the baker who sells bread, because you are going to hook him up with the grocer who sells, you know, in the grocery store, if you punched in, in your search station -- you know, give me all the bakers in Washington -- that would make it patentable?",
  "I'm sorry. Did or did not?",
  "So what did that -- what did that transform?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jakes, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "The -- the physical step that your process involves is picking -- picking up the phone and calling people on both sides of the transaction.",

  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Counsel, I -- I'm sorry, do you want to finish? Okay. I -- I find it curious -- and maybe you can illuminate it for me -- that the Justice Department is before us, arguing that the Justice Department can't be trusted without judicial review. And I find that doubly curious when the Justice Department won on the opposite position below. I mean, are you suggesting that the statute is so absolutely clear that you could not stand there and say that your colleague down the hall in the Justice Department could be trusted to exercise his discretion, but in fact you are saying: I know we won on that, but we are not going to defend it because we think the Attorney General needs judicial review to help him stay in line?",
  "Yes, but if you take -- if you continued to argue the position you won on before the -- before the Seventh Circuit, it wouldn't be that the standard of review is -- is so deferential that it is okay. It would be there is no review at all.",
  "And the position of the Department of Justice was the opposite before 2004, correct?",
  "So if you think it's so bad, the Attorney General doesn't have to do it. Why do you need a court to tell you that?",
  "You keep saying \"the Board\" --",
  "You keep saying \"the Board.\" Under the statute, it’s the Attorney General, correct?",
  "And if he doesn't like what they do, he has the authority to act himself. Whenever somebody delegates authority, they retain authority to act themselves.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Leiter.",
  "And I suppose it's a large question, if you are talking about, presumably, the unusual cases in which the motion to reopen is -- is justified, that you are talking about 2,000 or 3,000 cases, and the question is whether or not those are -- should be reviewed in the executive branch or should be reviewed in the judicial branch.",
  "So we are looking for needles in -- in a haystack, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Schoenfield, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",

  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-304, Graham County Soil and Water Conservation District v. The United States, ex rel. Wilson. Mr. Browning.",
  "Well, but that's not terribly persuasive. In the statute there are separate provisions, they talk about disclosures \"in criminal, civil or administrative hearings,\" \"in a congressional administrative or Government Accounting Office report, or from the news media.\" Simply because you want to limit \"administrative\" or not limit \"administrative\" does not mean that the other side's view requires news media to be modified by \"Federal.\"",
  "Thank you counsel. Mr. Hurt.",
  "Counsel, are you sure that -- your argument is that this is sandwiched between two Federal descriptions? Are you sure \"congressional\" is limited to Federal Congress? The first definition in Black's Dictionary is \"a formal meeting of delegates.\" And I don't know -- maybe I should -- I don't know if all 50 States refer to their legislature by some term other than \"Congress.\"",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier?",
  "Well -- I didn't mean to interrupt. Clear limitations, you really have only one, right? I mean you have no argument construing administrative in a Federal way other than it is sandwiched between two other Federal - -",
  "Well, we would just -- we would just take the sections from your brief today and say well no, you have got to read it in the context in which it appears and this is all Federal, which means it's all governmental.",
  "Well -- well, North Carolina has got a government, too.",
  "North Carolina has a government, too.",
  "Same rule for Congress?",
  "Same rule for congressional?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Browning, you have six minutes.",
  "To -- to follow up, I think it was a question that Justice Breyer asked earlier. Do you have any tie-breaker on your side? I mean, if we do decide the arguments are pretty much in equipoise, the suggestion was that the Federal government is both the beneficiary and the loser in the qui tam actions, from the sense they lose a percentage of recovery, and so we ought to let them strike the balance. What argument do you have on your side?",
  "That's the same - - that's one of the arguments that, I think, is balanced on the other side. For example, is -- do -- have we ever said -- and this is an unusual statute, of course, with a private Attorney General and all that. Have we -- does -- is there any authority for the idea that we should read it restrictively because of that?",
  "Have we ever -- have we ever said that that's a basis for reading the act restrictively?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-905, Merck and Company v. Reynolds. Mr. Shanmugam.",
  "What would you -- what would you -- what phrase would you use to describe what happens when inquiry notice culminates in finding out? You have to say, oh, there looks like there might be scienter, I have to look at it. And after a year, you find it; yes, there was scienter. What -- what would you call what happens when they find out there was scienter?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart.",
  "I don't understand -- I don't understand that. I mean, if there are facts that would cause a reasonable person to inquire, you say that those only come to fruition for purposes of the statute of limitations when they discover it, when they have constructive discovery, right?",
  "So inquiry notice has nothing to do with anything.",
  "I don't understand that.",
  "Well, and maybe –- and maybe it turns out that you could find them within a week and maybe it turns out you could find them within 3 months or when the fellow from Burma is released, but in either case, it’s when they discover it or should have discovered it.",

  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1119, Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz v. United States and United States v. Milavetz. Mr. Brunstad.",
  "How much of your case depends upon the difficulty of defining what -- if you accept the idea that \"in contemplation of\" means abusive or fraudulent, how much of your case depends upon the proposition that it's just hard to tell, that it's -- it's a multifactored inquiry and that the lawyer sort of has to stop and think at every turn: Well, could this be construed as recommending abuse, or is this just construed as telling clients what they can and can't do? And in some areas it's a gray area, and what should you do when it's a gray area? Is that -- does your case depend upon that, which is, I guess, just an issue with the limiting construction proposed by the Solicitor General?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Brunstad. Mr. Jay.",
  "So, if -- if -- if lawyers are debt relief agencies, I am curious how your limiting construction works. If a client comes into a lawyer and says, look, I know we are thinking of filing bankruptcy, but I want to go to Tahiti and charge it; can I do it? And the lawyer says: Oh, the law says I can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy; the Solicitor General says that means I can't give you advice in aid of fraud that would deprive debtors of assets they might otherwise get, so I can't tell you.",
  "Has that person violated -- has that lawyer violated the statute?",
  "Well, the person has asked, can I charge the trip to Tahiti? And the lawyer, although giving perfectly truthful advice, has effectively conveyed to his client that if he does he would be depriving debtors of assets they might otherwise get.",
  "He has communicated to the client that if he takes the trip, one, he will have a good time in Tahiti; and two, he will be using assets that would otherwise end up in the hands of the debtors.",
  "What if -- what if the lawyer said: I can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy, but here's the Solicitor General's brief, read that.",
  "And a reasonable - - my point is a reasonable person reading the brief would say, well, the reason he can't give me advice is because that might cause me to do something that would defraud the debtors, so I'm going to buy the ticket.",
  "Well, that's one of the things I'm concerned about your limiting construction, \"intending to defraud the debtor.\" What if the person takes a trip to Tahiti every November? They've always done it. They are not intending to defraud the debtor. They are just doing what they have always done. So an attorney that gives that advice, would be -- that would be okay?",
  "So if -- so if the lawyer said that, I can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy, but I can tell you that fraud turns on the debtor's intent?",
  "No, but the whole point is that the attorney could be providing advice that would steer the debtor away from doing anything wrong. And yet the other -- the government would say, oh, no, no, no, no; you are trying to tell him it's okay to take the trip to Tahiti. If he says you can take the trip to Tahiti so long as your intent is not to defraud the debtor -- correct advice that could be read as telling the debtor not to do anything wrong or could be read as giving the debtor a little, as you say, a wink and a nod and saying, you know, what do you intend to do? And he says, oh, I just intend to go on vacation, not to defraud the debtors.",
  "You can come up with your own hypotheticals that are a lot easier from your point of view, and Justice Ginsburg has been suggesting some that are much more difficult because they depend on particular facts. And under your construction it seems to me that a lawyer trying to give correct, legal, ethical advice has got to pause before every sentence and think, oh, is this going to be construed in violation of subsection (a)(4)?",
  "But the point is you don't know. Of course you can't give advice to do something illegal. But I -- I would think that some of the questions have been suggesting that it's hard to know whether it's illegal. You yourself say it depends on the debtor's intent. So if a client came in to me and said, can I do this, and it depends on his intent, as a lawyer I would want to say: It depends on why you are doing it. But if -- but that I think could be construed as being -- giving advice in contemplation of bankruptcy.",
  "This is a regulation of the attorney-client relationship to pursue an unrelated substantive objective. You want to ensure that debtors don't do something and you think, well, the way -- it's not enough to tell debtors, don't do this. You're going to say: We are going to regulate what lawyers tell them as a way of pursuing an unrelated objective.",
  "Well, the objective is criminal; that doesn't mean it is not being indirectly enforced by interfering with the attorney-client relationship.",
  "-- or affecting the attorney-client relationship.",
  "Yes, it's a good way to enforce it, to tell people you can't get legal advice about it. What if a State thinks that there are too many punitive damage awards, that they are out of control, and so it passes a law saying lawyers may not tell their clients that they can get -- they can seek punitive damages?",
  "Oh, if it's done with the purpose of fraud, it is. If you think, well, I'm really -- I really wasn't -- it really wasn't malicious conduct, I know that, or whatever the standard is for punitive damages, then it's illegal, just like here if you incur debt to defraud your debtors it's illegal, but if you don't it's not.",
  "Oh, no, no, no, no. Only if it's -- you know, it says you can't give that advice in contemplation of filing a lawsuit.",
  "No, no, no. It's a difference between filing, because there the lawyer signs the -- signs the complaint. It's giving advice to the client. And the -- I guess what I would see as the parallel is that it's an objective outside the attorney-client relationship. It's not like saying, you can't charge more than 50 percent contingent fee or - - or whatever -- you know, designed to regulate the client -- protect the client. It's -- it's a totally extraneous objective.",

  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-1134, United Student Aid Funds v. Espinosa. Ms. Wanslee.",
  "What -- what provision was this discharge under?",
  "And 1328 says: \"The court shall grant a debtor a discharge.\" That doesn't sound self-executing to me.",
  "(a), and section 523(a) does not refer to a discharge under 1328(a). It refers to a discharge under 1328(b).",
  "No, no, no. 1328(a)(2) brings in the definition, the kind of debt specified in 523(a). It doesn't bring in the discharge under 523(a), which is limited to 1328(b).",
  "If -- if you’d like to reserve time, it's probably time to wrap up.",
  "Mr. Heytens.",
  "I don't -- sorry to start -- stop you at the beginning, but I don't see that. I see in 1328(a) it says the court “shall grant” the debtor. And that is not self-executing. It's a directive to the court. And I see that 523(a) is referred to later on, but only for purposes of definition, not for purposes of discharge.",
  "Well, then the key distinction you draw in your brief is totally meaningless. You say on page 18 that this -- the issue is whether the provision is, quote, “framed as a directive” to the bankruptcy court. And here it is framed as a directive to the bankruptcy court, and therefore doesn't -- isn't self-executing.",

Would you concede that the State has different regulatory interests with respect to that new strip of land versus the old strip of land? It's still your property. The State can regulate your property. Presumably, they regulate your beach property now. Would their different -- would their authority to regulate be greater with respect to the new area?",
  "No. Your -- you would still have the title to the property.",
  "It's still your property. You know, the State regulates property all the time, in zoning -- would their authority be broader with respect to that new land than with respect to the old?",
  "Sometimes -- and I don't actually know what the law is on this. Sometimes the State builds, you know, sidewalks in front of people. Maybe they do it on their own land, and they say: We're putting this easement, and people can walk across it. Would this be in the same category of public project? They say, well, it's your land because you have a right to the mean high-water land, but we built it so we have greater rights with respect to regulation than we might have with respect to the natural beach.",
  "Could the State --",
  "Could the State sell this new land to somebody else?",
  "Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Safriet. Mr. Makar.",
  "I suppose it depends on -- or maybe not -- how quickly it all happens. I mean, if the State project is such that they add a foot a year, is that an avulsion or accretion?",
  "Well, is your view whenever the State does it, it's an avulsion?",
  "No, no. I know. My -- my questions was what if it is?",
  "I don't recall how quickly things happened here.",
  "But if it's -- if it's gradual, even though the State is doing it, it can be an accretion, right?",
  "Yes.",
  "It's a foot a year. It’s a foot a year.",
  "So, on these facts --",
  "On these facts, if the State's project added sand at a foot a year, the landowner would win?",
  "A foot -- are we dickering over the distance?",
  "Well, then, wherever you want to say it's an accretion -- what -- it’s an inch, 6 inches --",
  "So, you’re --",
  "If I can -- we're arguing about the application of a doctrine to this case. I’d like to step back if I can and talk about the doctrine through a hypothetical, if that's all right.",
  "The -- the -- let's say the legislature passes an act saying the boundary of beachfront property is now where the sand starts, and not the mean high-water mark but the mean high-sand mark. All right? And -- and then -- so that's sued. You -- you sue under that, and the court says: Yes, of course, that's a taking; our precedents have always said it's the mean high-water line and nothing else. Florida has judicial elections. Say, somebody runs for election for the Florida Supreme Court and says: I'm going to change that law. I'm going to say that it is not a taking. I think people should be able to walk right up to the land. And that person is elected, and the law is changed. Now, is -- is that a judicial taking?",
  "Is it a possibility or is it a clear case?",
  "No, no. I know. You're changing --",
  "I understand you have a different view about here. But under my hypothetical, would you agree that the action of the Florida Supreme Court is a taking?",
  "But that's not the question. I mean, you just said that, let's assume the -- assuming the property line doesn't change. The other side is saying the property line is the mean high-water line, and so if you -- whoever adds sand, the State, mother nature, you dumping it -- I guess you can't do that, but whoever adds it, the property line is the mean high-water line.",
  "Yes, but that's because you think the property line is the ECL rather than the MHWL.",
  "Well, but it's not -- it's not the same as the property right he held before, right?",
  "So he can exclude people from the additional 60 feet?",
  "But, that's what the case is about.",
  "So why doesn't -- why don't you take your list and Justice Breyer's list and submit that in the just compensation hearing? When the landowner comes in and says, look, you have taken my property and it is worth $100,000, and you come in and say oh, no, no; it's not worth $100,000; look at all these things we saved and gave you. It's only -- what you have lost is only worth $20,000. And a court will review that and say yes, no, whatever, and that's what you get.",
  "Again, that is what the whole case is about, whether they have a right to contact the water or not. It seems to me if your only answer to every question is they don't have the right, you're just completely begging the question.",
  "So on behalf of the State, you concede if any of this list -- these -- the list of good things that the land owner gets, if the legislature next year takes them away, that would be a taking?",
  "You can complete your thought.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, that's a clever ploy. We're talking about judicial takings and you say, don't look at what the court did; look at what the legislature did. That changes the whole ball game.",
  "There's no choice. If their argument is what the court did constituted the taking, they couldn't have raised that earlier --",
  "-- and said, oh, we think we know that the court is going to change things.",
  "Judicial -- judicial taking if that were the case?",
  "Accretion -- accretion, of course, would change.",
  "It would take submerged State land and give it to the landowner.",
  "So a foot -- I'll get back to what I raised earlier. A foot a year, if the State does it and it's a foot a year, does the property owner get the foot, or does the State get the foot?",
  "So it makes a difference whether it's done in a day or done in a month?",
  "Counsel, what is your --",
  "I'm sorry. What -- what is your view on the hypothetical I posed to your -- to your friend? The legislature moves it to the vegetation line. The State supreme court says that's a taking. Somebody runs for election to the State supreme court, saying, I'm going to change that. He's elected. He changes the law. Is that a judicial taking?",
  "Well, doesn't -- it's not pretextual.",
  "He says, I think they got the law wrong.",
  "It could be -- it could be adding an amusement park, though, under your theory, right?",
  "It's the State's property.",
  "It's the State's property. If they want to put an amusement park on, they can.",
  "Let's see if there are any further questions. (No response.)",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Safriet, 4 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next today in Case 08-1175, Florida v. Powell. Mr. Jacquot.",
  "Now, \"any\" –- just to make sure; you've said two different things. It says \"any of our questions,\" right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. O'Neil.",
  "Where -- where is that? Is that set forth in the -- in the briefs? The FBI form? Where -- where is that set forth?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Brueckheimer.",
  "So the --",
  "So the FBI warning that was specifically approved in Miranda was inconsistent with Miranda?",
  "It says consistent -- consistent with the procedure which we delineate today.",
  "Well, maybe, but it says -- it says the -- what the FBI -- the pattern of warning -- well, let me make sure I get it exact. \"The present pattern of warnings and respect for the rights of the individual followed as a practice by the FBI is consistent with the procedure we delineate today.\" And the FBI warning says nothing about presence or with -- or with counsel with him.",
  "Well, okay. I’ll take \"consistent with.\" That means that it complies with the rule in Miranda.",
  "Then how is the FBI warning consistent with the procedure the Court delineated in Miranda?",
  "No, I said how is it --",
  "Yes.",
  "So I would say that it's not consistent with Miranda.",
  "Okay.",
  "What it says is that the respect for the rights of the individual followed in the FBI is consistent with.",
  "Is there -- is there any -- I'm not sure this is pertinent -- but is there any malevolent reason Tampa police would adopt this warning? I mean, someone says, well, here's what the FBI uses. And they say, well, I tell you what, if we just say you have a right to an attorney before answering any questions and then later say you can exercise this right any time, maybe we'll be able to trick some people who don't think they can actually have the lawyer there. In other words was this just --",
  "So -- and you can't think of any bad reason they might have done it.",
  "You -- you think it's a good thing, though, that they changed their forms to track the FBI form after -- after this litigation started.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel, you have a minute remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-861, Free Enterprise Fund and Beckstead and Watts v. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Mr. Carvin.",
  "And the brief.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Carvin.",
  "General Kagan.",
  "No. I thought the employees were appointed by the chairman, not by the commission.",
  "So you think -- you think a -- a veto power is the same as an original -- original power?",
  "Well, let's say --",
  "Let's say that the -- let's say that the board issues -- demands documents from a particular company. Can the SEC direct them not to do that?",
  "Will that be consistent -- do you think that will be consistent with the intent of Congress in establishing the PCAOB?",
  "Why did -- just out of -- I guess maybe it's not important, but why did the -- why did Congress set up a separate board if it's going to be entirely controlled by the SEC?",
  "Before we get -- before you get too far into that, of those first two things, is there any reason Congress couldn't have achieved those same objectives by establishing the PCAOB as a division within the SEC?",
  "Does it have consequences for public companies subject to the board if it refuses to turn over documents requested by this -- this board?",
  "Oh, I know, but presumably you only get a subpoena when people don't cooperate.",
  "And what happens if they don't?",
  "Are there any other -- are there any consequences from the company's refusal short of -- that would not require the board to get a subpoena?",
  "In the absence of the subpoena, if nothing happens?",
  "Is it -- does it have a consequence as a practical matter for the company if it doesn't comply with a request from this board?",
  "So there are in fact collateral consequences that take place without any involvement by the SEC?",
  "So if you had a statute here that said, look, if you don't comply with the board's request for documents, your authorities will be suspended, and if that were the statute, you would say, well, that's okay, because the SEC can always change that rule.",
  "I'm sorry, I asked you whether there were any consequences from the failure of the company to turn over documents; and is your answer that there are no consequences whatever?",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "Right. That's Humphrey's Executor. But you have to add to Humphrey's Executor Perkins and Morrison. Humphrey's Executor says you can limit the President's removal power. That doesn't get you down to the board. You have to also say the principal officers -- there can be limits on their removal authority of the board members.",
  "I didn't say anything bad about Humphrey's Executor.",
  "What is -- I'm sorry. What is the removal authority of the SEC with respect to board officers?",
  "All right. So there is a limitation there. For cause does not include failure to follow the policies of the President.",
  "So you need to rely on Morrison to make the limitations on what the SEC can do with respect to the board constitutional.",
  "And you need to rely on Humphrey's Executor to make the limitations on what the President can tell the SEC constitutional.",
  "Oh, no, no, because you have got an extra layer there. Let's say, I mean, that you have to have two violations of the for-cause provision. You have got to have -- you have to meet the requirement in two places. When the SEC wants to remove the board member, they can only do that for cause. And if they decide, well, there isn't cause, I'm not going to do it, then the President under your theory has to remove the SEC commissioners, all of them, not just -- not just the chairman, and he can only do that for cause. So you have got \"for cause\" squared, and that's -- that's a significant limitation that Humphrey's Executor didn't recognize and Morrison didn't recognize.",
  "Which one are we talking about, the first one or the second one?",
  "Well, let's just talk -- a practical example. The board says I want to get the documents of company X. The SEC thinks they shouldn't do that. Okay? Can they remove them for that situation -- in that situation?",
  "Can they say --",
  "-- you are fired? Can they say, you are fired because we have control over what you do and we don't think you should do that?",
  "The easiest way to do it is to pick up the phone, not by promulgating a rule.",
  "Can the President pick up the phone and fire the SEC commissioners?",
  "He thinks -- he thinks they -- the board should be getting the documents from the other company, and the SEC thinks they can't. So the SEC tells the board, don't go after that company, and because they do that the President fires the SEC. Does that work under your theory?",
  "Right.",
  "I'm not worried if it's the same. I'm worried if it's enough.",
  "Right. And then --",
  "It goes further because you’ve got to rely on the SEC to get to the board. So there you’ve got to rely on Perkins and Morrison.",
  "What do they have to say about the theory that the SEC commissioners can be removed by the President?",
  "And you are not contesting it?",
  "Thank you, General.",
  "Mr. Lamken.",
  "I thought -- so you disagree with General Kagan? I thought she said one of the reasons for taking the board outside the SEC is that they’d have an independent funding stream.",
  "Well, the board can act, and the SEC can, I suppose, retroactively veto their actions, but the SEC doesn't propose what actions the board takes, actions that can have significant, devastating consequences for the regulated bodies.",
  "I'm not talking about rules. Agencies in the government do not act only in implementing a particular rule. They have authority to regulate. And the board here, for example, can tell a particular entity: You have to turn over these documents. They don't have to have a rule that says, this company must turn over the documents.",
  "Is there any other --",
  "Is there any other situation in the vast federal bureaucracy, where you have this two-level situation that we have here?",
  "In other words, the President can't remove the SEC commissioners at will. They can't remove the PCAOB commissioners at will. Or even if you look at it from the for-cause perspective, there has to be two layers of “for cause.”",
  "What -- well, give me an example.",
  "The formulation --",
  "The formulation -- excuse me.",
  "The formulation that you use and your friend the Solicitor General have used -- has used is that they have the same authority that they have over every other independent agency, but I'm -- it's very hard to find out exactly what that authority is. So what is your position about the authority of the President? Is it more than for cause or only for cause?",
  "What do you understand that position to be?",
  "So the President -- I guess I’m following up on Justice Kennedy's question -- the President cannot call them and say, take this particular action in this particular case.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Lamken. Mr. Carvin, to keep the time even here, you have 8 minutes.",
  "Well, I would have -- Judge Kavanaugh has suggested there are two ways to cure this problem: One, have the President appoint and remove; and the other thing, make it truly subordinate to the SEC. Now, I've heard the argument on the other side, both from the government -- well, it's an issue with the government -- the Solicitor General and the board, that the agency, the board, is completely subordinate to the SEC. Well, if Congress -- Congress could fix this problem by saying: The board is subordinate to the SEC.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument next in Case 08-1196, Weyhrauch v. United States. Mr. Ayer.",
  "So if the -- there were a State law that said you must disclose anything that could reasonably be viewed as a conflict of interest, then -- then you would lose?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben, welcome back.",
  "But what if -- what if that external standard imposed penalties vastly different from the mail fraud statute? For example, what if Alaska had a law here that said you must disclose this, and if you fail to disclose it, you are subject to 6 months in jail or a $500 fine?",
  "It's a light sentence because the disclosure obligations are confusing, but -- and then the Federal prosecutor comes along and says, well, you -- you are going away for 20 years because this violates 1346.",
  "Yes, he knows that he should disclose this, and --",
  "Yes.",
  "So, you have no problem with the idea that the State law, the source of the duty to disclose, imposes a penalty of 6 months, and the Federal law you say you can still go after him not only 20 years but an additional 20 years?",
  "I thought the principle was that a citizen has to be able to understand the law, and if he can't, then the law is invalid.",
  "Well, that’s a familiar common law term. “Honest services” is not.",
  "I'm not remembering. Was the phrase \"honest services\" used in Lemire?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, what if a public official -- you said in response to Justice Stevens that this actionable conduct has to benefit the defendant's interest. What if his interest is a particular policy contrary to that of his employer? In other words, he is a subordinate official. His employer says, I want you to do this and this to advance our policy. He doesn't like the policy, so he does something you can characterize as dishonest that undermines the policy or advanced a different policy that he agrees with.",
  "Why? Because it doesn't involve tangible --",
  "Financial.",
  "It has to involve financial --",
  "Well, where does the right to honest services say “financial”?",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Now, Mr. Ayer, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-876, Conrad Black et al. v. The United States. Mr. Estrada.",
  "Your theory -- your theory that return to the pre-McNally cases would help you is based almost entirely on the D.C. Circuit case - - case in Lemire -- Lemire.",
  "The -- the government tells us it was an outlier.",
  "Let's say you have a bank that is going to be opening up a lot of branches in the State, and one of the directors knows this and knows where they are going to open them. And he goes around and buys up the real estate where the bank is going to put its -- put its branch, so that he gets the benefit of the -- of the sale. And assume that the price that -- that he's going to charge is a fair market price, no different than what anybody else would charge. Now, is that sort of self-dealing covered under your view of the statute?",
  "But he is not stealing -- he is not stealing the confidential information. As the director, he has the perfect right to know the confidential information.",
  "Well, I don't know that I would call it a corporate -- I don't know if I would call it a corporate opportunity. They are not looking to sell the land; they need to buy it.",
  "Well, but presumably, the one thing it's odd to suggest Congress did was sort of run 1346 through 1341, when what it was trying to fix was the Court's understanding of what 1341 provided.",
  "Where -- where in the record do we find your argument that the statute is unconstitutional?",
  "Counsel, you were -- I think you were about to tell me where you raised it in the Court -- the constitutional argument in this Court?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "That would be - -",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Well, Mr. Dreeben, you agree that it would be very unusual if in June we announced the opinion in your case agreeing with you and then the next case announced that the statute is unconstitutional?",
  "So is that -- does the right to intangible services refer to an obligation that is legal or moral?",
  "Only -- only legal? So that if in a State their corporate law says conflicts of interest with respect to spouse and children must be disclosed, but conflicts of interest with respect to nieces and nephews need not, you would say you cannot use this statute to prosecute somebody who, under some abstract sense, should have told their employer that, \"My niece is going to get $10 million if we go ahead with this contract\"?",
  "Counsel, could I ask -- could I ask you just, in terms -- the terms of the statute, does your theory give any independent substance to the word \"right\"? It seems, to me, your argument is that - - that someone who deprives another of honest services. I don't know where the concept of \"right\" comes in, which is in the statute.",
  "So the point -- I guess maybe this is -- maybe I asked you this before. The -- the right is not limited to specific legal obligations, but to a developing Federal common law of criminal liability?",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Estrada, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Finish your thought.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument first today in Case 08-1198, Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds International. Mr. Waxman.",
  "Thank you. Ms. Pillard.",
  "Isn't that a critical difference, though? I mean, I understood the fundamental question in -- before getting arbitration is whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate this dispute with this party. And it's one thing to say that the contract permitted this sort of arbitration; it's another thing to say it didn't preclude it.",
  "And if it didn't preclude, the contract may not preclude -- if I agree -- I guess it's the -- well, if I agree to arbitrate with A, it doesn't preclude me from arbitrating with B, but nothing in the agreement compels me to do that. So which did the arbitrators do? Did they say, under this contract, you agreed to a class action treatment, in the sense that -- whether it's the language or the intent or whatever -- or did they say we don't find anything here that precludes class action treatment?",
  "Would you show me this -- I see they have quoted from --",
  "-- from the agreement. Where is that in the agreement itself?",
  "Yes.",
  "If you know offhand.",
  "Well, this is -- I'm sorry. This is what I was wondering. It is, of course, any dispute arising from -- blah, blah -- performance, termination of this charter party shall be settled in New York. Now, there's -- the class is not a party to this charter party. So disputes arising from this charter party doesn't involve the class. So they did not agree to arbitrate with the class. Now, as I understand what the arbitrators did, they said, well, they didn't preclude it, and so we get to decide how far our authority goes.",
  "Well, now -- now -- I'm sorry. I'm just reading along here. They rejected your argument about \"forbids,\" but the -- they go on to say: The issue -- we look at this, we look at that to see whether they intended to permit or to preclude class action.",
  "So it's enough for them if the parties did not intend to preclude class action.",
  "In -- in any -- in any case -- when you say \"arbitrators' toolbox,\" I'm trying to figure out if that is something different than what the parties agreed to.",
  "Well, that's just saying that they're -- they’re giving up a lot. This is the basic reason that you require, I thought, fairly clear language that you are agreeing to arbitrate. They are giving up their right to go into court. They have an agreement between A and B that they will arbitrate a dispute, and they say you are giving up your right to go to court with the dispute between A and C. And the \"any dispute\" language that you're, you know, quite understandably relying on refers to any dispute arising from the -- making performance or termination of \"this charter party.\" \"This charter party\" says nothing about arbitrating with C.",
  "Oh, but they can agree to arbitrate. They can agree to arbitrate with some and not with others, even if it's the same contract. They may decide that your client is a very reasonable person; they are happy to submit that to arbitration. Or it's a very big and important client, and they don't want to get into court with you. They may decide some other party, for whatever reason, they don't want to get dragged into court with them. Same charter party, different -- different parties --",
  "-- and different results.",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Allowing.",
  "Allowing. See, that's where I get hung up. There’s a difference in arbitration -- and it's a fundamental difference -- between allowing something and a background rule that requires it if you don't say anything about it. The difference I see with the hypothetical Justice Breyer put is that you are talking about the details of a contract once it's agreed there is a contract. There's a contract that governs the relationship between the employer and the employee, and you're trying to figure out if it says anything about where they eat lunch. This is the much more fundamental issue of whether you've even agreed to arbitrate with this person. Is this guy your employee or just somebody who came in off the street? And I think what your brother's position is, is that this is just somebody who came off the street; the class members. I didn't agree to do anything with them.",
  "So --",
  "Well, that's -- that's what it comes down --",
  "That's what it comes down to --",
  "-- whether it's an interpretation of the contract to give the arbitrators the authority to proceed on a class basis. Not enough, right, under your view, if there's nothing in there that precludes them from doing so?",
  "So what -- what happens --",
  "What happens if you get the arbitrator on the stand, and he says: As we read the contract, it doesn't say -- and nothing about the intent of the parties leads me to believe they meant -- you may arbitrate this on a class basis, but at the same time there is nothing in there that says you may not. And I looked at the intent of the parties and background rules, and nothing there says you may not. What do you understand to be the answer? Can they proceed on a class basis or not?",
  "Yes.",
  "Right. It's the background rule --",
  "-- under which you should interpret this.",
  "So we have to decide, when we -- when the contract says nothing about class actions, whether the background rule should be you can go ahead -- or the background rule should be you can't go ahead.",
  "Well --",
  "What the arbitrators have already told us -- I think you disagree with it --",
  "-- but take it for purposes of argument. What the arbitrators have told us is that it doesn't say anything. It doesn't say you can do it; it doesn't say you can't do it. Now, assume that's true.",
  "No, I know. I said she doesn't agree with it. But, I mean, assuming that's true, what's the answer? Yes or no? Can they go ahead with class action or not?",
  "If you and I have a --",
  "I'm sorry. If you and I have a contract -- you’re going to sell me a car, and we write up a contract and we enter into it, and it provides for arbitration if we have a dispute. I also buy a car from Mr. Waxman, and I Xerox that contract. It's the exact same contract. We have a dispute, and we go to arbitration. Can Mr. Waxman come in and say, I got the same contract, and I've got the same dispute. Arbitrate with me, too?",
  "Okay. Now, suppose I have a contract just with you and -- to arbitrate -- or I -- I have the same contract with Mr. Waxman, but it has no arbitration clause. And he says, well, the dispute is the same, you are arbitrating that, can I come in, too, and get bound by your decision?",
  "You would say no. And the reason is?",
  "Not that I -- he doesn't have any arbitration agreement with me or that it's not the same arbitration agreement?",
  "Let's say the intent is pertinent when we enter into the contract, okay? And there’s good evidence about what you and I meant the contract to mean, and there’s not any evidence about what Mr. Waxman and I meant the contract to mean. Say we’ve got an arbitration clause in both cases. Can we arbitrate -- can I be required to arbitrate Mr. Waxman's contract with -- along with the one that you and I have entered into?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman, why don't you take 2 minutes?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument next in Case 07-11191, Briscoe v. Virginia. Mr. Friedman.",
  "But I assume you've picked the best example for you. D.C. is a small place. You go to a big State, and the lab is not always right next door.",
  "Your answer to Justice Breyer has to be, of course, you would insist that the person be called. It would be malpractice for you not to.",
  "I'm sorry. Entirely what?",
  "Oh.",
  "Or the dissent.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Friedman.",
  "Mr. McCullough. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McCULLOUGH",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kruger.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Friedman, you have 4 minutes left.",
  "Well, the -- just the first one, the no-notice problem, that's kind of silly, isn't it? Because if you are being prosecuted for 50 grams of crack cocaine, you can expect the government is going to try to prove that.",
  "Yes.",

  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 132 on our original docket, Alabama v. North Carolina. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Would your position be the -- be the same if it were $20 million?",
  "So whatever the Commission contributed? In other words, it doesn't have to be enough to trigger an obligation on the part of North Carolina to move forward. I assume there is some level where you would say, you know, they took their chances, and it didn't work out -- as opposed to they obviously committed in light of the money they accepted.",
  "No, I don't think so. I think it's a question of whether there's a breach. I would say that if you gave them $1 million, you should not view that as: Well, we've supported your efforts; you are committed to do this, no matter how much it costs, because we have given you $1 million. It seems to me at some point the amount becomes pertinent in assessing whether you have a claim.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Kneedler.",

  "You took -- you took $80 million, and they got nothing for it. That would be a question your grandson might ask.",

  "Thank you, Mr. Dellinger. Mr. Phillips, have you 10 minutes.",
  "But then -- but those States couldn't take the money. They couldn't say, I want my share?",
  "You are saying it was their money, but they had no access to it.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1224, United States v. Comstock. General Kagan.",
  "So you would say that the Federal Government has no such power independent of the criminal conviction? In other words, that Congress could not pass a law saying, just as this one says, we are going to commit people who are sexually dangerous until a determination that they are not or until the State can take them? That power would not be in Article I?",
  "Right. I understand your argument to be that this power is necessary and proper, given the fact that the person is in Federal custody for some other reason, criminal conviction.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, why doesn't the Federal Government's authority to have custody because of the criminal justice system end when the criminal justice system is exhausted? In other words, when the sentence is done?",
  "So, if there were --",
  "But, General --",
  "I understood you in your response to Justice Alito to say, if I remember, that it was not just the fact of Federal custody, but the fact that there are no States or there may well often be no States willing. What if every State is willing; I mean, every State is willing to take the people on out of a concern to protect their citizens. Does that somehow mean there’s no necessary and proper power?",
  "I guess it wouldn't be necessary, is what you are saying?",
  "Thanks for thinking it was a promotion.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. DuBois. Is it \"due-BWAH\" or --",
  "Mr. DuBois.",
  "Well, he's not going to be cavalier. He doesn’t have -- he's going to say: Don't do it. This is a dangerous person, the Federal government; don't release him.",
  "And you want the Federal Government to have to be in the position of saying, well, we have to.",
  "Well, it may be the Federal Government's hard political position. They are the person holding them, and the attorney general is saying, don't release him, and then the Federal government is going to make the decision, well, we have to.",
  "Thank you, Mr. DuBois. General Kagan, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, General. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument next in Case 08-645, Abbott v. Abbott. Ms. Howe.",
  "The answer you just gave about concern for the protection of the child, that applies only to the child? In other words, in the case that we have been discussing, if the woman would be subject to whatever persecution or domestic violence, but the child -- you know, there’s no suggestion of any harm targeted to the child, that would not be a case in which they could grant refuge?",
  "To only -- only to the child?",
  "So the woman would be subject to -- if she wanted to remain with the child, there would be no protection. She would have to choose between subjecting herself to violence or being apart from the child?",
  "That would be consistent with the convention, for the returning state to say, we are returning the child, but only if -- you know, bang, bang, bang?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders.",
  "So that if -- so that if you have the mother taking her daughter from, say, a country where she would be forced to be raised under sharia law and that -- that is up to that country to decide whether the child has to be returned? Or is there a basis for a domestic tribunal in the court, in the -- what is it called, the country of refuge? Can that country decide that the child should not be returned?",
  "So it's your position that, in that case, the mother should return her daughter to the country where she will be raised under a system that the mother finds quite offensive?",
  "And what -- I know Ms. Howe cited it. What is the standard on the 13(b) defense?",
  "Does -- does the status of, in this case, women in the country, does that constitute grave risk, or is it an individualized determination?",
  "And that country is going to make a determination in favor of their domestic law and their domestic system. Presumably, they are not going to say: We think it's a grave risk to the child to be raised under our system.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hays.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Howe, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "I'm sorry, I'm a little taken aback by your answer to Justice Breyer. You think the grave prosecution standard means whatever is the best interest of the child?",
  "And you agree with what I understood to be the Solicitor General's position, that that’s an individual-specific and not a culture-specific determination?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-1200, Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer, & Ulrich. Mr. Russell.",
  "I think -- reading \"intentional\" the way you just articulated is absolutely right, but when you add -- I don't see what work \"bona fide error\" does in the statute, if \"intentional\" should be read in this case to mean what you say.",
  "But you say: Well, intentional means you meant to send out the document; you meant to serve it; in other words, no specific intent requirement. But if -- a bona fide error, it seems, doesn't make the activity not intentional under the traditional understanding of intentional.",
  "But you are sort of begging the question there. I mean, the antitrust laws also don't have a bona fide error defense, and the question is whether that includes a legal mistake defense.",
  "One -- one of the things you have to include on this initial communication is the name of the creditor, right?",
  "Okay. So let's say the bank that is the creditor is being sold or taken over. And, you know, you have heard that, well, they have merged, but, you know, the closing date of the merger is two months later or whatever. It's just not clear what the name of the creditor is. So you -- you are not a lawyer, but you are trying to collect the debt, and you go -- you fill in, I -- it's either A or B, and you say: I think it's A, and you fill it in and it turns out that it's -- it's B. Let's say that's a bona fide error. Okay? But if you are sitting there as the debt collector and you say: I don't know if it's A or B. And you say: I know; I'll call the lawyer. You call the lawyer and the lawyer says: Oh, it's -- it's B -- I mean, it's -- it's A. And you put down A and it turns out it's wrong, aren't -- you are in a worse position if you ask the lawyer than if you didn't, right?",
  "No, it's a -- it's a legal -- the lawyer looks at it and says: Well, you know, the merger is not going to close for whatever, but I think it's still this bank. And it turns out his legal analysis of who the creditor is was wrong.",
  "Yes.",
  "But if the client just says: I'm not going to ask the lawyer; I'm just going to make -- I think it's A -- it's a bona fide error, but it's an error -- he gets the benefit of that position. But if he asks the lawyer, he doesn't get the benefit.",
  "Who the -- who the creditor is is necessarily a mistake of law, rather than fact?",
  "Well, is it a mistake of fact if the lawyer does legal research to find it out?",
  "He looks and he says: Well, it depends upon the date of the closing of the merger, not the announcement.",
  "And it turns out that's a legal mistake.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Jay.",
  "How many times have they answered in the past decade?",
  "So that's not a very realistic procedure to rely on, is it?",
  "And why is that? Because it's a little difficult dealing with the FTC bureaucracy and getting an answer from them in a reasonable time?",
  "So you are saying that the debt collection industry doesn't does ask the FTC, which would be a safe harbor for them, because if they get a bad answer, they may not follow it and then they may be subject to heightened penalties?",
  "Well, but there are four of them. I don't care how public they are. There are four of them over the past 10 years. It's not a very reliable or usable effort to clarify the law and address the problem that the statute presents.",
  "And if that's wrong, it doesn't do you any good.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Jay. Mr. Coakley.",
  "I suppose it would make interpretation of the act a little more difficult. The same practice would be unconscionable in -- not unconscionable in one circumstance, you would have an opinion saying this is not unconscionable; but yet if somebody else does it, you know, two weeks later, that doesn't have the same -- he says, well, look, it's not unconscionable, but it turns out it is, in his case. And it would have to be -- the opinion would have to clarify the law by saying, this is normally unconscionable but we are going to say it's not here because of this activity that is unlikely to happen.",
  "That issue is still not settled, is it?",
  "We still don't know if the lawyer here was right or wrong.",
  "So I mean, you're - - the substance of your answer is that they are just two very different statutes.",
  "But I -- but I share Justice Scalia's concern, I mean the -- the ways in which they are different would suggest you need the legal mistake defense more in TILA than you do in the",
  "I see I have a copy in the retail -- Association of Retail Collection Trades. The first -- second sentence in the FTC's response is I apologize for the delay in responding to your request.",
  "It is not an atypical issue in dealing with government agencies.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-661, American Needle v. The National Football League. Mr. Nager.",
  "It seems --",
  "Counsel, it seems to me -- your last few answers seem to me to beg the question. You start out by saying, well, obviously it's a horizontal agreement among the teams, and then you explain how you are going to analyze it. I thought that was the very question before us: Whether these sorts of rules and regulations are horizontal agreements between the teams or whether they are part of a particular -- a single entity’s articulation of rules.",
  "That you have been begging the question? Is that -- that part?",
  "Counsel, could you articulate for me as succinctly as possible the extent to which your position departs from the position of the Solicitor General?",
  "Well, I would have thought it’s just the transfer of the inefficiency and lack of clarity from the -- the first question to the rule of reason. I mean, I'm not quite sure it -- you don't have the same problem. It's just a question of where you want to rest the inefficiency and confusion.",
  "Well, I -- I thought the purpose of their submission was to respond to some of the questions we've seen, like scheduling, like what the rules are going to be about, about the game. There are some things that it just seems odd to subject to a rule of reason analysis. And you yourself have said: Well, that’s going to be an easy case under the rule of reason. Why doesn't it make sense to sort of carve those out at the outset, rather than at the end of the case?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Nager. Mr. Stewart.",
  "I don't -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt your answer.",
  "So under your -- following of your paper case, are you saying that if the teams delegated to the commissioner the authority to decide whether we are going to enter -- whether the league is going to enter into one contract on logo products or let each team decide, that would be all right?",
  "Well, why isn't the decision to order paper from one company rather than another subject to section 1 challenge?",
  "Why is that? I mean, if I'm Office Depot and I'm selling paper to the -- to the Giants -- or does this only apply to the commissioner's office?",
  "No, no, no, no, because they are not part of the broader concerted entity. There's no separate -- you’re saying, well, just because all 32 teams can act as -- as an individual entity, any group of those teams can act as an individual entity.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Levy.",
  "Well, but if it's a plausibility standard at the threshold inquiry, there’s a range of things, and I guess your -- your friend on the other side is just saying selling logos is closer to selling houses than it is to playing football.",
  "So if there’s a factual -- if there’s a factual dispute about whether a particular activity of the league is designed to promote the game or is designed simply to make more money, than that is the sort of thing that goes to trial?",
  "Or do something else, do something other than promote the game?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Nager, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "What's the answer to the -- what's the answer to the hypothetical Mr. Levy ended with, the law firm?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument next this morning in Case 08-1214, Granite Rock Company v. the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Mr. Mathiason.",
  "It's a tort action, right?",
  "I suppose -- grounded in contract. I suppose the existence of a contract is an evidentiary matter that you have to establish, but the cause of action is still tort, and of course 301(a) is limited to violations of contracts.",
  "I don't see how somebody who is not a party to the contract can violate the contract. They can be liable for all sorts of things, but I don't see that they can be liable for violating the contract.",
  "I suppose you can have tortious interference with the contract. Can you, without the -- establishing the existence of a contract?",
  "Yes, I suppose that’s --",
  "-- tortious interference with -- what is it, the ability to enter into a contract, I think, is recognized in some jurisdictions.",
  "I suppose it's a question for your friends on the other side whether they think the ratification or the contract that was entered into in December that’s effective in May -- if that makes them liable for violating the no-strike clause, right?",
  "So what happens if it's ratified retroactively? Is the no-strike clause in effect?",
  "You want to say yes, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bonsall.",
  "So, if there was a contract beginning May 22nd, then that included the no-strike clause?",
  "So -- so you don't think -- I guess this is following up on Justice Alito's question. You don't think it included the no­ strike clause --",
  "-- for -- that would apply to July 2nd?",
  "Well, if it doesn't -- I'm sorry to interrupt you. But if it doesn't include the no-strike clause and the question is whether the July 2nd one does, all this talk about the December agreement being retroactive to May is really kind of beside the point.",
  "Well -- I'm sorry, but that's the central issue. Your friend says no, we had a contract on July 2nd, and that's for the court to determine, not the arbitrator, because it's a question of formation.",
  "And what do you expect the arbitrator to do? The arbitrator -- since you agree that there’s a contract in effect --",
  "-- the arbitrator is not going to decide whether the contract is there or not.",
  "And the contract has a no-strike clause.",
  "So you expect the arbitrator to say you get the benefit of the contract that lets me decide something, and even though there’s a no-strike clause in the contract, you want the arbitrator to say that no-strike clause is not operative on July 2nd?",
  "Even though -- I'm sorry to interrupt you. But even though the later agreement was that it would be retroactive?",
  "Is that an issue for the arbitrator? Now that we know there was an agreement on July 2nd, is the question whether the strike continued or not for the arbitrator?",
  "Well, you say there was no strike, and I -- I thought the other side said there was.",
  "Right.",
  "Right, but their position is that there was a contract on July 2nd that included a no-strike clause --",
  "-- that you violated.",
  "Okay. And your answer is, one, that there is no contract, right?",
  "Oh, sure.",
  "And that -- and that position depends upon your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, that you are severing arbitration and the no-strike obligation?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Nussbaum.",
  "Not against the international?",
  "Counsel, I'd like your broader perspective as a representative of the international, because I think it's an important issue of labor policy. If I think that the cause of actions available under 301(a) and the pre-emptive effect of 301(a) ought to be coextensive, which -- which do you prefer, a broader 301(a) or a narrower pre-emption? I think it makes a difference.",
  "I think 301 -- I think whatever -- I don't think there should be a no­ man's land between you can bring your action under 301 and it's pre-empted by 301. In other words, if -- if you are right, that they cannot bring a tortious interference action under 301, I don't think it should be pre-empted. If you are wrong and they can bring it, then I can understand that it should be pre-empted.",
  "So it was pre-empted by 301, and they cannot bring it under 301?",
  "Right.",
  "And so if Granite Rock brought this claim in State court, you would say it's pre-empted by 301?",
  "And then, if they turned around and brought it in Federal court under 301, you would say, no, there is no cause of action under 301?",
  "Okay.",
  "So it is in a no­ man's land. Their claim for tortious interference with contract just can't be brought anywhere?",
  "They could always go to the NLRB --",
  "In State court or in Federal court?",
  "But you bring it in Federal court?",
  "What would the make­ whole -- I gather a cease-and-desist wouldn’t make any sense because this is over, but what would the make­ whole remedy entail?",
  "Well, but that applies in 301. They’re not touching the contract. They’re not touching the parties to the contract. This is outside the contract. So why should it be pre-empted?",
  "I understand that.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Mathiason, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "I'm sorry. Where is that again? Footnote 18?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-240, Mac's Shell Service v. Shell Oil Products, and the consolidated case. Mr. Lamken.",
  "Well, but all -- under one view, all the dealer is doing is mitigating damages. In other words, the deal is off. He's in effect been terminated. You're saying, well then, he has to pack up and leave. He can stay and still reduce the damages you are going to have to pay.",
  "Well, but there --",
  "Well, you've lost the rights to operate at a particular level. In other words, if they say -- I don't know how the deal works, but, you know, you've got to charge $10 a gallon or, you know, you've got to close the convenient mart or whatever, you have lost the right to operate at that. The terms of the lease under which you were operating have been effectively terminated. That doesn't mean you can't still make money, and it doesn't mean you have to give that up, but --",
  "-- but the deal has been terminated.",
  "What did Williston say about it? Contract --",
  "What does Williston say about it?",
  "Well, you -- you put forth this dichotomy between breach of contract and constructive termination. I don't know why something can't be both.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. O'Neil.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Farraher.",
  "It's a million dollars, right? That's the difference. You get attorneys’ fees and expert fees in the Federal action, and presumably you don't in the State action.",
  "Well, you have the option, right? If you accept the idea that there’s a constructive termination under your view, even if you don't leave, I guess you have the option to stay in business or to leave at any time.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lamken, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. So the case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1402, Berghuis v. Smith. Mr. Restuccia.",
  "I guess the point is, just following up, it's not that you’re going to say 2 plus 2 is 6. I suppose, under AEDPA, all you have to do is say 2 plus 2 is somewhere between 3 and 5, right?",
  "Well, it does depend, doesn't it, on the size of the -- the urn? In other words, if it's a smaller --",
  "If it's 10,000 of these balls and you are going to go through it 10,000 times, it's more likely that you are going to get a sample that reflects the overall percentage, correct?",
  "I'm sorry. That -- I'm confused.",
  "I thought it was the other way around. I thought Grand Rapids gave however many -- you know, 30 percent to the pool and then took Grand Rapids people back?",
  "So -- so do we have any evidence in the record that -- I gather this whole claim depends upon Grand Rapids having more need for jurors per capita than anywhere else?",
  "So do we have any evidence in the record that that’s the case?",
  "I would suppose that’s something we can find out pretty easily, right? I mean, you look and see how many jurors are pulled for -- how many jurors Grand Rapids needs in a particular period --",
  "-- compare it to how many jurors Rockland needs.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lawrence.",
  "If you had a community with one African-American, your argument would be the same, if that's the disparity? That means every -- every minority is left off the jury.",
  "I guess I'm -- I guess I’m echoing Justice Stevens’s question of whether or not this type of statistical analysis really works when you’re dealing with relatively small numbers.",
  "Do I understand your siphoning theory to depend upon Grand Rapids drawing a disproportionate number of jurors from the pool?",
  "That results in fewer minorities going up to the county court, right?",
  "Removed from the county --",
  "Where -- where in the record is it established that Grand Rapids had a disproportionate need for jurors from the pool?",
  "Well, if it's -- if your theory depends upon Grand Rapids drawing a disproportionate number and it is not in the record that Grand Rapids drew a disproportionate number, I think that means you lose.",
  "Of course. Of course, but we have to look at this on a proportional basis, right? Grand Rapids is also sending a higher number of jurors to the pool than -- than the small rural county.",
  "Your -- your theory depends upon Grand Rapids drawing not just a proportional number, if it's contributing 30 percent and it draws 30 percent; your theory depends upon Grand Rapids contributing 30 percent to the pool and drawing 40 percent.",
  "How is that? Don't those people then have to become professional jurors? They have to serve on every jury, or you’re going to have the disproportion that the statistics show.",
  "Your answer to Justice Scalia's question is -- is no, right? Because the idea is, if Grand Rapids sends up a pool that’s 30 percent minority and if it takes back the same number as everybody else, it's going to get -- the county is going to get the same proportion. It's only when they take back more. They have the more heavily African-American pool, and they are going to draw from it more than everybody else is drawing from theirs, so there will be fewer African- Americans to go to the county.",
  "But you have no evidence that Grand Rapids takes back more than its share, proportionally, than anybody else.",
  "At the county level?",
  "Yes. Was there any evidence that your venire -- that minorities were underrepresented on your venire?",
  "Where is that in the record?",
  "Help me --",
  "Help me -- help me with the math. If there were one more African- American, what would the percentage be? Pretty close to what you’re saying it should be, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Restuccia, you have 2 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument next this morning in Case Number 08-810, Conkright v. Frommert. Mr. Long.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Long. Mr. Stris.",
  "Counsel, if I could switch to the deference point. Let's say you have an administrator who says I interpret this particular provision to mean A; and he says but, if that's rejected, there are these other provisions that should be read to mean B. That goes up; the court -- the rejects A. Does the administrator get deference on his reading of the other provisions B?",
  "No, but I think it's kind of odd to say to the administrator: Look, if you want discretion, you should make as many rulings as you can possibly think of because then you’ll get discretion as to each of them. But if you only do what’s efficient and say here's how I read it, then you don't get any discretion at all on the other provisions.",
  "So you’re saying it's not just that they abused their discretion; they're discretion abusers? You can't trust them on the next provision?",
  "We do that with the district court. We get a district court, and we use all of these pejorative terms -- “abuse of discretion,” “arbitrary and capricious,” “clear error” -- and we send it back for them to do the same -- you know, they make -­",
  "They're the fact finder. Here, the plan administrator is the primary interpreter.",
  "I'm sorry. What's the relevant principle? Isn't it what the lump sum was that he took out?",
  "Well, they chose to take it out of that plan, right?",
  "Well, since that’s a fairly stark disagreement among counsel on a factual matter, where in the record do you see 5 years?",
  "It put in the words \"phantom account\"?",
  "But defer doesn't mean uphold in every circumstance, does it?",
  "Okay, well, then I don't think it's proper to say they can choose not to defer. They can defer and -- and choose to find it's still an abuse of discretion.",
  "Just so I understand, there are two different views. One is we are going to listen to you, and we may not agree with you. And the other is we’re not even going to listen to you. And you are arguing for the second rule. You think the proper way to approach this is saying we don't care, plan administrator, what you think.",
  "Well, sure.",
  "Right.",
  "They don't even need to accept a brief from the plan administrator --",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Roberts.",
  "What about the hypothetical I asked your friend? You know, this is how we read the provision, reading A, and we recognize there’s some ambiguity there, and if a court disagrees with it, our -- our second reading is -- is B.",
  "No deference on B?",
  "Does that make sense? I mean, don't you want the administrators to give you their best -- best understanding?",
  "Yes, they can --",
  "They can -- they can take it to the extreme. But if it looks like a good faith effort, to say -- you know, it's tough to interpret and administer these plans, and they say, this is what we think it means, but we’re human; maybe we made a mistake. And this is --",
  "So one strike and you’re out?",
  "I mean, that's assuming, it seems to me -- it makes sense if there’s bad faith.",
  "I mean, you make fallback arguments. You’re here and say this is how we read this, but if you don't agree with it, this is how we read it.",
  "So if --",
  "So you disagree with Mr. Stris. Do you think the district court should listen to what the plan administrator has to say?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Mr. Long, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1322, Astrue v. Ratliff. Mr. Yang.",
  "So how can the court's broad equitable authority trump what you say is what the statute says?",
  "Do you actually have to transfer it or --",
  "I mean, the statute says pay the prevailing party.",
  "And you’re saying the court can say: No, pay the lawyer.",
  "In certain --",
  "What if the client is bankrupt? What happens then?",
  "Well, but that's a fanciful answer, because EAJA requires that the government's position, to get fees, is substantially unjustified. And so the government lawyer is going to sit down and say, well, you know, if I take a position that is substantially unjustified, I will at that point pay the fees to you, not to the client.",
  "Yes, but the attorney's interest -- I thought in the hypothetical we were talking about, the attorney's interest is. He thinks the government is going to take a substantially unjustified position, and he wants to make sure in that case that he gets paid.",
  "Well, that's going to look awful bad to a court that comes in and he's -- and the court is asked to award EAJA fees, and there is an agreement already in effect. The government says, well, if we’re -- you know, if we’re liable for EAJA fees, this is how we are going to handle it.",
  "That would be the first piece of -- that would be the first piece of evidence that I would want to put in saying I should get EAJA fees. The government thought they might even take a position that qualified.",
  "No, but say he goes in to the government and says, look, I’m about to sue you, and I’d like to sit down and negotiate a nice agreement about the repayment.",
  "Government lawyers are always sympathetic to people who come in and say: I'm going to sue you.",
  "The government zeroes out, but in the course of it, it has taken a legal position in court against a small business that was substantially unjustified.",
  "But I think the idea -- well --",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Leach.",
  "The prevailing party gets the benefit in the sense that she is relieved of the debt she owed to the government. That's a real benefit.",
  "Well, let me -- can trusts -- can trusts recover EAJA fees?",
  "Yes, I don't either. I’m looking at the definition. It doesn't say \"trust.\" It says a lot of other things, like corporation, association, unit of government. I just don't --",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Yang, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Counsel, do you -- do you dispute your friend's statement that 42 percent of the time in Social Security cases the government's position is unjustified, and 70 percent of the time in Veterans cases?",
  "So whenever it really makes a difference --",
  "-- 70 percent of the time the government's position is substantially unjustified?",
  "What number would you accept?",
  "Well, that's really startling, isn't it? In litigating with veterans, the government more often than not takes a position that is substantially unjustified?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument next in Case 08-974, Lewis v. The City of Chicago. Mr. Payton.",
  "So under your position, say the City adopts a discriminatory -- takes a -- issues a discriminatory test; people take it; they come out with the results; the City says these -- this is the test we’re going to use, but, you know, we don't have any vacancies. Nobody can sue at that point.",
  "But that -- each -- each qualified firefighter who did not get a job because the well-qualified one did has a new cause of action, I guess, every time somebody is hired from the -- the well-qualified pool?",
  "In other words, somebody is hired, that constitutes discrimination against the qualified black firefighter who was not hired, and then another -- then somebody else is hired -- each time it's a new cause of action?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, so they would have a new cause of action, sure.",
  "Now, but they -- but if 300 days go from the first round of hiring, they don't -- they cannot sort of piggyback that onto a later cause of action.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal.",
  "So you get --",
  "So everybody gets 132 over 6,000 times whatever the number of people who would have been hired?",
  "I mean the pay for the number of people.",
  "So I suppose the benefit is not that the City knows it's safe -- it can rely on a test and all that -- but knows that it only has to pay 300 days back.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Solomon.",
  "You force people to challenge the practice when they don't even know if it's going to affect them. In the hypothetical that has been discussed, somebody who didn't graduate from high school, you know, wants to be something other than a firefighter. But that doesn't work out, and then he says, well, now I want to be a firefighter. And they say, well, you can't, because you didn't graduate from high school.",
  "And I think your position is that, well, he should have filed that suit earlier, no?",
  "Well, but what is the unlawful practice?",
  "Just to follow up on Justice Alito's question, what if it were different? What if the letter said, look, you didn't get, you’re not well qualified, but we really do expect to hire a lot more, so, you know, keep your fingers crossed. There’s a good chance that you are going to be hired. And you say those people should have sued right then?",
  "Well, that's kind of a bad policy, isn't it? You’re telling people who may probably not be injured at all -- you are saying, well, you still have to go into Federal court and sue.",
  "Oh, sure. No, I understand that, but, you know, let's say we think we are going to hire -- if the budget plan goes through, we think we’re going to hire everybody else by -- in 4 months. And you’re saying, well, those people have to sue anyway because they are injured by the 4-month delay.",
  "Yes.",
  "You've got to -- I mean, you’ve just got to take your -- get as good legal advice as you can and determine is it -- are we going to be in more trouble if we follow the test or more trouble if we -- if we take it down? People have to do that all the time. They look -- well, if I do this, I'm going to be in trouble; if I do this, I'm going to -- but I have got to decide what I should do.",
  "Well, I'm sorry. Read in conjunction with the 300 -- you have got to finish that sentence at least, before --",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Payton, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1498, Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project and the cross-petition. Mr. Cole.",
  "What if it goes to the mere existence of a group? Let's say you have the Nazi Party, and you are talking about advice or speech on some purely mundane issue. The Nazis have a hospital, and you are giving them advice on how to run a hospital, but the government decides that anything that legitimizes the Nazi Party, you know, promotes that group's terrorist activities. Can the government make that kind of determination? I'm thinking of something like Regan v. Wald --",
  "-- where they say, look, you can't travel to Cuba because we don't want to do anything that legitimizes the regime.",
  "No, I meant during World War II.",
  "I’m just trying to find an example that doesn't implicate the particulars of the issue today.",
  "No, I didn't -- my hypothetical was confusing. I didn't mean to suggest we were at war.",
  "I meant to hypothesize a group that the government could reasonably determine should not be supported in any way --",
  "-- because it legitimizes it. It's going to make their hospital run better. People are going to like their hospital. So the party, the group, will be legitimized.",
  "Well, you've picked -- you've picked hypotheticals that are very easy for you. What about personnel? Is there a connection between providing personnel that participate in legal activity on behalf of a terrorist organization, and the organization can then say, well, because you are providing this personnel, we can take them out and shift them to bombmaking?",
  "Well, one of the things that’s being prohibited here that you challenge is providing personnel.",
  "Well, is your argument limited to personnel that engages in speech, or does it cover personnel that -- a nurse at one of the -- if there are any, Hamas hospitals?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cole. General Kagan.",
  "General, you've talked about -- there has been a lot of discussion about the legitimate activities allowing -- facilitating illegitimate activities by freeing up personnel and all that, and legitimizing the group. Is that an argument you've made before this Court or below? I looked at your briefs, and I thought it's almost all about: This is O'Brien, this is conduct, this is not speech. I didn't see the argument that we've spent a lot of time talking about, which is the legitimate activities allow the illegitimate activities to take place.",
  "Do you have -- I don't mean to -- do you have particular references to where in your brief you made the argument?",
  "Yes, I know. It seems to me your case is all about O'Brien. I'm not sure you have an answer to whether or not strict scrutiny is satisfied. If we disagree with you and think that some of this activity is speech, I don't see the argument that you've presented on strict scrutiny.",
  "I'm sorry. You can communicate on -- I don't mean to interrupt. But you can communicate on your own, but you can't communicate with them?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "Well, but that’s -- I'm not -- I'm not sure that's right. I mean, expert advice or assistance -- I don't know sitting down that I could tell, you know, how to advocate for peaceful, you know, resolution or whatever. Is that expert advice? Is that specialized knowledge? And I understand training, service, personnel, but that one's a little hard to --",
  "No, my -- my point is that this --",
  "Yes. My point is that even knowing what they intend to do, it's kind of hard to decide whether that's based on specialized knowledge or not.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Cole, we’ll give you 5 minutes.",
  "Well, why don't -- why don't we remand it to the lower courts to apply strict scrutiny if we agree with you that O'Brien doesn't apply here?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument next in Case 08-1569, United States v. O'Brien. Mr. Horwich.",
  "Counsel -- counsel, I think you had said you had three responses to Justice Ginsburg --",
  "-- and only got one out.",
  "All right. Number two?",
  "Those are all -- all three of those are -- are pretty subtle ways for Congress to change the view in Castillo.",
  "Moving something from the body of the paragraph to a separate section and so on.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Fisher.",
  "I'm sorry. Could otherwise receive under what? The sentence -- you say 7 years is a sentence he could otherwise receive.",
  "Yes, but we know that's a sentencing factor.",
  "Well, the Court's -- the Court's opinion in Castillo quite carefully noted that it wasn't addressing this statute. I think it's a little bit of a bait-and-switch to say that, well, Castillo decides this case.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fisher. Mr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1301, Carr v. United States. Mr. Rothfeld.",
  "Is that -- that's pretty unusual, isn't it, to have Congress say it's up to the Attorney General whether their laws apply prospectively or retroactively or --",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Gannon.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Carr, was in violation of the law the instant it was passed, right?",
  "What's -- an obvious question. What’s the government's view on what a reasonable time is?",
  "So -- but the reasonable time question doesn't come up in your -- in your hypothetical.",
  "First because he's in the hospital and he has got a defense there, so --",
  "But no -- but as far as a reasonable time goes, nobody's literally incapable of doing it the same day the law passed.",
  "Unless they meet one of the other exceptions.",
  "What -- what do you do with Mr. Rothfeld's hypothetical about someone who travels in interstate commerce as a young child and, 20 years later, is covered by SORNA?",
  "I'm sorry. I'm not -- I'm missing your answer to my question. The answer to the child traveling and then 20 years later is --",
  "-- is because it's -- you have to require under SORNA before the travel?",
  "So your answer to Justice Scalia is that you don't get it from the language? You get it from the anomaly; you get it from the purpose.",
  "I tried to --",
  "I tried to find one and -- and couldn't. I mean, looking up travels in -- in the Code, and in each of those cases that I found it's always -- it looks like it's -- it's linked directly to the activity that's meant to be covered, you know, traveling for the purpose of the -- the activity that's against the law.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "No, you don't have to -- you don't have to do that. I guess my problem with your argument -- you say, \"is required to register under SORNA.\" But you can be required to register under SORNA before SORNA is enacted to the extent that SORNA is retroactive. You ask someone: Why are you registering? Well, SORNA tells me I -- I have to.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument next in Case 08-1341, United States v. Marcus. Mr. Miller.",

  "We’ll hear argument next today in Case 08-1394, Skilling v. United States. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "Because you think --",
  "-- they’re going to lie, right?",
  "Because you think they're going to lie?",
  "When they fill out the form and say this is what I've heard, and this -- I can fairly evaluate the law and the arguments?",
  "Counsel, can I -- perhaps it's time for you to shift gears, if I could --",
  "-- and move to the statutory question.",
  "I don't understand why it's difficult. The statute prohibits “scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.” Skilling owed the Enron shareholders honest services. He acted dishonestly in a way that harmed them. But I don't understand the difficulty.",
  "No, there has to be -- there has to be a right to honesty. In other words, it's not just in the abstract. And the shareholders had a right to his honest services.",
  "I'm sorry. A disclosed interest?",
  "What you've just explained is why you think the statute is very broad. You haven't explained why it's vague.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "It took many days after it had been transferred.",
  "It was very -- the atmosphere in Oklahoma City was very different from that anywhere else, in terms of the impact of the bombing on that particular community.",
  "Oh, no, no. No. They’d go to the statute that says honest services --",
  "Right. It seems -- it seems -- I'm being flip. It seems that that's where you would focus your attention, if you think your community has essentially been fleeced by somebody because of his dishonesty.",
  "But if -- if you’re going to say that the statute refers to a term of art, the whole point of a term of art is that it’s a shorthand for defining something. And then -- but if you’re saying that it's a term of art that means the pre-McNally case law over the -- you know, all the different circuits and the district courts and that some knowledge of that, it -- it's descriptive of something, but it's not a term of art.",
  "No, I'm with you there. But then the kinds of cases -- that's where it gets fuzzy. I mean, you need lawyers and research before you get an idea of what the pre-McNally state of law was with respect to intangible -- the right to intangible services, of honest services. And I’m just wondering how clear does what that body of law is have to be before you can say, you know what, when we tell you that right, you know that that's what it's referring to?",
  "It kind of -- it puts the prospective defendant, I guess, in an awfully difficult position, though, if he has got to wait. There’s this common law evolution over time. You have two cases the government wins, one it loses, three -- and he's supposed to keep track of that. That doesn't sound like fair notice of what's criminal.",
  "So that covers the case that your friend put of the employee using the computer for personal use? That fits under this instruction?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Well, but it's -- it’s a different model of it. As Mr. Dreeben was explaining, if you have an experienced judge who goes through this all the time, I think it's reasonable for him to say: Look, bring the person in front of me. We’ve got a questionnaire. I can identify the problems, look him in the eye, and I’ve got a lot of experience picking a jury, and it's better to let me do it than to have the lawyers have 3 weeks to do it.",

  "The question --",
  "The question, of course, is not whether we think 2 and a quarter hours under all the circumstances is -- is too long under our precedent. The question is, instead, whether it would be unreasonable for the State court to determine otherwise.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Saharsky. Ms. Jacobs.",
  "What happens when you read Butler?",
  "Well, we have it to the extent that he was told he had right to remain silent and he didn't say, I'm not going to talk to you.",
  "Is it there any clearly established law the other way, which is the pertinent question?",
  "We’re not talking -- we’re not talking about the Fifth Amendment right. We’re talking about the Miranda warnings. There’s no issue of voluntariness in this case. Right?",
  "There’s no suggestion that there’s -- that the statements are not voluntary. The suggestion is that they may have violated Miranda.",
  "What if he said, do you want to remain silent?",
  "And he doesn't answer either one.",
  "You say you don't have to invoke your rights, but Butler also says that you can impliedly waive them. You don't have to expressly waive them.",
  "Right. So the question under AEDPA -- you agree there can be an implied waiver; that's what Butler says, right? So the question under AEDPA is whether the State court was unreasonable to determine that there was an implied waiver on these facts?",
  "Yes.",
  "Maybe.",
  "Right.",
  "What are those?",
  "And all he has to do is say: I don't want to talk to you. It's over.",
  "I don't understand how they create the ambiguity.",
  "Well, I guess this gets back to a question I had earlier. I thought there was no dispute on this record that there was no involuntariness. We are talking about a violation of the technical, important but formal, Miranda requirements. This is not a case where the person says: My statements were involuntary.",
  "But that's correct -- and that's where -- how I read Butler; you have to look at the circumstances. And you’re saying no, you don't look at any circumstances; they have got to ask the question and he has to waive.",
  "The other circumstances are irrelevant. Well then, if yes, why are you talking to me about 2 hours 15 minutes, what they are doing? You say that circumstances don't matter.",
  "That issue is not in this case, though.",
  "As I understand it, you've lost at every stage on the voluntariness and have not renewed that, correct? This is a Miranda case; it's not a Fifth Amendment case.",
  "One? I mean, that's -- I don't want to piggyback off Justice Kennedy's point, but that's the whole point, is you do not look at any of those circumstances, you say. Before they can say anything more, they have to get a waiver. So it's 30 seconds if they go on, before they -- if they sit there for how long before -- how long do they have to ask, do you want to waive?",
  "Could -- could you describe a situation where you think there would be an implied waiver?",
  "Well, I thought that -- that doesn't sound implied. That sounds express to me.",
  "So, is --",
  "Okay. So what -- what is an implied waiver case?",
  "Well, that's right. Now, getting back to Ms. Saharsky's point, she said if you prevail, you have to overrule Butler. And it seems to me that that's the point we're at.",
  "So, there's -- so, there's no implied waiver with respect to the right to remain silent?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Restuccia, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument next in Case 09-5327, Holland v. Florida. Mr. Scher.",
  "Is this case different if the filing error -- I understand there was a lot going on, but if the lawyer just miscalculated the days and was off by one day, this case comes out the other way in your view, right?",
  "I guess I understand what the cases have said. I -- I have trouble understanding why that should make a difference, why that should be so pertinent, why he should be in better shape than somebody who says: Look, I don't know anything about this. I need a good lawyer. This is what I get. I'm trusting you. Tell me what I should do, and I leave it in your hands. And that person is in somehow worse shape?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Makar.",
  "Counsel, I'm concerned about some of the situations Justice Breyer mentions, you know, if there is an earthquake, a plane crash, but the law seems to be focusing on other things when it's talking about extraordinary circumstances. Like here, we’re talking about how diligent he was in pursuing his lawyer. There seems to be a disconnect there. I don't know why -- I mean, assuming we’re going to have, for argument, equitable tolling, what should we be looking at? The unusual nature of the situation that comes up, or whether you've got a pesky client?",
  "Well, but it legislated against the background of cases like Irwin that stated the general proposition is, unless Congress says otherwise, there is equitable tolling.",
  "You're not -- you're not worried about Justice Breyer's case of the really extraordinary circumstance where everybody would say, well, that's -- you know, we understand. You’re worried that if you create an exception, that all sorts of other stuff will come in. And so why isn't the answer to that concern that you’ve got an unusual case here where you do have the client saying, do this, do this, do this, and the lawyer doesn't?",
  "It's very hard to argue against -- against equity, against equitable tolling. But at the same time, I think you do need a constraining principle that it doesn't do away with the statute of limitations. So why isn't what we have here good enough?",
  "Meaning the fact that you have got a client who is constantly telling the lawyer, do this, you know, get it done; doesn't get the judgment. And, you know, it's not just your run-of-the-mill case where the lawyer happens to miss a deadline.",
  "What -- why isn't it extreme attorney incompetence to miss a deadline? I mean, you either miss it or you don't. It's not going to get -- why doesn't that qualify as extreme attorney misconduct?",
  "I mean, give me an example.",
  "That's worse than missing the deadline.",
  "Well, we don’t -- that's not negligence.",
  "So you’re -- it has to be criminal behavior?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Scher, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "If I’m worried --",
  "If I’m worried about the open-ended nature of what you’re asking for, how -- how would you state the test you would like in the most restrictive terms?",
  "Hurricane or kidnapping?",
  "Oh, the different one.",
  "What type -- the problem comes up when you say “this type of attorney negligence.” What is your test? What type of --",
  "No, I know your test will mean your client wins.",
  "But, I mean, can you articulate it more -- because I’m very concerned that if you start saying, well, you can forgive an inequitable case, every time a case comes up, you’re going to -- there’s going to be sympathy for the client. The lawyer goofed. Of course, you don't want to penalize the client, but Congress obviously had something more in mind.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1521, McDonald v. The City of Chicago. Mr. Gura.",
  "Of course, this argument is contrary to the Slaughter-House Cases, which have been the law for 140 years. It might be simpler, but it's a big -- it's a heavy burden for you to carry to suggest that we ought to overrule that decision.",
  "In -- in that context, is your position that the rights that are incorporated as essential to the concept of ordered liberty, do they bring all of our decisions with them? When you say the First Amendment is covered, does that mean New York Times v. Sullivan is incorporated as well? Or is it only some lesser version of the incorporated right?",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement.",
  "That still allows scope, once you determine that the right is incorporated, for recognizing that the States might have broader interests that the Federal Government doesn't have. But I would suppose that would come up in the application of the right, rather than in an effort to determine whether parts of it are incorporated or not.",
  "You can respond if you want, briefly.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Feldman.",
  "Well, I think that's exactly -- that's exactly right. And that is what the Court elaborated on in Duncan. I do think the focus is our system of ordered liberty, not any abstract system of ordered liberty. You can say Japan is a free country, but it doesn't have the right to trial by -- by jury. The -- the concept only makes sense, I think, if you limit it to our system. Under our system, as you said, the -- the right to a jury is essential.",
  "Well, if you think that's right, why wouldn't you think, for all the reasons given in Heller, that the Second Amendment right is essential to our system, whatever it may be with respect to France or England or anywhere else?",
  "I don't see how you can read --",
  "I don't see how you can read Heller and not take away from it the notion that the Second Amendment, whether you’d want to label it fundamental or not, was extremely important to the framers in their view of what liberty meant.",
  "Well, sure, and it's still going to be subject to the political process if the Court determines that it’s incorporated in the Due Process Clause. All the arguments you make against incorporation, it seems to me, are arguments you should make in favor of regulation under the Second Amendment. We haven't said anything about what the content of the Second Amendment is beyond what was said in Heller.",
  "And so the argument you make is, well, given this context, you should not be able to have concealed carry. Well, maybe that's right, but that doesn't mean you don't incorporate the Second Amendment to allow you to enforce that type of regulation.",
  "That sounds an awful lot to me like the argument we heard in Heller on the losing side.",
  "Well, to get back to Justice Breyer's point, which I'm not sure you answered, is your theory that you simply -- it's not a question of is it in or is it out? But you’re saying, well, what is in and what is out, are you?",
  "So you think it's in or out, right?",
  "No, I -- I know your reasons.",
  "I'm trying to get you to take a position on whether or not you want us to not only pick and choose among which amendments are part of our abstract notion of ordered liberty, or if you want us also to take amendments that might be in and refine them and shave them off a little bit and say, well, this part of the amendment is in, and this part isn't.",
  "Okay. So your argument is all in or all out.",
  "Okay.",
  "That's how you think Madison went about his job?",
  "I'm asking counsel. Do you think that's how Madison went about his job?",
  "Well, all those may be perfectly valid today, or -- if the Court incorporates the Second Amendment. Incorporation doesn't say anything by itself about whether those types of regulations, which you think are reasonable and your friends think may not be reasonable, are valid or not.",
  "I'm sorry. Is it the position of the City of Chicago that we should rely on Justice Harlan's dissent in Griswold?",
  "Well, then your answer to Justice Stevens is no, you’re not going to follow that approach, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gura, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Your approach -- your original approach would give judges a lot more power and flexibility in determining what rights they think are a good idea than they have now with the constraints of the Due Process Clause.",
  "Privileges and immunities give you a lot more flexibility than due process, because it’s not limited to procedural -- where you don't have to deal with the hurdle that it's limited to procedural by the text.",
  "Yes, you may.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "Well, counsel, we're still here.",
  "And we’ll hear argument in Case 08-1529, Hui v. Castaneda. Ms. Goldenberg.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shah.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Shah. Mr. Doyle.",
  "Well, I would have thought it wouldn't apply as strongly because they would have been saying any action at a time when they knew that particular action existed.",
  "Oh, so you’re saying -- your response to Justice Stevens follows because you say they -- unless they say a Bivens action is excluded, it's not.",
  "You’re not abandoning it; you’re taking it further. You’re taking Carlson further. It doesn't have to be -- no?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Goldenberg, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument today in Case 08-1555, Samantar v. Yousuf. Mr. Dvoretzky.",
  "Well, I’ll jump on the hobby horse even if Justice Kennedy is jumping off. I mean, the -- the exception in the TVPA is to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state. That doesn't sound the way you would just establish a cause of action.",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett.",
  "But the state -- there is -- the distinction strikes me as artificial as well. We’re talking about insulating state acts. The only way a state can act is through people. And you’re saying: Well, the state is insulated, but the people who do the acts for the state are not. I don't see how that can -- can work.",
  "Oh, well, then -- but the whole point of the Act was to codify what was there before, and -- and it seems odd to say, well, they were codifying the immunity of the state, but not the immunity of the only way a state can act, which is through individuals.",
  "Ms. Millett, I thought --",
  "I thought the whole point of the FSIA was to get the Executive Branch out of the business of sending letters to the court every time a state was sued. The government requested it for that purpose. Now they are just back into it again if you say, well, you can just sue the individuals. And the government's position in this case confirms that. They're -- they tell us the way you should proceed is to look to the Executive Branch and, basically, we’ll send you a letter and let you know. So it seems to me the whole reason you have the FSIA is undermined by the position you’re taking today.",
  "Courts -- courts decide this sort of question all the time, whether you’re talking about principles of domestic immunity or even corporate liability: Is the employee on a frolic or is it a detour? Determining when an individual is acting for another entity as opposed to on -- on his own business, that's a very common inquiry.",
  "Your friend -- you friend --",
  "Your friend said it happens all the time. He cited the example of the Israeli embassy is always sending letters or showing up in court when their agents are -- are sued.",
  "Please.",
  "Finish your sentence.",
  "You made that a long sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Kneedler.",
  "I wonder -- I wonder if the example you give or the point you make, that there’s no functioning Somali Government, doesn't cut the other way. Let's assume you have somebody who was acting in an official capacity, doing what his job required, whether you like it or not, and then there’s a change in the Somali government; and the United States likes the new Somali government. That guy is kind of put out to -- to dry because he can't get anybody to say what he maintains is true, which was I was acting pursuant to official policy of the government.",
  "And the United States is not going to give him the letter he needs because they like the new Somali government.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Mr. Dvoretzky, because of that, we’ll give you 5 minutes.",
  "It's kind of hard -- I mean, I assume the reason you don't rely heavily on it -- because it says that an agency or instrumentality is an entity. I mean, we usually don't think of individuals as being entities.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-998, Hamilton, the Chapter 13 Trustee, v. Lanning. Mr. Hamilton.",
  "The review of the determination or the request to move the period is -- is what? Up to the total discretion of the -- of the judge?",
  "So your objection to the fact that the judge has more discretion with respect to defining \"projected disposable\" -- you don't mind the discretion on the other side.",
  "Right, but the only purpose of moving the time period is to change the income.",
  "Well, that's a good answer, isn't it, because your point would be the statute does not allow that exercise of discretion with respect to projected disposable income, but it does in the other areas.",
  "No, my -- my point and what I thought your point would be is that the fact that there is exercise of discretion in two different areas is not the problem. The problem is that in one area the discretion is specifically permitted and in the other area, projected disposable income, it's not.",
  "Where is that, by the way, the provision that allows it to move the 6-month period?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein.",
  "Why don't you follow his suggestion and just move the 6-month period, because the statute specifically grants that authority to the judge?",
  "Well, I think -- I think that's exactly right when you look at term \"projected disposable income.\"",
  "But if you look as \"disposable income\" -­",
  "-- as a defined term and then add \"projected,\" I think it's a different -­ different -- different argument, different kettle of fish. I mean, because particularly in a statute intended to restrict discretion, it's a way to do it. You look at it in the abstract, \"projected disposable income,\" it doesn't achieve that objective.",
  "What if you -- you wanted to achieve your friend's result and you had a definition of disposable income, and you wanted the court to -- you don't want to say project that forward, what -- what word would be more natural than saying projected?",
  "No, that's altering disposable income -- the definition of disposable income. I'm asking isn't the most natural word to achieve your friend's result to use projected. What other word would you say when you say this is the period you look at and you want to take it forward?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Harrington.",
  "It seems to me that, particularly since you are adopting a fairly broad -­ well, depending on how broad a theory you are adopting of what's projected and what's not, that you are taking into account a lot of things that are more properly taken into account when it comes to whether the plan should be confirmed or not.",
  "What's going to happen? What's the situation going to be? What should, you know, the creditors get? What should the debtor get? There is no reason to kind of shoehorn those into the projected disposable income.",
  "Well, is that -- I mean, let's say your friend wins up to the point and somebody else, when it gets to confirmation, can say: Well, look, you know, there was this big payout before the filing. So don't confirm it. We know she has got all this -- all this other money. That -- it could do it that way, couldn't it?",
  "Well, whatever the situation is, can't that be taken into account when it comes to confirmation?",
  "Well, the creditor has the option of objecting the confirmation of the plan.",
  "They can't say: I object because the 6-month period is unrepresentative because of this particular event?",
  "Does the government have a position on that?",
  "You can finish the sentence.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Harrington.",
  "Mr. Hamilton, you have two minutes remaining.",

  "One member of the full board can overturn a group delegation, in other words, and hear the initial decision?",
  "What if one board member wants to do that and four don't? What happens?",
  "One member wants to review the group's decision.",

  "So, counsel, if I -­",
  "No, go ahead; finish.",
  "Let -- let's say the board delegates to a group the authority to act as the board until December 31st, 2010. And on December 30th, 2010, the group delegates to itself because it's acting as the board the authority to act until December 31, 2011. Is that valid?",
  "All the powers of the board until December 31st.",
  "So a delegee can delegate to itself the full authority of the -- the master in the master -agent relationship?",
  "No, no; they are just -- you know, they make the distinction that the board should continue to function.",
  "Even though their original delegation was limited to 2010 -­",
  "-- they, acting as a board, get to delegate to themselves as the group the authority to go beyond that.",
  "Now, what if the board, consisting of five members -- let's say three Democrats and two Republicans -- the three Democrats delegate to a group the authority to act as a board. They designate themselves as the members of the group. They have at that point, authorized themselves to act as the board with as little as two members, even though they couldn't have done that as members of the board.",
  "Even though the whole -- even though the whole purpose of expanding from three to five was to ensure that more than two are required for the board to act?",
  "Not trying to, but succeeding in doing so.",
  "Well, I mean, it depends upon who would remove them for cause.",
  "Now, who would remove them?",
  "Well, what if he's perfectly content to have two Democrats?",
  "I just want to make sure there is nothing to constrain -- if you have three Democrats, three -- or two Republicans or, of course, the other way around, nothing to constrain them from acting fully as the board with only two -- two Democrats?",
  "In the statute.",
  "What actually happens on -- on the ground? Somebody complains about an unfair labor practice to the board, and let's say the petitioner prevails and the board can't function. What happens next? Is there -- I don't know if there would be a review or not, but can you go to the court of appeals?",
  "Yes, assume there is no board. As you say, the -- the problem that would happen if you don't prevail?",
  "And the recess appointment power doesn't work why?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Richie, you have 3 minutes remaining.",

  "Those are -- those are two different arguments, right; your rail carrier argument and your pre-1978 argument?",
  "Prior -- prior to 1978. If I think you lose on that question under the law as happens to be currently codified, but would prevail under the pre-1978 law, what -- what is your strongest case for the proposition that what I referred to earlier as the boilerplate language trumps the plain language of the currently codified version?",
  "It's kind of a difficult -- I mean, if you’re a shipper and you’re trying to figure out, okay, let's ship some goods, and you pick up the law and it says, well, this is what the law says, who's going to tell you that, well, that you may think that's what the law says, but you’re really governed by the pre-1978 law.",

  "If it weren't -- if it weren't for the -- for the track from Long Beach to Los Angeles, you would say then they’re not a rail carrier?",
  "Well, unless we hold, as your friends argue on the other side, that they can opt out under 10709.",
  "And that's a different question with respect to liability and claims and with respect to venue.",
  "Perhaps --",
  "Maybe now you could respond to my question about the distinction under 10502 between claims and liability and venue.",
  "Well, but it's a little -- I mean, the -- I’m looking at page 64a of the petition appendix, where they’re saying you can't exempt through contractual terms for liability and claims. Venue is treated elsewhere, separately from liability and claims. So, again, under -- you’re the plain language team, and that seems fairly plain that venue is not covered.",
  "No, the liability is not where you can bring your suit. Liability is liability. Venue is where you can bring your suit.",
  "Is that because they have contracted for them?",
  "Well, they don't own Union Pacific's rail line.",
  "So if I -- if I own a container being pulled by somebody else's train, I'm in the train business?",
  "No, it wouldn't. It would just -- it may just mean that they don't have the regulatory authority because that container is a rail carrier.",
  "What’s carrying it is the rail carrier. It's a container.",
  "Well, they -- they can't contract around liability for an event such as the one that happened here. Because they have to offer Carmack-compliant terms, and if the owner of the goods has the option of accepting those, they can't contract around that.",

  "But that's an issue that we look at all the time under AEDPA. That's not a new approach. AEDPA says, you know, if you show that a claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive, that was previously unavailable.

  "Okay. What other explanation is there for a note saying \"Are we being too loud,\" other than that there was some degree of acrimony on the jury?",
  "No, you don't dispute the fact that a note came out saying, Are we being too loud?",
  "Well, what would that indicate other than that there was some degree of acrimony?",
  "So you -- you do agree that there could be situations where a Federal court on direct review would find abuse of discretion, and yet a court on habeas under AEDPA would say that that has to stand?",
  "So there are a category of cases where a Federal court could look at it and say, that's an abuse of discretion, but that same court reviewing it under habeas would say you are not entitled to relief under AEDPA?",
  "How can you say that? I mean, you may think the discretion was abused, but it's not like he just suddenly announced there was going to be a mistrial. He exercised discretion. He looked at the note, he asked the question, he's -- are you hopelessly deadlocked? Are you going to be able to reach a unanimous verdict? And he was able to rely on the fact that they had previously sent out a note saying, are we being too loud, and the fact he knew, 4-1/2 hours on a case in which there were 10 hours of testimony. I mean, I understand your argument that he abused his discretion, but I don't understand the argument that he didn't exercise discretion at all.",
  "No, she asked the foreperson a question.",
  "Where did -- where did -- I'm sorry. Where did she conflate the two things you said she conflated, deadlocked and the other thing? What was it, inability to -­",
  "Well, but you got to read down further. She says: \"Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not?\" And the foreperson says \"No.\"",
  "Well, just -- with respect, it's not the very first sign of disagreement. Reasonably interpreting, a note saying \"Are we being too loud\" is a sign of disagreement. And there is another note that comes out: \"What happens if we can't agree?\" You are making it sound more precipitous than it was.",
  "Oh, no, no. I'm sorry.",
  "There is not a period on page 7 of the Petitioner's brief. Is that a mistake? There's a -­",
  "-- dash. And -- and could the court be concerned that the person was about to say, and again with deference to the court, \"The majority -- majority of us don't believe that\" -- that the defendant is guilty, that the defendant is innocent. Wasn't the judge quite correct to stop her right there?",
  "Isn't that exactly what she did? After that he says don't tell me what you are going to -- or don't tell me what you are going to say. I don't want to know what your verdict might be or how the split is or anything like that, are you going to reach a unanimous verdict? She did go on after that -­",
  "How -- how do you know she answered for herself? The judge was talking -­ she can't reach a unanimous verdict by herself. She is answering for the jury.",

  "We will hear argument next in case 09-5201, Barber v. Thomas, the Warden. Mr. Sady.",
  "I'm sure there is something wrong with this predicate to this question, but the -- the statute allows the Bureau to make a determination of good time credit within 15 days after the end of each year of the sentence.",
  "They cannot make that determination within 15 days of the 311 days. And so \"each year of the sentence\" must mean each -- the full year, the 365 days.",
  "You treat each year of the sentence as the 311 days if there has been good behavior, no?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall.",
  "How can he do that? I'm looking at page 14A of your appendix. It says: Such credit toward service of sentence vests at the time that it is received. Credit that is vested may not later be withdrawn.",

  "We’ll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-6338, Dillon v. United States. Ms. Freeland.",
  "What if the Sentencing Commission just issued a new guideline and said anyone with a -- a crack sentence, their sentence is going to be reduced by 10 percent? That wouldn't present any problems, would it?",
  "But there's no --",
  "But 3553(a) doesn't even come into play under my hypothetical.",
  "3553(a) doesn't even come into play, so there's not a resentencing by a judge. It is just an across-the-board policy, like increasing good time credits.",
  "Right, in -- in this case, but in my hypothetical Congress hasn't done that. It hasn't -- or the Sentencing Commission hasn't done that. They haven't invoked the discretionary sentencing. They just said: Across the board, 10 percent off.",
  "Only Booker?",
  "Only Booker? What if there is another constitutional objection to the sentence, and he goes back under -- under the crack cocaine? Can you say, oh, and, you know, also, it violated my rights under equal protection? You didn't notice that before, but here's the argument. Is that before the sentencing court?",
  "Yes, you would you have to say. So --",
  "So it's not only as unfair as Justice Ginsburg hypothesized. It's even more unfair than that, because just because of the crack cocaine change, somebody with an equal protection challenge gets to raise that. While somebody in prison without an equal -- with an equal protection challenge but not the crack cocaine one is still stuck.",
  "Well, that's a new constitutional rule. This is an old one. This is one that was -- you know, the equal protection clause has been in the books for a while. And -- and he -- he just gets the chance to raise it solely because of the fact that his conviction involved crack cocaine.",
  "Oh, no, no, no. I thought under your theory this is a whole new sentencing. So who cares whether he waived it at the first one? We’re starting from -- from point zero.",
  "And my point is that they shouldn't under your theory. The fact that he waived it at the earlier sentencing under your theory should not matter at all, because your theory is that this is a whole new sentencing, so who cares what went on in the prior sentencing?",
  "I'm sorry. Why --",
  "Why could they -- the first part of that, why could they not hold him for the term under the 1993 sentence?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Freeland. Ms. Kruger.",
  "I’m troubled by your response to Justice Kennedy's previous question, that the judge can take into account conduct in prison and all these other things. It does seem to open it up to other factors than the crack cocaine disparity, and once you’re looking at other factors, why not look at everything?",
  "But it -- it's also a factor that would -- might guide the district court to a decision not to reduce the sentence.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Kruger. Ms. Freeland, have you 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Three.",
  "You can answer Justice Breyer's question.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-6261, Robertson v. United States, ex rel. Watson. Ms. Frankfurt.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Long.",
  "Yes, but the argument is that because a private interested party can't bring it, the party is bringing it on behalf of the United States and his plea agreement therefore is with the United States.",
  "As representative of the sovereign?",
  "And nobody doubts -- I didn't think it was at issue that the United States, rather than operating through the Assistant U.S. Attorney, can appoint you to handle the prosecution.",
  "And that's what they don't dispute, right?",
  "I'm sorry, that's -­ they don't dispute that? That's the point you were trying to make?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, one way you can find it in the Constitution is that we have built a body of law about the obligation of people bringing prosecutions that wouldn't fit within your situation. For -- what are the Brady -- what's the Brady obligation of your client?",
  "What are the Brady obligations of your client?",
  "What -- what are the Brady obligations of your client?",
  "Well, unless you think it's a violation of due process for an interested party to be able to criminally prosecute someone at their -- at their discretion.",
  "Those are in every state?",
  "But can your private prosecutor, however you want to describe her, could she enter into a plea agreement with the defendant?",
  "No, she said you could be subject to you 180 days; I will agree, and you'll plead guilty to 30 days.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Kagan.",
  "That's -- that's absolutely startling. The different U.S. Attorneys all work for your boss, right? They work for the Attorney General. How can one part of the Attorney General agree to something that doesn't bind the other part of the Attorney General?",
  "I take your word for it.",
  "Maybe or maybe not, but surely it binds the New Jersey U.S. Attorney. If you -- just think about it. The -- the U.S. Attorney from the Southern District says: Look, you agree to go to jail for 10 years and I will drop these 3 charges. Done. Then the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey can come in and prosecute under those three charges?",
  "Well, how do you get -- I mean, you are a defendant. You have to go to all more than 50, all the U.S. Attorney's Offices and say, will you agree to this and get everybody to sign off?",
  "It can't do that. If the U.S. attorney in New Jersey has the authority to prosecute this, the U.S. Attorney in New York can't say, oh, and by the way I bind all the other U.S. Attorneys.",
  "Usually we have questions the other way.",
  "Counsel, could I ask you could a 1983 or I guess Bivens action be brought against Ms. Watson? The defendant, you know, it turns out he's not guilty and he thinks there was malice. Could he bring a Bivens action against her?",
  "She's a State actor. She's acting on behalf either of the United States or the District of Columbia. Therefore, she can be sued directly and be personally liable.",
  "Yes, briefly.",
  "Thank you, General. Ms. Frankfurt, you have 7 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-60, Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "Under the applicable State law, what’s required before the recidivist sentence is triggered? Is it a formal finding of recidivism by the -- by a jury?",
  "No, but the State prosecutors often prosecute when they have a recidivist provision under that, rather than the much more difficult illicit trafficking crime. I mean, if you’re going to go to jail for a certain amount of years for a recidivist possession, that's easier to show than illicit trafficking.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Saharsky. Mr. Srinivasan, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Make your second point short.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 08-1332, the City of Ontario v. Quon. Mr. Richland.",
  "The written policy?",
  "The whole -- the argument here, of course, is that that was modified by the instructions he got from the lieutenant. Do we follow the written policy or the policy they allegedly enforced in practice?",
  "Well, we are dealing with Mr. Quon's reasonable expectations, right?",
  "And even with the written policy, he has the instructions -- everybody agrees -- you can use this pager for private communications.",
  "We’re not going to audit them. Right? That's what he said. He has to pay for them. Right? Now, most things, if you're paying for them, they’re yours. And this -- it particularly covered messages off-duty. Now, can't you sort of put all those together and say that it would be reasonable for him to assume that private messages were his business? They said he can do it. They said, you’ve got to pay for it. He used it off duty. They said they’re not going to audit it.",
  "Let me ask you --",
  "Let me ask you to put the written policy aside. Hypothetical case: There’s no written policy. Would he have a reasonable expectation in the privacy of his personal e-mail, text messages, in that case?",
  "In other words, all we know is the list that I went through earlier.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, that’s the written policy.",
  "But the policy itself, from the point of view of Officer Quon, is a little bit more complicated than that.",
  "You would agree, I think, that if the SCA, the Stored Communications Act --",
  "If that made it illegal to disclose these e-mails, then he would certainly be correct that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy; isn't that right?",
  "It's not reasonable to assume that people are going to follow the law?",
  "Did your client treat on-duty text messages different from off-duty text messages?",
  "Why did it do that?",
  "Why did it treat them differently? Under your theory, they’re all the same -- no expectation of privacy.",
  "Well, why did -- I'm sorry. I still don't understand. It redacted them, right?",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, you don't have to look at the messages to determine that with respect to the off-duty messages, right?",
  "Certainly, counsel. Mr. Katyal.",
  "Your point that you made just a moment ago, that we don't want to freeze into place the constitutional requirements with respect to new technology, I wonder if it cuts the other way. We’re dealing with an amendment that looks to whether something is reasonable. And I think it might be the better course to say that the Constitution applies, but we’re going to be more flexible in determining what’s reasonable because they are dealing with evolving technology.",
  "Well, but that puts a lot of weight -- I mean, there are some things where we don't bind them. You know, you get the usual parking garage thing that has got all this small print on the back. We -- we don't say that you’re bound by that, because nobody reads it. But in here, I just don't know. I just don't know how you tell what’s reasonable -- I suspect it might change with how old people are and how comfortable they are with the technology -- when you have all these different -- different factors. You know, they’re told you can use it for private; you’ve got to pay for it. I think if I pay for it, it's mine, and it’s not the employer's.",
  "So, your -- your position would require people basically to have two of these things with them, two whatever they are, text messager or the BlackBerries or whatever, right? Because assuming they’re going to get personal things, you know, some emergency at home, they’re also going to get work things --",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dammeier.",
  "Maybe -- maybe everybody else knows this, but what is the difference between a pager and e-mail?",
  "You can do that with e-mails.",
  "The only reason -- the only reason the officer would not be accurate -- I mean, I don't understand why the redaction is such a bad idea. He just says these are private. And that allows -- and then you could look at everything else. You can see if he's going too far because then everything else would be there. But in terms of -- the jury found this was not done to find out what was in the messages, so they don't need to find out what’s in the messages. That's just a question. He has to pay for everything he -- he redacts.",
  "I mean, it's no different than the police coming in and saying, well, we’re going to look at, you know, what's in every drawer and then -- you know, then if it turns out to be personal and private, we won't -- you know, we won't -- it just happens that we came upon, I guess, is Justice Kennedy's point. It's kind of the plain view doctrine, except they get to decide how broad what they can view is.",
  "What happens, just out of curiosity, if you're -- he is on the pager and sending a message and they’re trying to reach him for, you know, a SWAT team crisis? Does he -- does the one kind of trump the other, or do they get a busy signal?",
  "And would you know where the message was coming from?",
  "Well --",
  "Well, again, it depends upon their reasonable expectation. Do any of these other people know about Arch Wireless? Don't they just assume that once they send something to Quon, it's going to Quon?",
  "Well, then they can't have a reasonable expectation of privacy based on the fact that their communication is routed through a communications company.",
  "Well, I didn't -- I wouldn't think that. I thought, you know, you push a button; it goes right to the other thing.",
  "But just -- just to be clear: You think if these messages went straight to Quon that there’d be no problem from the point of view of the senders? I mean, no problem in searching -- getting them from Quon?",
  "Yes.",
  "So we have to assume for your argument to succeed that they know that this goes somewhere else and then it’s processed and then it goes to Quon.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Richland, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1371, Christian Legal Society Chapter of the University of California- Hastings v. Martinez. Mr. McConnell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL",
  "Thank you, Mr. McConnell. Mr. Garre.",
  "Well, then why do you have --",
  "Why do you have a policy, a written policy -- you don't have a written policy that says anything about all-comers. You’ve got a written policy that says you can -- you can't discriminate on the basis of only one type of belief, religious belief.",
  "Well, then why is --",
  "Is this nondiscrimination policy no longer on the books?",
  "Well, it doesn't -- it doesn't say that.",
  "Right.",
  "So they -- so you’re saying the second paragraph is totally unnecessary. You say the first paragraph says you can't discriminate on any basis, and the second paragraph spells out the bases. So why do you do have the second paragraph?",
  "Well, they -- they quite -- quote the bylaws of the National Lawyers Guild, which says any member must “agree with the objectives of the organization as set forth herein.” That's not all-comers. That's a bylaw that restricts an organization according to its -- members can't join unless they sign on the dotted line that they believe in objectives of the organization.",
  "It has nothing to do with --",
  "It's got nothing to do with sexual -- well, I don't know the National Lawyers Guild, but they say you have got to agree with the objectives of the organization.",
  "No, start with mine.",
  "It seems to me that your position is continually evolving wherever the First Amendment pressure comes. You’ve got a written nondiscrimination policy. And then you say, well, yes, but we use an all-comers policy. You’ve got an all-comers policy, and then groups don't actually follow the all-comers policy, and you have another answer to that. It seems to me that we should go with -- why shouldn't we go with the written policy and the written bylaws?",
  "No, you’re talking about --",
  "-- La Raza background. As I understand it, the La Raza organization says you have to be of La Raza background to be a policy member of the organization.",
  "So if you have a law that says every newspaper that’s published in the United States must be reviewed every day by the government's censor board, and the fact that the government's censor board decides not to do it, then that law is okay?",
  "A newspaper sues saying that law is constitutional, and we’ll say it's all right; it has never been applied?",
  "That was because they might adopt a different policy. We’re not dealing with a future different policy in this case. takeover hypothetical, there is no evidence that it has happened. Groups can take measures to prevent it. They can require attendance requirements before people become members. They can instruct into their bylaws --",
  "That's not going to help if you have the 50 anti-Muslim students who want to take over the group.",
  "Okay. They take over the group and the first thing they do is say we’re abolishing the attendance policy.",
  "I’m sorry. I don’t understand your --",
  "Well, but that's because gender or race is fundamentally different from religious brief. Gender and race is a status. Religious belief -- it has to be based on the fundamental notion that we are not open to everybody. We have beliefs, you have to subscribe to them. And we’ve always regarded that as a good thing. That type of exclusion is supported in -- in the Constitution. The other types of exclusion are not.",
  "You phrase it that way. It's a group that wants to exclude -- a religious group, a religious-oriented group, that wants to exclude people who do not subscribe to their religious beliefs.",
  "Well, that -- that -- that's pretty tough. That has no connection to merit. I assume there are groups that think subscribing to their beliefs is evidence of merit, particularly religious groups. So, how can you have a -- a test that allows distinctions based on merit but not -- not beliefs?",
  "Well, I'm sorry. All parties do not agree that the policy is the all-comers policy. Your friend argued repeatedly that the policy was the written nondiscrimination policy.",
  "In your response to Justice Ginsburg concerning California law, is it your position that California law requires religious groups to admit people who do not believe in their religious beliefs and in fact to conduct services of that group?",
  "So the answer to my question is \"yes\"?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Garre.",
  "Mr. McConnell, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL",
  "Thank you, Mr. McConnell. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-367, Dolan v. United States. Ms. Karlan.",
  "In this -- when the judge did not enter a date for restitution, did you object to that?",
  "Well, why not? It seems that that's when the violation occurred. The statute said the court shall set a date if they’re not ready to calculate the restitution, and he didn't do that.",
  "Well, I thought it says -- maybe I am misreading it. It says the court -- this is at sentencing. When sentencing -- you look at the previous provision -- what is it? 3663A(a)(1) --",
  "-- talks about what you do when sentencing it.",
  "And the statute says, “the court shall set a date for the final determination” … “not to exceed 90 days.” And he didn't.",
  "No, I think that's right. I -- I agree with you that.",
  "In other words, the final determination -- the date for the -- the final determination can't exceed 90 days --",
  "-- but that doesn't mean that the provision saying the court shall set a date can wait -- that he can wait 89 days to do that.",
  "No, no, no --",
  "So you can -- under your view, you can change the amount of jail time up to the point at which you have to set the restitution. The judge says: I'm going to sentence you to 3 years, and I'm going to figure out the restitution. He looks, and the restitution turns out to be a lot more than he thought. So he says: Well, I'm only going to give you 2 years. Or it's less, and he Because the judgment is still open, he can do that?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Heytens.",
  "Well, the consequence is the usual consequence when trial courts make errors, which is to appeal.",
  "Counsel, let's -- let's suppose there’s no 3664(d)(5), and we’re back to just 363(a)(1), which says when sentencing a defendant, the court shall order restitution. What if the judge doesn't -- is that mandatory? It has to be when sentencing the defendant?",
  "So you think even without 3664(d)(5), the judge can say: I know it says when I'm sentencing I’ve got to order restitution. But 2 months later, he can do it?",
  "Yes, but nothing happens if he doesn't. Is that --",
  "So a -- a defendant who is sentenced to a week in prison, and he decides, that's no big deal, I'm not going to appeal, and then finds out, you know, 90 days later he has got to pay a million dollars in restitution, is just out of luck, right?",
  "So, your argument is “not to exceed 90 days” means the same thing as “without undue delay”?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Karlan, you have 4 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument this morning in Case 09-337, Krupski v. Costa Crociere, S.p.A. Mr. Bendure.",
  "Counsel, your -- your client tripped over the cable, right?",
  "What if the case were there were two people behind her and she was pushed? And she didn't know which one pushed her, Jones or Smith. So she sues Jones, and Smith knows all about it because, of course, he's a key witness or whatever. Can he be substituted later on because he was the person she should have sued?",
  "Not just the real name. It's not that Jones pushed her, but his real name is Johnson. It's that Jones -- whoever pushed her; I forget -- but one guy --",
  "One of the people pushed her, and she named that -- she named the other person. She made a mistake about who pushed her. Can they have substitution in that case?",
  "Yes. The non-pusher has notice --",
  "-- and everything else. But there’s no relationship between the two of them.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Glazier.",
  "You know, the -- the definition of carrier includes independent contractors. I mean -- I -- I would -- other than that they are more closely related, I can see someone thinking, well, Costa Cruise is at least an independent contractor with which Costa Crociere does business.",
  "Well, but I don't -- I mean, there’s some sharp practice going on here. Paragraph 10 of their complaint sues Costa Cruise Lines because -- saying they owned, operated, managed, supervised, and controlled the ocean-going passenger vessel. And it's the same lawyer for Costa Cruise as for Costa Crociere, right?",
  "Okay. So that lawyer looks at this and says: Aha, they made a mistake; they named the cruise line rather than the name in Italian. So I'm going to wait until the statute of limitations runs, and then a couple of days after, I'm going to say aha.",
  "No, I would have said the previous paragraph, 9, says: \"The plaintiff has complied with all the pre-suit requirements of the passenger ticket.\" So you know they read the ticket.",
  "Now, which is it? Is that a Freudian slip?",
  "Just a mistake.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bendure, you have 9 minutes remaining.",
  "I would have thought your answer would have been: This has nothing to do with equity at all. It's just the interpretation of a legal rule.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument next in Case 09-448, Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company. Mr. Ates.",
  "Well, she prevailed in some way to give her another chance to make that argument.",
  "I'm just saying I think you’re giving up too much.",
  "Well, what if you get in Justice Kennedy's situation, where the court doesn't know what's going to happen on remand? You know, the objection is -- the administrator throws it out, saying, you know, you filed the wrong form, so you lose. And the district court says you can't throw it out on that basis; under trust law, it doesn't matter. And it goes back. Now, the district court doesn't know what’s going to happen. Does she get fees or not?",
  "So is the district court -- is the district court supposed to wait until the whole thing is over before deciding the fee application?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shah.",
  "What if -- what if the success is preliminary? You know, the plaintiff survives a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff survives a motion for summary judgment, wins every procedural issue, wins a privilege issue, gets discovery issues resolved, and at the end of the day loses? The plaintiff has had --",
  "Why? He has had some success.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosenkranz.",
  "Counsel, what is the impact on your position of our decision last week in Conkright v. Frommert? I know you haven't had a chance to brief it, but I'm also sure had you a chance to read it.",
  "I would have thought that it -- one thing it did emphasize, that in the typical case, the likely relief is going to be sending it back rather than making a judicial decision, which -- which seems to me, then, that -- and then presumably, in most cases, the person would prevail before the plan administrator. So given Conkright, your position is going to severely limit the circumstances under which claimants are entitled to fees.",
  "Even though the -- as in Conkright, the claimant's success can -- before an agreement, can be quite dramatic. This was a very, very significant victory for the claimant to get it sent back under those circumstances.",
  "Is that how it works? Remands always retain jurisdiction? I would -- I would have thought the district judge would want the thing off his or her docket, you know, for the statistics, if anything. And --",
  "-- and would say, and maybe could say -- well, what if the judge says: Look, I don't know if you’re going to prevail or not on remand. My decision actually doesn't help you much one way or the other, but if you get benefits, then the other side is liable for attorney's fees, and I assume you’ll be able to work out the amount. If you don't, he's done. End of case. Sent back to the administrator.",
  "What if the parties -- to follow up on Justice Ginsburg's line of questioning, what if the parties decide, look, this case rises or falls on the discovery issue? If we have to go through discovery, it's going to cost us a lot more than to pay you. So we stipulate whatever the ruling is on discovery will decide the issue. In that case, can the party -- can the claimant get fees?",
  "Well, it grants the discovery order, and as a result, a direct result of that ruling, the plan pays benefits.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ates, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-497, Rent-A-Center West v. Jackson. Mr. Friedman.",
  "But not to the question of which parties have agreed to arbitrate?",
  "Not the question of which parties have agreed to arbitrate?",
  "But I suppose that the substance of the agreement -- maybe this is just the same question as Justice Scalia's. I suppose the substance of the agreement is evidence -- could be evidence on the unconscionability at formation.",
  "And that is for the court.",
  "No, the point is -- it's not that. It would be the -- the provisions are so one-sided that you may assume from that that the formation was not voluntary.",
  "So your position is that the arbitrator gets to decide questions of unconscionability, but the court gets to decide whether the arbitrator can do that?",
  "I would have thought the answer to your -- the answer to your answer would be, well then, the -- you’re more likely to win on that question. Obviously, you are going to lose on the gun to the head, but if it’s simply the economic inequality or whatever, under the State law you’re probably going to prevail, and they will say there is a valid contract. I thought the -- your -- your whole point was simply it's all or nothing. The courts get to decide is there a valid contract or is there not. And once they decide there is, then everything else about unconscionability of particular clauses is for the arbitrator.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Silverberg.",
  "I would have thought the issue would be -- it's odd to say, I think, that if you have 10 provisions, some are unconscionable and some are not. The issue would be whether there is unconscionability in the making of the whole contract. In other words, it's the same question I asked your friend: Why isn't it all or nothing? If it was -- if there was no unconscionability in the making, then the arbitrator decides. If there was unconscionability in the making, then -- then the arbitrator doesn't decide anything. Questions 1 through 10, not simply, you know, 1, 8, and 9.",
  "No, my point is that once you get past that gateway question of whether the formation of the contract was not unconscionable, then claims that particular provisions were unconscionable are by definition for the arbitrator to decide.",
  "I thought your --",
  "No, that can't be right. The -- how can you say there's no problem agreeing to arbitrate, no imbalance in bargaining authority whatever, but then say, oh, but these procedures are unconscionable? It seems to me that the procedures are there, and the party, the employee, whatever, can look at those. And if he says, well, that's unconscionable,",
  "I know you’re arguing in the alternative. But the one argument that we get to pick out the provisions we don't like and say those are unconscionable, but the agreement as a whole is not -- that seems to me illogical.",
  "Well, it's a matter -- it may be a matter of State law, but the open question is who gets to decide it.",
  "Arbitrators decide matters of State law all the time.",
  "Does it make a difference in response to Justice Stevens's hypothetical that there is a provision saying the arbitrator will decide the conscionability of all clauses? The arbitrator may decide that clauses 2 and 8 are unconscionable, but if there’s an agreement and it's not unconscionable that the arbitrator will decide, then the arbitrator decides all of them, right?",
  "Right.",
  "Can I ask you just a follow-up on Justice Breyer's hypothetical to you where he had the first agreement and then the issue to the second? You said you’ve got to leave the door open. The door open on the second agreement or on the first agreement?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Friedman, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Friedman, Mr. Silverberg. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument this morning in Case 09-475, Monsanto Company v. Geertson Seed Farms, et al. Mr. Garre.",
  "You agree that those are two different things, then, right? The vacatur is one thing and the injunction is another, right?",
  "And under the vacatur, the normal APA remedy is a remand to the agency. In fact, there are some courts that say you can't get anything else. But whether you can or can't, it's clear that the burden is on you to get something short of complete remand. The burden is on your friends to get -- establish the injunction. The problem with combining the two, it seems to me, is that you are imposing on them the burden to meet the injunction standard simply to get a remand to which they are entitled under the APA.",
  "But the vacatur does that. You can't plant once the deregulation order is vacated.",
  "So you would say that the injunction is limited only to a decision the agency might make to allow partial planting?",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. Why did it do that? I mean, the way the APA works, this is sent back to the agency. If the agency wants to partially deregulate, it can do it. And then you can challenge it under the normal APA procedures.",
  "It's very odd to get an injunction to an agency telling them they can't do something under the APA.",
  "What authority do you have for the proposition that when a court vacates an administrative order, it has the authority to tailor an injunction rather than simply remand the matter to the agency?",
  "I guess -- Weinberger, of course, involved a statute. I mean, the concern is that the authority to determine how far to go in deregulating or partial deregulating is for the agency to make. And once there has been a violation of the APA, it goes back to the agency. What the district court did here was assume that responsibility itself.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Stewart.",
  "You have the burden to establish your entitlement to those conditions that are short of a remand, correct?",
  "Sure, sure. Agencies can do that.",
  "Well, sure, because -- but here the question is whether the court can do that. The court is stepping into the shoes of the agency. And I would say it's -- I mean, there's authority that you can't do that at all, but certainly you’d have the burden to establish that those reliefs short of remand, that you are entitled to that.",
  "Well, you’re short-circuiting notice and comment or whatever else is required, the reason we send this to an agency, because they are expert and all that. The agency is acting without the benefit of any input on the partial deregulation.",
  "Do you -- do you agree that when you’re talking about the elements of the injunction that are short of remand to the agency, that the Respondents do not have the obligation to meet the injunction standards with respect to those? In other words, it's part of the judgment. It's not an injunction, and you have the burden if you want the court to do anything other than send it back.",
  "No, I'm talking to the -- about the types of activities that would be prohibited if the court just remanded it back, vacated it, which is everything -- you can't plant.",
  "I guess my point is they don't need an injunction. The thing that’s bothering me is you’ve got two different things, the vacatur and the injunction. And it seems to me by melding them together, you’re trying to impose the burden on the plaintiffs to meet the injunction standard to get the benefit of the vacatur.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Robbins.",
  "So if the injunction doesn't do anything, why are you bothering to defend it?",
  "Just -- I'm sorry to interrupt. Just from the seeds blowing in the wind?",
  "But that -- there's a flip side of that that is not so good for you, because one of the things you want from the injunction is a prohibition on the agency partially deregulating. Well, you’re not entitled to that, because the vacatur sends it -- should send it back to the agency and they can decide. And if they decide to partially deregulate, you have the APA challenges available to you.",
  "So your argument is that the district court judge made a mistake in mixing up the vacatur and the injunction?",
  "I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but they’ve already done an EA in support of total deregulation, presumably, and they found no adverse -- presumably, that would be a fortiori for partial.",
  "Could I go back to something you said a while ago, that \"likely\" does not mean more likely than not?",
  "It's -- I thought that would be obvious. If I say your friends are likely to win, that means they are more likely than you.",
  "Do you have -- I -- I was surprised that this apparently hasn't been decided over the however many years we’ve had this standard. Is there a case that says \"likely\" does not mean more likely than not?",
  "And that's a decision for the government to decide, APHIS, and their lawyer, Mr. Stewart, who is in the courtroom told us what the APHIS view is.",
  "All arguments you can make before HP -- APHIS and which presumably were made before APHIS --",
  "-- and can be made before APHIS if this is remanded.",
  "It doesn't entitle you to an order saying APHIS can't do anything in the meantime.",
  "Well, it's kind of artificial to separate the two out. I mean, it's one judgment, and they say they’re intertwined. The injunction is based on the vacatur. And so if they challenge the injunction, you can't say, well, they’re not challenging the vacatur.",
  "Well, but we have to decide -- for you to prevail on that, we have to decide that the injunction does no more than the vacatur.",
  "So -- so the district judge was wrong. He should have -- if you say the injunction adds nothing to the vacatur, he should have ended by saying it's vacated.",
  "If you're -- if you are right that the injunction does nothing, they don't have standing because of that, we should throw the injunction out.",
  "We don't have to worry --",
  "The government doesn't have to worry about standing, does it?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Garre, you have 3 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We’ll hear argument this morning in Case 09-559, John Doe v. Reed, Washington Secretary of State. Mr. Bopp.",
  "Counsel --",
  "I'm sorry, go ahead and finish your answer.",
  "Now, counsel, the responses you have given to a couple of the questions has been that the First Amendment analysis would apply. But given you have a facial challenge, is that enough? Don't you have to indicate that the First Amendment analysis would prevail in either all of the other cases, most of the other cases, a significant portion? This is a facial challenge. And if the challenge is going to fail in some of those other cases, I think your facial challenge fails as well.",
  "So we have to decide, in assessing your claim that, no matter what the referendum issue was, that there's a significant intrusion on First Amendment rights?",
  "So that if, for example, the referendum involves a bond issue as to which people may have particular views, but they’re not going to get terribly excited about it, we’d still have to say that that’s protected under the First Amendment?",
  "Well, my point is, though, you’re not likely to get that with respect to, you know, a debt issue, raising the debt ceiling from 0.8 percent to 0.9 percent. You’re not going to get a crowd outside your house because you signed that petition.",
  "I suppose the -- a majority of the voters in Washington decided that, and one of the purposes of the First Amendment is to protect minorities.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Bopp. General McKenna. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL ROBERT M. McKENNA",
  "Would these records --",
  "Counsel --",
  "Counsel, if the State had a law that you could disclose voters and for whom they voted, would that implicate First Amendment interests?",
  "What would the First Amendment interests be?",
  "Yes.",
  "Do you think having your name revealed on a petition of this sort might have a chilling effect on whether you sign it?",
  "You don't think revealing that you’re a voter has the same chilling effect as revealing how you voted, do you?",
  "Well, I thought you told me that the First Amendment interests were implicated with respect to the secret ballot, that you couldn't require people to reveal how they voted.",
  "Counsel, your answer to Justice Breyer was that they can bring an as-applied challenge. Now, that as-applied challenge would be small comfort unless the names were protected pending the resolution of that challenge, correct?",
  "So you think a stay should be granted in this case to allow the Petitioners to pursue an as-applied challenge.",
  "Do you think that the disclosure of the names, pending the resolution of their as-applied challenge, would subject them to incidents of violence and intimidation?",
  "There’s no evidence -- there’s no evidence of episodes of violence or intimidation?",
  "What -- what's the most sensitive similar petition for a referendum?",
  "No, but what’s the --",
  "What’s -- what's the other one that's going to get people -- that's the most controversial public issue?",
  "No, I'm talking about in Washington, counsel.",
  "Was the referendum in favor or opposed to assisted suicide?",
  "What percentage -- what percentage of the people who signed this petition to put this law on the referendum do you think signed it because they think these sort of things should be generally put to a public vote as opposed to because they opposed the law?",
  "You think as much as 20 percent of the people who signed this petition are actually in favor of the law that it's aimed to repeal?",
  "I thought one of the reasons you wanted to do this was so people would have information that would allow them to participate in the civic process, and there are people who -- might think it makes a difference whether a referendum was requested by -- primarily by members of a particular ethnic group or not. So isn't -- doesn't -- I thought your brief would say the State has an interest in that type of disclosure.",
  "How can they --",
  "How can they find that out with just the name and address, that a large number of people from a company signed it?",
  "You don't have to put on who you work for, do you?",
  "I'm sorry. I'm still on the companies. How -- how does knowing who the sponsors are tell you how many people from a particular company signed the petition?",
  "Thank you, General McKenna. Mr. Bopp, you have 2 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Bopp. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 09-479, Abbott v. United States, and the consolidated case, 7073, Gould v. United States. Mr. Horan.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Ryan.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. McLeese.",
  "But that's not -- I can't imagine a single district judge getting that wrong. To think that, oh, my gosh, here it says 10 years if you discharge the firearms, and here it says 5 years if you have one, which one do I use in a case when it's discharged?",
  "You don't need this provision, the -- your argument can't be that this language is to make sure the district judge knows in that case to use the 10-year rather than the 5-year.",
  "Well, I would have -- I guess things are obvious to different people. I would have thought it would be odd to say when there are increased minimums that the highest minimum applicable isn't the one that applies.",
  "But your main -- the meat of your argument focuses on 3559(c), right? There is this significant provision out there that does provide a greater mandatory minimum. And I just don't see, as a practical matter, why people would worry about that. Under 3559(c), you get life. And you're saying, well, they put in the \"except\" clause to be sure that the judge would add another 5 years at the end of a life sentence.",
  "Yes, exactly. Yes, I'm sorry.",
  "Okay. Well, just so I make sure I understand, the basic point you're making is that there are some things under your reading that this deals with. One is the internal point, and we can disagree as to whether that's necessary or not, and the other is 3559(c), where it seems to me it doesn't make any difference whether you're in there for life or life and the additional 5 years.",
  "But that's a difficult -- you're saying, because Congress wanted to get tough on the people who use firearms in this provision, every ambiguous clause should be read in a way that makes it tougher on the criminal defendant?",
  "So, with respect to 3559(c) they were in fact being more lenient, not stricter, right?",
  "I thought you said earlier that the purpose of this, what it does, is it makes sure that you don't add 5 extra years on the people who are sentenced to life.",
  "Which is right. You're saying when you get life, or you get 5, just serve life; don't serve the extra 5.",
  "Is there any evidence in the legislative history that the reason they put this in was to ensure that people who got life would not get life plus 5 years?",
  "You should pick any other violent crime or drug trafficking offense that already provides a higher minimum.",
  "No, it seems to me the perfectly natural reading is to say, look, we are providing some minimum sentences when this happens, when this is the violent crime and you use a gun, but if you have already got a higher sentence for the violent crime, then this doesn't apply.",
  "As Justice -- as Justice Breyer has pointed out, he can take that into account in figuring out what sentence he would want to impose beyond the greater minimum.",
  "Thank you, Mr. McLeese. Mr. Ryan, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this term in Case 09-907, Ransom v. FIA Card Services. Mr. Burke.",
  "And they get it whether or not they incur that expense or not?",
  "In other words, food -- you don't have to say, well, he did spend this much money on food, so he gets the standard deduction.",
  "If he doesn't eat as much as somebody else, he gets the same deduction, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Maynard.",
  "So if they have pre-purchased their food expenses, so long as they have $1 of food expense they get the entire expense even though they're not incurring it?",
  "And there are things like, you can pay up, you know, have the grocery deliver your food every month and you can pay in advance, and if you're paid up, you still get the full food expense that is allowed?",
  "But if you paid $1 for food, you'd get the full amount for 60 months?",
  "So your argument leads to a result that's just as absurd as your colleague's result on the other side.",
  "I mean, that was a big part of your argument. You said his position leads to an absurd result, and yours is just as absurd.",
  "Your -- your position penalizes debtors who pay their expenses in advance, who don't incur additional debt to pay for things like their car. I would have thought the Bankruptcy Code would think that's a good thing, that they're not incurring debt that they can't afford to pay off, but instead, to the extent they can, they're paying expenses in advance. Why should somebody who does that be in a worse position than somebody -- than somebody who takes out a loan they can't afford to pay back?",
  "Well, he hasn't incurred -- he hasn't incurred expenses. It's the whole point, I guess, that he's paid for something.",
  "Even though he can do it -- even though he can do it for everything else -­ he can do it for food, he can do it for housekeeping expenses, he can do it for personal care expenses, he can even do it -- the other, the final category is miscellaneous, so he can do it for anything.",
  "Why don't you finish answering the question?",
  "Do you think that -­",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "And if he paid -­",
  "If he paid a dollar, he would be able to shield $27,999, and you're comfortable with that result?",
  "And I understood your brief to say it was the amount -- you get the whole amount, not simply as a cap.",
  "If the point of the $1, counsel, is to lead to the extreme hypothetical that would flesh out your position, what if it were $10,000 and the amount would give him $30,000? The trustees have probably seen loans like that.",
  "Ms. Saharsky, I should -- I should probably know this, but if you do have amounts that are excluded from the disposable income because of car ownership, in other words, you actually have, from -- in your point of view, expenses, do they have to go to the -- pay off the car loan or are they available for everybody? All the creditors?",
  "But can he decide -­ let's say he has more food expense than is allowed. Can he decide of the amount that would otherwise go for the car payment that he's going to pay some of that for the food expenses?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Burke, have you 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 09-150, Michigan v. Bryant. Ms. Palmer.",
  "Well, it can't all be the formality of the context. I mean, if the police came in and said, well, has this person -- Rick, I guess -- sold you drugs before, what was the -- what was the quantity, and all those sorts of questions, the answers to that would be testimonial, despite the same lack of formality.",
  "I'm confused of what -- what Davis focuses our inquiry on. Is it the purpose of the interrogators or is it the purpose of the declarants? We say the statements are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events. The -- the focus seems to be on the purpose of the interrogation, which seems to be the question of what the police thought, not what the -- the person dying thought.",
  "Yes, I mean -­",
  "But what the footnote -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but what the footnote says is, in the final analysis, it's the declarant's statements, not the interrogator's question, that the Confrontation Clause requires us to evaluate. So which -- I guess, which is it?",
  "Well, then, how does that apply? The officer says, what happened? And the -- the declarant says, Rick shot me. Now, is that testimonial or not? Because the declarant knows he's 6 miles away. It's not going to help them solve an emergency, but the police don't know that.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kruger.",
  "No, but then you're saying that the focus is on the police officers. I mean, after all, we're not saying that police officers can't do this; we're just saying the testimonial aspects can't be admitted into evidence or that's what your friend is arguing for. I still have trouble figuring out is the issue the purpose of the interrogating officers or the purpose and intent of the declarant?",
  "Okay. And what do you do with the last sentence of footnote 1. It's the one that says -­",
  "Right, right.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Van Hoek.",
  "Now is a good time to try to jump in, I think.",
  "So what do you do -­ what do you do with the statement the guy in the gas station shot me? Is that purely past, or is that an ongoing emergency?",
  "Even though the guy in the gas station is still there with a gun, the police are within range?",
  "Yes. I mean, that strikes me as something that happened in the past, he shot me, but at the same time demonstrates an ongoing emergency because he's right there and he might shoot you. I'm suggesting the line you propose to Justice Alito doesn't work.",
  "No relation.",
  "Oh, sure it can. If he says the principal did it. It's -- it's 10 o'clock in the morning; you assume the principal is at the school; and he says the principal did it. You can infer from the circumstances that he's referring to an ongoing emergency.",
  "Well, it's quite different than saying, you know, this happened to some guy driving by, or something like that. If he says the principal did it, it's at 10 o'clock, it's in the school -- that suggests to me more, not that the dying student or the wounded student wanted to make sure that the principal was convicted, but that there's an emergency, something is happening.",
  "Oh, no, no. You don't want them to have to go through, you know, a whole list of questions while the student's there dying and the principal is inside the building shooting people?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Palmer, you have 2 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 09-350, Los Angeles County v. Humphries. Mr. Coates.",
  "You concede, I take it, or acknowledge that one episode can be the basis -­ I mean, going forward -- for a determination that the defendant has a policy, custom, or practice.",
  "And they have sued the State here, right?",
  "Or under Ex parte Young?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus.",
  "So that's what you think. So you agree -- it struck me that your argument could have been made by your friend on the other side. You say if you get an injunction, you must have shown municipal policy, practice, or custom. And, therefore, you agree that a municipal policy, custom, or practice is required. That's what he thinks.",
  "Well, Monell doesn't apply to State officials, right?",
  "Thank you.",
  "That, of course, isn't before us.",
  "Well, that would require -- that would require us to get into the question of whether Ex parte Young is a fiction or substance, which I certainly wouldn't like to get into.",
  "Justice Breyer's question said you need a city policy, and you said that's exactly right. So I think the case is over. The issue is whether you need a city policy, and your friend thinks so, and you think so.",
  "But you don't think that -­",
  "I think your friend agrees. But -- but how can the city have caused the violation in the absence of a city policy, custom, or practice? You say you have to show causation to get an injunction. The only way to show that the city caused the problem is to show that they've got a policy, custom, or practice, including one that might be shown by inaction. But you still have to show that, and that's all Monell requires.",
  "Well, now you're arguing whether Monell was satisfied or not, and you're going to get a chance to do that on remand because the Ninth Circuit said we're -- we're making the city pay, and now we're going to find out if they violated anything.",
  "So -- so the Ninth Circuit was wrong to send it back for a hearing?",
  "Because you've already shown Monell was satisfied.",
  "-- but -- yes, damages, but turning on whether Monell was satisfied. It was a hearing about Monell.",
  "Go ahead.",
  "How can you get relief -- how can you get relief going forward under Monell unless there has been a city violation before? Otherwise what the injunction you're getting is just an injunction saying don't violate the law, and the city has said we haven't because you haven't shown that we had policy, practice, or custom.",
  "If you were sued -­",
  "No, I -­",
  "I'm sorry -- answer.",
  "Well, but it's not -- defending the suit doesn't give rise to a municipal custom, policy, or practice. They may have -­ somebody comes in and says this is what's going on. And they say, well, we don't -- we don't think that's unconstitutional. So they're going to defend the suit. That doesn't mean that they have adopted a policy to do what they -- the individual employee has been alleged to have done.",
  "Well -- or continuing to do, I mean, the suit doesn't satisfy the requirement of showing a policy or practice, because they may defend on the ground that it's not unconstitutional. They may say, look, this isn't our policy, this isn't our practice, but we're going to defend our employee because we don't think it's unconstitutional.",
  "No, but -­",
  "And so the city -­",
  "The city is in a catch-22 position. Whenever they are sued, they have to say if we defend this, we're going to be liable under Monell, but if we don't defend it, then, you know, our policy is being changed. Or we might -- we might want to have this policy; we might not. We didn't know this clerk was doing that, but we might think it's a good idea, we might think it's a bad idea. The cases are not always going to be as clear as the hypotheticals in your -- in your brief. It seems to me that it's a bit much to tell the city you've got to choose -- when you have to choose whether to defend a suit, you are in fact choosing what policy or practice to have going forward.",
  "Well, he doesn't get relief against the city because the city is not responsible for what happened until they adopt a policy, practice, or custom. Now, if they are told this is unconstitutional and they decide to stick with it, then they're -- then that's their policy and custom, and you can get an injunction against them.",
  "He's not -- he's not entitled -­",
  "He's not entitled to prospective relief against the city because the city has not caused the alleged harm until you establish a policy, practice or custom.",
  "If you establish what the employee is doing in a suit against the employee, which the city is defending because he's one of their employees, then the city is put to a choice. Once -- I suppose once the legal process has concluded, they have to decide whether to continue that or not.",
  "What I'm trying to figure out the answer to is whether or not merely defending the employee in court is sufficient to establish that the city has that policy, custom, or practice.",
  "Oh, sure. Sure.",
  "So you're back where Justice -- Justice Alito was commenting, well, that at some point you have to bring what you're complaining about to the attention of the city. And you dismiss that as an exhaustion requirement, but -­",
  "Thank you, counsel.",

  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-530, National Aeronautics and Space Administration v. Nelson. Mr. Katyal.",
  "Does that -- does that ruling stop you from asking that question right now throughout the Ninth Circuit?",
  "No, no, no. The - - yes. Yes, the counseling and treatment question.",
  "Right.",
  "But if we sustained -- if we sustain the preliminary injunction, the Government can't ask that question throughout the - - the -- the reach of the Ninth Circuit?",
  "So when you say your position would be no, you mean that there is no right of any kind under -- I know you don't want us to reach it, but you would say there is no right of any kind for a citizen to tell the Government that that's none of your business. The Government will decide that it can ask anything of a citizen, so long as you don't disclose it.",
  "Do you think it's firmly rooted in our traditions that there is some right to tell the Government that's none of your business?",
  "Yes, but that's putting those aside. I mean, what about some of the hypotheticals that Justice Alito posed? Your diet?",
  "That's certainly relevant in the employment context, right? They're going to have to pay for your health care, worry you might miss things, miss days of work. So I guess the point is: Do you think the Government's right to inquire in the employment context is exactly as broad as a private employer's right?",
  "What is the reason -- I've had trouble putting my finger on it - - that you need the information about counseling? You already have the information, have you used drugs in the past year? I couldn't tell if you thought the question about counseling was for the good of the employee -- oh, you are taking steps to -- or was it to allow you to show, well, it must be serious, because you need counseling.",
  "Well, now that's - - whenever the Government comes and says this is for your own good, you have to be - -",
  "-- you have to be a little suspicious. I mean, if it's -- the employee gets to expand upon his or her answer. They say, tell us about it. And they can say, don't worry, I'm in counseling or treatment. And even then, that doesn't sound like it's for their good. It's one thing to say, I had a drink. It's another thing to say, I'm in AA.",
  "Now, I had a question about the way it's worded. You're supposed - - it says, if you've used it in the last year, detail your involvement with drugs and any counseling you received. Do you understand the counseling question to be limited to the past year, or to reach back as far as - -",
  "But do you think it's required? I mean, you do sign at the end, this is true to the best -- do you think it's required to disclose counseling and treatment you received more than a year back?",
  "Well, how do you know -- how do you know that? I mean, you ask a lot of questions on these forms, and they say, well, we're not going to hire you. How can you go back and say it was because you put in, you know, in treatment for -- for drug abuse?",
  "Over the last 5 years, this has only come into play 128 times across the Federal bureaucracy?",
  "Federal contractors.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Stormer.",
  "So this gets back to Justice Sotomayor's earlier question. You just said if there is a rational basis, so is that the test?",
  "No matter what type of information? I suppose it's harder to show a rational basis when you get into certain areas that - - that concern you, but is it a rational basis test?",
  "But in the case of a date of birth for a driver's license, you say it's rational basis?",
  "So -- just to -- I'd like to get back to Justice Breyer's question. So now you not only have to decide which questions -- they can challenge any question they want and say this isn't pertinent, but you also have to categorize which employees are being asked that question. This is a -- SF means \"standard form,\" right?",
  "Well, that -- you know, it's a big government, and they can't tailor every inquiry, every form, to the individual applicant.",
  "But you don't know -- you don't know if it's a low-risk employee until you find out what he -- he or she is like or what the neighbor thinks. Well, you know, he keeps practicing planting bombs or something. I mean, then he becomes a high-risk employee. You don't know until you get the information. That's the reason you ask for it.",
  "What you're saying -- what you're saying is it may not make much sense to have the people here fill out Standard Form 85, but the Government can't tailor its open -- opening security form to people that -- you know, maybe down the road at a different NASA laboratory, they do work on more sensitive information. It's a standard form. The Government has to do things in a standard way.",
  "Under what -- under what law could you -- a private employer not ask for those records?",
  "No, we're talking about under general federal law.",
  "But it's a matter of statutory law.",
  "What do you understand the scope of the preliminary injunction to be? Does it bar the solicitation of this information throughout the Ninth Circuit or only with respect to JPL?",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Katyal, you have 4 minutes.",
  "Thank you, General. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 09-571, Connick v. Thompson. Mr. Duncan.",
  "I'm sorry. What's the page number.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Cooney.",
  "Well, Justice Alito's question was, what you would tell the assistant DAs? What's your answer?",
  "Okay. That's your instruction on Brady. Now, you're basing liability on -- on this incident of failing to comply with Brady. So you say they should have instructed on Brady. What else should they have instructed on?",
  "You're the -- you're the new DA, and you're setting up -- I need to instruct my people. What -- what do they instruct on? I know they instruct on Brady under your view. What else?",
  "Well, we're looking at -- we're looking at specifics where they're going to violate the Constitution. I think that's a good thing, to tell them they have an obligation as well to protect the innocent. But we're worried about violations of our constitutional requirements. We know Brady is one. What's the next one? What's day 2 in the course?",
  "So if it is - - prosecutors can violate a defendant's constitutional rights by making improper statements in their closing arguments. Do you have to instruct new -- I suspect new prosecutors coming out of law school don't know what those rules are. Do you have to give instruction on what they can say in closing arguments?",
  "Yes. My understanding is -- I don't -- I'm not an expert in criminal law. I need training in that. But my understanding is that comments in a closing argument can give rise to a constitutional violation. So you should -- you should train those people. You know that. You know that that can happen, just as you know there can be Brady violations. So they need training in exactly what they can say and can't say in closing argument.",
  "When you're talking about improper comments in closing argument, it is the prosecuting attorney.",
  "So you don't -- you don't have to train with respect to closing arguments?",
  "Could I ask you what -- most law offices with which I'm familiar, the training is mentoring. In other words, the young attorneys learn from the older attorneys, often by following them along -- around. Would it have been an adequate training program for this office simply to say, new prosecutors, you don't get to be first chair prosecutors until after a year, and you're going to follow one of the prosecutors around and learn from them? Is that an adequate training program?",
  "Yes.",
  "Even -- even if the violation that becomes the basis for the claim later on is one that, you know, didn't come up in that year? We -- they didn't have a Brady issue in that first year. They went around; they sat in on a lot of trials; but there wasn't a Brady issue and so they didn't learn about this type of question. And - -",
  "Does that give rise to a claim of the sort you're bringing here?",
  "But isn't that - - isn't that best practice? In other words, I thought that was the good thing, when what the prosecutor does is say look at everything we've got. And as my brother has suggested, what is important may not be there for either deliberate misconduct or by happenstance.",
  "Would this have been -- would this be a no-training case if the rule was you have to be in the office for 3 years as a second chair prosecutor before we let you have a case, and, in fact, you have to be here 10 years before we let you have a capital case? That's all it says. Is that sufficient training?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Duncan, have you 3 minutes remaining.",
  "How do you train your new hires? First day, somebody right out of law school shows up and says, I want to be an assistant district attorney. How do you train them?",
  "You can answer.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 09-751, Snyder v. Phelps. Mr. Summers.",
  "Okay. Were you finished - -",
  "Were you finished answering Justice Breyer's question?",
  "You -- so you have no objection if the sign said \"Get out of Iraq\" or antiwar protests; in other words, not directed at this particular individual?",
  "So no objection there?",
  "Perhaps you would like to answer Justice Alito's question.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Phelps.",
  "What is your answer -- what is your answer to Justice Alito's question? Do you think the First Amendment would bar that cause of action or not?",
  "So you think there are situations where a tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress is allowed, even for a matter of public debate?",
  "Well, I understood the hypothetical, that the person disagreed with the war in Iraq and the sending of American troops there.",
  "The person selects the grandmother because he thinks that will give maximum publicity to his views. Now, is -- does the First Amendment bar that cause of action or not?",
  "Well, no -- Justice -- Justice Alito posed, the grandmother was returning from the grave of her grandson. She didn't enter the public discussion at all. So I'm anxious to determine whether in those circumstances you think the First Amendment allows that cause of action or not.",
  "Do you think it satisfies the normal tort or law against stalking for someone to come up to an individual and engage in discussion? I thought a lot more was required.",
  "But Your response - - your response to Justice Alito is dwelling on the facts of this particular case.",
  "I'm interested in knowing what your position is on the broader question. Can you imagine a circumstance where this same type of discussion is directed at an individual and yet would give rise to the tort of emotional distress?",
  "I'm sorry -- can or cannot?",
  "You can.",
  "Okay. So if you recognize that there can be a tort of emotional distress in circumstances like that, isn't that the factual question of whether it rises to that level of outrageousness, which is part of the tort for the jury?",
  "Does it make - -",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Does it make a difference - -",
  "Does it make a difference, which seems to me to be the case here, that Mr. Snyder was selected not because of who he was, but because it was a way to get maximum publicity for your client's particular message?",
  "Well, assuming it is accurate, does that make a difference?",
  "Well, it might affect whether or not the selection inflicts emotional distress for a reason unconnected with the individual who is the subject of emotional distress.",
  "In other words, if the person is selected because, as I indicated, it gives maximum publicity, rather than because of a particular connection to the matter of public debate, I wonder if that makes a difference.",
  "Well, so that - - what -- what if -- did Mr. Snyder, the father, become a public figure simply because his son was killed in Iraq?",
  "Okay. So if didn't take out - -",
  "If he didn't take out the usual obituary notice, then this case should come out the other way?",
  "All right. Well, let's just say he does nothing. He does nothing other than bury his son.",
  "He is then not a public figure?",
  "Well, that's because if he does nothing and it's not publicized, you don't get the maximum publicity that your clients are looking for. My question is, if he simply buries his son, is he a public figure open to this protest or -- or not?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Phelps.",
  "Mr. Summers, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Summers. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 09-152, Bruesewitz v. Wyeth. Mr. Frederick.",
  "What is -- I'm sorry, Mr. Frederick. What's the point that you are trying to make? That because there are a whole bunch of provisions designed to help manufacturers, that this one can't possibly also be designed to help manufacturers?",
  "I would have thought the argument would go the other way: That because they set up a compensation scheme, that was a good sign that they didn't want to allow State law claims.",
  "So you are asking us to interpret this statute in light of his testimony at a hearing?",
  "It seems to me the language supports the reading Justice Ginsburg has just suggested, or the government has just suggested, with the use of the word \"the.\" It says the effects of the vaccine were unavoidable, even though the vaccine was properly prepared. Your position is, well -- the question is whether it was unavoidable if you could have prepared a different vaccine. But this says \"unavoidable, even though the vaccine.\"",
  "I don't see the word \"if.\"",
  "It would depend, I suppose, on what they thought the judgments were going to be in the 1 percent of the time.",
  "It doesn't take too many $60 million verdicts to make you come out on the other side of your calculus.",
  "If the language -­",
  "But I'm not sure that in most cases you are going to be able to tell immediately -- you are marketing one vaccine and something else is being tested or about to be approved, or it's on the market -- that that's safer. Particularly since you have to look not only at -­ whatever -- injury and mortality rates, but also efficaciousness -- or efficiency, I guess -- in terms of the vaccine. So you don't know right away. Somebody comes in and says, Here's a different vaccine; your vaccine causes one death every 10,000 doses, or whatever it is. And the other says, This is better; it's one death every 12,000 doses. You say, Well, but ours is more efficient in stopping the vaccine. Well, how much more efficient? Well, it depends on the judgment of a jury.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Ms. Sullivan.",
  "Before you get to that, I think your answer to Justice Sotomayor's question is: Nothing; the manufacturers have no reason to take the vaccine off the market until the FDA tells them to.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Sullivan.",
  "Mr. Horwich.",
  "So it doesn't make a determination that the one that they are listing in their morbidity report is better than one that's out there? This is a situation where there were two of them out there.",
  "Well, the comparison between the vaccine that caused the harm and the one that Mr. Frederick's client says was more efficacious and therefore the harms were avoidable.",
  "There must be a situation where the Centers for Disease Control approve, alert people to the fact that there is a particular vaccine that they think manufacturers should -- should produce, and there is another vaccine addressed to the same disease already on the market. That's never the case? They must improve the vaccine -­",
  "-- or we wouldn't have this case.",
  "When they publish that information in their weekly report, do they compare it both with respect to losses or mortality and with respect to efficiency, with -- to the other vaccines on the market.",
  "It has not only given that information; it has also said in its weekly report that this is the one we want you to make.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Frederick, take five minutes.",
  "I thought Mr. Horwich told me that the CDC does compare new vaccines to the ones that are out in the market?",
  "You think he was incorrect in that assertion. We can go back and look at these weekly reports and they are either going to say this is better than the one that's out there or they are not.",
  "I'm just trying to find out what your position is on that. Do they compare it to existing vaccines or not?",
  "I'm not asking about law, I'm asking matter of fact.",
  "You open up the weekly report.",
  "When you open up the weekly report and it says this new vaccine is better vaccine than the one that is out there or not?",

  "And Johnson?",
  "Okay. And you say that he could have dragged him from the pool to the couch because there were drops along the way.",
  "What other -­",
  "Counsel, what other expert evidence should Richter's counsel have pursued before deciding upon his course of action in this case? Put aside the blood-spatter expert. What other experts did he need to consult?",
  "Okay. We have got a blood-spatter expert, a ballistics expert. Go on. I thought, in their habeas proceeding, you said he should have consulted a serologist and a pathologist. Okay, that's four. Why wouldn't he have wanted to talk to an expert on the effects of alcohol and drugs on people's different perceptions of the events?",
  "I thought the Ninth Circuit said that part of the ineffective assistance was failing to consult an expert in planning his defense and in preparing his defense, not simply responding to the State's expert in the middle of trial.",
  "Did I understand you -- I just want to step back to the prior answer. You think what counsel did here would have been effective assistance but for exactly what he said in the opening statement?",
  "You mean the case against Gunner you've just described, would it have been enough, and wouldn't that have justified counsel's decision to focus on credibility rather than expert physical evidence?",
  "Did -- did counsel have to investigate the other aspects? I mean, we're talking -- we're focusing on the scene where the shooting took place. Did he have to consider experts with respect to the bypass, where they threw the guns, Richter's apartment, the vehicle that was used? One thing counsel said is he thought about hiring a tire expert because of the vehicle. He has to look at the possibility of expert testimony affecting every aspect of the various scenes that were pertinent in this claim?",
  "What does -- what happens -- I know you have an answer that that's not this case, but what -- what happens if the defendant tells his lawyer, look, I did it, I'm guilty? And the lawyer decides that the best thing to do is try to pin it on a guy whose nickname is Gunner?",
  "Does -- does -- what else is the lawyer supposed to do? He thinks no matter what -- what physical evidence is found, it's got to cut against his client because his client did it.",

  "Yes, I know, but the idea -- one of the objections to your position is that it's going to be very hard to figure out in any particular case what is a filing an oral complaint under the FLSA, because one, it's got to be reconstructed, unlike the situation where you had have a government agency that's doing it, or you have a written complaint; and second of all, it's -- it's unclear perhaps for the employer to know that he's being charged with a violation of the FLSA.",
  "Well, if it's written -- if it's written, you have got a document that people can look like -- look at, whether it's the NLRB or a court, that -- that they can look at and say, yes, this is a -- an assertion of a violation.",
  "Well, what if he goes to the boss and says, boss, you ought to do something, that railing is -- is pretty dangerous over there.",
  "Is the boss supposed to know, well, he is asserting statutory rights under the FLSA?",

  "Necessarily implies or conclusively establishes?",
  "Well, but what you say in the rest of paragraph 33 is that you want the biological evidence because by refusing to turn it over, he prevented you from gaining access to exculpatory evidence that could demonstrate he is not guilty of capital murder, which is usually what we -- what habeas corpus is for: To show you are not guilty of what you are in prison for.",
  "I understand. But did I understand you to say that you -- different cases where people are seeking the DNA evidence might come out differently under Heck. In other words, if it's the type of DNA evidence that could conclusively establish he's innocent. I mean, there are types like that. It's somebody else's, you know, DNA and that's what's necessary for the conviction. And there's others -- other types of DNA evidence that doesn't. I mean, it just happens to be on the scene of the crime and it turns out that it's not him that was in the room, but, you know, he was somewhere else, and it might or might not mean he's innocent. In the former case, do you say that has to go under habeas, but in the latter it doesn't?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Owen. Mr. Coleman.",
  "Well, he says exculpatory evidence that could demonstrate that he's not guilty. There's a lot of exculpatory evidence that might imply, necessarily imply guilt, but there's a lot of exculpatory evidence that simply is helpful and doesn't mean it will demonstrate. He says it could.",

  "I'm sorry to interrupt so quickly, but that especially, I take it -­ I take it, is a concession that there's a difference between claims for qualified immunity based on evidence and claims that are based on law.",
  "I don't understand, counsel, how your argument -- that in every case you need to know the facts, every qualified immunity case you need to know the facts, and those only come out after trial -- is consistent with our recognizing that you can have a collateral order appeals denial of summary judgment. In other words, you can consider qualified immunity without knowing how the facts are going to come out at trial, which is why we allow you to have an appeal before trial.",
  "Well -- so you're just saying your case on qualified immunity isn't like that case; is that all?",
  "But you have an obligation in opposing summary judgment to, in your list of disputed facts or facts that preclude summary judgment, to put all that in. And why didn't you put the point you are raising now in the opposition to summary judgment?",
  "I know. So it -­",
  "Well, but -- but you may prevail. You may have three different factual disputes that the other side is saying are undisputed, and the fact that you prevail on one doesn't meant that you didn't have an obligation to put in your opposition the others.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mizer.",
  "Yes, that -- that is right, and I find it, in the context where that already matters, whether they're appealable as a collateral issue already very difficult and complicated to sort out. Now, what you want us to do is take that difficulty and continue it on in terms of when you can appeal and when you can't. Some qualified immunity claims are purely legal. Some are purely factual. Some are in the middle. Wouldn't it be easier if we just said: Here's the rule from now on; you've got to renew them all in a 50(b) motion. And that makes it a lot easier for the trial courts and the appellate courts to figure out when they have to -- when they can consider it and when they can't. I understand your argument that it makes a difference. I think it's a good argument, because some don't depend on the facts. But going forward, it just creates an awful lot of difficulty that we don't need to buy into.",

  "Well, that's kind of a tough choice to put them to, isn't it?",
  "So they have to take the immediate appeal, and when they do so, they lose the right to appeal at the end?",
  "Well, why is that?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",

  "Well, but it's not -- it's not as broad as your test, \"arising out of the same operative facts.\" It doesn't say that; it says \"any claim for and respect to which.\" And it seems to me that the facts of this case draw that precise distinction. When you are asking for an accounting, you are not raising any claims about people doing anything bad at all. You are just saying, let me know what I've got. And then when you bring a claim for -- for money because of mismanagement of the trust, that's -- that's quite different.",

  "And they can get -­ and then it may be a basis for a further claim that, if that's all we've got, where did the rest of it go, and that might be the Court of Claims action. But it does strike me that they are different -- claims for different relief.",

  "It's not -- I mean, you are putting a pejorative spin on what they are doing, saying, you know, many plaintiffs like to take a chance in more than one court.

  "What was -- what was the state of the record that was present before the Court in Ginsberg?",
  "So the Court acted on the basis of common sense?",
  "I don't want to interrupt your answer, but any 13-year-old can bypass parental controls in about 5 minutes.",
  "Graphic violence. There is a difference. We do not have a tradition in this country of telling children they should watch people actively hitting schoolgirls over the head with a shovel so they'll beg with mercy, being merciless and decapitating them, shooting people in the leg so they fall down -- I'm reading from the district court description -- pour gasoline over them, set them on fire, and urinate on them. We do not have a tradition in this country. We protect children from that. We don't actively expose them to that.",
  "Is it your position -- I know this is a facial challenge, Mr. Smith. So is it your position that the First Amendment could not prohibit the sale to minors of the video game that I just described?",
  "I know you don't, but what is -- you're avoiding the answer. Does the First Amendment protect the sale of that video to minors?",
  "A minor?",
  "So your position is that the First Amendment does not, cannot, no matter what type of law, whether this one is vague or not, that the State legislature cannot pass a law that says you may not sell to a 10-year-old a video in which they set schoolgirls on fire.",
  "Mr. Smith, your -­ your challenge is a facial challenge?",
  "So that under -­ whether you use the Salerno test or the Glucksberg test, if there is either one or any applications that would satisfy the Constitution, the facial challenge fails. Right?",
  "I thought we referenced them last year in the Stevens case, and the only reason we didn't have to decide which applies is because we adopted an approach that looked at overbreadth and said this statute is overbroad and specifically didn't decide whether it could be applied in that case to -- to crush videos.",
  "Well, I understood -- the tenor of much of the questioning, I think, is that there may be games and may be minors -­ maybe a less violent game sold to a 17-year-old, perhaps that violates the First Amendment, but something like Postal 2 sold to a 10-year-old might -- might well not violate the First Amendment to apply this law to that.",
  "And the way we approached the issue in Stevens, where we had hunting videos and crush videos, would say that it's too broad to apply the law to everything, so we strike it down, it's overbroad, but leave open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute might pass muster. Why -- why isn't that a good approach here?",
  "So, just to be clear, your answer to Justice Alito is, at this point, there is nothing the State can do?",
  "Could I -- could I just have a simple answer?",
  "There's nothing the State can do.",
  "Could you have a law that says the State has to put -- the dealers have to put the violent video games in a particular area of the video store?",
  "That is not -- and then -- you know, and minors are not allowed in that area.",
  "Yes.",
  "So they can't say, example, all the -- all the highest rated videos have to be on the top shelf out of the reach of children. Can they do that?",
  "That's what they do with cigarettes or something, isn't it?",
  "I know that cigarettes are not speech, Mr. Smith.",
  "Cigarettes are something that we have determined are harmful to children. The question is, you say the record doesn't support the idea that these video games are harmful to children. Some of us may conclude that it does.",
  "We draw that kind of line of course in the death penalty area, don't we? Between 18-year-olds? You are under 18; you can't be sentenced to life without parole; if you were over 18, you can.",

  "Well, but -- I'm -- I'm sorry, but I think the end there just kind of glided over the whole issue. You say it had nothing to do with his military status. It has to do with a procedure that was set up because the employer was discriminating against him because of his military status. So it certainly had something to do with his military status.",
  "Well, I know, but the hypothetical is extreme to try to flesh out your position. You can certainly imagine an employee reacting in a particular way by being put through procedures that were set up in a discriminatory manner that would seem to anybody to be a basis for termination, even though the groundwork was laid by the discriminatory procedure.",

  "I thought the reason that the Solicitor General gives for not -- that NHTSA did not immediately require the type 2 seatbelt is because the costs would have been higher. Is that your understanding?",
  "How come allowing -­ or why doesn't allowing the relief you seek under State law impose those same costs, contrary to NHTSA's objective in not making those mandatory?",
  "And a State tort action does not?",
  "I suppose -- I understand the argument. I'm not sure it's right, though, in the sense that NHTSA may decide not to make particular standards mandatory for reasons other than cost. It may decide it doesn't think the technology is adequately developed. It may decide that it doesn't think there are adequate, you know, mechanics prepared or involved. But here it's because of the cost, and the relief you are seeking it seems to me directly imposes the costs that NHTSA decided not to require.",
  "Well, every -- there is no objective that the government pursues regardless of cost. I understand that their objective was to encourage this, but it was clearly not to impose it, because it thought at that time that the costs were too great. So to simply say their objective was to get these in ignores the other side of the cost/benefit analysis.",
  "What if the rule here had another provision that said you must have Type 1? You can have Type 2 -­",
  "You can have Type 2, right? But we are not requiring Type 2, because we think the costs on manufacturers would be too great. We may require it in the future, but not now. Is it the same? Is your position the same?",
  "Well, doesn't the -­ doesn't the increased costs that are imposed by the tort liability conflict with NHTSA's determination in my hypothetical that they're not requiring Type 2 because of the cost?",
  "Well, it said all those thing in Geier, too, didn't it?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jay.",
  "No -- I agree with you, it doesn't require. It doesn't support the inference that they did not want Type 2 seatbelts to happen, to be used. It does, in my hypothetical view, support the inference that it didn't want to mandate Type 2 seatbelts because it was worried, as you said in your brief at page 9, about the cost. And yet its worries about the cost, it seems to me, are overridden by the position that State tort suits can go on for the absence of Type 2 seatbelts.",

  "When you talk about safety to children, are you also addressing the strap going across the aisle or the strap interfering with vision? I know that is not directly related to children, but it affects what type of belt might be the safest overall.",
  "But state tort law doesn't, juries typically don't take into account the fleet costs of avoiding liability, which as I understand from the SG's brief in this case was the reason that Type 2 was not mandated, because of the overall costs. You have a jury with an injured plaintiff, they are not likely to weigh heavily the fact that this would cost 3 extra cents per car fleet wide. I think that is the sort of thing NHTSA considers.",

  "No, no. I'm trying -- I don't think that's my-- I hope that wasn't my question. It's how is it discriminating on the basis of religion if the STOs and the government money -- it doesn't care whether it goes to a religious school or not; it's treated the same?",
  "The State money going to the STO -- the State doesn't care whether it goes to a religious STO or a secular STO.",
  "I thought we've held that when you have the decision is made by a private entity whether to use the money to go to a religious school or a nonreligious school, that that doesn't violate the Constitution because the decision is not made by the State; it's made by the private recipient.",

  "Well, you keep focusing, Mr. Olson, on -- on this case. And one of the things that I think is important in the tax code is that you not have litigation of each different case, so the different courts are coming out with different rules. And, at the end of the day, you put one next to the other, and it looks pretty hard to tell the difference. So why doesn't it make sense simply to refer to -- defer to the Service's interpretation?",
  "You go back and -­ both of you go back and forth with hypotheticals, each of which sort of supports, but this basically a very familiar situation of an apprentice who is both an employee and both a student, and to try to draw the line in some categorical way doesn't make sense. The only way you can draw the line is to have somebody say: This is going to be the line. And if anybody is going to say it, it ought to be the IRS.",
  "You're not challenging that, are you, Mr. Olson?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Roberts.",
  "What if -- what if the school said: You have to get all this clinical experience, but we're going to pay you for the first two hours of the day that you're doing that.

But what if the school says: Well, look, we recognize some of this is going to school and some of this is working; so, just like the IRS, we're going to have an arbitrary rule and we're going to say you're being paid for the first two hours.",

  "We'll hear argument next in Case 09-1088, Cullen v. Pinholster. Mr. Bilderback.",
  "What about Dr. Stalberg's new deposition? Doesn't that count as a new fact? I'm looking at your brief on page 11. At a deposition just before the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Stalberg revealed that nothing in the new material called into question his original diagnosis.",
  "How does that work -­",
  "How does that work, counsel, if you have new evidence? My claim was decided, it was reasonable under (d)(1) based on what they knew, but I've come up with new evidence that I think could not have been reasonably discovered before the (d)(1) hearing? What happens to that? It seems to me you determine whether that evidence can come in under (e)(2).",
  "So -- so you think -- and I have trouble understanding the parties' position on this. When you talk about claims, you don't mean totally different legal bases; you mean different evidentiary support. The claim that it's ineffective assistance of counsel based on organic -- the failure to discover the organic brain damage you say might or might not be considered a new claim, and, therefore, (d)(1) would not be a bar to that.",
  "So then -- and the reason that doesn't undermine your position is because you think it's evidence that could have been discovered and presented earlier?",
  "I understand that. But if it were evidence that could not have been discovered previously, then (d)(1) does not bar looking at (e)(2)?",
  "If it's really a new claim?",
  "I suppose -- I suppose the Federal court can send it back to the State court for exhaustion.",
  "Just a second.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Kennedy.",
  "A finding under -­ under the standards that we've applied under AEDPA?",
  "We have to determine under AEDPA that it was objectively unreasonable for this lawyer to get a psychiatrist, or whatever his status was; to get a report, which he did, and which he looked at, in which the psychiatrist or psychologist said, look, there's nothing here, and he went through all the stuff that was there; and, in fact, after the Federal evidentiary hearing, he said, well, in light of this new evidence, I'm still correct; and objectively unreasonable for this lawyer to say, look, my best bet is to put his mother on the stand, that that might engender sympathy and portray him as not as bad a guy as everybody says, as opposed to putting on all this evidence that explains why he's such a bad guy. Those are two -- we've said those are reasonable choices. If you're relying on that basis, we have to decide that it is objectively unreasonable for a lawyer to proceed on that basis.",
  "Just to pause for a moment, you said there was no hearing in the State court. Well, that was because the State court, pursuant to the established procedures, assumed everything you wanted to show was true. It's a little bit much. I mean, you were not going to be in any better position after a hearing than you were before the State court.",
  "So you're putting your eggs in the basket that, under AEDPA, what happened here was objectively unreasonable?",
  "Or do you want to go on and look at the question on which we granted cert and argue that we should look at the new evidence or that the State court should look at the new evidence?",
  "Well, this -- your friend pointed it out, and I have to say it's a logical conundrum for me, too -- you have to show under (e)(2) that the factual predicate could not have been previously discovered, and your claim is that his lawyer should have discovered this. They both can't be true. And if the former is not true, you don't get a hearing; and if the latter is not true, you don't get relief.",
  "When you say the State court -- you just told us that this was better off because it's only 6 hours, and you said in State court they did nothing; is that right?",
  "When you say they did nothing, surely that was rhetorical hyperbole, and you took the 6 hours to say this proves what we said, they did nothing; they did next to nothing. You're not saying, oh, well, it was 6 hours, so we're sorry we said they did nothing.",
  "Well, that's -- that gets back to the point Justice Scalia was making, is that this is new evidence that the Ninth Circuit considered with respect to the original. In other words, they were not just saying, okay, even if none of this happened, we'd still rule against you, because one of the new things they had was the 6-hour evidence, which you've just said makes your case stronger. I think it does make your case stronger, but it also makes clear that we can't say let's just look -- the Ninth Circuit just looked at what was there originally.",
  "You're going back to arguing that you win under the original proceeding, and the question on which we granted cert -­",
  "-- shouldn't be addressed.",
  "Okay.",
  "How long does it take to read Dr. Stalberg's report that says I've looked at this, I've examined this, this, and this, and there's nothing here that's going to support a mental impairment theory?",
  "Counsel, just to get back to (e)(2), what is specifically the factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered in this case?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bilderback, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",

  "Go ahead, Justice Sotomayor.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Pincus.",
  "Mr. Gupta.",
  "If I could just go to your -- your second reason seemed to be focused particularly on arbitration as opposed to a principle that applies to every other contract.",
  "No, but the substantive State liability rule on the issue you are addressing is that you consider the issue of consent ex ante, and with respect to arbitration you are considering it at the time the dispute arose. Isn't that a discrimination against arbitration agreements?",
  "Well, sure. That's true in all of these cases.",
  "It's a question of what the State law provides; then you consider whether it's consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.",
  "Well, what other area of contract law does the court consider unconscionability not with respect to the parties before the court, but with respect to third parties?",
  "But isn't that -­ doesn't that look to the parties before the court rather than third parties?",
  "Well, it's a general rule of contract law that contracts contrary to public policy could be unenforceable. It seems to me that's quite different than saying we're worried about third parties that are in the same position as these particular parties. In other words, it's not simply adverse public consequences, but it's a different mode of analysis than I'm familiar with under basic contract law.",
  "Where do you get -­",
  "Where do you get \"obvious subterfuge\" in the Federal Arbitration Act?",
  "But that's in the independent and adequate State ground context, which strikes me as quite different. We have a statute here that says the arbitration agreements have to be treated like any other contract, any contract. I don't see how that's the same as obvious subterfuge.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Pincus, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-520, CSX Transportation v. The Alabama Department of Revenue. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Ms. Sherry.",
  "Well -- well, but in any case when you have discrimination, you can remedy it by reducing the tax, for example, in this case on the railroad or by increasing the tax on the people who are otherwise exempt.",
  "A decision that I suppose would be left at some point or another up to the State.",
  "But the discriminary -- the discriminary portion of the tax may be regarded as the excess that is imposed on the railroad or the deficiency on -- on the others.",
  "You can finish the sentence.",
  "Don't even try.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. General Maze.",
  "Well, you can single out the railroads through exemptions. I mean, let's say you have a tax of $1,000 per mile per day for anything that uses a thoroughfare in the State. However, things that use roads, waterways, you know, the long list that in effect leaves only the railroads exposed. You are saying that can't be regarded as a tax that discriminates against the railroads?",
  "Okay. So what if there's only two that pay it? Only -- and it applies only to railroads and bicycles?",
  "We can determine that a tax is not generally applicable based on the exemptions. If everybody else is exempt, well, it's not generally applicable. If just bicycles are also exempt, then it is not generally applicable. We have to look at the exemptions to decide whether there is discrimination.",
  "I'm sorry. Just so I follow: And that test says what?",
  "I'm sure I'm just repeating myself here. So that it doesn't single it out if there's one additional business or line of business subject to the tax, no matter how small that exemption is?",
  "Right.",
  "Exactly. So the Court has to decide, even when you are dealing with exemptions, whether or not that discriminates against the railroad?",
  "If I'm right, that means you lose the case -­",
  "-- at least as the question presented has been addressed, because all we are deciding -- I understand you think we ought to decide more, but all we are deciding is: Can (b)(4) ever come into play when the discrimination arises from an exemption?",
  "That's what railroads do.",
  "But it still doesn't get to the question that in courts in each particular case will be able to decide, even under your test, whether it singles out railroads. The only question I have is that whether singling out means railroads have to be the only business subject to it, or if it has to be, you know, some theory -- Justice Kennedy was looking for a test. I don't know if we have got a workable one -- to decide when it's really discriminating against the railroad and when it's that the exceptions are just the way taxes normally work.",
  "Do you think section 11501(c) is relevant to all these disputes, because one thing 11501(c) does is give the State a little bit of a break?",
  "They recognize that it is hard to have exact equality in terms of ad valorem property assessment. So, what does -- what does it say -- you know, a 5 percent legal room.",
  "Couldn't you, if we rule against you, when you get back and other State officials say, look, the one thing we don't have to worry about is being precise. We have got some legal room, so we can exempt the 85-year-old widow, we can, you know, exempt the farm property. We just kind of have to get it close so that if somebody looks at it, and they'll say, well, it doesn't really look like they are discriminating against railroads, why isn't that pertinent and why doesn't it respond to a lot of your concerns?",
  "No, I know. I'm using that not as saying that this is applicable to (b)(4), but that it gives you an idea that Congress didn't have the precise absolute rule, and you go one, you know, 1 inch over the line and you are in trouble.",
  "It clearly -- it clearly applies to (b)(1) through (3) and has got nothing to do with (b)(4) because it can't apply to (b)(4).",
  "(b)(4) is not a -­ (b)(4), the whole point is if it's not a property tax, you don't have ad valorem assessments, so the details limiting jurisdiction when you do have ad valorem taxes don't apply to this case at all.",
  "Thank you counsel.",
  "Mr. Phillips, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips, counsel. Case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-5801, Flores-Villar v. United States. Mr. Hubachek.",
  "Maybe this is -­ maybe you would like to answer Justice Breyer's question.",
  "No, he would have a remedy. The remedy for an equal protection violation is to treat everybody the same. You can do that either by lowering the people who are given a benefit or by increasing the people who aren't. So he has a remedy. His objection is, we're not being -- my father and my mother are not being treated the same. That's all of the relief he is entitled to.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Counsel, what if -­ if the Court were to determine that this does violate the Equal Protection Clause, and the court were also to determine that this is not a case that should be the first one in history in which it grants naturalization, what do you think the Court ought to do?",
  "On the ground that it violates equal protection.",
  "What about your friend's point that that retroactively deprives people of citizenship that we would be saying they should have gotten if the Equal Protection Clause had been enforced.",
  "Right. But here, of course, under my scenario we don't have a situation where Congress has addressed -- addressed the problem. So what do we do? If somebody under the theory that we say this person should not have been denied citizenship because of the unequal protection in the law, and he comes in and it's the same situation, he's going to be deported for not being an American citizen and he says I'm an American citizen.",
  "Does he get the benefit of that or not?",
  "The reason it doesn't grant that relief is somewhat unusual in this case. It only doesn't grant him relief because of the third-party standing. He doesn't care whether he's treated equally or not; he just wants to be -- claim the benefit of citizenship. The person where he would get relief is if it were the father, because the relief that he is entitled to is to be treated equally. That's it. The relief this person is asking for is not to be deported. And so the problem of the relief being granted is really complicated by the fact that it's a case of third-party standing.",
  "Counsel, if we determine that the only remedy we can impose is to equalize up -- in other words, add to the burden on the mother rather than relieving the father of it, do you have authority for the proposition that we can address that issue hypothetically? In other words, without making a decision on the equal protection question on the merits?",
  "In other words, look ahead and if you say, look, the only remedy that we are going to be able to give this person is a remedy that isn't going to benefit him regardless of how the merits are decided, therefore we don't reach the merits.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hubachek, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "You referred -- I'm sorry, you refer to the tradition of passing -- do you agree with Mr. Kneedler that there is no such right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel, the case submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-868, Wall v. Kholi. Mr. Weisman.",
  "Are those different than the characteristics that the sentencing judge looks at in the first instance?",
  "In other words, how these -- you've obviously seen a lot of these, and I haven't seen any, but I mean, do the Rule 35 motions typically say -- do they typically concede the legal validity of the sentence and then simply say -- what? I mean, I assume the sentencing is -- is completely open and you can put in anything at all, like the -- the deprived childhood, the unique situation, the age, whatever.",
  "In what sense is Rule 35 different from the arguments that are made at sentencing?",
  "But that's bad for you, isn't it, I mean for the very point that Justice Kennedy was raising? If it's the same sort of arguments that you get to raise as a legal matter prior to the imposition of sentencing, why should they not be considered legal matters when they're raised under Rule 35?",
  "Are those issues that can be -- that are typically raised on direct -­ direct review?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Mizner.",
  "Why don't you just call your motion a motion to correct an illegal sentence? Then we wouldn't have any dispute here, I gather.",
  "You're not one of the stupid lawyers that we were worried about before.",
  "I'm sure of that. But you do think that if you had -- if you or whoever files these motions had simply said that, there would be no problem, right?",
  "Well, it's because you want something other than legal review, right? You want to throw yourself on the mercy of the court. You've got plenty of avenues to correct the illegality of the sentence, but this is something different, right? This is to -- not correct -- you admit it's illegal, but you say but it should still be reduced for a lot of reasons.",
  "You can raise all of those -- all of those claims under the normal State collateral postconviction, State habeas, all those other things, right?",
  "So I guess I'm having trouble. You can -- the various grounds on which the sentence should have been lower than it was, including the fact that setting the sentence at that level was an abuse of discretion, you obviously can raise those at sentencing and you can raise those on direct review, right?",
  "Can you challenge it on -- in State habeas?",
  "That's the only vehicle you have -­",
  "It's the only vehicle you have for challenging the sentence.",
  "I -- I may have asked this already, but it seems unusual to me so I want to make sure of the answer. Your -- you have a client who is convicted of a particular offense that results in a sentence of, what, zero to 5 years, okay? And the judge, in imposing the sentence, engages in racial discrimination. It turns out that he sentences African-Americans to 5 years and Caucasian defendants to 2 years. That, you're telling me, is a claim that you cannot raise on direct review or on -- in State habeas?",
  "Well, you say it \"would be raised.\" Are you saying it can only be raised under Rule 35?",
  "That's what I would have thought. So Rule 35 is not the only vehicle for challenging a sentence?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, I guess the question -- and I'm sorry if I cut you off -- is not that this is a question of abuse, that it may be a good thing. The idea is you've got a motion for reduction of sentence because of mercy, and the judge might say: Well, I'm inclined to exercise mercy if you come out of the rehab program in a good way, if it turns out after the first several months that you're a model prisoner. In other words, it's not a question of abuse, it's a good thing; and if we start saying that the time for Federal habeas is tolled, judges might be inclined not to exercise such charity based on the prisoner's conduct after conviction.",
  "120 days, right?",
  "For filing?",
  "Right.",

  "And for it to be real -- just so I understand -- for it to be real, you have to have a defense counsel, a client comes to him with a non-frivolous Federal habeas claim, and the defense counsel says, I can't tell whether we're going to be barred by this time rule or not. Some courts, looks like we will; some don't. So -- what? Of course he's going to file the Federal habeas and see if it's determined to be adequate or inadequate, correct?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bigelow.",
  "Well, but everybody -- everybody in this room can tell him that he is obligated to file the petition as promptly as the circumstances allow. He has complete notice of that. And if he wants to go and do the research and say, well, here's one where they let it in after 5 months, but here's one where they didn't leave it in after 9 months, and he sits here and decides so I'm going to wait 9 months and put my money on that court -- that -- that is not a scenario that's likely to happen, right?",
  "You're not challenging that as the State rule, are you?",
  "Right.",
  "And they didn't look at possible justifications at all, correct?",
  "No, no. I'm not asking about Mr. Martin's.",
  "This -- the analysis that the amicus undertook simply looked at the chronological time. They did not consider the fact that, for example, somebody with 3 years might have had an explanation; somebody with 1 year might have not had any. And they may view those cases as different cases.",
  "Well, how did they look -- did they look for explanations for delay when you had the one-sentence denial?",
  "Well, how much range are you willing to give the State? Do they have 3 months' range? I mean, if you come in and say, well, here they were filed in 9 months and they were allowed, and here they were filed in 6 months and they weren't allowed. Is that a problem under our consistency requirement?",
  "No, it says -­",
  "It says \"as promptly as the circumstances allow.\" And then they go back and say there is a 3-range, a 3-month range.",
  "You do the same sort of research you've done here, and you find out that -­ that there's a 3-month range. Sometimes -- I mean, there are cases and you can show a lot where they are allowed at 9 months, and then you find cases that are not allowed under 6 months.",
  "Now, I understand that you'd have a much stronger case if you were dealing with a judge-made rule about timeliness, if the courts, on their own authority, said, look, we're not going to look at things that are filed 4 years late because that prejudices the State, it prejudices us, et cetera. But here you have something different. You have a rule, right? An established rule: promptly as the circumstances allow.",
  "Judge-made, but it's been around for a long time. This isn't a new rule that's just coming in.",
  "Well, let me get back. I tried to -- when you made that point earlier, I wanted to follow up on it. Your claim is not that you don't know or defendants in California don't know that the rule is \"as promptly as the circumstances allow,\" do you?",
  "No. I thought you had fair notice of that rule.",
  "Okay.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Marshall, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument in Case 09-1233, Schwarzenegger v. Plata, and the related cases. Mr. Phillips.",
  "I'm sorry. Could you answer Justice Ginsburg's question first?",
  "Counsel, I see your time is about to expire.",
  "Mr. Specter.",
  "Did -- I'm sorry. Let me just keep track here. The evidence was cut off when in 2008?",
  "All right. So -­",
  "You -- you don't dispute the statement I have -- it's in the response of the intervenors -- that between October 2006 and October 2010, the population of the adult facilities declined by 14,832 inmates?",
  "But that's not what -- that is not what the three-judge district court determined. The Prisoner Litigation Reform Act requires that court to give substantial weight to adverse impact on public safety.",
  "And when -- and then it said to the State, look, you come up with a plan that gets you to 137.5 in 2 years.",
  "The State did -­",
  "-- and the State did not say -- emphatically did not say this is not going to have an adverse impact on public safety.",
  "If you follow the double negative there. But -- and what the district court said -- it didn't examine that. It said, well, we're sure the State's not going to do anything that has an adverse impact on public safety. I'm looking at page 4a of the jurisdictional statement.",
  "It said -- and so it did not make those determinations, but the PLRA requires it to determine that what it's ordering -- or at least give substantial weight to the public safety issue. So isn't that a basis for overturning the remedy that's imposed here?",
  "I thought you would.",
  "Did he want to do it within the 2-year period the district court ordered?",
  "Right. Right. No, my -- my question is specifically with respect -­",
  "-- to the 2-year plan -­",
  "-- and I'd like an answer to that -­",
  "-- because I look at this record; I don't see that the district court did what was required by the Act with respect to the plan that it's ordering.",
  "It just simply said, oh, we're sure -- I'm sure the State wouldn't do anything to hurt public safety -- after telling the State you've got to give me a plan in 2 years that gets to 137.5.",
  "Well, they said we're sure, because -- but -­",
  "-- because we trust -- I'm just quoting from 4a -­",
  "\"We trust that the State will comply with its duty to ensure public safety as it implements the constitutionally required reduction.\" The State is saying it cannot meet the 137.5 in 2 years without an adverse impact on public safety.",
  "Right.",
  "I think -­",
  "I think Justice Sotomayor has been patient.",
  "Well, but I thought the -­",
  "Maybe you can answer.",
  "Maybe you can answer, counsel, please.",
  "Can I ask you a hypothetical question that I know is not your case? But let's say you had the district court entering an order saying you have to bring it down to 137.5 in 2 years. That will, as a practical matter, result in the release of 40,000 prisoners. The State comes back and makes a showing supported by experts saying, look, if you give us 4 years, we can reach the figure without releasing any prisoners. Do you think it would violate the Prison Litigation Reform Act for the district court to say: No, I want this done in 2 years, not 4 years, and we'll just have to deal with the fact there are going to be 40,000 prisoners out on the streets.",
  "Right.",
  "I'm sorry. I couldn't -- what was the first -­",
  "Seven-zero?",
  "Counsel, one of the thing that concerns me about this type of institutional reform litigation -­",
  "-- is that the State is responsible for a lot of different things.",
  "And what happens when you have this case, another district court ordering the State to take action with respect to environmental damage, another court saying, well, you've got to spend this much more on education for disabled, another court saying you've got to spend this much more on something else? How does the State sort out its obligations? Does it say -­",
  "-- well, I'll spend more money to build prisons, but I'll violate this other district court order saying I have to spend more money to build water treatment plants?",
  "I know you like your particular case -­",
  "-- and you want the State to say this is where I'm going to put my money.",
  "But the point is it's a budget prioritization that the State has to go through -­",
  "-- every day, and now it's being transferred from the State legislature to Federal district courts throughout the State.",
  "No, no. I believe that as well, counsel.",
  "What I'm saying is that you have conflicting orders from different district courts telling them you've got to comply with the Constitution by spending 8 billion here; and another court saying, I've got another constitutional problem of my own, and you've got to spend 8 billion over there. What is the State supposed to do in that situation?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes left.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips, Mr. Specter. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-804, Cigna Corporation v. Amara. Mr. Olson.",
  "Then you can't -­",
  "Then you can't require, it seems to me, each individual to make a calculation about whether they have actually been harmed, whether there's detrimental reliance. The whole point of these plans is to give people some comfort and assurance when they are age whatever, that: Don't worry; retirement is taken care, or at least I can rely on that. And your formulation would sort of put that up in the air and say: We don't know if you're going to be harmed or not; wait until you're 65 and we will see.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Bruce.",
  "It seems to me that it's a very tough argument to say -- to make a nondisclosure claim on the theory that the summary is part of the plan, because the whole point of a summary is not to disclose everything. If it disclosed everything, it wouldn't be a summary. And if you can claim something because it didn't disclose it, it seems to me that's in tension with the idea that it's not supposed to be just a repetition of the plan.",
  "Could I just stop -­ the securities cases, does that involve stock traded in a market, in which case the inference of harm would be much more obvious and follow more logically than in the trust context?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1163, Milner v. The Department of the Navy. Mr. Mann.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang.",
  "Why? If these -- if these maps are so sensitive as you suggested, why weren't they classified?",
  "I'm sorry, I don't understand that. It's different to classify when?",
  "Well, surely, you classify documents that are shared outside the Federal Government?",
  "Could you classify these maps after -- I mean, assume that you don't prevail, could you then classify these documents, preventing their release before they're released?",
  "No, I mean, isn't it the case when a government agency has to go through its records in response to a FOIA request and comes upon records that would otherwise be disclosable, they can at that point say we're going to classify this so we don't have to disclose it.",
  "It seems to me you're asking us to do your job. You've got to go through these documents and say -- you're telling us how sensitive these are, and, therefore, it would harm the national interest if they had to be disclosed.",
  "If that's true, you can classify them and -­",
  "-- instead of coming to us and saying you should torture the language in FOIA to allow us to determine that this is sensitive to the national interest and therefore shouldn't be disclosed.",
  "I would have thought that the amendment to Exemption 7 really cut the other way. They amended Exemption 7; they didn't amend Exemption 2.",
  "To adopt more or less Crooker, right?",
  "Yes. Exactly, not this one.",
  "For what level of classification? I gather the investigation of the person is quite different depending upon what level you want, if you want to give -­",
  "The lower things below secret -­",
  "Are those sufficient classifications to prevent disclosure under FOIA?",
  "What is it, sensitive?",
  "And so, if you label something confidential, you don't have to disclose it under FOIA?",
  "I'm sorry. You wouldn't regard internal security procedures for computer systems as confidential?",
  "And all of which you already have to review to compile the Vaughn index and to make sure there are not other exemptions that are applicable, right? You don't just grab a bunch of files and turn them over. You look at them before you release them under FOIA.",
  "You don't have to go through everything. You have to go through the material that is requested, and you go through that material already.",
  "And it takes forever to get the documents.",
  "Right.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mann, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 09-529, the Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart. Mr. Galanter.",
  "Counsel, if this were a private suit, let's say Ford Motor Company has two subsidiaries, Ford East and Ford West. They get into a dispute. Ford West sues Ford East. No Federal court would entertain that action, would it?",
  "Yes. They think -- Ford West thinks Ford East is discriminating on the basis of race.",
  "That adversely affects their reputation, too, so they sue them.",
  "No, no. It's independent -- right -- it's independent from what?",
  "Yes -­",
  "-- but is it independent from the State? Is that what the statute says?",
  "You say on page 27 of your brief, the blue brief, that there's no big deal here with respect to State sovereignty because ultimately the sovereign retains the authority to dissolve the State agency plaintiff if the State believes the litigation is too onerous.",
  "That's a good -- a good cite for your proposition, but arguably in those cases, the ICC is really not the real party in interest. The real party in interest is the beneficiary of the ICC ruling.",
  "To get -- to get back to my question, you -- no court would entertain Ford West against Ford East?",
  "Not divisions; separate corporate entities that happened to be wholly owned by the same parent.",
  "Well, I would have thought that would become an advisory opinion. Ford has an internal dispute, basically, and your -- in that hypothetical, one of the entities would be asking the Federal court to resolve it. Ford can decide at the end of the day how it wants to resolve it. If Ford West wins and Ford East loses, Ford can say, all right, this is how we're going to do it regardless of what the Federal court says.",
  "Well, the State here is free to dissolve one of the -- one of the parties to the case. That's -- that's a little different.",
  "All right, State, Commonwealth.",
  "Oh.",
  "Well, right, but that makes all the difference in the world because they made the choice of saying this is going to be one of us, the State. And as far as what issue is before the Court, I would suppose the Article III question is a jurisdictional one that we have to address before reaching the Eleventh Amendment question.",
  "Well, just -- I know you're anxious to get to that, but -­",
  "-- do you know -- do you know of any other situation where one party to a Federal court action can dissolve the other one in the middle of the case? I mean, if VOPA files a discovery request with the State and they think it is, as you put it in your brief, too onerous, the State can say: Guess what, the case is over, you're dissolved.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders.",
  "Can EPA sue the Army Corps of Engineers for violating the Clean Water Act?",
  "Oh, very adverse. EPA wants clean water, and the Army Corps of Engineers wants to, you know, dredge the water in a way that contributes to pollution.",
  "Do you agree with the Petitioners that Virginia can dissolve VOPA if it finds the litigation too onerous?",
  "If -- if it happened to arise, do you think that they can -- do you agree with the Petitioners that they can do it?",
  "Are you sure that the governor cannot remove the members of VOPA? I know it says VOPA has to be independent of any State agency, and the governor appoints one-third. Can the governor remove the members of this Virginia agency?",
  "What would it not -­ what would it not comply with? I just don't know. I'm just looking at the provision where you say it's independent, and it says independent of any State agency. You said the governor may not appoint more than one-third. I just wonder if there's a prohibition on him removing.",
  "Where is that?",
  "What if the VOPA officials are engaged in corruption or illegal conduct or, you know, extracurricular activity that brings discredit upon the -- the governor has no power to say that, you're a Virginia official and you're -- you know, whatever -- breaking Virginia law, for example? And -­",
  "Thank you, Ms. Anders. Mr. Getchell.",
  "I'm sorry. I don't think so -- what? You don't think Congress -­",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Galanter, have you 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. I have one question of curiosity. You said in your opening argument that 49 of 50 States limit in some way the executive's power in this area.",
  "What's the one State?",
  "Thank you. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1036, Henderson v. Shinseki. Ms. Blatt.",
  "Well, counting -- I appreciate all those points, but counting -- cutting, perhaps, the other way is that it's not a real adversarial system before you get to that stage. It's a collaborative effort, the Veterans Administration and the -- the individual.",
  "Which seems to me may counterbalance a little bit the fact that the veterans are uncounseled.",
  "I think -- unless I'm missing the point of my colleague's question, it's two different issues. Of course, they don't participate in the court. They're not -- they're not lawyers. But it's not clear to me why they wouldn't participate at least in the process of saying you've got to file your notice and here's where you file it. Are you saying they don't do that?",
  "I mean, they do it regularly, and they -- every now and then, they file it in the wrong place?",
  "I don't see how that works. You've got somebody there, and he has been telling them where to file it and file it and file it, and all of a sudden he tells him to file it someplace else?",
  "What -- what clear statement rule are you talking about?",
  "Yes, I know. I remember that.",
  "I remember that. I thought that that was a prospective bright-line rule. It's kind of hard to apply a new bright-line rule retrospectively. I understood what we said in those cases to be: Look, Congress, we're tired of trying to sort out this ambiguity. From now on, if you want it to be treated as jurisdictional, tell us it's jurisdictional. That makes sense prospectively, but it doesn't make sense to do that to statues that were passed before we announced our bright-line preference.",
  "No. I'm trying -- I understand -- changing the subject -- but in my question, you invoked the bright-line rule of Arbaugh that the statute should say \"jurisdictional.\" And I'm just saying that only makes sense prospectively.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Miller.",
  "Of course -­",
  "Of course, in Bowles it was from an Article III court to another Article III court. Here, although we're dealing with an Article I court, there are characteristics of what you might call internal agency review. The court is specialized with respect to veterans' affairs, and there are particular standards for review that you don't find when you're talking about between the district court and the court of appeals.",
  "I guess it's related -- just to get everything out on the table, it's related to the same point that I thought was significant in Bowles: That you are dealing with a time limitation that lawyers had long recognized as being, you know, a drop-dead date.",
  "And it made some sense. I mean, when you look at the statistics, when you get into this court, the veterans almost always win, right?",
  "My point was the exact opposite: That if you -- if they almost always win, you assume that Congress wouldn't want to cut them off, because it's -- you know, if only 1 percent of the veterans appealing win, then you might understand an absolute rule, because they're not as -- statistically anyway, we're not losing much. But if, as I understand to be the case, about 80 percent of them win, you might cut them a little slack on appealing because it is a very significant part of the -- the process.",
  "What -- what is the reversal rate?",
  "Any idea what the normal rule is from district court to court of appeals?",
  "No, what I -­",
  "I sense some confusion here, given what you and your friend have said. What do you mean when you say \"counseled\"? Do you mean --- I mean, if you have somebody from the American Legion that is telling this person here's what you need to do, does he get a notice, or are you talking about just the situation where somebody comes in and says, I'm -- well, I'm this person's lawyer, or I'm representing him in some other way?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Counsel, I want to clear up this represent -- represented business.",
  "I understood you to say in the -- your opening that represented -- most of these people are not represented, and they're -- to the extent the American Legion participates, they don't get notice of the order that triggers the 120 days. Now, I understood Mr. Miller to tell us that 80 percent of the people have registered representatives and they do get notice.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Was that person helping him registered as a representative?",
  "Well, is that the exception, then? I mean, Mr. Miller tells us 80 percent of the people do have registered representatives.",
  "It doesn't matter how far away they are if he gets notice.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 09-6822, Pepper v. United States. Mr. Parrish.",
  "Counsel, I think you -- I think you've got a difficult job navigating between your two issues. It seems on the first one, the 40 percent to 20 percent, you're saying: Look, you've got to stick with what you did before. And when it gets to the post-sentencing consideration, you're saying: Well, we can -- all bets are off; we can start -- start anew; we can look at things that have happened since. Is there a way you reconcile that -­ those -- that tension?",
  "Well, that's kind of a fortuitous situation, then. You're sort of saying if you end up with the same judge, she can reconsider her own prior determination. But if you, for whatever reason, the death of the first judge, you're in a different judge, she's bound by what went before. That doesn't seem right.",
  "Well, it's -- it's warranted that the one get the benefit, and it's unwarranted that the other does not. I mean, the departure in the case of the one who gets reconsideration is warranted, but that doesn't mean that the disparity is warranted.",
  "You may want to -­",
  "-- reserve time. Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. McLeese. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY W. McLEESE, III,",
  "Counsel, perhaps before your time is up, you'd like to address the first question.",
  "But it has nothing -- but what if the appeal had nothing to do with the issue at all? I'm thinking in -- the analogy in the civil context, so you have two totally unrelated issues. If you appeal issue B and that's what the fight is about, and you reverse and send it back, it would at least be unusual for judge to say, oh, and by the way, I'm coming out the other way on issue A.",
  "But these are not interconnected, are they?",
  "No, my point is that the level of assistance is not in any way connected to the post-sentencing conduct.",
  "No, but why -- why does that matter when you're talking about two totally unrelated issues?",
  "There's no reason to suppose that the court of appeals thinks there ought to be -- or any issue with respect to the question A when they focus solely on question B.",
  "So, you're worried about the general rule, but you agree that none of those arguments make any sense in this case.",
  "That would not interfere with the new judge's or the judge's discretion across the board?",
  "I have never had to sentence someone, but it seems to me, particularly when you have a change in the judges, there's a very personal investment in what you do with the -- the defendant, and to say that, well, another judge looked at this factor so your hands are tied in that respect is -- is a questionable result.",
  "Is there reason to suppose when they say de novo resentencing, they're talking about the mistake that was made with respect to issue B and not issue A?",
  "Do they -- is it their practice in some cases to say we're sending this back for de novo sentencing but only with respect to the issue that we addressed? Or do they just normally throw it out and say start over, without any supposition that the district court would take a look again at something that wasn't before the court of appeals at all?",
  "Could they -- are you aware of any case where the Eighth Circuit has said we're sending this back for resentencing but only on the issue that we addressed on appeal?",
  "Finish your sentence.",

  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Parrish, you have 2 minutes remaining.",

  "I understood your brief, and certainly the Government's brief, to take a very expansive view of what type of retaliation would give rise to a cause of action by the -- the directly harmed employee. Now you seem to be suggesting that that employee would not have Article III standing to bring an action.",
  "Thank you -­",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kruger.",
  "You -­",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Well, but you say -­ but it won't be because of the degree of connection between the -- the retaliated-against employee and the means of retaliating. I understood your brief. I'm just looking at page 6. The limitation you propose is someone -­ someone close to him. The anti-retaliation prohibition \"prohibits an employer from firing an employee because someone close to him filed an EEOC complaint.\" And I guess I have the same concern that we've been discussing for a little while. How are we supposed to tell, or how is an employer supposed to tell, whether somebody is close enough or not?",
  "But Burlington Northern, of course, is quite different, because you're just -- you're dealing with the obvious plaintiff in that case. You -- your -- your concern is confined to a particular person. In this hypothetical, it's an unlimited universe that you don't have any reason to know where it ends.",
  "Well, can't they talk about that?",
  "I mean, it's not like you're dealing with strangers. That's the whole point. It's someone close to them. I -- on the one hand you're saying, well, you only have to worry about people really close, and then your response to this line of questioning is, well, the other person might not sue. They're going to sit and say: Well, you sue. No, you sue.",
  "Why is that a problem? You're dealing with people who are close. They assume the person who was hurt, the person retaliated against, would sue. Well, why -- why don't they? You said that person has a valid suit.",
  "They're lay people. They don't know about Article III.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Kruger. Ms. Latherow.",
  "Wait, wait. Who is the person who is discriminated against in the hypothetical?",
  "Okay.",

  "I suppose if the lawyers for the trust did an inadequate job of reviewing the JCM drafts, they would be subject to a malpractice action by the trust?",
  "Could you -­",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick.",
  "How can -- I'm sorry. Please -­",
  "Except -- except when they review material going in the prospectus.",
  "Then they have independent representation by outside counsel.",
  "I don't understand -- I don't understand your answer. The outside counsel reviews what the policy is going to be.",
  "Our question is the validity of that statement, whether that's deceptive in the prospectus. That seems to me to be an entirely different question. I understood your theory of the case to be that JCM is liable, basically, because they put it in the prospectus.",
  "Well, that's the question, I guess, that -- your response seems to beg the question -- is that they falsely represented. The issue is whether or not something happened between their drafting and its appearance in the prospectus that makes it appropriate to say that that's a statement of the trust rather than a statement of JCM.",
  "I'm sorry to interrupt, but it seems be an important -- when they issued the prospectus -­",
  "Who issued the prospectus?",
  "And the SEC has recognized that they remain two separate entities, despite this interconnected relationship.",
  "The one -- the one activity -­",
  "The one activity that we know they did not outsource was review of the materials submitted by JCM. They had independent counsel that conducted that review. Would it have been a breach of the trustees' fiduciary obligations to the fund investors under common law -- I forget where this is incorporated -- to rubber-stamp what they get from somebody on the outside, not to have independent counsel review what they're going to say in their prospectus?",
  "Well, it seems to me -­",
  "Isn't -- isn't that, again, what has been conceded: That there may well be an action from the fund represented by their trustees against -­",
  "Except -- except to the SEC, right? Because they can pursue it under aiding and abetting. It's kind of a big -­",
  "-- problem if you're trying to say we're safe from actions for security fraud.",
  "Well, I know, but you were just responding by saying the problem is that this will give people a road map. But they're going to hit a pretty big bump in the road when the SEC brings an action against them, including potential criminal actions.",
  "The SEC -­",

  "-- to get back, so you are conceding that if you lose this case, you will be unable to bring any aiding and abetting case in a situation such as this?",

  "Thank you, Mr. Perry. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 09-115, Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Katyal.",
  "Just to pose there, we've had a little discussion about what licensing laws are, but we haven't talked at all about those last two words, \"and similar laws.\" It seems to me that whatever wiggle room or ambiguity there may be in saying whether this is a license or not, Congress swept pretty broadly. It said, not just licensing laws, but licensing and similar laws.",
  "I'm sorry. Let me just -- I mean, businesses had to have licensing laws pretty much across the board, right? You couldn't set up a -- I don't know -- an electrical contracting business if you didn't -- weren't licensed to do business or met the requirements for an electrician. It wasn't just agricultural work.",
  "Even if they said -­",
  "Even if they said \"and you have to renew your license every year or every 6 months\"?",
  "You don't disagree that whether or not a company hires illegal workers is related to quality or -- or ability to do business or qualification?",
  "Counsel, just so I get -- make sure I understand your approach. You're saying that Arizona had a law saying you have to have a license to do business, and then it became aware of a problem it wasn't aware of before -- it found out that a lot of employers were employing child labor, and they didn't know they would do that -- and they say we can revoke your license if you're determined to have employed child labor; that that would not be okay?",
  "But it would be okay if, in the original licensing thing, they said \"and you can't employ child labor\"?",
  "But you had -­",
  "I was just going to say you tried earlier to talk about the two boxes, and you said something would be pre-empted by the first clause. Anything -- civil and criminal sanctions are allowed if they're imposed through licensing and similar laws. There are not two boxes. The State can do what's in the first part so long as it does it through licensing or similar laws.",
  "Is it similar to a licensing law?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Grady.",
  "Could you -- I wasn't quite sure what she meant. Judge Schroeder, in her opinion for the court, emphasized that this statute was being evaluated on its -- on its face and that -­ she said in as-applied, particular challenges might arise. How would that work? If we determine this is not pre-empted, how would -- on its face, how would an as-applied challenge come about?",
  "So you think you are home free under State law?",
  "It's an affirmative defense under both.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Well, except -­ well, you're just kind of blinking over the savings clause: except through licensing and similar laws. So that's not a real reservation by Congress of this power to itself.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-329, Chase Bank v. McCoy. Mr. Waxman.",
  "This is not new to you, is it, this method of proceeding?",
  "Do I understand -­ before you move in the direction you'd like to, I understand your view to be that Chevron and Auer apply, and it's consistent with Mead because you have more indications that Congress delegated this authority to the Board than you -- than were present in Mead?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Palmore.",
  "I take it, apart from the amendment to the rule, you think those circumstances provide for Chevron/Auer deference.",
  "Our Long Island health care case?",
  "Could you address your friend's contention that because the notice doesn't occur -- the notice that the increase has gone into effect doesn't occur until the end of a billing cycle, it's a retroactive increase without notice.",
  "But it is correct to characterize what's being allowed under your interpretation as an increase in rates without notice?",
  "Well, advance notice --",
  "Advance notice is notice, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Beck.",
  "Well, that's just saying that the problem that Justice Ginsburg is concerned with isn't likely to come up, because a credit card issuer realizes he's not going to get chosen by a consumer if he says your rate is going to be somewhere between 5 and 20 percent. No one's going to sign up for that card.",

  "You're talking about -- you're talking about who's right or wrong about the connection between Matrixx and anosmia. But that's not the question. I'm an investor in Matrixx; I worry whether my stock price is going to go down. You can have some psychic come out and say Zicam is going to cause a disease, with no support whatsoever, but if it causes the stock to go down 20 percent, it seems to me that's material.",
  "But -­",
  "A reasonable investor is going to worry about the fact that thousands of unreasonable investors are going to dump their Matrixx stock.",
  "So -- but, I mean, there's nothing unreasonable about that. If it looks -­ if you're looking at Good Morning America, you say, my gosh, everybody else is going to sell this; I'm going to sell, too. And if it turns out you knew about it, you should have told me about it before.",
  "It may not know, but it certainly can know.",
  "If you -- if you know this is a very false report, but we know that, I don't know, the surgeon general, somebody, is going to come out and announce it and that will cause an effect -­",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hacker. Mr. Frederick.",
  "In response to Justice Alito, I heard you say something about a scientifically plausible link.",
  "That seems to me to be a rather significant concession. In other words, you're saying it's not simply the fact that some psychic would say something, that that is not sufficient, even if that has an impact on the market price, that there has to be some scientifically plausible link to the report.",
  "So what protection is there at the summary judgment stage in response to allegations? Because it doesn't have to be scientifically valid; it can be completely irrational. All you have to do is allege that, you know, if you had told this, the price would have gone down. If you had told -- if you had disclosed this, the price would have gone down. And the response from the company is, well, but this is just ridiculous; this is some guy in his garage who writes this out on -- on a -- you know, a piece of paper in -- in handwriting. And the response is going to be, well, let's let the jury sort it out.",
  "Well, you just told me that it would be enough if somebody says that there's a satanic, you know, impact on this, because a reasonable investor would say there are enough crazy people out there that this is going to affect the price.",
  "So it matters whether -- I don't know what kind of product has particular satanic susceptibility -­",
  "-- but I mean, are you saying it matters if it's something that -- that Satan's not going to be interested in? I don't understand.",
  "I don't mean to be facetious, but your way of distinguishing the satanic product is that it depends on whether people who follow satanic cults are going to be interested or not. I mean -­",
  "Okay. So that -- I'm just trying to get your response to that. You just talked again about credible scientists and all that, and you're putting those other things to one side. So even if you have your satanic problem, that is not enough. And you can sit there and allege it would cause a drop of 30 percent in the stock price, and you should have let this know -- your answer is no, they don't have to let -- they don't have to disclose this because there is no scientific credible basis for the link that's alleged?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Shah.",
  "You would have -­ you just said they would have a duty to disclose.",
  "I thought you earlier just said there's no affirmative duty to disclose; it only is based on what they say.",
  "Right.",
  "Is there any way that consideration of those factors would support a -- a summary judgment in favor of the pharmaceutical manufacturer, other than the fact of having an extremely poor lawyer drafting a complaint? Anytime you have a variety of factors like that -­",
  "-- I think it's very difficult for the judge to say anything other than that's for the jury.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, no, I'm talking about -- I'm talking about materiality. In other words -­",
  "-- based solely on -- in other words, you're saying if they say anything related, it's going to be enough -­",
  "-- whether it's a scientific basis or not.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hacker, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 137 on our original docket, Montana v. Wyoming and North Dakota. General Bullock.",
  "But you -- this is where it's been talking about beneficial uses. What the compact said -- says is appropriative rights to beneficial uses. And to me that suggests, which I always understood to be the way water law worked in the west, is you have a right to pull out, you know, water, and the appropriative right is you have the right to take out however much you were taking out. And the fact that less comes back, that's something different. That doesn't affect your appropriation.",
  "Well, isn't that what's going on here? The beneficial use is irrigation of crops. They have an appropriative right to take out so much flow for that. That's all they're doing. They're doing it now, just as they were back then. They just use up more of it once they've taken it out.",
  "I don't understand why that's a good -- good answer. I mean, the beneficial use is that use by which the water supply is depleted. Well, the use here is irrigation. It doesn't say irrigation up to the technological development in 1950. They're still taking out the same amount of water for that beneficial use. They're using it to irrigate. And if they get better at it so they use more, well, that's just too bad for you.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michael.",
  "Just to follow up on Justice Kennedy's point, because I think it's important: So you were reading -- when it says \"is depleted,\" you think all you have to show is that it's less than when you started, and once that is shown, it is depleted. Then you're saying, but we can deplete as much as we want?",
  "Yes.",
  "And you don't care how much? You're saying, well, this is a beneficial use because it depletes some of the water, it takes some away, and once we have gotten over that hurdle, all bets are off and we can deplete as much as we want.",
  "Well, I guess to get back to the point, wouldn't the normal word be \"divert\"?",
  "Counsel, just before you sit down, what makes you think we've deferred the remedy question? It's presented. It's been briefed. I don't know why you think we've deferred it. Whether or not Montana has to take care of intrastate uses -­ that's what I understand the remedy question to be. You briefed it.",
  "Well, thank you. Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Jay, maybe you can help clarify something. The -- the second question presented, which involves what Montana has to do before they -- that's still before us, right?",
  "I know you want us -- you don't want us to reach it, but it's still before us.",
  "Well, I always thought in addition that's kind of the way appropriation law works in the west, right? I mean, the person who gets it, gets it.",
  "Well, I mean, I don't mean -- I mean, isn't that the difference between eastern water law and western water law? In the east, you try to allocate everything fairly so everyone is treated fairly, and I thought in the west, for reasons of efficiency, it's first come, first served.",
  "You keep saying everybody gets the same beneficial use they had prior to 1950, but -- even though that may mean they can't do it. In other words, they may have a right to get 50 cubic whatever for irrigation, but there may not be any water there for them to use it because of the increased efficiencies upstream.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Jay. General, you have 2 minutes left.",
  "Thank you, General, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1343, J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro. Mr. Fergenson.",
  "Perhaps you'd like to reserve some of your time for rebuttal, counsel.",
  "Thank you. Mr. Ross.",
  "What if he said we want to do that, but we don't like New Jersey, so don't sell our products in New Jersey, and the Ohio company nonetheless does so? Can you get them -- can you hale them into court in New Jersey?",
  "But he said: But I have no intention of selling in New Jersey; I'm afraid I might get sued there, and I don't want to get sued there. He is not entering the stream of commerce in the United States. He's entering a stream of commerce that detours around New Jersey.",
  "Yes.",
  "Oh, it would be excluded?",
  "So it depends on the intent of the manufacturer?",
  "Maybe you could respond to Justice Breyer's -­",
  "What difference does it make that they go to a trade show somewhere other than New Jersey? We have the notion that they're availing themselves of the -- the entire United States market. That's -- I'll accept that.",
  "What does the trade show in Nevada add to the jurisdictional ties to New Jersey?",
  "With Nevada?",
  "What if there is no scrap metal plant in Montana? Can Montana be a jurisdiction in a case like this? You know, a Montana worker is over in New Jersey and comes back to his home in Montana, and he's been injured. Do they avail themselves of the market in Montana when there's no market for their products there?",
  "No, no. He's just injured by one of the machines somewhere else, but he's from Montana. Can he sue in Montana?",
  "Well, I thought -- I thought this was what the case was all about: whether this is -- the stream of commerce is sufficient to add a basis on top of the plaintiff's residence.",
  "And I would have thought -- to me, that's a significant limitation on your theory to say that in areas where you don't expect to be haled into court because your machine is not going to be used, you can't be.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, no. Not the machine.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, exactly.",
  "Could it be put elsewhere? Could it be put in the other State?",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, better -- I know -- I know you think it's better, but can he be sued in Montana? What I'm trying to get at, obviously, is we're talking about the stream of commerce in the United States, but the stream doesn't wash over the United States evenly. The manufacturer, as I asked earlier, may decide I don't want to sell New Jersey.",
  "The manufacturer may reasonably assume his machines aren't going to be in Montana because there's no scrap metal business in Montana. So I'm just trying to see if there are limitations to your theory about the stream of commerce covers everything.",
  "Right, but the market cannot be simply the United States, because you carve out New Jersey if the manufacturer does, you carve out Montana if --",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, what if -­",
  "Let's say he does know, it's a component part for something that is sold, widely sold, in the United States. Or it's a component part of this machine.",
  "But why would it be -­",
  "So you have an entirely different test.",
  "You have -- you have an entirely different test for a component manufacturer than you do for the finished product manufacturer. The component manufacturer may well know to a certainty that his component is going to be used in a product that's sold in the United States. Let's say he makes a component for this machine.",
  "Why is that different? Shouldn't it be the same test?",
  "He makes -- let's say he makes the 25-inch blade that only goes into this machine. That's the only market for it. Does -- no difference?",
  "I'm sorry. That was poorly phrased. Is it the same test for the machine, or is it a different test? Is it your component test?",
  "How can there not -­ how can there possibly not be purposeful availment if the manufacturer of the 25-inch blade knows it's only going to be used in McIntyre's machine and it knows that McIntyre is trying to sell its machine in the United States?",
  "He put it in a product that is only going to be -- that he knows is going to be sold in the United States.",
  "You have a partnership. One of the partners makes the shell of the machine; the other partner makes the insides of the machine. Are they, as individual companies -- are they availing themselves of the United States market?",
  "Can -- maybe everybody knows this except me. Do you -- are Web sites targeted to the United States? Don't you -- you can -­ let's say they put it on their Web site in England. Can't you -- can't -- can't I access that from here?",
  "So they don't even have to send the Web site to the United States? They just have to have a Web site?",
  "So it has to be interactive?",
  "If it's just -- what if it says, here, we're McIntyre -- on a Web site -- we make these machines; give us a call at this number if you want to buy one?",
  "Not enough?",
  "And this distinction is somewhere in the Due Process Clause?",
  "Complete? He's got to complete the transaction?",
  "What if it's -­",
  "-- you know, punch these numbers, and we will send you an application for a machine? Is that not enough, because he's got to complete the transaction?",
  "So that if they say fill this out, and contact this person, McIntyre, whatever, in Ohio, that's where you can get one of our machines -- that's enough?",
  "Would their -­",

  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Horwich.",
  "There's at least one other person in the courtroom who was hoping that, too.",
  "And briefly.",
  "Saved by the bell.",
  "Ms. Peddie.",
  "And don't you think that's a question as to which we ought to have some sensitivity to the views of the United States expressed here by the Solicitor General? It certainly implicates foreign relations concerns.",

  "I'm sorry. Looking -- looking -- I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but looking for a safe place to stop violates the statute?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Marsh. Mr. Wall.",
  "Well, but that's not -- 14 isn't very many. And I assume the vast majority of these cases aren't litigated.",
  "Well, I read your brief, and I was -- I read your brief and was surprised that when you're -- the list -- one of the things you talk about to show that is media reports. You usually have a more concrete basis for -- for speculation than media reports.",
  "Well, one of the -­",
  "Another word is \"aggressive\" in Begay, and that's where I have a little difficulty with your argument. It seems to me, this is the exact opposite of aggressive. He's running away. Certainly, the other option is to turn and confront, and he doesn't want to. There's nothing aggressive about running away.",
  "Well, that's the risk of violence, I understand that, and purposeful, which I guess everything is. But those are the three words: \"purposeful, violent, and aggressive.\" I'll give you purposeful, I'll give you violent, but aggressive?",
  "I think you're two-thirds of the way home free.",
  "There's a difference. The opposite of passive is active. It's not aggressive.",
  "This is active. He's running away, but -­",
  "What's the aggression?",
  "I thought there was -- I don't know where -- I don't remember where it was from. I thought there was a development of best police practices that you don't just chase people. You know, if they're going 30 miles an hour over the speed limit through a school zone, that doesn't mean the police officer should do that. You know, you call ahead, they put these strips on the road, whatever.",
  "Doesn't whether it's aggressive or not depend upon how it happened? I mean, it could be -- I mean, the flight puts in place the potential for -- for violence, I agree with that; but if somebody just, you know, jumps out between two cars while the fellow's fleeing, how has his conduct changed to aggressive?",
  "It's not like he -­ it's not like he's aiming for the guy. I mean, it's putting it in a dangerous situation. It's purposeful. Again, I'll give you violent in the sense that it has that potential. But he didn't want to hit the -- the person.",
  "It's not aggression against the person.",
  "Who's he aggressing against? When someone sees the police and says I'm getting out of here and drives down the highway, say, at 80 miles an hour, you know, 25 miles above the speed limit, who is he -- I'm sure it's not the right verb, but who is he aggressing against?",
  "Well, no. It's not that -­",
  "-- there's no specific target. There's no target. What this guy hopes is that nobody gets in his way.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Wall. Mr. Marsh, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Well, it's, for me, anyway, an important question. I'll -- I'm not sure the ordinary case does. I assume the ordinary prison escape is -- I don't know -- over the wall, under the tunnel or, you know, while the guard's looking a different way, or some -- I don't know that it's typical that when the guard is there, you say now's my chance. The typical case doesn't involve aggression.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 09-1272, Kentucky v. King. Mr. Farley.",
  "So, you have an apartment building where the police know from experience there's a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug transactions. Every 2 weeks, they walk through and knock on every door and wait for evidence of the destruction of -- of drugs. Is that all right?",
  "Well, the probable cause, of course, comes when they hear the, you know, flushing and the, you know, hiding or whatever behind the door.",
  "I'm sorry. I think I've got two different probable causes that's caused -­ causing me some confusion. I understand their requirement of probable cause, and that they hear sound of evidence being destroyed and therefore enter. Is that -- or are you talking about the probable cause to think there's something going on in the first place?",
  "So there's only one probable cause, right?",
  "Okay.",
  "Sure, you can. There's nothing illegal about walking down the hall and knocking on somebody's door. And if as a police officer you say I smell marijuana, and then you hear the flushing, then there's probable cause. You don't need any business about the dealer and the breezeway and all that at all.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Farley.",
  "Ms. O'Connell.",
  "Thank you, Ms. O'Connell. Ms. Drake.",
  "Although you're -­",
  "You're describing what you think the evidence was to support exigency, and the suggestion we've heard on the other side is that that's an issue that can be addressed on remand once we, according to the other side, correct the State court's error in that this -- you -- the police cannot create exigent circumstances. So I -- I don't know that it's terribly relevant what the underlying facts about what they heard was. That will be relevant depending, or not -­ depending on what our opinion says.",
  "No, it's -- it's not at all. The court said: I don't care whether exigent circumstances existed; you cannot create exigent circumstances; so I don't care whether they were or not. The legal standard is antecedent to the application of the facts.",
  "Oh, sure, there is. It was dismissed because the State supreme court held you can't bring this evidence in. If we say, oh, yes, you can, then the issue becomes live again.",
  "This is the argument you presented to us in the letter, right?",
  "And yet, we nonetheless decided to have argument.",
  "So maybe it would be -- it's your case, but maybe it would be best to move on to the legal issue.",

  "Is that after -­ after the exigent circumstances or the alleged exigent circumstances were presented? And that's after they heard what they thought -- and I know you disagree -­ was the destruction of evidence.",
  "It seems to me that you're trying to change the case. I mean, this is not a case where they come in and, in effect, demand entry. My understanding is that the issue in the case is whether or not, after a request for entry, they can then base probable cause in dispensing with the warrant based on what they hear from behind the door. Now, I know you think that they -- whatever they hear is perfectly innocent; but the issue is whenever they knock on the door, \"Police\" or \"Can we come in\" or whatever, and then they hear that, the activity behind the door, they have reason and can -­ can enter. Now, what you're -- it seems to me what you're arguing is, well, they did something else. They banged on the door, they yelled \"Police\"; it wasn't simply knocking on the door and seeking entry. And you may be right, again, on the facts, but it seems to me that's for -- for later on. I want to know what your position is on whether they can assume, at least for me, they knock and say \"Can we come in\" or knock and say \"Police\" -- no demand to get in.",
  "So just assume, for my sake, that the police comes to the door. It's not 10:00 at night; it's, you know, 6:00 at night. Knocks quietly on the door and says \"We're the police. Can we talk?\" And then there was the smell of marijuana. And then he hears the sounds that do convey to a reasonable police officer that evidence is being destroyed. At that point can they enter without a warrant?",
  "Okay.",
  "You know -- you don't know what -­",
  "You don't know what \"unlawful\" means, but you know what \"unreasonable\" means.",
  "What is -- what is an example of conduct that you would consider unreasonable resulting in suppression of the evidence that would not be unlawful?",
  "Right.",
  "So you can't -­ can't give me one example of some conduct that's unreasonable under your test that would not be unlawful?",

  "But they can't gain entry by deception. They can't knock on the door and say \"Pizza\"; right?",
  "No, no? Okay.",
  "Thank you, counsel. You will have noticed that Justice Kennedy left the bench a few minutes early. He is going to Tucson to represent the Court as the Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit at the memorial service there.

  "What if -- how far does your procedural right extend? Let's say in the second action, the court says, look, we've been through all this before; we have had a million pages of discovery from the prior action, no protective order at all. So while, if you were the first person here, you're entitled to, you know, 10 interrogatories, because we've been through this before, I'm going to say you can look at all the discovery that's there, but you only get 5 interrogatories. Now, do you say no, no, no, I'm entitled to the same procedural rights I'd have if I were here first? Is that right?",
  "So now it's not only that you're entitled to your day in court substantively; you're -- you're entitled to your day in court procedurally as to some procedural aspects but not others?",

  "-- whether the -­ the lawyer is adequate or not. People have different views about what kind of lawyer they want, and I can see somebody who doesn't even know that this action is going on saying: Well, I don't care if you think the lawyer is adequate. I don't think he is. Besides I wanted my, you know, brother-in-law to be the lawyer.",
  "I was just going to say -- it's odd to say you're precluded. The whole point is the basic principle that you're entitled to your day in court. And you're saying, well, you're not entitled to your day in court if somebody else had a day in court and they had a good lawyer.",

  "Yes.",
  "What about a False Claims Act action?",
  "You -- you emphasize that the contract has the language in haec verba of the statute. What if -- what if it doesn't? The statute imposes certain provisions. The pricing I guess is the key one. But in a private deal, when you're arranging for the delivery of, you know, pharmaceuticals, you could have a lot of provisions. It's got to be delivered by this much. You've got to have this much inventory. You've got to -- whatever. I mean, what if the contract here included terms beyond those in the statute? Could those be enforced by the third-party beneficiaries?",
  "Yes?",

That seems to me to put an awful lot of power and authority in the hands of one beneficiary and one lawyer saying -- all they have to do is filing a suit saying, look, we get a hundred doses of Lipitor from this program; we think we should get less. And if they win, the whole country's -- the pricing of Lipitor under this program has changed.",

  "That's Miree. That's 1977. And a lot of your argument, it seems to me, is in the earlier world of implied right of action jurisprudence that has changed dramatically in the last 30 years. And what concerns me is when you are talking about the same language, the mere fact that the government has decided to go through a contractual mechanism to advance this program doesn't allow you to use that to get an end run around all of the implied right of action jurisprudence of the last 30 years. You're on stronger ground before that.",
  "Well, but that was pretty well -- that analysis was certainly consistent with the established jurisprudence in this area then. But it started changing very quickly thereafter -- I think about 1980 -- and then consistently went in the other direction, to the point now where I think the jurisprudence is pretty clear that we're not going to imply a private right of action at all.",
  "But so do the -­ it's the same situation with the States under Spending Clause legislation. They don't have to sign up, but if they do, then the issue is, is there an implied right of action on the beneficiaries? And our cases for the last 25, 30 years have said no.",

  "Well, why is it such a big deal, then, to extend that to the organization as a whole, if the individual's privacy is already going to be protected?",
  "No. I mean you're -- you're already protected, at least to a significant extent, because the individual officers would be able to assert a privacy interest, to the extent at least that what you find embarrassing to -- to the corporation is also individually embarrassing to them.",
  "Counsel, your central argument is that because \"person\" is defined to include corporation, \"personal\" in the same statute must include corporate. I tried to sit down and come up with other examples where the adjective was very different from the root noun. And it turns out it's not hard at all. You have \"craft\" and \"crafty.\" Totally different. \"Crafty\" doesn't have much to do with \"craft.\" \"Squirrel,\" \"squirrelly.\" Right?",
  "I mean, \"pastor\" -­ you have a \"pastor\" and \"pastoral.\" Same root, totally different. So I don't understand -- I don't think there's much to the argument that because \"person\" means one thing, \"personal\" has to be the same relation.",

They really do kind of blend together, and it seems to me awfully difficult to put on a criminal defendant the responsibility to decide whether this is going to be an enumerated powers claim or this is going to be a Tenth Amendment claim. The basic principles do kind of merge together, and why does it make -- again, why does it make that much of a difference and why do you put the burden on the defendant to parse the claim one way or another, since I assume they can make pretty much all the same arguments under an enumerated powers -- under the enumerated powers clause -­",

  "Is there a reason that the Federal Government can't just say, from now on we're not going to give any money to Stanford or anybody else until they have an agreement making clear that the inventor is going to ensure sure that title rests with the university, which then triggers the Bayh-Dole Act?",
  "So you have no problem -- I mean, Mr. Stewart is being careful for his client, but you're comfortable with the idea that the government could impose that, even though there's nothing in the statute that requires it, and even though somebody could argue that the statute's somewhat inconsistent with it, in the -- in the sense that it wants to promote commercialization.",
  "Well, but the problem with -­",
  "Are you finished answering Justice Breyer?",
  "But that might lead to the same thing that the Bayh-Dole Act was intended to get away from, which is a variety of different arrangements across the vast array of government agencies, because they will have differing degrees of interest, differing leverage with respect to what they insist on from the different contractors.",
  "Do you -- are you aware of situations where the universities enter into different types of arrangements with different types of professors and researchers?",
  "Presumably some of them have greater degree of leverage than others and can say: Look, you've got to make sure I get this much of the royalties, and I'm only going to give you that much.",
  "No, go ahead.",
  "But it's just -­",
  "-- it's not just that there may or may not be an effective assignment. The problem is you may get together, you the inventor get together with the university and say, look, the one -- we share an interest in making sure none of this goes to the government. Why would we want to do that? So you make an arrangement. Your theory -- your theory is that whatever the contractor gets is what the government can get and nothing more, so the contractor and you work out a deal to make sure that the contractor doesn't get the invention or the patent, it just gets royalties.",
  "And they're happy because they're -- the value of the patent is not diluted by the fact that the government is going to be doing something with it.",
  "So at the end of the day, though, your theory is that Congress passed a law that could -- I guess this is Justice Breyer's point -­ be easily circumvented not only by the inventor but by the inventor and the contractor working together.",
  "There's nothing inequitable about it. It's a perfectly fair deal between the university and the inventor. Mr. Fleming: In that event the government has all the remedies that Mr. Stewart was talking about. As a matter of leverage, it could take the patent by eminent domain, and just compensation might be quite low if in fact it has funded all of the research.",
  "What are the obligations -- what are the obligations that the contractor undertakes?",
  "All things -- all things that the government had and more under the prior system?",
  "Thank you, Counsel.",
  "Mr. Ayer, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1533, DePierre v. United States. Mr. Pincus.",
  "Counsel, the provision refers to \"a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base.\" You read cocaine base to be crack, so you have to be talking about a mixture or substance which contains crack. What contains crack? Crack is the problem they're getting at; yet the statute, as you read it, has to talk about a substance which contains crack, not just crack.",
  "It's kind of an odd way for Congress -- it's an odd way for Congress to phrase the provision if what they want to get at is crack, to say what we want to get at is substance which contained crack. That suggests to me, when you talk about substances that contain something, what they contain is a base that then is used in the substance. I think that's a harder, harder logic to apply when you're talking about crack. They want to stop the use of crack, not so much -- it wouldn't occur naturally that they're talking about substances which contain crack. It would occur naturally, that language formulation, if you think of cocaine base as broader than just crack.",
  "You kind of elided the point there in your verbal formulation. It's easier to say this is something that's not just cocaine. It's harder to say this is something which is not just crack because crack is a type of cocaine. You can say it contains, as the government says, cocaine base.",
  "And you're saying Congress is afraid that the sodium bicarbonate, we might not be able to get at that if we just say crack?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Pincus. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Pincus, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1454, Camreta v. Greene, and 09-1478, Alford v. Greene. General Kroger.",
  "It doesn't just do that. Is -- is Mr. Camreta in any more comfortable position when he knows that the Ninth -- what the Ninth Circuit thinks on this issue and he just has to wait until there's another case when they can impose the view that they've already spelled out? I know as a technical matter it's not binding, but if you're Camreta, do you say, well, the Supreme Court vacated that decision, so I can go ahead and do this again and not have to worry about personal liability?",
  "They're supposed to file circuit -- follow circuit precedent, aren't they?",
  "On the merits -­",
  "-- do you think that the same approach you're following here would apply if the investigation focused on the student rather than a third party? Would in those cases a warrant have to be obtained?",
  "No, no, not another child. It could be anything. We think the child is, you know, selling drugs, obviously not a 7-year-old, but someone else in the school is involved in legal activity, him- or herself.",
  "So -- so you think it would be a different rule if we're talking about some other criminal activity? The father's selling drugs, and you think the child might have some evidence or at least be willing to talk about that. Do you need anything other than reasonableness in that case?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kruger.",
  "It would be -­",
  "It would be a partial vacatur, right? The Court's done that before, hasn't it, where we vacate part of a decision under Munsingwear?",
  "Well, I'm not so sure he was correct. The -­",
  "If it's vacated, it indicates that there's no established law on that question, and it seems to me Camreta would be free to do what he considered appropriate under the circumstances, and if somebody tries to impose personal liability on him, it seems he has an even stronger case than he might have before.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kubitschek.",
  "Then why are you -­ why are you here?",
  "You're not challenging the qualified immunity ruling?",
  "Yet, you have -­ yet, you have -- why didn't you just go away?",
  "No, I know that. But why -­",
  "I do know that. But on the other hand, you had no -- you could have filed a paper saying we have no continuing interest in the case, but you haven't done that. You've fought the legal issues on the merits in -- in an area where it's been suggested you don't have a stake.",
  "So you have objection if we entered a Munsingwear order vacating the decision of the Ninth Circuit on the merits of the dispute?",
  "Well, again -­",
  "I'm sorry. Again, I get to the question, why do you care? Why do you care whether we vacate the -- the order or not? Your position is your client has no continuing interest in the case.",
  "He was not trying to help you.",
  "So you're -­",
  "So that's your argument, again, that we shouldn't reach the merits?",
  "Now, do you agree that if we vacate the court of appeals' decision on the merits, that if Camreta had did exactly what he did in this case again, that he would not face personal liability?",
  "Right. Then that cannot be used -- that cannot be used to establish that there's clearly established law. And in the absence of clearly established law, he cannot be found personally liable?",
  "So if he did exactly the same thing, he would still be entitled to qualified immunity?",
  "But who is -- who is on the other side of the county?",
  "The claim pending below involves which two parties?",
  "Oh. So -­",
  "Does the decision on the merits here have any relevance whatever to the action that's still pending?",
  "So you agree that if -- if this is -- we vacate the decision on the merits, that's of no meaning whatever in the pending action below?",
  "If you're making an argument on something that you've already told us you have no cognizable interest in -- correct?",

  "There's information, facts, that you can glean from their action, but that doesn't make what they've done a report.",
  "Is your position that sometimes it can't -- a FOIA response can be a report and other times it's not?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Willens.",
  "Most of the -- maybe I'm -- maybe this isn't correct, but many FOIA responses include more than just turning over the documents. They've got a privilege log or other things, this exemption applies, here's a document, but these things are blacked out, and they tell you why. Is that a report?",
  "Well, but it's not really because it does get into the assertion of exemptions and privileges, and -­",
  "-- things of that sort. And why isn't that a report of somebody's evaluation of the particular documents that are being released?",
  "The person is -- the person is separate but is often dealing on a regular basis with people who have line responsibilities and something else.",

The one, you know, takes the blood samples from the vials, puts them in another vial, and puts the aluminum stuff on and crimps it. The other one then takes the vials and puts them in the machine and runs it. Do you have to have both of them testify?",

  "Thank you, General. Mr. Gelernt.",
  "The problem, and it's, I think, the problem that I think Whren highlighted is that the -- the allegation can so readily be made in every case under the material witness statute is that this is one of those bad intent cases, and the case has to proceed so that we can prove that. One of the ways we prove that is by asking everybody who is involved in the process. Why did you do this? What was your intent? I mean, the whole purpose of Whren is to make sure that kind of stuff doesn't happen.",
  "So every time the prosecutor elects not to call one of these witnesses for a variety of reasons, you would have a claim that this wasn't designed to elicit testimony?",
  "If you were writing a law review article, you might have done that. But we're talking about an officer. I think the first thing you would do is say, well, let me see these material witness statute cases, and what would he have found?",
  "But, again, you're talking about the officer, he reads the statute and then doesn't say, well, but maybe the statute's unconstitutional, so I need to do more research?",
  "So the eight -­ eight judges taking the opposite position in the hearing en banc below were just being unreasonable? It would have been unreasonable for an officer making this determination to agree with eight judges from the Ninth Circuit?",
  "What we said in Wilson, I'm quoting, judges -- when judges disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject public employees to money damages for picking the losing side of the controversy.",
  "Well, I agree with -- I agree with that, of course, but at the same time, it does seem that you're imposing a very heavy burden on the officers in this area when do you have a situation where eight judges, when they conduct their research, come out the other way. And that type of burden is particularly heavy when you're talking about if they guess wrong, it comes out of their pocket. And if I'm the officer in that situation, I say, well, I'm just not going to run the risk of, you know, having to sell the house because I agreed with eight judges on the Court of Appeals.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General, you have 10 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, General. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-11328, Davis v. United States. Mr. Kerr.",
  "Well, Mr. Kerr, our cases have talked about the deterrence impact on police conduct. It seems to me you're trying to expand that notion to cover incentives for defendants, and as I read -- I guess it's Leon, in footnote 25, it says the argument that defendants will lose their incentive to litigate meritorious Fourth Amendment claims as a result of a good faith exception is -- is unpersuasive.",
  "Well, I think our -­ our theory on the exclusionary rule across the board, without regard to the underlying substantive violation, is that you look to deterrence of police conduct. And here, I mean -- I mean, you agree the police did nothing wrong in this case, don't you?",
  "So what impact -­ why do we want to deter them from doing what's right?",
  "If I could just follow up on Justice Ginsburg's question. Why did this defendant have any incentive to bring his constitutional claim if, as may or may not appear too likely, the inventory search is going to result in the admission of the evidence anyway? It seems that your theory goes too far in saying that defendants will never have an incentive to bring a constitutional challenge if there's some other ground on which the evidence might be admitted, and that's never been our law.",
  "Well, it's often -­ we do that. We take cases where you can bring a constitutional challenge or a different challenge all the time, qualified immunity cases, you know, what was the law and was it clearly established? Defendants bring the qualified immunity cases all the time even if they have a tough case on whether it's clearly established. Harmless error cases, the underlying violation, whether it's a harmless error, and the Court can decide the case on either ground, but that doesn't keep defendants from bringing the claims.",
  "So your incentive argument really only holds up when the ground on the alternative ground is hopeless? Otherwise we'll expect the defendants to bring a Fourth Amendment claim because it's pretty easy to bring.",
  "You're asking us for an exception to our general approach, assuming the general approach is not the one you succeed, for, as you put it, cases where there's zero possibility of success, while allowing application of the good faith precedent, even if the chances of success are remote. Is it really worth the candle to have litigation over whether it was a difference between zero chance and remote chance, as opposed to continuing to apply the good faith rule across the board?",
  "I understand your position on that. Now, getting to my question, is it really worth it for us to have litigation over the difference between zero and remote in determining what rule we should apply in this case?",
  "Most lawyers don't take that position. Most lawyers would argue the Court's precedents should be overturned and, if not, here's why our case is different. And we would still be required under your theory to look if that second argument has zero chance or only a remote chance.",
  "And it seems to me -- I mean, in terms of the incentives on the defense counsel, it would be an odd defense lawyer who is going to say you should consider argument A because my second argument has got zero chance of succeeding.",
  "The difference between zero and remote.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Kerr, you have 6 minutes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kerr. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-11556, Tolentino v. New York. Ms. Schwarz.",
  "So the only way that the police can prevent an unlicensed driver from driving in this situation is to take away his car? Impound the car, as you say?",
  "Unless they want -­ for any offense, you know, expired driver's license. Expired last week. They can't just give the guy -- they can't give the guy a ticket, right? All they can do is take away his car? Your answer to a number of the questions has been that -- that have tried to address the issue of what are they supposed to do, since they know they have somebody who is violating the law, is that, well, they can take away the car. And I just want to know if that's the only permissible response by the police when they know that the person driving has violated the law.",
  "Totally illegal.",
  "Totally, yes.",
  "And the only way to prevent him from reoffending immediately is to impound the car? Because if he gets into the car and drives, then -- or can the police arrest him right away?",
  "Why not? Why wouldn't they -­",
  "Is that your answer, then: They've got to impound the car every time or let the guy just go?",
  "They could tell him not to drive until he clears up his license?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Schwarz. Ms. Halligan.",
  "Do you -- is your position that they can do anything in terms of the search of a name? Could they punch it into Google or something like that and find out a lot more than just what they have in their own possession?",
  "I know -- I know it raises a different question, but you know, you keep saying they're just -- or you know, you're just talking about the name, but names are meaningless in the abstract. It's not just that the officer wants to know what to call him. It's what he wants to find out from the name.",
  "And these days there's so many electronic databases, you can find out an awful lot just, you know, with the punch of a few -­ a few buttons.",
  "No, but it's not limited to suggesting danger or whatever. It's -- it can -- that may be what the officer on the scene is most interested in, of course, but once you get the guy's name you're interested in a lot of things.",
  "Well, they're not suppressing the knowledge of somebody's identity. All that -- what's being suppressed is the evidence of criminal activity that you derive from that.",
  "You -- you make the point that these records are already in the government's possession.",
  "I mean, isn't that true of everything that's available on any type of database? Everything in Google or whatever the other search engines are is in the government's possession in the sense that they've got it; all they've got to do is identify it in their search, and they've got it.",
  "Well, it can't make a difference on whose server it is, does it?",
  "It is information that they can get if they have the correct way of searching it, which is here by name.",
  "Are these things public records? If I wanted to find out if you had been, you know, stopped for driving without a license, can I find that out?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Halligan.",
  "Mr. Shah.",
  "Is everything that the government has access to through any database considered in the government's possession?",
  "Well, you said -- as you phrased it, I thought it was in the government's possession.",
  "Well, what's the difference? In either case, they need some search term, and then they will get the answers. I don't see why it makes a difference.",
  "Well, what if -- I'm sorry, go ahead.",
  "Well, what if it's in the -- the government of Colorado's possession, and they have an arrangement with New York that they will let them check their files to find out, you know, whatever it is, nationwide or something? Does that -­ your argument apply to that?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Shah. Ms. Schwarz, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "And I suppose would subject the police officers to liability, though, right? In civil actions?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1476, The Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri. Mr. Ortiz.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Ortiz. Mr. Palmore.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Schnapper.",
  "But all of our cases have equated the Petition Clause reach with that of the First Amendment, and our cases under the First Amendment have made clear that we don't want to constitutionalize the -- the employee grievance procedures.",
  "Does the Petition Clause cover anything that the First Amendment does not?",
  "Well, getting back to the second part of my question -­",
  "-- in the First Amendment cases we were concerned about, as I said, constitutionalizing employee grievances. If you constitutionalize it under the Petition Clause, how is that any less a problem of constitutionalizing it under the First Amendment?",
  "All you have to do then is add a sentence to your complaint saying: This is an example of how the government employer mistreats its employees?",
  "And then it becomes more generalized?",
  "But -- but that's the basis of our law in this area is that when the government is actually the employer the rights of the individuals are somewhat different, and they're closer to the rights that private employees have. So simply saying that these constitutional provisions apply against the government and therefore, you don't have to worry about the distinction between private employers and government employers doesn't seem to be -- me to be completely responsive to our precedent.",
  "Well, but things will be a lot different if we give the sanction to your theory. I think the idea that it hasn't happened in 17 years in the wake of San Filippo is a little bit -- it's not very compelling.",
  "Well, but the most likely solution when you have an employee grievance along with it is that some umbrella settlement -- I mean, the employer doesn't want to spend -- I mean, that's part of the reason our doctrine developed under the First Amendment. The employer doesn't want to have to worry about spending time and money in court to resolve what is essentially an employee grievance.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ortiz, you have a minute left.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 10-114, Fox v. Vice. Mr. Rosenkranz.",
  "That's an incredible burden to impose on the district court. It's hard enough for clients to read through these billing records and figure out what's valid and what's not, but to ask the district court to then go through and look at it, and see -- and maybe it doesn't say, you know, \"1983 suit,\" \"State suit.\" Maybe it's just an entry. And then you've got to go through entry by entry and say well, now, was that for the 1983 action or was that for the State court action?",
  "And that seems -­ just -- sorry, I don't mean to drone on, but that seems to me to be an especially odd burden to impose when you're dealing with an area where there is a heavy dose of discretion to the district court in the first place.",
  "Well, maybe in your case, but there's no reason to suppose there won't be cases where the things are flipped, and the Federal claim, perhaps frivolous for a legal reason rather than a factual one, is the dominant driving force in the litigation and you've tagged on a few other State claims.",
  "But that's a pretty audacious claim, that you filed such a frivolous cause of action that they shouldn't have wasted so much time responding to it.",
  "That's a lot of chutzpah.",
  "And you shouldn't have filed it.",
  "Can I clarify what you mean by \"completely intertwined\"? You mean there is no incremental work just on the Federal action?",
  "So you -- you're looking for fees -- your first argument -- even though they can identify fees that were incurred solely on defending the frivolous cause of action?",
  "All right. That's an easier case. What if it's 20 percent spent on the Federal action? Do you still completely intertwine?",
  "What if it's not completely frivolous, but frivolous enough to satisfy a demand for fees? What if it does take them, you know, 40 hours to prepare the motion to dismiss it as frivolous? Do they get those 40 hours?",
  "Well, you've got to find the 17 cases.",
  "You've got to look carefully at the facts. They assume good faith on the part of their adversary that would not file a frivolous claim. The idea that it's going to be able to -­ they're going to look at it and say, this is frivolous, file a motion in Federal court, I think that's a -­ doesn't reflect an adequate -- doesn't reflect a realistic understanding of Federal litigation.",
  "No, that's not how it works. You say they know they're going to be seeking claims. They don't know in advance, this is going to be a frivolous claim, the discovery is going to be completely overlapping or it's not going to be overlapping. And most lawyers do not keep detailed accurate billing records. That's just an underlying reality. So I do think it's a significant burden on the district court to say, go back and read these -­ read these billing sheets, figure out which is which, presumably have litigation over it. Someone is going to file a motion for these fees; the other person is going to say, no, no, it shouldn't be 20,000, it should be 15,000. And our precedent in this area gives a huge amount of discretion to the district courts, just reasonableness. And it seems to me you're buying into a lot of litigation to decide whether it's 20,000 or",
  "I understand you go back to the first point.",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, I'm looking at the billing sheet, August 14, 2007, 32 hours, miscellaneous cost, online research. Is that for Federal or State?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stancil.",
  "If the liability under the State law claims is $100,000 and the liability under the Federal claims is the same, and you win on the Federal claim and you lose on the State law claim, if I were the client, I would say your degree of success was zero. I still have to pay $100,000. The fact that you won on one claim but then lost the whole issue -- the whole value on another, I wouldn't call that a degree of success.",
  "And I assume you agree that discretion can end up going either way? You could submit time sheets that show 35 percent of our time was spent on the Federal case, and the district judge can say, you know, time sheets are subject to -­ manipulation is too strong a word, but I'm just not going to give you 35 percent; I'm going to give you 10 percent. That's a reasonable exercise of discretion. The judge doesn't have to say a whole lot about it and it's certainly going to be upheld on -- on appeal, right?",
  "So you disagree with the statement in the -- in the Court of Appeals opinion about, only for fees that can be distinctly traced?",
  "I understood your adversary to agree with that position. You'll need to switch sides, right?",
  "But your argument has focused, in reference to the complaint and all that, on the legal theories. Your friend has focused on the underlying factual basis, and all the litigation -- all the background work on the underlying factual basis, I don't know why that can be fairly attributed only to the 1983 claim.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosenkranz, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "I was wondering kind of as a starting point, and I don't know why you would fight so vigorously against the verbal formulation \"fairly attributable.\" I assume most district courts, when they get it, they're going to start by looking at whatever his affidavit, this is how much our fees were, and then if there's some reason, perhaps Mr. Stancil's case, where everybody thinks it's a Federal that's all, or maybe not, then they can just go \"fairly attributable\" rather than but-for, which gives the district court a lot more leeway and the sort of leeway we have always held in this area they should have.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 09-11121, J.D.B. v. North Carolina. Ms. Blackman.",
  "The whole point -­",
  "The whole point of the Miranda rule, I thought, was to provide clear, objective guidelines about what the police are supposed to do. And it seems to me that one of the difficulties with your rule, however clear it may seem in this case, but it does have to apply more broadly, is that that's off the table, and now they're not only going to have to know, does this person understand it, but they're going to have to know, it's not every one of these situations that's going to be in school. They're going to have to guess how old the person is. And there are differences. Some 15-year-olds know a lot more than some 17-year-olds, and so on. And -- and the facts that you're concerned about all go into the voluntariness inquiry, which is still pertinent after Miranda. Why don't we just put those facts into that inquiry and say, look, we've got one strict rule; everybody knows it, you hear it on TV all the time, people are given Miranda warnings; that part of it is done?",
  "Would it be -- is it enough if the officers in this situation said, look, you're free to leave, you know, whenever you want, but -- and then goes on -- or do they have to think -­ now, maybe -- maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't think that's true, or maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't feel that he can leave if he's got the vice principal there and they want to talk.",
  "I'm thinking it would not even be enough if they told the 13-year-old, look, you can leave, but I want to ask you some questions. And the principal is there, and he thinks, well, you know -- maybe the 13-year-old is thinking, maybe I'm going to get in trouble if I leave.",
  "How is that relevant to the Miranda inquiry? It might be relevant to the voluntariness inquiry, but I don't see whether you call the parents or not. Part of his Miranda -- your Miranda right is not to have your parents called.",
  "Independent of what?",
  "Well, right. That's my whole point.",
  "So is your answer to Justice Ginsburg that, no, the fact that a parent was not notified is not relevant to the Miranda question? It may be relevant to the voluntariness question.",
  "Oh, so it's not just that they have to call the parent; they have to wait for the parent to show up?",
  "That's not -- that's not pertinent to the Federal law question on the Miranda warnings.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Cooper.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin.",
  "Finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blackman, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in case 10-10, Turner v. Rogers. Mr. Waxman.",
  "When you -­",
  "When you asked -­",
  "Counsel, you -­",
  "Counsel.",
  "Counsel!",
  "You have stressed that the burden in this case is on the defendant. Would your position be different if the burden were on the complainant?",
  "Maybe Justice Alito can -­ MR. WAXMAN -- I'm not sure, but -­",
  "-- can ask his question.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Ms. Kruger.",
  "Counsel, did -- just to be clear, your answer to the question presented is no, right? It was not error for the South Carolina court to say there's no constitutional right in this type of a proceeding to appointed counsel?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Kruger. Mr. Bibas.",
  "Suppose -­",
  "I suppose -- we have held, haven't we, that States can have different concepts of mootness than the Federal one?",
  "Counsel, do you know why we're not hearing from the State of South Carolina?",
  "No, no. I understand that they were involved below. They decided not to become a party before the State supreme court; is that right?",
  "Why aren't they defending their procedures?",
  "It may be an unfair question, since you don't represent the State.",
  "I think it would be a great financial interest if they have to provide counsel in these thousands and thousands of cases.",
  "But that can't possibly be true, because we have cases applying the rule that this is capable of repetition, yet evading review. If the rule were you have to get a stay, we wouldn't have any of those cases.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next this morning in case 10-235, CSX Transportation v. McBride. Mr. Rothfeld.",
  "I just don't -- and maybe this has already been asked, but I'm not sure from a juror's perspective that it makes terribly much difference the exact formulation of this instruction. I think a juror who sees an employee is suing the railroad, and it turns out that what the railroad did had very little or nothing to do with what happened to the employee, they don't need an instruction about natural, foreseeable causes. They're just not going to give the awards, or they're going to give the awards even though the railroad didn't do anything that affected the employee. It's a -- it's a nuance that I just don't think has any practical significance.",
  "My point is that I don't see much practical difference between what you argue is the correct instruction and what your friend argues is the correct instruction.",
  "I mean, law students, professors, and some judges have had trouble defining the concept of proximate cause for centuries. I don't know why we expect a juror to be able to navigate through those nuances, either.",
  "And do you want -­ what instruction would you give that would tell the jury to allow damages in one of those -- the first of the coupling cases, but not in the second?",
  "Are jurors going to sit there and say, one of those is natural, foreseeable, and probable, but the other isn't?",
  "I don't know what \"natural\" means. You know, so it's not a supernatural situation?",
  "It's not foreseeable that if you drop a coupling where it's not supposed to be, somebody will come along and try to pick it up and move it?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld, you have 4 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 10-238, Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett and the consolidated case. Mr. Maurer.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips.",
  "But counsel, how -­ the supposition that it results in more speech, let's take the independent expenditure example. You've got one candidate running against three others. There's an independent expenditure on behalf of the one candidate. That means, say $10,000. That means each of the other three get $10,000 of their own. Now, that might promote more speech, but the effect may well be for the independent expenditure to say, I'm not going to spend the money, and so the other candidates don't get the money and you have less speech.",
  "How would you -­ what would that evidence look like?",
  "Well, other than somebody saying it, I'm just curious what the evidence would look like. You're -- it's -- you're proving a negative. You're saying, well, this person didn't do something because of this, and that's pretty hard to do.",
  "So -- so the idea is this is a way of encouraging candidates to take the public financing, right?",
  "Would it encourage more candidates to do that if you doubled the amount that was available for every additional amount that the privately financed candidate spends? He spends $1,000 over the amount and the publicly financed candidate gets $2,000. A lot more people are going to do the publicly financing route if that were the case.",
  "But that's kind of an odd line to find in the First Amendment, isn't it? That you get a 100 percent matching as opposed to, say, 110 percent or 150 percent? Somewhere in the First Amendment the line is drawn on the amount?",
  "So it doesn't work?",
  "On that, there's a back and forth about the record and common sense. As a matter of common sense -- I think this has already been asked -- if you knew that a $10,000 expenditure that you would make that would support a candidate would result in $30,000, 40,000, 50,000, depending on how many opposition candidates there were available for them, wouldn't you think twice about it?",
  "Well, if you're thinking twice and one way you're thinking is not to do it, that sounds like a sufficient burden.",
  "Our cases, as you know, have drawn a distinction between expression and disclosure.",
  "Your focus on persuasiveness -- your focus on persuasiveness is a particular view of the political process that may not be applicable in every case. Political scientists sometimes tell you that it's not persuasion, but simply playing to your base, getting them more actively involved. So it's not the somewhat more academic view that people are going to sit down and just regard which one is persuasive. Is that a permissible objective for the State to pursue, to value a particular view of the electoral process over another?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Jay.",
  "Counsel, do you agree that under our precedents, leveling the playing field for candidates is not a legitimate State purpose?",
  "Well, I checked the Citizens' Clean Elections Commission website this morning, and it says that this act was passed to, quote, \"level the playing field\" when it comes to running for office. Why isn't that clear evidence that it's unconstitutional?",
  "Why -- why do you think the elections commission then tells us its purpose is to level the playing field?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Jay. Mr. Maurer, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-277, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes. Mr. Boutrous.",
  "I suppose if corporate headquarters had learned that the subjective decisionmaking or the delegation of decisionmaking to the field was resulting in several discriminatory practices or a pattern of discrimination -- in other words, the decentralized process was leading to discrimination -- then I suppose the company -- that that could be attributed to the policy adopted by -- at headquarters?",
  "No, I'm talking about -- so, they've got thousands of stores, and, you know, every week they get a report from another store saying that, you know, there's an allegation of gender discrimination. At some point, can't they conclude that it is their policy of decentralizing decisionmaking that is causing or permitting that discrimination to take place?",
  "What -- what happens to the damages claim of an individual woman who is part of this class if that class prevails?",
  "Would -- would she be eligible for only back pay or compensatory damages as well?",
  "I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "All right. But would -- would the -- would the women with a claim for compensatory damages be able to sue that after the class prevails in this case?",
  "Even -- even though she could have not received notice and not had an opportunity to opt out?",
  "What if the class does -- does not prevail; it loses? Does that bar an individual woman at a particular Wal-Mart from bringing these same claims?",
  "But what if it were the same theory, that the reason this person was able to discriminate was because he had total subjective discretion in his hiring?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Sellers.",
  "All right. Is it your position that on this scale subjective decisionmaking processes are necessarily illegal?",
  "So, if this were -­ how many stores are we talking about, a thousand stores?",
  "Several thousand stores. How many examples of abuse of the subjective discrimination delegation need to be shown before you can say that flows from the policy rather than from bad actors? I assume with three -- however many thousands of stores, you're going to have some bad apples.",
  "No, I know there are examples. How many do you need to have?",
  "Surely it won't be -- if somebody sends one letter in saying the guy at this plant -- is -- plant -- this store is discriminating, that can't be enough to support your theory.",
  "Is it -- is it true that Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?",
  "What if you had a situation where you had a company with a very clear policy in favor of equal treatment of men and women? You know, the answer to your -- the answer to your question was women don't have as many positions because managers discriminate against them in -- in hiring and in promotion, yet you still have the same subjective delegation system. Could you have a class of women who were harmed by this subjective policy, even though it was clear that the policy of the corporation favored equal employment opportunity?",
  "No, no, no, they still -- well, then you're saying it is not enough that it be a subjective decision. This company has a thousand stores, and sure enough in a thousand stores you're going to be able to find a goodly number who aren't following the company's policy, who are exercising their subjective judgment in a way that violates the right to equal treatment. Couldn't you bring a class of people subjective to discrimination as a result of that subjective policy?",
  "Counsel -­",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Boutrous, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-5443, Fowler v. United States. Mr. Crawford.",
  "What is -- what is your position on the subsequent element or -- or feature about relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense? Does the defendant have to know that his actions to prevent communication involve an underlying Federal offense?",
  "Why is that? 1512(g)(2) talks about with respect to the law enforcement officer.",
  "I would have thought you'd say there's a negative implication that intent has to be shown with respect to everything else, including whether or not this is a possible Federal crime.",
  "Are you willing to concede that the defendant knew that?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Harrington.",
  "Isn't -- if you have a Federal -- underlying Federal offense, and I gather you don't think -- that just needs to be shown as a matter of fact, right?",
  "No intent with respect to that. Isn't it always likely that there's going to be a reasonable possibility, reasonable likelihood, that the communication is going to go to a Federal officer?",
  "It's a Federal offense. If the communication covers Federal judges, that's the person who is going to try the case in every case.",
  "No, obviously not all of them.",
  "So you think that -­ that it's not an element of the crime, but that feature of the prosecution depends upon what percentage of the crimes are prosecuted Federally as opposed to by State law?",
  "Can you instruct the jury that the underlying crime here is a Federal crime and then say the only thing they have to determine under some standard is whether or not the communication would be to a Federal officer?",
  "But why isn't that -- maybe I asked this already, but why isn't that the case when you're dealing with the Federal offense?",
  "Oh, but there's a possibility.",
  "A realistic possibility.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Crawford, you have 7 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-993, Pliva, Incorporated v. Mensing, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Lefkowitz.",
  "Well, that makes a lot of sense, but we do have our Wyeth decision that seems to cut the other way.",
  "Well, Buckman -- Buckman was arguably a little bit different, in that there's a concern expressed in that case that requiring allowing the State suit to go forward would cause manufacturers to basically inundate the agency with proposals and warning revisions, so that there would be so many things that the agency wouldn't even be able to process them, and they would become meaningless to the consumers. That doesn't seem to me to be a concern in this case.",
  "To disclose -- I'm sorry. To disclose to the FDA?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Lefkowitz. Mr. Bograd.",
  "But what happens -­",
  "How long does it take -- how long typically does it take the FDA to respond to a request from a generic manufacturer that it -- it ask the branded manufacturer to change the label?",
  "Are those the ones that are submitted by generic manufacturers?",
  "-- whether about -­",
  "I was just going to ask, does the FDA give you an up or a down, or does it just not take action sometimes if you submit one of these requests?",
  "Counsel -­",
  "You can finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "So if your theory of the case is accepted, this is what will happen: Every time a generic manufacturer gets an adverse incident report, it will send that on to the FDA, and there will be a boilerplate sentence at the end of it saying, We think you should consider revising the labels because of this, and then, under your theory, that manufacturer is completely protected from State suits?",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, they're not going to take a chance. They're going to say, if you're the FDA, you look at it. We're just telling you what we know, and we think you ought to consider revising the label.",
  "Okay. We think you should revise the label; if you agree, this is what it should look like.",
  "Does it lead to preemption?",
  "Does it lead to preemption?",
  "Right. Wouldn't you -- if you were the generic company's lawyer, you would advise them to do that in every case, right?",
  "No, I know that's what this case is, but if -- a reasonable generic manufacturer would be worried about every case, and it would just add this boilerplate language at the end of every letter, and as I understand your theory, they would be protected.",
  "And in the brief -­ and in the brief that you filed you said one of the concerns is that people are going to flood the FDA with all these warnings and -- and whatever, and that would interfere with the FDA's ability. Now you're telling me -- you -- you said when you started out that you think it's unlikely or you don't think it's likely. In your brief it said SG language you said we're not prepared to predict that a ruling would do this. So, why is that a difference between those two cases?",
  "Well, but it's not -- the regulation doesn't say propose a labeling change. It says labeling shall be revised, and the one thing we know is that the generic manufacturer can't revise the labeling from the branded one.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Lefkowitz, you have your 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Lefkowitz. Counsel, the case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-313, Talk America v. Michigan Bell, and the consolidated case. Mr. Bursch.",
  "Is that right or --",
  "Is there a mutual exchange of traffic when you're talking about backhauling?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Miller.",
  "Mr. Miller, you began by saying there were two regulations that disposed of the case. You got one. What's the second?",
  "I'm sorry. Could you run that by me again?",
  "Okay.",
  "Got it.",
  "Oh, continue.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Miller. Mr. Angstreich.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bursch -- Bursch, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 10-5400, Tapia v. United States. Mr. Cahn.",
  "What if -- putting aside the particular statement here, what if a judge says: I appreciate that one purpose of punishment is deterrence; that's what -- and that's what's going to guide me, and I think you will not be deterred if I only sentence you for 2 years, but I think if you have to go away for 3 years, you will appreciate that what you've done is wrong and you won't do it again. Is that for rehabilitation, that extra year, or is it for punishment?",
  "Well, maybe -- what is the difference between deterrence and rehabilitation? The person doesn't commit any crimes anymore but wishes -- wishes she could? Or -- and, well, if she's rehabilitated, she doesn't want to? It seems to me it's a very artificial distinction.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cahn. Mr. Roberts.",
  "What if -- what if the judge sentences people who commit robbery with assault typically to 1 year; he can do it 1 to 2 years, he gives them 1 year; except whenever the presentencing report says the person has a drug problem and there's a one-and-a-half-year drug program in the prison, he sentences those people to one and a half years? Regularly. But each time he says I recognize rehabilitation is not a permitted factor; I can send sentence this person to one to two, I'm going to pick one and a half.",
  "Is that a problem, or does it always just depend on what the judge says?",
  "It's wrong -- wrong to do what?",
  "Does the defendant have the right to raise arguments and inquire into that in -- in every case? Say that, well, he did say this was just to -- just to punish me, but here is a list of 10 cases where I think it's like my case and those people got less.",
  "Well, I think it's going to be hard for the government to defend a sentence under those circumstances.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bibas.",
  "Thank you. Mr. Cahn, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bibas, you were appointed by this Court to brief and argue this case. You have ably carried out that responsibility, for which the Court is grateful. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument today in Case 10-174, American Electric Power Company v. Connecticut, et al. Mr. Keisler.",
  "I think that's -­",
  "That's exactly one thing that's concerned me. They do all flow from the same basic argument, and I'm concerned why you think we should focus on prudential standing, basically, which cuts off our jurisdiction at our own whim, as opposed to dealing with this on the merits.",
  "In either case, your argument is that this is too generalized for the Court to -- to address.",
  "So how many States does it take? I think, you know, if it's three States who have made that allegation, I don't know exactly how you draw the line between a case like Tennessee Copper and this case.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Keisler. General Katyal.",
  "Counsel, you don't usually -- your phrase is exactly what bothers me. We don't usually base a decision on our general intuition, and the idea of prudential standing that we have jurisdiction of the case but we're not going to decide it is contrary to Chief Justice Marshall's famous line that if we don't have jurisdiction, we can't decide it, but if we do, we have to decide it.",
  "I'll give that you on the zone of interests, but there you're dealing with administrative law and a very narrow proposition. I think it's Justice Kennedy's point, or at least the point of his questions, that these issues meld into the merits and, at least for anyone who is troubled by the idea that we are not going to decide a case even though we have jurisdiction to decide it, maybe that's the better place to address it.",
  "Why is it -- I don't want to make -- try to make a case for you, but why is it that much more difficult? It's just -- I mean, it's sort of like the negative commerce clause, right? The fact that EPA has the authority to regulate in a particular area means that the ball has passed from the courts to the agency, to the executive branch, and they've made an implicit decision not to regulate a particular question.",
  "I guess that would be a preemption question rather than -- rather than a displacement question.",
  "Thank you, General. General Underwood.",
  "What -- what is the -- what factors go into the cost-benefit analysis that would have to be undertaken to decide what level of emissions are reasonable in light of the threat of global -- global warming?",
  "Obviously the greatest benefit to reduce global warming would be, of course, to shut down the power plants, right?",
  "Because -- right. But I mean, across the economy, the whole problem of dealing with global warming is that there are costs and benefits on both sides, and you have to determine how much you want to readjust the world economy to address global warming, and I think that's a pretty big burden to post -- to impose on a district court judge.",
  "We're dealing with an electric grid that connects I don't know how vast an area, but certainly a vast area here. And the fact that they can reduce their emissions in a way that doesn't affect their customers is based on the fact that other power plants that are part of the grid will serve part of those -- will serve the customers' needs to some extent.",
  "I -- I suppose there were reasons that Congress adopted that approach, and your suit would override those determinations.",
  "How much -- how much regulation do you need before you would admit that there is displacement? Is it -- is it a preemption analysis that you're adopting or a displacement analysis?",
  "What is -- what is your test for displacement? When do we tell whether there's displacement or not? Has there been some displacement in this case but just not total displacement or -­",
  "That sounds like -­ that sounds like preemption to me and not displacement, or at least preemption with another label.",
  "Well, maybe you can tell me in what -- to what extent displacement is different from preemption. Tell me in this area you're going to have displacement but not preemption. Or I guess it's the other way around, in which there's going to be preemption but not -- well, what's the difference? You said in response to Justice Kagan that if they've made a considered decision that this is the amount and no other amount higher or lower, then there would be displacement. In what way is that different from preemption?",
  "I think you're right that under your theory they operate pretty similarly and I thought the whole point of Milwaukee v. Illinois was that they are two very distinct propositions.",
  "Well, why do you stop at U.S. emissions? What percentage of worldwide emissions, every one of which I assume harms your clients, do these five power plants represent? Infinitesimal, right?",
  "From power plants or total emissions?",
  "Do you agree -- General Katyal began his argument in fairly dramatic fashion by saying we've never in 222 years had a case where the relief, the damages and the relief sought, were as broad as they are here. Do you have anything to rebut his proposition? Any case where it has been as broad as it is here?",
  "What's your best -­ what's your candidate to rebut his proposition?",
  "A broader case with respect to the infliction of damage and the need for relief.",
  "Well, not as many as contribute to global warming?",
  "Well, no, it's not, and it's not true of every litigation in this sense, that everyone is harmed by global warming. So unless you limit your suits to the States, which would -- I'm not aware of a principled basis for doing that -- every individual can bring -- every individual in the world if they can establish jurisdiction can bring one of these cause of -- causes of action.",
  "Well, I guess, just to follow up, what is the appellate court reviewing? Is it reviewing the reasonableness of EPA's judgment or the continuing validity of the injunction it entered previously?",
  "But that seems to be a displacement of the normal process of administrative law, which we would review the agency's determination of how best and to what extent to regulate the emissions.",
  "Yes. And I guess that's the central problem. Once you turn it over to litigation, it's an entirely different set of standards that would regulate emissions as opposed to the standards that would apply with respect to an agency's determination.",
  "Thank you, General Underwood. Mr. Keisler, you have five minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Keisler, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument today in case 10-382, United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation. Mr. Shah.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Shah.",
  "Mr. Gordon.",
  "It's -- you don't doubt that in this context sovereign commands would trump trustee obligations, do you? In other words, if Congress -­",
  "Okay.",
  "Counsel, the attorney-client privilege is policy-based and I'm concerned about the policy implications of your position. Our system has concluded that it works best if people have candid advice from their lawyers, and my concern here is if you're a lawyer -- you are a lawyer -- and -- and you're asked for your advice by a trustee -­",
  "-- and if you know that that is going to be shared with the beneficiary, you're going to give bland, mushy, hedging advice rather than direct and candid advice to the trustee, because it's going to be shared more widely beyond the trustee. And that's -- that hurts not only the trustee, but also the beneficiaries, whose trustee does not have candid legal advice.",
  "So how does -- I appreciate the point, but how does a trustee get candid legal advice? In every case, isn't the -- the lawyer -­ concerning his dealings with the beneficiary, with the trust: I don't know if I have to do this or I have to do this.",
  "And it seems to me if the -- if the information is always going to be shared with the beneficiary, the trustee is always going to get hedged advice.",
  "Well, that's always a question of liability. If he messes up and doesn't manage it the way he's supposed to, he will be liable. So the distinction you draw doesn't seem to me to be a workable one.",
  "So I'm the trustee, and I say I would like legal advice as to whether I should renegotiate this lease with the government.",
  "Now, I want that advice so I manage the trust correctly, and I'm concerned if I don't manage the trust correctly I'm going to be sued. Now is the document from the lawyer responding to that inquiry privileged or not?",
  "So if he says this is what I did and I might be liable, it's privileged. If he says this is what I'm going to do -­",
  "So under your theory if there's a claim of privilege on -- on -- on the government's behalf, presumably the district court would conduct an in-camera review to determine whether it was retrospective for liability or prospective for responsibility?",
  "Well, they -- they could be retrospective, too, right? The government exposes itself to liability, obviously, in these areas as well. That's the basis for your suit, right?",
  "I suppose the government as a whole has an obligation to act in the best interests of the citizenry, right? Why doesn't the same theory apply to any citizen? Look, government, you're supposed to -­ you're acting in a fiduciary statute -- status with respect to me. You're supposed to be acting in my best interests. If you're getting advice from the, you know, Department of Justice about what to do, I'm entitled to get that.",
  "Are there any other -- are there any other areas in which the government's relationship to particular groups of citizens is that of fiduciary to beneficiary?",
  "What are some of those?",
  "And your argument could be applied to them?",
  "So if I'm a government retiree, I have the ability to get the legal advice that whoever it is that runs that trust gets?",
  "The trustee I guess is -- is broadly conceived of as the government?",
  "Well, isn't the lawyer working for the trustee then a trustee too, an employee of the trustee?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gordon.",
  "Mr. Shah, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "If I -- if I pay -­ if I pay a lawyer to prepare a document for me, is that -- I do own that document or does the lawyer?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Shah, and Mr. Gordon. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1403, Erica P. John Fund v. Halliburton Company. Mr. Boies.",
  "Mr. Boies, if could I just stop you there.",
  "What if that had been disputed? Is that something that can be disputed at the certification stage?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Class certification is not a merits determination except with respect to reliance? Except with respect to the fraud on the market theory? That you can; that is a merits inquiry and you can decide it at the class certification stage?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sterling.",
  "Counsel, I suppose if you prevail and a defendant tries to establish at the certification stage that there's no loss causation and loses, then that's law of the case and you've missed the three opportunities that Mr. Boies was willing to give you at the pleading stage, summary judgment, and the merits. That issue is out of the case if you lose, right?",
  "What if there's no -- no new evidence? One of the objections to your theory is you don't have discovery at the certification stage. What if you have no new evidence to put on at later stages?",
  "No, no, no. You -­ on page 13 of your brief you say one of the objections to it -- to your opponents or your friends' view is that it would just postpone the defendant's ability to rebut the presumption, result in countless classes being certified with the certain knowledge that they would have to be decertified later. Well, if it's so certain, then there's no in terrorem effect.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Sterling. Mr. Boies, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "So you win, so you win at the certification stage or at the pleading stage, whatever. So why is it such I big deal to you here?",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next this morning in Case 10-5258, McNeill v. United States. Mr. Gordon.",
  "What if the State -­",
  "What if the State change is to abolish the offense altogether? Do we -­ do we not have any predicate offense for the defendant who committed the crime prior to the abolition of the State offense?",
  "Well, but it strikes me that there's really no change in the State view of how serious it is. It was just an overall change in how they're going to look at sentencing. Under the prior regime, you're sentenced to a particular term, but in fact you serve a lot less. With the new treatment in sentencing, you're sentenced to what is a much -- a smaller term, but you in fact are going to serve the whole thing. At the end of the day, there's no real change in how they view the seriousness of the offense.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gordon. Mr. Gannon.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gannon. Mr. Gordon, you have 6 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning -- this morning in Case 10-779, William Sorrell, Attorney General of Vermont, v. IMS Health Incorporated. Ms. Asay.",
  "The purpose -- the purpose is to prevent sales representatives from contacting particular physicians, right?",
  "You want to lower -­ you want to lower your health care costs, not by direct regulation, but by restricting the flow of information to the doctors, by, to use a pejorative word, but by censoring what they can hear to make sure they don't have full information, so they will do what you want them to do when it comes to prescribing drugs, because you can't take, I gather, direct action and tell them, you must prescribe generics, right?",
  "You're restricting their -- you're -- you're making it far more burdensome for the manufacturers to reach their intended audience, right? It's as if I want -- there's a demonstration in town, all right? They need a permit to hold the demonstration. They get the permit. I want to hold a counter-demonstration, and you're saying it doesn't make any difference whether I know where their demonstration is going to be or not?",
  "Well, we'll -- we'll give you -- we seem to have questions. We'll give you additional time for rebuttal, so you don't -- don't worry that we're cutting into that. But you're making a judgment about how their -- whether or not their speech will be as effective or not. Don't you think they're the ones who are entitled to make that judgment? It doesn't mean that you're right or wrong. It just means that we would not rely on your determination that it is -- their speech is just as effective. They're the ones doing the speaking and they think it's not.",
  "We'll afford you 5 minutes for rebuttal. Mr. Kneedler. AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING the PETITIONERS",
  "So he's required to provide it, but he would be required to provide it quite apart from the government regulation, right? I mean, the pharmacy needs to know who to make the prescription out to.",
  "I thought our precedents made -- indicated that it's problematic for the State to make a determination about what uses information can be -- to what uses information can be put, particularly when it's an interested party as it is here.",
  "I thought you told me that -- I thought you told me that this doesn't protect physician privacy to the extent of saying this information can't be used for academic purposes even if you, the physician, don't want it to be used for those purposes?",
  "So the physician doesn't get to decide for what uses the information -­",
  "What if the statute -- I'm sorry. What if the statute said this information can be used for any number of purposes, except not for anybody who is going to criticize the State of Vermont?",
  "This information -­ this information cannot be used for any purposes -- can be used for any purposes except a purpose that will make things more expensive for the State of Vermont?",
  "What if you say -­",
  "Let's say I don't like to be bothered by people knocking on my door by saying, sign this petition. Can I -- to protect my privacy interests, can I prevent that as a general matter?",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein.",
  "But there is another interest here besides the State's concern about health care costs, and that is the physician's privacy interests.",
  "You can sell this information to whomever you want, right?",
  "You could sell to it a journalist who wants to expose physicians in a particular area who prescribe a lot of a particular medication.",
  "So the public can discern well, this is the guy who is treating these people; we don't like these people, so we're going to Pickett outside his clinic.",
  "Now, nothing prevents you from doing that, right?",
  "Well, don't you think that's protecting physicians' privacy, to prevent that from happening?",
  "You would have no objection I take it, if there were not the academic exception and if the State didn't -- didn't push its own contrary program?",
  "How would -- if you were truly concerned about physician privacy -­",
  "You didn't want people to know that this physician prescribed this drug more often because it tells you a lot about his practice -­",
  "-- that he may not want known, how would you -- how would you write this statute?",
  "Would you remind me what Justice Kennedy said?",
  "Okay. Who's -­",
  "This -- this is, Mr. Kneedler explained this is the government's information. Why can't -- you wouldn't have to have it if it weren't prescription. It was the fact that it has to be prescribed that requires this information. The government frequently controls the use to which information can be put. It makes me file a tax return, and it doesn't allow, you know, dissemination of that. It restricts it.",
  "And presumably it could say that if an accountant prepares my tax return, that accountant can't sell it, either.",
  "How is this any different?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Asay, you have five minutes.",
  "Ms. Asay, I want to give you the chance to respond to a point that was highlighted by your friend, which is the fourth legislative finding, which does seem to say that the State is doing this because it doesn't like an imbalance in the marketplace of ideas.",
  "Do we have -- were there -- were there findings with respect to the statute as enacted?",
  "I take it there's -­ there's -- it's against the law for a physician to say I want you to fill this prescription in a particular place, a particular pharmacy because I know that pharmacy doesn't sell the information. They can't do that, can they?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "Our last argument of the term is in Case 10-568, Nevada Commission on Ethics v. Carrigan. Mr. Elwood.",
  "You modified your answer to Justice Scalia by saying you're not aware of any case that applied the First Amendment to rules of general -- neutral rules of general applicability, I think. But if the First Amendment doesn't apply, that doesn't matter, does it? You can't limit your -- the type of rules that you say are not -- are okay and are not if the First Amendment doesn't apply at all?",
  "Well, if the First Amendment doesn't apply to this type of activity, then you would have no First Amendment objection to biased rules of specific applicability.",
  "I thought your position was that this wasn't speech protected by the First Amendment.",
  "So someone can challenge one of these rules on the grounds that it's not neutral, that it applies in a disproportionate way to particular members of the legislature?",
  "Do you think that the rules in the House of Representatives allocating time on the floor or committee membership are neutral? They're biased in favor of whichever party happens to be in the majority.",
  "I suppose you would have a First Amendment claim under your theory if the generally applicable rule was applied in a discriminatory manner; it turned out, you go back and look and over the last 2 years the only people who have been sanctioned for violating the ethics rules have been members of the minority party.",
  "That would be a viable First Amendment -­",
  "Thank you, Mr. Elwood. Mr. Rosenkranz.",
  "So if the legislature adopts a rule that says from now on we're going to require a four-fifths majority for a bill to pass, that lowers the effectiveness of the speech of someone in the minority, and you can challenge that on First Amendment grounds?",
  "Counsel, I've kind of lost the thread of your argument. Is this a vagueness claim or a First Amendment claim? I gather your claim is going to be the same even if the statute clearly said family members, you know, business partners, and political consultants.",
  "Is your vagueness argument, is that a First Amendment argument of its own?",
  "So we can decide your vagueness -- if we agree with you on vagueness, we don't have to determine whether the First Amendment applies in this type of situation?",
  "Here we're talking about penalty for participating. What -- what if it's a disclosure rule saying, you know, you can participate, you can vote, you can advocate, you just have to disclose interest of this sort.",
  "Is that problematic under -­",
  "Right. Well, doesn't that burden his First Amendment rights?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Elwood, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-958, Douglas v. Independent Living Center of Southern California, and the consolidated cases. Ms. Schwartz.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, is your argument in this case limited to Spending Clause legislation?",
  "So, you think --",
  "So, you think there may well be implied rights of action outside the Spending Clause context.",
  "So --",
  "So, your -- your answer to my earlier question was that you're not arguing about that in this case.",
  "So, the Government -- the Government -- we don't have a position from the Government on whether or not there is an implied right of action under other constitutional provisions.",
  "I mean, outside the Spending Clause context.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Why isn't -- why doesn't your position constitute a complete end run around all of our implied right of action jurisprudence? We've wasted a lot of time trying to figure out whether there's an implied right of action under a particular statute if there has always been one under the Supremacy Clause?",
  "How can they have much broader -- broader -- first of all, all of those cases -- I don't know if all of them did, but certainly a lot of them did include -- included claims for injunctive relief. And I would have thought the court's authority under your equitable action under the Constitution would be at least as broad as it would be under the statute.",
  "But your position --",
  "Your position --",
  "Your position is that the Constitution prohibits you from doing anything where the State law is pre-empted by the Federal law. That doesn't sound very narrow to me.",
  "What if the --",
  "What if the law that Congress is -- Congress passes sets forth certain Federal standards -- it's a cooperative Federal-State law like this one -- and it says: And there's no private right of action for any individual to enforce this. That's limited to the Federal Government.",
  "So, Congress can say --",
  "Congress can say in the same statute that confers the allegedly pre-emptive Federal standards that we do not want individuals bringing actions in court to enforce this. We want to leave that up to HHS. And you're saying, even though Congress said that, individuals can nonetheless bring a suit under the Supremacy Clause, the theory of which is we are making sure that Federal law controls.",
  "The same Federal law that says you can't bring a cause of action.",
  "Why is there no --",
  "Why is there no suit if the agency doesn't approve?",
  "You're saying Congress can't say there's no implied right of action.",
  "But the agency can?",
  "Do you have the same answer or a different one?",
  "But you still have a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause.",
  "I thought you were saying you didn't --",
  "-- if the agency --",
  "Why does the --",
  "Why does the agency get to determine Federal law when Congress doesn't? You told me earlier if Congress --",
  "-- Congress says in a statute no implied right of action, that that doesn't control.",
  "The answer is yes, they intended to deprive them of the right to sue under the statute. I understand that you're not challenging the proposition that this statute, when Congress was specifically focused on the question of how to enforce this provision, they did not provide a right of action. And under our implied right of action jurisprudence, that means there isn't one. So, why when they're confronted with the precise question did they say no, we don't want these people to sue, but you say, well, they knew under the Constitution they were going to be able to anyway?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Ms. Schwartz, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-6549, Reynolds v. United States. Ms. Cain.",
  "Was the -- is the Wetterling Act retroactive?",
  "No, no, I know. That's going forward. But was the requirement to register under the Wetterling Act -- did that apply as of the enactment date or did that reach back?",
  "So, you think it only applied to that year?",
  "So, if the offense were committed in 1994, did that person have to register under the Wetterling Act?",
  "You have -­",
  "You have a notice -­ notice and comment claim, right?",
  "No, that's not -­ no. Your argument, as I understand it, is there was no notice and comment when he issued the interim rule.",
  "If there had been notice and comment, you would have jumped in with comments that would have convinced the Attorney General not to apply the rule to your client.",
  "Okay.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Sherry.",
  "So, your -- your argument is that \"requirements\" in the heading for 42 U.S.C. 16913, Registration requirements for sex offenders, means something different than \"requirements\" in subsection (d), which the Attorney General can issue rules about, because you're saying, although there is the requirement that they register and comply with (c) and all those other things, when it says that the Attorney General can issue regulations specifying the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter, that only meant the administration, you know, provisions, not the general requirement that you register and keep current and all that.",
  "It's a safety valve to release what?",
  "Well, you are talking about sort of in the weeds, the little details, not the underlying requirement of registration, right?",
  "You want to share it with the rest of us?",
  "Why -- why isn't part of your answer to Justice Breyer's question that the one person who doesn't have to register for 4 years is in prison already; so, presumably, he doesn't present the same type of threat that led to the enactment of these registration laws in the first place?",
  "And providing criminal penalties that weren't always there.",
  "That's a big change.",
  "Your theory -­",
  "Your theory of what the Attorney General did here, as you put in your -- I forget what, the regulations or the -- was confirm the applicability of SORNA, right?",
  "That's the word you used, I think, on page 12 of your brief.",
  "Right.",
  "What is the other example -- do you have any other example where an Attorney General confirms the applicability of a criminal law?",
  "No, that's different. I mean, if you're talking about defining which drugs are qualified, you know, under provisions that criminalize possession, things like that. That's is clarification going forward. I'm talking about straightforward confirming, which is what you say happened here.",
  "You know, the law says this, and I -- I think it means -- I think it means what -- what you say it means.",
  "So, I get back to my question, which -- what's your best example of an Attorney General doing something like that?",
  "Well, here it says \"shall.\" It says, \"The Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subsection.\"",
  "What if -- what if we think the reason Congress left it to the Attorney General is because they just didn't want to decide? Or some people were saying this is fine but not retroactive, and others were saying it should be retroactive. Do you see any constitutional issues with Congress delegating that authority to the Attorney General, the authority to make a criminal statute applicable on a retroactive basis?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Cain, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear case next in Case 10-1001, Martinez v. Ryan. Mr. Bartels.",
  "I'm sorry. I don't -- I don't understand how that works. The claim is, say, for example, you were ineffective because you didn't raise a Batson claim. Surely, he gets to pursue the Batson claim once he establishes ineffectiveness - -",
  "So -- so, the lawyer -- the State would be required to provide counsel not simply to raise the threshold ineffectiveness argument, but to go ahead and raise the arguments as to which he was ineffective.",
  "So, you would be happy with a system that said, no, you don't have to raise it on collateral review; you have to raise it on direct appeal.",
  "Which is very unworkable, because if you're arguing ineffective assistance of counsel in a direct proceeding, presumably it's usually the same counsel; he's not likely to bring the claim. That would be worse for criminal defendants - -",
  "-- than the system that's there now.",
  "Well, but the person - -",
  "The person who decides what arguments you're going to make on appeal is usually the person who handled the trial in these types of cases.",
  "In Arizona, the usual case in criminal cases is that somebody else handles the appeal on direct proceedings?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Cattani.",
  "Is it routine, or does it happen often, for lawyers who perceive a trial issue that can only be raised on collateral review to think that it makes sense to raise that right away so that the appeal -- and then the appeal is delayed until that's resolved?",
  "Thank you, counsel. No, you've got to listen to the Government. Mr. Wall.",
  "Well, it's pretty - - it's small comfort to the lawyer -- the client who doesn't get one that everybody else does.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bartels, you have 2 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-63, Maples v. Thomas. Mr. Garre.",
  "You talk about the State's role. I assume that you're talking about there is the failure to take action after the return of the notices.",
  "Well, put -- putting that -- that to one side, what if only one of the three notices had been returned?",
  "Right.",
  "What if -- but -- your case it seems to me turns critically on Butler's role. How much, in addition to what he did or didn't do, would he have to do to put him in a position where he was in fact representing Maples in your view?",
  "What if -- the New York lawyers did not abandon Mr. Maples prior to the time that they left their law firm in New York, right?",
  "So, their conduct prior to that time would be attributed to him, right?",
  "Right. Part of their conduct was setting up their arrangement with Mr. Butler where he would show up as counsel of record but not really do anything. So, why aren't the consequences of that arrangement attributed to Maples as well?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Neiman.",
  "Let's say the three notices are sent out; all three of them come back, okay? Let's even go further and say the prosecutor knows that nobody representing Mr. Maples received notice. What happens then?",
  "Yeah, I know it would be more substantial. That's why --",
  "My question is what happens? Are you prepared to acknowledge that in that case, Mr. Maples had been abandoned by all of his lawyers, it was known to the prosecution, and, therefore, the failure to file the notice should not constitute an adequate and independent State ground barring collateral relief?",
  "Why did he do it? Why did he do it, then? Just gloating that -- that the fellow had lost?",
  "What was the point of it? He must have thought there was a problem, right?",
  "So, you accept -- I don't mean to interfere with the question, but -- so, you accept the idea that there is a distinction between malfeasance and abandonment.",
  "Okay. So, then the only thing -- the only thing we're talking about is whether, on these particular facts, there has been abandonment or not. Right?",
  "From your perspective.",
  "But you agreed with me earlier that abandonment is an exception to the adequate and independent State grounds. So, under your view of the case, Coleman was not necessarily controlling.",
  "Is it correct or does the notice -- most of the notices I see list the people who have been served. Were the New York people listed on the notice that went to Butler?",
  "Well, then he knew he wasn't the only one getting notice.",
  "Or he knew that he was the only one who was supposed to get notice.",
  "You said a few moments ago that Butler did more than your friend suggested. What more did he do?",
  "Well, after the default, sure. But what did he do before?",
  "What did he do more than that?",
  "Well, you made a fairly serious suggestion that your friend had not accurately represented what Butler did. And you still haven't told me one thing he did more than move the admission of the out-of-town attorneys.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Mr. Garre, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-680, Howes v. Fields. Mr. Bursch.",
  "Well, which way do you think that factor cuts?",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Anders.",
  "Counsel, I wonder why you just agreed that the 7 hours would be a pertinent circumstance. It strikes me that that would be a pertinent circumstance on overall voluntariness, perhaps, but once you're told you can leave whenever you want, I don't see why it matters at all how long he's kept there.",
  "So, it's not a relevant circumstance on the custody question.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Now Ms. Jacobs.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg is quite right. That -- that was not the issue in Mathis. The argument in Mathis was: We're questioning him about something else; so, we don't have to give him Miranda warnings. And that's the question that the Court decided. I don't think it had any discussion about whether -- there was certainly not the argument of whether he was in custody or not. The argument was this is a different crime; so, we don't have to give you Miranda. And the Court rejected that. So how does that clearly establish the law on which the court relied in this case?",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Do you know where exactly in Mathis? It's only --",
  "-- about five pages long. Can you show me where they have that discussion about custody, as opposed to a discussion about what crime is being discussed?",
  "Exactly.",
  "Exactly. It's implied. Inferred. How --",
  "Is that clearly established law?",
  "Do you agree that this is not -- what you want to derive from Mathis is not part of the holding of Mathis?",
  "It's an extension.",
  "I'm not sure you answered mine from before.",
  "How do you think that your argument or the decision of the court below was implicit in or an extension of Mathis? Mathis says you don't -- you're not free of Miranda just because it's a different crime. How does that answer the issue before the Sixth Circuit in this case?",
  "Well, I thought what we've been arguing about is not the nexus issue, but instead whether, in light of the circumstances or under an absolute rule, there's custody.",
  "And what is the clearly established law set forth in our cases that answers that latter question?",
  "Can I -- since we're talking about the Sixth Circuit decision, what it says is -- this is on page 10a. \"The central holding of Mathis is that a Miranda warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population and interrogated, i.e., questioned in a manner likely to lead self-incrimination about conduct occurring outside of the prison.\" Is that correct --",
  "-- description of Mathis?",
  "I thought Mathis rejected the argument that it depends on whether the crime is the one that you're in prison for or something else.",
  "Well -- the first part, \"a Miranda warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population\" -- okay -- \"and interrogated\"; i.e., questioned in a manner or whatever. Now, does that address all of the issues? Is that -- where in Mathis is the discussion about whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population?",
  "No, no. Where in Mathis?",
  "Right.",
  "If the argument were Miranda was not required because this -- this concerns a different crime than what you're in prison for here. I understand the idea that -- under AEDPA, that Mathis is clearly established law. The issue here, however, as the Sixth Circuit put it, is a warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population. And I just don't see that anywhere in Mathis.",
  "Okay.",
  "Isn't the best you can say, not that Mathis found but perhaps that Mathis apparently assumed that he was in custody, because there is no discussion of it? There's no discussion of the custody.",
  "Yes, they give you a factual recital. He was in his cell and all that.",
  "What's dicta? Dicta is something that's said that's not necessary to the holding.",
  "We don't have anything that's said about it here.",
  "Counsel, you -- you mentioned several times, we were talking about Mathis, that, you know, they mentioned he was in -- in a cell, right? I've just been skimming it quickly. I don't see where that's mentioned. Do you know offhand?",
  "And I --",
  "I did, too. And -- well, I'll look at it again. I'm sure --",
  "I'm sure it's there. All I see is noting that he was in prison serving a State sentence, but --",
  "Okay. Let me --",

  "That's -- one answer is that Congress has done this before.",
  "Right.",
  "Okay. Well, do you have an argument other than that they've -- they've done this before?",
  "But we have -- but it's pertinent under the First Amendment in other areas, right? It's a different analysis if your claim is the government should open up a park as a public forum, than if it's been a public forum for 200 years and the government decides to close it down. Maybe they can do it, but it's a different question. So, why isn't this a different question, from whether they can extend copyright protection that's already there?",
  "Well, what about -- what about Jimi Hendrix, right? He has a distinctive rendition of the national anthem, and all of a -- assuming the national anthem is suddenly entitled to copyright protection that it wasn't before, he can't do that, right?",
  "So, he's just out of luck? And that's just one example of many, where you take existing works and you have a derivative work or something that is distinctive to you. So, those people are just out of luck?",
  "Even under -- even under rational basis scrutiny, it seems to me that you run into Justice Breyer's concern that the government interest is vanishingly small when it comes to promoting progress under the Copyright Clause, so that the interest weighed on the other side of the -- the restriction of free speech rights -- it's hard to say that that's necessarily going to tip the balance in every case.",

  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-553, Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Mr. Laycock.",
  "Counsel, you referred to the ministerial exception, but, of course, your position extends beyond ministers. How do we - - how do we decide who's covered by the ministerial exception and who is not?",
  "Well, let's say it's a teacher who teaches only purely secular subjects but leads the class in grace before lunch. Is that somebody who would be covered by the ministerial exception?",
  "Well, different churches have different ideas about who's a minister. There are some churches who think all of our adherents are ministers of our faith. Now, does that mean that everybody who's a member of that church qualifies as a minister because that is part of the church's belief?",
  "Every one of our adherents stands as a witness to our beliefs. And that -- you know, not every church is hierarchical in terms of different offices.",
  "You may. Ms. Kruger.",
  "Is the position of the United States that there is a ministerial exception or that there is not a ministerial exception?",
  "Nothing to do with respect to the ministers. In other words, is there a ministerial exception distinct from the right of association under the First Amendment?",
  "Is there anything special about the fact that the people involved in this case are part of a religious organization?",
  "Is that a \"no\"? You say it's similar to other cases. Expressive associations -- a group of people who are interested in labor rights have expressive associations. Is the issue we are talking about here in the view of the United States any different than any other group of people who get together for an expressive right?",
  "I'm sorry. That was a yes -- I think that question can be answered yes or no.",
  "So, you're making - - you're making a judgment about how important a particular religious belief is to a church. You're saying -- this may just be the same question Justice Alito asked -- but you're saying: We don't believe the Lutheran Church when it says that this is an important and central tenet of our faith.",
  "On the other hand, the -- the belief of the Catholic Church that priests should be male only -- you do defer to that, even if the Lutherans say, look, our dispute resolution belief is just as important to a Lutheran as the all-male clergy is to a Catholic.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Kruger.",
  "Mr. Dellinger.",
  "Justice Kagan.",
  "That can't -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but that can't be the test. The Pope is a head of state carrying out secular functions; right?",

  "When you say on land, do you -- where do you put the 3-mile State offshore limit? Does that count as land under your view?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Palmore.",
  "Well, but it's a little -- it's a little different when you're talking about a labor practice and an activity that results in an injury. Labor practice by its terms is going to have applicability to a particular location. So, you would expect them to use that type of language. It doesn't carry the same negative implication you're suggesting under 1333(b).",
  "What if -- but what if that exposure is not pertinent to what they're doing? Let's take the same individual, 98 percent of the time on the rig and 2 percent on land. An emergency comes up. They need a new part, and they say: Here, go - - you know, go drive to Reno where they have a new part and bring it back. And he skids off the road and is injured. Is he really covered by the Offshore Act?",
  "Well, so, he's subject -- he's injured by, you know, a hazard on the road to Reno. He's -- I don't know how many miles that is from the offshore, and yet he's still covered by the Offshore Act?",
  "I'm sorry; I don't understand the answer. So, he's covered by both?",
  "Oh.",
  "Please.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick.",
  "Well, I mean, both positions - -",
  "Both positions, Mr. Frederick, are vulnerable to particular hypotheticals. You have imprecision on what it means to spend most of your time on the -- on the shelf, and they have their own problems. And what do you do with somebody who's - - 3 months he's on the shelf, and then 3 months he's back -- back on land 3 months? Does it depend when the injury occurs, whether it's when he's on the land part of his job or on the shelf part?",
  "Well, that's -- I've given you all the totality. He's working for 3 months, and then he's -- you know, it's seasonal or something, and 3 months he's on -- on the land. That is the totality of the circumstances.",
  "Why?",
  "Where -- how do you know it's the kind of person? I thought your line was whether or not he spends most of his time on the shelf or most of his time somewhere else.",
  "Thirty percent is the line?",
  "Well, I know, but we'd like to have a test that we apply to your situation, and it's nice to know -- maybe 30 percent, I guess, is as good as any.",
  "Unless he spent 30 percent of his time on the shelf. Then he's covered.",
  "Well, that's a real -- obviously, it's a real mishmash, and maybe that's what we're -- we're stuck with. How does this work as a practical matter? I assume the -- the companies get insurance to cover their risks here.",
  "Who decides -- I mean, the insurance company will underwrite how many people spend what percentage of time where?",
  "No -- well, they have to pay higher insurance rates. To say they're not liable for it I think is a real - -",
  "Well, but you -- I don't mean to get back to it all the time, but it's not -- you have to say that Congress contemplated the person who spent 30 percent of his time on the outer continental shelf. In terms of us coming up with a test. Maybe your client is an easy case, where it's 98 percent. But the test you want us to adopt covers the person who spends 70 percent of his time on land.",

  "We can't very well GVR it until he seeks cert.",
  "And I think it's kind of a glaring factual nuance to the case, kind of a -- that he didn't seek cert. And he also didn't seek State collateral review. I mean, if he had tried one of those or both of those, we -- we probably wouldn't be here.",
  "I would think our normal --",
  "Normally, I think if it looks like a mess procedurally, or whatever, the normal assumption is you let the lower court figure it out. Send it back, and I -- I think the research is that in actually most cases in which we GVR, the court reinstates the judgment below for one reason or -- or another. But the idea that we parse through them carefully -- I think if it's arguable, send it back and let the lower court sort it out.",
  "The problem is that --",
  "You would be – I appreciate your point that you may or may not have been able to bring it. My -- my concern is that you have, I guess as someone put it, the perfect storm here. You have a person who did not file cert, and he could well have gotten relief if he had through the GVR process, and who did not seek State collateral review, and he could well have -- you say probably wouldn't. The State said certainly would have. Somewhere in there. At least he'd have had a fair chance - -",
  "-- or a chance. But because he didn't seek cert and he didn't file State collateral relief, we have this more complicated scenario.",
  "Well, but, I mean, it seems to me that AEDPA contemplates that. It refers to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings. So, naturally, you'd have a different result with respect to claims that were adjudicated on direct review and any claim that was pushed over to collateral review.",
  "Well, I'm sorry, but I mean, my point is that it seems a pretty weak criticism of a result that it requires you to go claim by claim, when the statute specifically requires you to go claim by claim.",

Your friend makes the argument that, of course, in a typical appellate case, you don't go back and revisit the facts, but that appellate court is expected to apply the law at the time it renders its decision. So, there is that distinction between law and facts that seems to cut in his favor.",
  "Well, I'm talking more generally about the idea that Pinholster automatically applies to this situation. It applies to facts; therefore, it applies to law. The distinction in that context between law and facts, the general context, strikes me as one that supports his argument that they're at least not tied at the hip and have to be treated the same way.",

  "Look at the evidence before him and say, boy, I'd take that deal.",
  "But you can never say that there's no possibility of acquittal. Juries can decide not to convict no matter what the evidence.",
  "That's up to the jury. It's not up to us ex ante to decide this guy is definitely going to lose; so, let's not waste our time. Juries -- I don't want to say often, but it's not - - it's certainly not inconceivable that a jury may decide for whatever reason we are not going to convict this guy. Right?",
  "Did you -- I mean - - MS. NEWMAN -- went to trial for an acquittal. He went to trial because he believed legally his client would be convicted of a lesser offense that would put him in a better position than if he had accepted the plea. That was the only reason.",
  "You said there's -- I want to make sure I understand your point. You said there was no defense. Does that mean you didn't -- he had a frivolous defense or that he literally didn't put on a defense; just said, look, the State has to prove the case and they haven't done it.",
  "Did he -- did he - -",
  "Oh.",
  "That's something the jury could have accepted, right? Even if it's not legally true that if you shoot him -- at the -- the person below the waist, that's not a defense, but I can see a reasonable juror saying he probably didn't intend to kill her. He shot her, you know, below the waist. Maybe that is not such a bad strategy.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bursch, 4 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-444, Missouri v. Frye. General Koster.",
  "Well, I suppose the defendant might think, you know, there is really bad evidence out there that they don't have yet. And if I -- I want to nail this deal down as soon as possible. I mean, that would be a reason to -- to move things up and get the plea in early, wouldn't it?",
  "I mean, I don't know how often that happens.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang.",
  "Thank you, counsel. MR. YANG. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Queener.",
  "Well, we get a lot of Strickland cases, and the lower courts do, too.",
  "That's not much comfort in terms of what the consequences of a decision in your favor would be.",
  "Counsel - -",
  "No, go ahead.",
  "Counsel - -",
  "I'll go this time. Counsel, on page 24 of your brief, you quote Alford for the proposition that a valid plea must be a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.",
  "On the next page, you say when Frye entered his guilty plea before the trial court, he was completely unaware that counsel's ineffective delay had forever foreclosed those options. Now, I put the two of those together and find you saying that this was a valid plea.",
  "The question of validity is whether it's an intelligent choice, as you quote, among the alternative choices of action open to the defendant. The next page you say these options have forever been foreclosed. So, they weren't open to the defendant.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Koster, you have 2 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1104, Minneci v. Pollard. Mr. Franklin.",
  "I don't -- I don't understand your answer to Justice Kagan. If I heard you right, you were saying, well, they're going to be able to get a certificate because it's an Eighth Amendment violation, and everything is very severe. But the point is they're going to bring a negligence action, not an Eighth Amendment action.",
  "So - -",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shah.",
  "It is -- a Bivens action is unusual in the first place, but it's also unusual to say that you don't have a Federal cause of action because of something a State gives you. Do you have any other example of something like that, where the availability of Federal relief turns on the availability of alternative relief under State law?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Preis.",
  "Well, before you do, on page 5 of your brief you say, in the private prison setting, quote, \"'a Bivens claim against the offending individual offending officer,'\" end quote, is an appropriate remedy. And the quote is from Malesko.",
  "What we said in Malesko, where you quote, is that if a Federal prisoner in a BOP facility alleges a constitutional deprivation, he may bring a Bivens claim against the offending individual officer. Now, your friend describes that as a distortion of what we said in Malesko, and I just wanted to give you a chance to reply to what I think is a fairly serious assertion.",
  "Well, just to be clear, you quote that language -- you say \"in the private prison setting\"; and the language specifically says in a BOP facility.",
  "You would expect the same rule. That's your argument - -",
  "-- to apply in the private prison setting. What you say is that there we explained that, in the private prison setting, a Bivens claim against the offending individual officer was the appropriate remedy.",
  "What about medical malpractice caps? Is that an issue? In other words, State law -- and I don't know how many there are; I know it's been proposed -- I think it's true in some cases will cap your recovery for medical malpractice at a particular level.",
  "I was -- that was a helpful question, in the sense that - -",
  "The Bivens action - - presumably the cap would not apply. But it applies under State law.",
  "Do you disagree that the -- I know you have your argument on compensation - -",
  "-- but with respect to deterrence, is there any significant difference between the two causes of action? In other words, if you think the most significant aspect of Bivens is to deter constitutional violations, doesn't that work equally as well or perhaps more effectively under the State law than under Bivens?",
  "So, your answer - - your answer is the same as under compensation, that the State law might be different or not?",
  "Who -- who actually ends up paying in these Bivens actions? Is it the -- I mean - -",
  "-- the Federal Government or an individual or - -",
  "I'm just looking in terms of the practical deterrence. The problem I've had with it in general, I don't know how much practical deterrence there is as if you sue the individual and the -- the individual doesn't actually pay; the government does. It seems to me perhaps more likely in the private context that the individual may get stuck with some amount of the liability if the employer just says, look, you were off doing something you weren't supposed to do; we're not going to pay for it.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Franklin, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-788, Rehberg v. Paulk. Mr. Pincus.",
  "A person? What - - what if you have three elements to a crime, and you have one witness for each one. You see somebody sees the guy trying to get into a car. Well, maybe he left it - - maybe he locked his keys in. Another sees the guy walking around with a television. It might be his. A third sees the guy selling the television to somebody else. There's nothing wrong with that. Each one testifies before the grand jury. Who is the complaining witness?",
  "Urges -- urges a prosecution. One area that causes me concern here are the domestic violence cases, where someone may well report an episode but, by the time it gets to whatever the indictment procedure is, a grand jury or otherwise, is unwilling to -- to testify and pursue it. And yet, that person may be the one who started the prosecution in motion. Is that individual a complaining witness?",
  "No, he says -- he or she says at the time, I -- I don't want prosecution to go forward. I -- you know, I would prefer that it not go forward.",
  "Well, I thought the whole point of the grand jury was to protect citizens from unwarranted prosecutions. The grand jury initiates the prosecution. So, why do we look back beyond that? That's where the prosecution is initiated. You're not subject to prosecution until the grand jury returns the indictment. So, why do we talk about complaining witnesses initiating the prosecution?",
  "Well, somebody's is not - -",
  "No, go ahead.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jones.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus, you have 4 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case No. 10-895, Gonzalez v. Thaler. Ms. Millett.",
  "What if he had identified a constitutional issue, speedy trial issue? Does that give the court the authority to consider a different constitutional issue, a Fourth Amendment issue?",
  "So, what if it identifies something that is not remotely a Federal constitutional issue? By the terms of the COA, it's quite clear, you know, whether it is a State law issue or something else. There's no constitutional plausibility on the face of it. Does that still work for you?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mitchell.",
  "You agree with your friend that the only fault here was on the part of the judge and not the Petitioner?",
  "Maybe -- maybe it's a good time -- you're a good bit more than halfway through your argument. Maybe it's a good time to switch to the merits.",
  "Do you want to finish your sentence?",
  "That's a different sentence.",
  "Ms. O'Connell.",
  "If the court of appeals -- if a court of appeals judge can do that, can we do that?",
  "You read -- you read that to be any circuit justice or only the circuit justice from the circuit in which the case comes from?",
  "No. Because Justice Breyer is not the circuit justice for the Fifth Circuit.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Millett, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "I just have a -- I don't understand the 99 percent figure. That includes people who entered a plea bargain and presumably gave up the right to appeal?",
  "So, 99 percent of the convictions that are entered. So, that would include all the plea bargains. Those people obviously didn't appeal, is what --",
  "Okay. Thank you, counsel; counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 10-8974, Perry v. New Hampshire. Mr. Guerriero.",
  "Why isn't it -- this may be -- just, again, following up on Justice Alito's question, but there's always a degree of suggestiveness. It's not like the person is, you know, picked randomly off the street and saying, you know, do you know this person? It's in the context of an investigation. The person has some contact with it. So, there's always some suggestiveness that, well, this person might have something to do with what went on.",
  "But whenever - - whenever the witness is asked, at least there's a suggestion that this might be the man. And I don't know why you would think that's any greater than this is the man. The police don't come up usually and say, this is the person that we think did it; is that who you saw? They say, did you see this guy?",
  "Well, what about a situation like the one we had here, where you're not talking about a line-up?",
  "But you're talking about the scene of a crime, and the police says, do you know this person, did you see this person, or anything else? That in itself, any type of identification in the course of an investigation, I think you would have to say is suggestive, because the person is not picked up randomly.",
  "So, this is - - again, this is just following up, I guess. But I remember in law school one of the things in criminal law, the professor says, all right, everybody be quiet. And then a certain amount of time goes by, and then he starts asking people, well, how much time went by? And people -- some people say 4 minutes, some people say, you know, 1 minute. And it turns out, if I'm remembering correctly, to be a lot shorter than most people think. So, that's at least, the point was trying to be made anyway, at least as unreliable as eyewitness testimony. So, your argument would have to cover that, wouldn't it?",
  "You know, how long were you there before this individual came into the shop? The person says, I was there for 5 minutes. And that ruins the person's alibi, when it turns out, you know, study after study would say, you know, it really was 45 seconds or 1 minute.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "General Delaney.",
  "When you say that's -- when you say that's different, you're not - - you're not suggesting that that would be suggestive, are you?",
  "Because presumably, that's the same argument -- that's for the jury and the counsel. They can say during cross-examination the guy was two blocks away, you know, and wasn't it only because the police brought him back that you -- you know, all of that. I don't see what difference it makes in terms of whether you have a suppression hearing before the trial.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Well, we did it - -",
  "Well, suppose the - - lie detectors, for example, that's been taken away from the jury on a categorical basis, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Guerriero, you have 2 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-577, Kawashima v. Holder. Mr. Whalen.",
  "I'm sorry. That's",
  "Okay.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon.",
  "Counsel, what did you - -",
  "Counsel, what - - what is your answer to your friend's 6501(c)(i) argument?",
  "Well, no, but I think your friend's argument, which has some appeal, is 7206 is fraud and false statements. And he said if you're right that that includes deceit, they wouldn't have had to add \"with the intent to evade tax,\" which is what they do in 6501(c)(1).",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Whalen, you have 8 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-699, Zivotofsky v. Clinton. Mr. Lewin.",
  "Well, Medellin involved a situation where the President's purported exercise of authority changed domestic law, and not simply domestic law, but domestic State law. That seems to me to be quite a distinguishable circumstance.",
  "What -- so, you're suggesting that the outcome of this of case would be different, from your perspective, if Congress said you have to say \"Jerusalem, Israel.\"",
  "Why is it -- why is it a different case?",
  "So, would there be -- there would be a greater concern -- the concern on the part of the executive that there would be adverse political reaction would have a greater degree of credibility?",
  "And so, we're supposed to decide whether or not the executive is correct in saying that it's a significant problem. And he says, well, he says that, but we know foreign policy better; we don't think it's going to be a big deal.",
  "I don't see Justice Jackson's analysis -- what he's saying -- and I guess I don't think it's as controlling as others might. He's saying when there's a conflict, it's a harder case.",
  "When there's -- when they agree, it's an easy case. When you can't tell, it's sort of a middle case. I don't see how that's very helpful in resolving the dispute before us.",
  "But it's recognizing that principle only with respect to a particular jurisdiction. An American citizen born in Northern Ireland doesn't have this option, because he thinks that's part of Ireland.",
  "And your -- and your friend on behalf of the United States says that's because of a State Department judgment that in one situation, it's significant; in the other, it's not.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Lewin. General Verrilli.",
  "Your friend -­",
  "Your friend documented contrary history at some length in his reply brief, where from the beginning at least, as he says, through the McKinley Administration, the two branches acted as if they had co-equal authority.",
  "Counsel, if I could stop you and just have you address the political question doctrine.",
  "You say this is exclusively committed to the President, and, therefore, it is a non-justiciable political question. How is that different from saying it's our job to decide cases, it is justiciable, and then you can argue that the answer of that analysis is that it's exclusively committed to the President? I don't understand why labeling it a political question advances the analysis much.",
  "What if -­",
  "What if Congress's statute said what you must put on the passport, if requested, is \"Israel,\" parentheses, (\"Disputed\"), close parentheses? Which would seem to take care of your objection that people are going to look at this and draw a false conclusion.",
  "It is the position of the administration, isn't it, that the status of Jerusalem is disputed?",
  "So, what if Congress says, in the place that you have it, this person has the choice of whether or not to put \"Jerusalem\" or \"Israel\"? This doesn't affect whether the United States recognizes Jerusalem as part of Israel or not; it's just his choice. Same problem?",
  "Really?",
  "I thought your argument was that someone's going to look at that and say that -- that offends me, that you're calling this part of Israel. That was the foreign policy significance. And I tried to give you a hypothetical in which nobody could reasonably draw that conclusion, and you say still, same thing.",
  "And what you told -­",
  "You told -- you told Justice Kagan that it didn't -- your position didn't depend upon a textual commitment, that your position would be the same if the Receive Ambassadors Clause were not in the Constitution.",
  "That sounds to me like not in the text.",
  "I will give you a couple more minutes. If my colleagues have any questions?",
  "Do you want to answer?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lewin, we'll give you 6 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1259, United States v. Jones. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Knotts, though, seems to me much more like traditional surveillance. You're following the car, and the beeper just helps you follow it from a -- from a slightly greater distance. That was 30 years ago. The technology is very different, and you get a lot more information from the GPS surveillance than you do from following a beeper.",
  "But that's a good example of the change in technology. That's a lot of work to follow the car. They've got to listen to the beeper; when they lose it, they've got to call in the helicopter. Here they just sit back in the station, and they -- they push a button whenever they want to find out where the car is. They look at data from a month and find out everywhere it's been in the past month. That -- that seems to me dramatically different.",
  "You think there would also not be a search if you put a GPS device on all of our cars, monitored our movements for a month? You think you're entitled to do that under your theory?",
  "Yes.",
  "So, your answer is yes, you could tomorrow decide that you put a GPS device on every one of our cars, follow us for a month; no problem under the Constitution?",
  "Well, then you're - - you're moving away from your argument. Your argument is it doesn't depend how much suspicion you have; it doesn't depend on how urgent it is. Your argument is you can do it, period. You don't have to give any reason. It doesn't have to be limited in any way, right?",
  "Well, isn't the normal way in these situations that we draw these limits how intrusive the search can be, how long it can be, is by having a magistrate spell it out in a warrant?",
  "Well, you're talking about the difference between seeing a little tile and seeing a mosaic. The one gives you information; the other doesn't.",
  "If you get an anonymous tip that there's the same bomb in somebody's house, do you get a warrant or do -- do you just go in?",
  "Right. Well, why are you asking for a different rule in this situation?",
  "What if we -- I give you that, that it's in public. Does the reasonable expectation of privacy trump that fact? In other words, if we ask people, do you think it's -- it violates your right to privacy to have this kind of information acquired, and everybody says yes, is it a response that, no, that takes place in public, or is it simply the reasonable expectation of privacy regardless of the fact that it takes place in public?",
  "You can see, though, can't you, that 30 years ago if you asked people does it violate your privacy to be followed by a beeper, the police following you, you might get one answer, while today if you ask people does it violate your right to privacy to know that the police can have a record of every movement you made in the past month, they might see that differently?",
  "Thank you. Your - - our questions have eaten into your rebuttal time. So, we'll give you the full time. Mr. Leckar.",
  "I didn't -- I didn't hear an answer to Justice Alito's question. What is your position on the placement of the GPS device on the State-owned license plate?",
  "It's a - -",
  "My understanding is correct that it's the State's license plate they require you to have. So, your trespass theory, it would seem, falls apart with respect to that particular scenario.",
  "No. It's the size of a credit card. You slip it behind the license plate.",
  "I thought it made a difference under your theory, which focused on the question of trespass, because it was attached to an effect owned by somebody else. This is an effect not owned by the individual.",
  "So, the trespass theory anyway doesn't seem ridiculous to me.",
  "How do you know that?",
  "Well, that gets back to Justice Scalia's question, which is you've got to determine that there has been a search first before you impose the warrant requirement. And it seems to me that your -- the warrant requirement applies only with respect to searches, right?",
  "Okay. And seizures. So, while it might seem like a good idea to impose the requirement on this particular technological device, you still have to establish that it's a search.",
  "Now, we pushed your -- we pushed your friend to the limits of his theory. Your theory, I take it, would apply if you're going to do it for 3 minutes, right? Where's the car? You push a button; it's 3 minutes. You say that's still a Fourth Amendment violation?",
  "Okay. Well, then don't talk to me about how long they're going to be doing it or all the information. We have to test the validity of your theory on the proposition that it violates the Fourth Amendment to do this for 3 minutes.",
  "You have said that several times. How do we tell? I mean, I don't know what society expects. I suppose if you ask people do you think it's a violation of privacy for the police to do this for no reason for a month, maybe they'd come out one way. If you asked the people do you think the police have to have probable cause before they monitor for 5 minutes the movements of somebody they think is going to set off a huge bomb, maybe you get a different answer.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",

  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Andrieu.",
  "Well, and you could argue, presumably you did argue, that before the jury, and that would be compelling evidence for the jury. And if you were the defense lawyer, you really would like to have that statement where he said: I couldn't identify them.",
  "Wait, wait. I'm sorry. You've lost me there. When he says I can't identify anyone, Smith is out of that group already?",
  "Okay.",
  "Excuse me. I can't identify everyone or everyone?",
  "Okay.",
  "I thought -- I'm sorry. I thought the idea was they were going to kill everybody who might have seen them inside. Their only worry would be someone who would see them outside, right?",
  "You can, very briefly.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, 4 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-224, National Meat Association v. Harris. Mr. Wells.",
  "I would have thought that your argument on sales would apply at the front end as well. You say sales can't be regulated because it's really just a way to get to the regulation of what goes on at the slaughterhouse. Wouldn't that concern also apply at the front end?",
  "Well, that -- isn't that logically not -- doesn't that logically not follow? You may not sell meat if it's been adulterated doesn't mean that you can sell meat so long as it's not been adulterated; right?",
  "One is a limitation, not a grant.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Horwich.",
  "You want to give a one-sentence answer?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Smith.",
  "But they don't - - you don't know whether they're going to become meat until after the Federal process of post-mortem inspection and all of that. And your rules seem to prohibit that.",
  "No, but I mean your -- your argument up to this point has been that this doesn't interfere with the Federal laws because the Federal laws are designed only to deal with meat that is for consumption. And you say with your -- with respect to your animals, that's not what it is. But here, as I understand the Petitioner's and the Government's position, it is that nonambulatory animals can be turned into meat for consumption. So, you don't know whether it fits under the definition of the State law until you've violated it.",
  "So, your argument is that because the Act doesn't speak to whether or not cats and dogs and horses can be sold as meat, you can also say it's not within the scope because it doesn't speak to specifically whether nonambulatory animals can be sold as meat or not.",
  "Well, that seems to me -- what you're saying then with respect to animals that are slaughtered in a slaughterhouse is that the difference is that the State law says you can't sell that as meat while the Federal law says you can. Right? In other words, you're saying, well, just because the Federal law says you can doesn't mean that the State can't say you can't.",
  "Correct? Well, isn't the exact flip side of saying you can sell it is that -- that you can't sell it is that you can. So, when the Federal law says you can, that pre-empts the rule from the States that says you can't.",
  "What -- what purpose does the ban on buying and selling have, other than to implement the restrictions that go to operations?",
  "But that seems to me to be, the answer, that, no, it doesn't have anything else to do because the animal cruelty that you're concerned about takes place on the premises as a result of the operations. And so, you prohibit the buying and selling of an animal that wasn't treated the way you think it should be treated, to give effect to your views on how it should or should not be treated, which seems to be expressly pre-empted.",
  "What does it include besides swine?",
  "Those are -- those all go through slaughterhouses?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wells, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you counsel, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-879, Kurns v. Railroad Friction Products Corporation. Mr. Frederick.",
  "Well, but, counsel, looking at Napier, the power that Justice Brandeis said was conferred in that case was to specify the sort of equipment to be used on locomotives, right?",
  "So, this is equipment that was used in locomotives.",
  "Yes, but that's the same -- that's the same thing, I'll give you that, fitness for service.",
  "It doesn't say something that's going to cause harm while it's actually being used.",
  "Why does it depend -- you want to know if this equipment is safe to operate, right? To be used, whether -- whether it's going to be used. If you have a - -",
  "If you have a boiler that's going to be used, that's within the power that was confirmed. It's not merely to inspect as, again, Justice Brandeis said.",
  "Well, I guess your argument isn't limited to being taken apart. Your argument does depend on the fact that the asbestos doesn't come out during use; right?",
  "Well, how do we know that - -",
  "Yes, but if there's an accident or something, does the asbestos come out during the use of the locomotive?",
  "Well, that's the old insurance cases we've had, that, you know, when the car, you know, slams into a pole or something, it's not being used as a car anymore; and, therefore, the insurance doesn't cover it.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Ms. Harrington.",
  "Well, but if you're talking about -- I bet there are a lot of things on railroad cars that you can fix in the shop or you can fix while it's under way, right? We're not always talking about brakes. So, let's suppose there's one of those things. You get to the shop and the guy says: Boy, you got to fix this. And they said: Well, the train's leaving, and we're going to go in 10 hours. And he says: Okay, I can fix it during the -- while it's in use. Is that covered or not?",
  "So, the line you've been talking about between the repair shop and the locomotive on the tracks, that's not really the line at all.",
  "Well, then -- well, then what's the answer to my question? This is something you can fix in either place. It's covered while it's -- if you fix it while the train is under way, but it's not covered if you wait until it's in the shop?",
  "So, then it's not whether it's in use or in the shop. It's whether it is something that affects whether the locomotive can go, whether it's - -",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Hacker.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes.",
  "And it knows -- it knows about Napier and what's been going on for 85 years, and if it wants to pull back on the pre-emptive effect of the provisions interpreted in Napier, it's free to do that, too.",

  "You -- you'd have -- the same private right of action that could be brought in State court without subsection 5 at all, right?",
  "What is the basis -- you assert that you could bring this -- bring a Federal cause of action in Federal court.",
  "You think that you can bring the Federal cause of action in Federal court.",
  "What is -- what is the basis for -- putting aside jurisdiction, what is the basis for the Federal cause of action?",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "But we -- we said that 40 years ago. More recently, we've said that Congress must be fairly express in creating a private cause of action. And my -- my concern is if you put it against that context, that our cases require fairly direct evidence, express evidence, that Congress meant to give a private right of action, in that context the existence of an express State cause of action or Federal cause of action that can only be brought in State court, the implication that there isn't one that can be brought on its own in Federal court is fairly strong.",
  "Well, that -- I understand that -- that proposition. Assuming that distinction is correct and that there is no free-standing Federal cause of action, what good does having Federal jurisdiction give you?",
  "Because I take it that at that point everybody can immediately -- defendants can remove -- never mind. Cross that off. What benefit do you have if as soon as you file your action, everybody says congratulations, you have Federal jurisdiction, and you're kicked out of court because you have no cause of action?",
  "No, no. I'm assuming that we don't see a cause --",
  "But why is that? Wouldn't the -- I think you're fighting Justice Breyer's hypothetical. Wouldn't the -- I can imagine if you've got a, you know, small claim type case because you got the -- one of these calls, and the first thing you get is the notice of removal and this. I mean, you're going to say forget about it; I'm not going to hire a lawyer. Right? I mean, the idea is they would drop it right away.",
  "But is it just when the action can be brought in State court or when the action can be brought at all? It says you may bring an action -- and that's what I understood your basis for the Federal cause of action to be -- if it's permitted by the law or rules of -- of a court of that State.",
  "Yes.",
  "What you can always --",
  "So, if -- could an individual -- you say there's a Federal cause of action in this case apart from the State cause of action that's provided. Could that Federal cause of action be brought in State court even though the State cause of action could not be?",
  "Right. Let's say you have two --",
  "Got it, got it. But just to follow up. The cause of action could be brought in both, except if the State courts say it can't be brought there. The State cause of action can't be brought in State court because of this \"if otherwise permitted,\" right? The Federal cause of action, though -- I thought the State courts couldn't discriminate against the Federal cause of action, any Federal cause of action. So, you can sue in State court and say: I'm bringing my Federal cause of action; so, the fact that you don't permit a State cause of action doesn't bar me.",
  "But that's fine. That may be exactly right. But the cause of action under subsection (3) asks whether or not this action -- it provides an action that can be brought in State court if otherwise permitted, right?",
  "What about --",
  "What about a diversity action? You could not bring this action in State court because it's contrary to the law, the rules of the court of that State, but there's diversity. Can you bring that diversity action in Federal court?",
  "Counsel, do you know -- do you know why the Solicitor General is not here defending the proposition that Federal law provides a Federal cause of action that can be brought in Federal court?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Nelson. Mr. Garre.",
  "I'm having --",
  "Im sorry. I'm having trouble, Mr. Garre, figuring out what exactly is at issue here. It seems to me that there are two possible views on it. First is, is there Federal jurisdiction over one of these actions? The second of all is, is there a private right of action apart from the one that can be brought under subsection (b)(3), which is one in State court?",
  "Now, which -- which are we supposed to decide? I can see the Federal question jurisdiction issue being straightforward. Federal law creates this cause of action; therefore, you can say that it is -- under 1331, there's jurisdiction, but then you can't do anything once you're in Federal court because the private right of action is limited to State court.",
  "Counsel, I -- we've been talking about where this provision fits, basically, into our general jurisprudence in this area. But I've never seen a statute remotely like this before. Is there any one, where you have a Federal -- where you have Congress creating a cause of action that can be brought in State courts unless the State court says it can't, saying nothing at all about whether there's a Federal cause of action? This is the strangest statute I've ever seen.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Nelson, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Are you arguing only about \"arising under\" jurisdiction or are you arguing also about a Federal cause of action that can be brought in Federal court? In other words, I am trying to figure out what we're being asked to decide in this odd case. I understand the idea -- and I'm sorry to take up your time -- I understand the idea that this is a Federal question because it's created by a Federal law. Can you go -- get into Federal court, and then we'll have another case about whether you can bring a cause of action there?",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-708, First American Financial Corporation v. Edwards. Mr. Panner.",
  "I'm sorry. Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Panner. Mr. Lamken.",
  "Well, that gets to a point that I'm having trouble getting my arms around. It seems to me what your position is, what you want us to focus on, there are three possible arguments. One is that there is injury-in-fact in this case. I see some of that argument in your briefs. Two, that Congress presumes injury-in-fact. Injury-in-fact is still required, but that is presumed. I read that to be perhaps what the trust cases say. Or, three, that injury-in-fact is not required at all. Now, which are you arguing? One, two or three?",
  "Okay, statutory right.",
  "Can I -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, and I want to pause on that question. You said violation of a statute is injury-in-fact. I would have thought that would be called injury-in-law. And when we say, as all our standing cases have, is that what is required is injury-in-fact, I understand that to be in contradistinction to injury-in-law. And when you tell me all that you've got or all that you want to plead is violation of the statute, that doesn't sound like injury-in-fact.",
  "Okay. Now, that goes back to the first proposition. That's an argument that there is injury-in-fact here. So, it seems to me that -- I don't mean this in a pejorative sense, but it seems to me that you slide back and forth between one, two, and three, which makes it hard for us to get a decision.",
  "Potential -- potential value.",
  "Now, we said in the Whitmore case, and this is a quote: \"Allegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Article III.\" Potential value sounds to me like possible future injury.",
  "Okay.",
  "So, that's injury-in-fact?",
  "Okay.",
  "So, if you tell me what this case is about is whether or not you've shown injury-in-fact, it's not a significant -- significant case, and your client has to prove that at trial.",
  "But I thought -- and maybe it's a unique circumstance in this case, but Ohio says this is going to cost you the same no matter what you do.",
  "Okay. But then again, that's an argument about was there or was there not injury-in-fact.",
  "That sounds -- again, to use a word we've said is inadequate to support standing, that sounds conjectural.",
  "No, no, no. We're talking about not what Congress found; what the injury-in-fact is.",
  "So, you will agree, won't you, that the idea that it's certainly possible or whatever your formulation was, that the quality here wasn't good enough or that the entire quality across the board might be better, that's conjectural, right?",
  "Now we're in point -- now we're at level two: It's hard to prove. So, is that your argument, that Congress presumed injury?",
  "Okay.",
  "So, you would accept $1 in this case?",
  "Well, no, that -- that gets -- I didn't mean to be facetious, but it gets to the question of whether or not you have to actually show injury-in-fact. Your allegation in this case is for damages, not just nominal damages but damages.",
  "So, do you -- I'm sorry.",
  "Do you want to get out of this contract?",
  "Do you want to get out of this deal?",
  "I didn't see -- I didn't see an allegation for rescission or -- or, you know -- so, you're perfectly happy as far as we know from the complaint with this deal; you just want the extra $500 per class member without showing any injury-in-fact.",
  "You -- you don't want a conflict-free transaction because you don't want to get out of this contract. You're perfectly happy with the contract. You want $500. You don't want a conflict-free transaction, because even if it was a -- were a conflict-free transaction, the price would be the same, in Ohio.",
  "Okay. Now, there the answer to my question -- and I don't mean to focus on a peculiar structure, but there -- your answer was on part one. You said no, not necessarily. Here there was an injury-in-fact; she might have gotten a better deal.",
  "Can I ask you, just to follow up -- you said whether or not there's further economic harm. So, you say economic harm is required --",
  "-- because there can't be further economic harm if there isn't economic harm in the first place.",
  "Further harm that happens to be economic, not further economic harm.",
  "Okay.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Lamken. Mr. Yang.",
  "Well, why do --",
  "What -- why do we always say injury-in-fact then? You say so long as the harm is a violation of the law, a legally protected interest. Our standing cases always say injury-in-fact as opposed to injury-in-law. And yet, you're saying if you violate the law, you have sufficient injury.",
  "Because they also go on to say that it has to be concrete.",
  "Real and immediate, not conjectural or hypothetical.",
  "So that all of our cases -- we could have left \"in fact\" out of all of them? None of them come out differently because we insist on injury-in-fact?",
  "The difference between legal harm, though -- I mean, isn't that -- I guess I'm just repeating myself. Injury-in-fact -- how do you understand that to be different than any other kind of injury?",
  "There are two elements. That's the particularized requirement, and I understand that. But you're saying there's -- injury-in-fact simply means particularized?",
  "Okay.",
  "You can -- the trespass cases, it seems to me, are different because you are talking about a property right, and you can sell a property right. You can go to somebody and say I have the right to keep people off of this piece of property. Do you want to buy it? Here's how much it's worth. But if -- that's only a property right to the extent you can keep people off of it. Here, no one's going to buy this right from the -- the plaintiff, because everybody's got it anyway. You don't -- you don't pay her, because she doesn't have a tangible concrete right. The trespass case, the person obviously does, because he can sell it.",
  "No, this one -- that's my point. This cannot be monetized because everybody's already got it. You can answer.",
  "It's not really a question, but you can answer.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Yang.",
  "Mr. Panner, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-875, Hall v. United States. Ms. Freeman.",
  "Well, but I mean, your -- it is a question for you, because these things don't go for 2 or 3 years, do they? I thought typically they are wrapped up very quickly, and that's to the advantage of the debtor. And your position with respect to postpetition taxes has the potential of extending them beyond the kind of quick turnaround that helps everybody.",
  "How long was this -- this one?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Freeman.",
  "Mr. Shah.",
  "Does that -- does that make sense, though, in terms of if you're talking about farmers and fishermen and you're talking about the treatment of their central asset, whether it's the farm or typically the boat, and they either want to try -- they want to try to save the farm or the boat, and they go into bankruptcy, and the big issue is how that asset's going to be treated. And your position is it's not in the bankruptcy at all; it's outside of it. That seems to me to be at least counterintuitive.",
  "But also, I gather, it's a fairly typical situation where you have farmers that might want to sell part of the farm. You know, they have dairy and corn operations or something, and they sell one to try to preserve the other. And that's -- that's exactly the sort of thing that should be considered in the bankruptcy context. And yet, your position says we're going to treat it outside the bankruptcy.",
  "But that's a big deal if you're deciding how the plan's going to work, whether they -- I mean, what the amount was here was big for the farmer, and the idea of, well, we're going to pretend that's not at issue here seems to me to be -- again, not -- not to make a lot of sense.",
  "Well, it's certainly not a self-denying position now, right? You're arguing that these are -- that the taxes of this sort are administrative expenses when that puts you at the head of the line. You're arguing that they are not administrative expenses, same type of taxes, when it puts you at the back of the line, even though the provision that puts you at the back of the line was designed to particularly help the fishermen and -- and farmers.",
  "No, I'm talking about the position you're taking now. You argue for --",
  "-- different treatment of these taxes as to whether or not they're administrative expenses -- not solely, but it leads to the result that you get the money first either way.",
  "Well, but then you're saying that Congress changed the rules in a way that, as Justice Alito's question suggested, really doesn't do much at all, when what they wanted to do was provide some real protection for farmers and fishermen.",
  "But those are -- those are small potatoes compared to the sale of a farm and a boat, right?",
  "Would there -- this particular issue of large capital gains from a sale of significant assets doesn't typically arise in the chapter 13 cases.",
  "Well, in chapter -- chapter 13 cases are the ones that you -- that are typically resolved very quickly, right?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Shah.",
  "Ms. Freeman, you have 2 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1024, Federal Aviation Administration v. Cooper. Mr. Feigin.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cardozo.",
  "The argument you've made, and I certainly understand it, that this is the Privacy Act, and so it's precisely these types of damages that you'd be concerned about, really cuts both ways. I mean, what you're saying is this is a really big chunk of damages, because this is what the whole Act was about. And it seems to me that that argument suggests that there's some weight to the Government's point that, well, if you're going to get into that, you really do need a clear waiver of sovereign immunity.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-7387, Setser v. United States. Mr. Hawkins.",
  "Where is --",
  "Where is all that that you just read, that they're bound by all these things? Where do I find that?",
  "Well, I'm looking at -- I guess I got this off -- somebody got this off line for me. I'm looking at the program statement of the Bureau of Prisons. And it says what the regional directors are supposed to look at is the intent of the Federal sentencing court or the goals of the criminal justice system. So, you've got some guy deciding whether the goals of the criminal justice system require this person to serve an extra 10 years or not.",
  "I mean, doesn't it seem strange to you that a Federal bureaucrat sitting -- a regional director -- and I guess there are about a half dozen of them -- sits somewhere and decides whether a defendant -- say there's a 10-year Federal sentence, a 10-year State sentence, and that person says, well, I think he ought to serve another 10 years, or I think he's done.",
  "Well, I know, but -- but it's a big deal to be sentenced to, in my hypothetical, another 10 years in prison. I don't care how much information the bureaucrat has.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jay.",
  "You said Federal or State. Where does it say that in 3621?",
  "Yes.",
  "Or -- or what if it's a situation where he goes into one of these prisons that are run by a private entity, right? It says whether the Federal Government or otherwise, right? And so, maybe the Federal Government -- I don't know how often it might do it -- they -- you use facilities that are privately run, right?",
  "Okay. So, why --",
  "-- isn't that what they meant when they said \"whether maintained by the Federal Government or otherwise\"? I think if they wanted to say State or Federal, that's what they would have said.",
  "So that -- so that 20 years later after the defendant has served his mandatory minimum sentence, your friend in the Bureau of Prisons regional office is supposed to go look back and see what the judge said 20 years ago?",
  "I don't think that is responsive to the point I just made, that they make recommendations all the time. I'm talking about the effectiveness of the recommendation 20 years later.",
  "I suppose --",
  "You may answer briefly.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Young.",
  "I'm interested in pursuing the point Justice Breyer raised. I am troubled by the idea that someone in the Bureau of Prisons makes this determination, but I -- I wonder how that -- how that helps you. You said it's either the jailer or the judge, and, therefore, you do have to decide it. But maybe it's either the first judge or the second judge.",
  "Why -- why isn't -- doesn't it make sense to say that the Federal court doesn't -- whoever is second can always tailor their sentence to what they want. Whoever is first just has to give the sentence that he or she thinks is appropriate.",
  "Doesn't compel -- no, doesn't compel the Federal sovereign. He would say: Look, I want to give 10 years.",
  "I see you've already got, you know, a -- a 15-year sentence under the Federal, but I don't want it to be 25 years. So, I'm going to, in fact, just give you a 5-year sentence. Do understand what I'm making --",
  "Whoever the second judge is can figure out exactly how long he thinks the sentence should run and give a sentence accordingly.",
  "It can't -- it can't if, for example, they're dealing with a mandatory minimum. Right? If the State court judge has to sentence the person to 10 years, then your explanation falls apart.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hawkins, you have 2 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-704, Messerschmidt v. Millender. Mr. Coates.",
  "There -- I suppose one new feature of the case is the fact that these officers submitted the affidavit to their superiors, who were -- were attorneys.",
  "Have we -- have we addressed that in a prior case?",
  "Whose house -- whose house was this?",
  "So, it was not the defendant's house?",
  "Of course --",
  "I was just going to say, of course you're making the case somewhat harder for yourself because the issue here is whether it was reasonable for him to say let me check and see what my superiors think about this and then, after that review, for him to say let's see what the magistrate thinks about this, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "Did you --",
  "Did you say apply protectively or correctly?",
  "Okay.",
  "Finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wolfson.",
  "Well, Malley involved a search warrant based solely on a wiretap in which an unknown individual discussed drug use at a party. That was all. It seems to me there's a lot more information here.",
  "Here you had a police officer who assembled information he had, truthful information, in the affidavit, submitted it to his superiors, who were lawyers. Then it was submitted to the magistrate, who was a judge. And what you have to say, it seems to me, is that a reasonably competent officer -- not objective good faith or anything like that -- a reasonable -- reasonably competent officer would say: You know, I know the lawyers in the office said this was okay and I know the judge said it was okay, but I know more than them; I know not only that it's not okay, but it's so clearly not okay that I shouldn't have qualified immunity. That seems to me a pretty heavy burden to put on -- put on the cop on the beat.",
  "We've been talking -- we've been talking about this for some time as if we're reviewing the adequacy of the warrant. We're not. We're reviewing the reasonableness of these officers' determination that there was probable cause. Do you think it is at all pertinent in addressing that question that the officers submitted the affidavit to support the warrant to Deputy District Attorney Jane Wilson, who reviewed it and signed off on it?",
  "I didn't ask if it's dispositive. Is it relevant in any way?",
  "Do you want -- do you want to encourage officers, when they're applying for search warrants, to have them reviewed by the deputy district attorney or not?",
  "Did they enter the residence?",
  "To cite Groh -- in Groh, the warrant did not identify the items to be seized at all.",
  "Your answer -- and, again, it seems to me we keep separating these two inquiries. It's not whether the warrant showed adequate probable cause; it's whether or not the officers were reasonable in believing that it did.",
  "And to cite Groh, a -- no reasonable officer could think that a warrant that doesn't say anything at all about what's to be seized complied with the Fourth Amendment.",
  "Counsel, do you -- do you contend that anything in the affidavit was false?",
  "What --",
  "What was that?",
  "Where did the --",
  "-- may have been -- may have staying there?",
  "And you say it was materially false that they said he resides there, and what he knew is that he may have been staying there?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Coates, you have 2 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-844, Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories v. Novo Nordisk. Mr. Hurst.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Horwich.",
  "What about --",
  "What about an APA action against the FDA for relying on the use code? Couldn't that be challenged as arbitrary and capricious?",
  "Justice Sotomayor.",
  "Finish your statement.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Perry.",
  "Oh, I'm sorry. What page were you again?",
  "Thanks.",
  "But the alternative is that the FDA is going to have to hire an awful lot of patent lawyers to review the -- the use codes and their correspondence to the actual patents.",

  "-- before your time is finished.",
  "But I'm still not following it. It's not listed simply because the number is wrong?",
  "The brand manufacturer has an overwhelming incentive to list the correct patent, doesn't it?",
  "So, why would we give a procedure to an adversary to fix the number when the brand manufacturer is going to fix it as soon as it's alerted to the problem?",

  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1265, Martel v. Clair. Mr. Campbell.",
  "Was there some way that Clair knew that the court was just about to issue its decision?",
  "I suppose you don't think that the standard of review is abuse of discretion, because if you do, then I suppose you're assuming that the district court has discretion whether to grant the motion or not instead of being confined by a particular standard.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman.",
  "So --",
  "So, what if last week we get notice from Mr. Clair that he is dissatisfied with his Supreme Court counsel, that communication has broken down, that you plan to argue particular -- present particular arguments, and he doesn't want you to do that. Do we have an obligation to conduct an inquiry into his complaint?",
  "No. He says -- he says: I've turned up new evidence, or I think this is a great argument, and my counsel has told me he is not going to raise it, and I want new counsel who will raise this argument. Will we have to say -- look at it and say, well, we have to figure out is that a good argument; is it better than the ones counsel are going to raise?",
  "Has communication broken down.",
  "I want to --",
  "I want to ask you about that. You mention that no fewer than six times in your brief. What is your point, that the judge altered his disposition of a legal matter before him for his personal convenience?",
  "Then what's the significance of the fact that he was going to retire?",
  "So, you are saying --",
  "So, you are saying he violated his judicial oath for his own personal convenience, that he failed to do something that you say he should have done, because he was retiring?",
  "So, why do you say six times in your brief that the judge was retiring the next day or retired the next day?",
  "There was another judge.",
  "There is another judge. She's available. I have to say it strikes me, frankly, as argument by innuendo that I think is very unjustified.",
  "I'm still trying to get to the point -- I'm sorry. I'm still trying to get to the point of the relevance of the fact that he was retiring.",
  "How does it go -- how does it go to the remedy?",
  "Counsel, I --",
  "No. I'm trying to help you. I understood you to say you had an answer to Justice Breyer's question.",
  "Why don't you finish your answer to Justice Sotomayor and then go back to Justice Breyer?",
  "Counsel, if -- the interests of justice, does that include the available resources of the Federal Public Defender? I mean, those offices are notoriously understaffed. And here you have a situation where one lawyer has been representing an individual for an awful long time, and the defendant says, I want a new lawyer. It's obviously going to take that -- a new lawyer away from their work and put them in a position of having to get up to speed in a new case. And I just wonder if that's part of this -- I won't call \"interests of justice\" a standard -- it's an aspiration. But does that go into the calculus?",
  "Well, that gets to my --",
  "Is the -- is the person in a different position with the new counsel than he would have been with the old concerning the standards about reopening things? In other words, do we say, well, what would the old counsel have been able to do with respect to reopening, and say, well, that's all the new counsel can do? In other words, new counsel doesn't allow you to circumvent the various --",
  "-- restrictions you just talked about.",
  "And one of the things --",
  "And one of the things I think the district court would do in that situation with the same counsel is say, look, this was a tactical strategic decision of the lawyer; you don't get to reopen something because of that. Now, does that same consideration apply with respect to the substituted counsel, or does the substituted counsel allow the defendant to get a leg up on the process and make new arguments that the old counsel couldn't make?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Campbell, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-8505, Williams v. Illinois. Mr. Carroll.",
  "But that's just because the photographing is something that people wouldn't dispute. I mean, what if the State presents testimony saying, I took the sample; I put it in the sample case; I sent it to Cellmark saying give us a DNA analysis of this sample; we got back from Cellmark the analysis with the same name on it? And the expert testifies, I compared that to DNA from the defendant, and it was a match. You would be free in cross-examining to say: Do you know what they did at Cellmark? And she would say: Well, they're a DNA lab; we asked them to do a DNA analysis. But do you know what happened? No, I don't. As far as you know, do they -- did they just ignore it and not do anything? Well, yes, I didn't -- I'm not testifying to what happened at Cellmark. I'm just telling you we sent the DNA there, and this is what we got back. Why is that not perfectly fine?",
  "They did not -- she does not say that. She said: We sent the sample marked \"crime scene\" or whatever it was. We got back a data sheet that said \"crime scene.\" Well, Expert, do you know that they didn't mix them up? No, I don't. All I know is what we sent and what we got back.",
  "And all the witness is -- all the witness is testifying to is what they sent and what they got back. And you're free to cross-examine about what went on at Cellmark, and a jury is free to say, well, I believe the circumstantial evidence about what happened. Or the defense counsel can say, why don't they have anybody here from Cellmark? And a jury can say, well, yes, that's a good point. It just seems to me that nobody from Cellmark is testifying, and what you're -- that's what you're objecting to, but they don't need that testimony to present the expert's conclusion to the jury.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Alvarez.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "No, it -- it doesn't though. It could have -- could it have a witness saying Cellmark is the nation's foremost DNA testing laboratory; they hire only people who have Ph.D.'s in DNA testing? I mean, is that all right?",
  "The State can make its case a lot stronger --",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Carroll, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "You do think our law is established, though, that a jury will follow an instruction in this situation to -- not to take the testimony for truth of the evidence, for truth of the matter.",
  "Do we have any -- any case saying that instruction is inadequate in a case like this?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1150, Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories. Mr. Shapiro.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli.",
  "That -- in your test for that -- I see on page 9 of your brief you say: \"a classic patent-eligible process,\" \"recites a series of acts, performed in the physical world, that transforms the subject of the process ... to achieve a useful result.\" So, I have a great idea. You take wood, you put it on a grate, you light it, and you've got heat. That is -- recites a series of acts performed in the physical world that transforms the subject of the process, the wood, to achieve a useful result, which is heat. So, I can get a patent for that?",
  "No, no, no. No. Well, let me put it --",
  "That's patent -- that's patent- eligible.",
  "I was just going to say, what is the great advantage you see of putting this critical question off until the 102, 103 analysis, rather than cutting it off at the beginning, 101, which I understand your friend to say is very important because you don't want people to have to pause terribly long to see if this is something they can -- can do?",
  "What about -- what about litigation? Is it -- it is easier to throw something out at the threshold level, isn't it, than to move further down the line?",
  "Justice Scalia.",
  "Finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Bress.",
  "Well, it seems to me that's your -- the problem with your whole approach is that every time you're pressed on 101, your answer is to fall back to 102 or 103 or the utility part of 101. And I'm just wondering why it's beneficial to essentially eliminate 101 and say, oh, we'll catch everything later on.",
  "Well, but just to --",
  "Sorry to interrupt. Your friend's point is that if you don't do this -- if you don't give 101 some more content, then the doctor is going to have to start worrying right from the get-go and then see, well, is there an exception that I might be able to rely on, as opposed to being able to say right away this -- I don't have to worry about this patent; I can treat the patient in this way.",

  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next today in Case 10-218, PPL Montana v. Montana. Mr. Clement.",
  "Well, maybe it demonstrates the non-navigability of the particular stretch, but we would still speak of the transfer of commerce as being along the river.",
  "The sort of case -- the analogy I was thinking of is if I say I fly from Washington to Tokyo; and someone says, no, you didn't, you flew to San Francisco, then you walked however many yards from one gate to another, and then you flew to Tokyo. And I would say, well, yes, there's a gap there when I -- you know, part of the distance where I wasn't flying, but people would still say you flew from D.C. to Tokyo. Now, why isn't this just like that, that the commercial path, the commercial waterway people think of as the Missouri? And, yes, occasionally you've got to get out, and, you know, we can debate how long the portage is, but it doesn't interrupt the notion that that whole pathway would qualify as a navigable waterway.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "I think, though, if you start drawing these lines, they become very difficult, in some rivers anyway, to -- to apply. I'm sure there are seasonable fluctuations. They may be navigable in some seasons, but not in others. The line at which you pass from navigability to non-navigability may be difficult to ascertain. It seems to me, once you start chopping the highway of commerce up, it does create all those difficulties.",
  "Your answer a moment ago gives me pause. You said the United States would not be bound by this litigation but could bring its own quiet title action.",
  "It's kind of odd. Maybe this is -- maybe this is Justice Alito's earlier question. It's kind of odd that the more navigable the river is, the more claim the State has. The less navigable -- where you're talking about sports boats and drift fishing -- then it's Federal.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre.",
  "But we're talking about the land at the bottom of the -- the river. What is it that the State can't do on the navigable waterways that it wants to do?",
  "No, but I'm not sure it has the same consequences. It seems to me that regardless of who prevails in this case, the State will be able to exercise regulatory jurisdiction over the waters. You know, you can't fish during these seasons, or there are different limits on how many fish you can take. And so will the Federal Government. It will be able to apply Federal law to the river regardless of who owns parts of the river, regardless of who owns the land underneath.",
  "Without regard -- but I would say without regard to whether they happened to own the land under the -- under the river or not.",
  "We haven't talked much about the Madison. What -- what is your best piece of evidence with respect to the Madison for the proposition that it was navigable at statehood?",
  "Well, fur trappers are going to go -- they don't need a lot of -- a lot of water to ply their canoes up the river.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1062, Sackett v. The Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Schiff.",
  "What if the sanction imposed each day was not the $37,000, but was $10? If you don't comply, you know, we can bring an action any time to enforce this, and you'll be subject to the statutory maximum, but during the period, the additional sanction for the -- under the administrative order, or the compliance order, is $10 a day.",
  "But it might go to adequacy of judicial review, the adequacy of the judicial review that would come when the EPA brings the enforcement action. I understood your argument to be that there was a significant extortion impact from the fact that these were such significant fines -- double, as you say -- that you could rack up for 5 years. But if it's only $10 a day, that takes a lot of the wind out of your sails, doesn't it?",
  "Could the -- I don't understand what exactly you might get from the Army Corps of Engineers. Obviously, they might give you a permit, and I take it that cuts off liability; you can do what you're hoping to do. They might say you don't get a permit because these are wetlands. Can they do something in the middle, which is: It's kind of hard for us to tell; you're on your own?",
  "Well, you -- would collateral estoppel apply to you because of the judicial determination on the compliance order in the subsequent enforcement action? In other words, you lose. You seek APA review, and the court says, you know, we think it's a wetland. And then the EPA brings an enforcement action. They have to establish it's a wetland. Don't they just attach a copy of the decision?",
  "Well, not -- I guess I'm back to Justice Scalia's question. This -- it struck me as a purely legal, jurisdictional issue: Are these wetlands or not? And I don't know why you would give deference to the agency's determination on a legal jurisdictional issue like that.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart.",
  "I don't follow -- I didn't follow that. What is your response to the assertion that you're subject to double penalties?",
  "One, for violating the Act; two, for violating the compliance order.",
  "Well, but you don't doubt that -- you don't doubt that they have the authority to do that?",
  "Justice Alito.",
  "Well, and that's not their argument today, either.",
  "Counsel, you referred a couple of times to the EPA's view of the statute. I take it that's your view as well?",
  "What would you - - what would you do, Mr. Stewart, if you received this compliance order? You don't think your -- your property has wetlands on it, and you get this compliance order from the EPA. What would you do?",
  "If they weren't in the record, I don't want to hear about them. You appreciate that rule, that we don't consider things that aren't in the record. You get a compliance order. You don't think your property has wetlands. What do you do?",
  "You wouldn't do that, right? You know you'll never get an after-the-fact permit if the EPA has sent you a compliance order saying you've got wetlands.",
  "That's what you would do? You would say: I don't think there are wetlands on my property, but EPA does. So, I'm going to take out all the fill; I'm going to plant herbaceous trees or whatever it is; and I'll worry about whether to -- that way, I'll just do what the government tells me I should do.",
  "In other words, what the landowner is supposed to do -- the agency says, because you didn't apply for a permit, you're in trouble because you didn't give us a chance to say whether we were going to take away your constitutional rights or not; so, we can do it.",
  "If you - -",
  "Well, that's - - that's right. In other words, you hope you have - - you've looked at it. You hope you have a sufficient basis. And because of the administrative compliance order, you're really never going to be put to the test because most landowners aren't going to say, I'm going to risk the $37,000 a day. All EPA has to do is make whatever finding it wants and realize that in 99 percent of the cases, it's never going to be put to the test.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Schiff, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1219, Kappos v. Hyatt. Ms. Anders.",
  "What if -- what if the new evidence is in reaction to the PTO's ruling? The PTO says: Look, we're not -- we're not going to issue a patent because you didn't show us that, you know, the valve in the back of the thing or whatever was -- was novel, and we think that's important. So - - and the applicant goes to, under 145, to the district court and said: Well, I didn't submit that evidence because I didn't have any idea that that was going to be a significant issue, and I'm -- you know, I'm sorry, but, you know, I have a good basis for not thinking of that, and here it is. Is that the type of new evidence that could be admitted?",
  "So, this is an exception? I thought you were telling us earlier you generally can't get - -",
  "Oh.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Panner.",
  "The problem I have with your submission: You say there are basically two routes to get review of a denial by the Patent Office. The first is, under 141, you appeal to the Federal Circuit, right, and in that situation, you're limited to the record before the agency - -",
  "-- on which you lost. And there's deference to the agency, which ruled against you. Under 145, you can add new evidence, you could address questions that the PTO raised, saying you don't -- you haven't dealt with this valve in the back, and you could say, well, here's new evidence dealing with that. There's no deference to the agency, and to some extent you can pick which judge you want to hear, to the extent you can -- can do that. Why would anybody proceed under section 141 instead of 145?",
  "So, that in -- in every case where it's anything other than a purely legal issue, you would go under 145?",
  "Well, I know. That's why I'm -- I'm really confused, because I take it that people don't often use 145, right? They almost always appeal to the Federal Circuit.",
  "Well, Ms. - - Ms. Anders told us that there's a procedure before the PTO that lets you deal with these -- that sort of something came up that you didn't think about, and you can address that.",
  "Because -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "I guess, as a practical matter, these things all end up before the Federal Circuit anyway, right?",
  "And I suppose that -- if you had the same case and one is coming up under the 141 and the other under 145, I suppose it's theoretically possible they could reach different results because of different standards of review.",
  "No, no. I know. I'm not saying -- the point is that although they all come before the Federal Circuit, they may come to them in a very different posture that would cause the Federal Circuit to rule differently if you had the same case under one and under the other.",
  "Right.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Panner. Ms. Anders, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next today in Case 11-713, Perry v. Perez, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Clement.",
  "You can finish your -- finish your answer, please, if you can.",
  "Counsel, I think there -- I see two different problems, and I'm not quite sure how to come out. One, you cannot assume that the legislature's plan should be treated as if it were precleared. The district court in Texas cannot assume or presume what the district court here in D.C. is going to do. But, on the other hand, it can't presume it the other way. In other words, it can't draw its interim plan assuming that there are going to be these section 5 violations because that's presuming what the court's going to do the other way. So, how do we decide between those two - - you have two wrong choices. How do we end up?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "Well, that's exactly right, but you see it only on one side of the problem. You say, well, you can't treat it as if it's been precleared - -",
  "-- because that would be prejudging what the court in D.C. is going to do. But you have no trouble with them saying - - assuming that there are going to be these section 5 violations and drawing additional majority-minority districts, which is just assuming on the other -- the other way what the court here in D.C. is going to do.",
  "I don't know how you -- you lean one way and say, well, it's horrible, you can't use it because it hasn't been precleared; but it's all right in drawing the interim plan to treat it as there -- as if preclearance has been denied.",
  "And if you look - - and if you look at Joint Appendix 146 - -",
  "-- to 147, it looks the exact opposite. It looks like they're drawing minority coalition opportunity districts to draw them because they have anticipated how they think the district court in D.C. is going to come out.",
  "You do.",
  "We -- we'll let you go on for a little longer. We may have a few more questions.",
  "Counsel, I have - - your position -- I understand you're straddling a position. That's why you're sitting in the back rather than the front row between the two parties. But it's a little unsatisfying because what you say we should do when we are all under the gun of very strict time limitations is we should send it back to the district court so it can give a greater explanation of what it's done. Isn't that going to be very wasteful? I mean, it's kind of an odd order from this Court to send to a district court saying, you know, tell us more.",
  "Maybe a brief answer. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garza.",
  "I'm sorry. I'm not -- I didn't - -",
  "I don't mean to interrupt, but I didn't follow that. So long as a district has been challenged in D.C., the court in Texas should not accept it?",
  "And that's right, but -- but it goes the other way when you say they can't approve something that's been challenged. Aren't you assuming that the plaintiffs are right?",
  "And that's an inquiry that belongs to the district court in D.C.",
  "The constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act isn't at issue here, right?",
  "Okay. Maybe you could turn for a moment to the issue that I see on Joint Appendix 146 and 147. They don't say a minority coalition opportunity district just happened to emerge. It said that district 33 was drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district. And we've never held that it is appropriate or even permissible to draw a district where you're putting in together two minorities, two different minority groups. And it seems to me that that raises all sorts of different concerns. It's one thing under the Voting Rights Act to say that this group votes as a bloc and has been discriminated against in its ability to elect representatives of its choice. It's another thing to say that two different minority groups are put together because they share some particular view so that one candidate is going to be each of theirs candidate - - candidates of choice. That goes quite a step further from what we've upheld under the Voting Rights Act. And here you have the district court creating that in the absence of any State expression of a desire to create that type of -- of district.",
  "Oh, it is. It says - -",
  "New district 33 was drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district. I don't see how that can be read any way other than saying -- saying when we sat down and drew it, we drew this one as a minority coalition opportunity district.",
  "I'm sorry. When you say something can be read differently than that and say because they said something else somewhere else, that's not responsive.",
  "I'm sorry. Why - - why do you care -- why do they care then that it was drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district? You're saying they didn't do that at all. They just followed precinct lines and everything else. Why would they say something?",
  "When -- so, when do you - -",
  "And when do you expect our decision on the appeal from the district court in D.C.?",
  "I don't think we do, either. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, you have 3 minutes remaining.",

  "Well, I'm not sure that -- this may just simply be repeating Justice Sotomayor's question, but if they say we have to raise the assessment 10 percent because, as she said, you know, we estimated the printing costs for the union newsletter, whatever, was going to be this and it turns out they raised it, it's going to be that; so, we know we're going to have to get additional money, for things that are indisputably chargeable, why do you need special procedures in that case?",

  "But this is not - - this is not an incidental matter. I mean, the whole point of your friend's argument with the Hudson notice is they want people to understand what's happening with the -- their union money. And they say this notice didn't let people know that. And if the case is not moot and if they prevail, they will have a right to be heard on what the notice should say. And that will make a difference in how many people opt out or how many people don't. And I guess I'm following up on Justice Kagan's question. That's a very important part of this case, what the notice is going to say, and if we accept your view that it's moot, that issue goes by the wayside.",
  "I'm sorry. I don't see how that -- I don't see how that works. The notice is only required by the district court if the case is not moot. If the case is moot by the notice you sent out, the district court doesn't have a case on the basis of which to order a different notice.",
  "But -- I want you to move to the merits. It may be a good time to do that.",
  "I thought your point, though -- this was a very special ballot initiative. That's what the literature suggests, that this was not sort of the normal run in the course - - every 2 years, every election cycle, we spend something. That's why it's a special assessment.",
  "No, it's not short-term; it's just until November 7th or whatever.",
  "One reason -- I mean, we're dealing with the situation where the union is compelling nonunion members to give them money for political activities. We allow, as I understand Hudson, as I read it, because you can't figure out what that is, you wait until the end of the year. In other words, it's a compromise for administrative convenience. Normally, you wouldn't allow it at all, as -- at least under the law as I read it, you would not allow people to take money -- you would not allow the union to take money from people who don't want to spend it on political activities so the union can spend it on political activities. But we allow that in the course of the year because it's impossible as you go on to sort these things out. I thought the argument on the other side was when you have a special assessment, an additional charge, there you don't have the administrative problem. You can tell it's .25 percent. So, you can't take that until you tell them, do you want to object or are you happy -- are you fine with having this spent on political purposes?",
  "But on the -- I'm reading from the district court opinion. It said that this assessment would be used -- and they're quoting from union material -- \"for a broad range of political expenses, including television, radio advertising, direct mail, voter registration, voter education, and get out the vote activities in our work sites and in communities across California.\" And it further said, quote, \"The fund will not be used for regular costs of the union such as office rent, staff salaries or routine equipment replacement.\"",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Young, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Briefly, counsel.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1293, Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations. General Verrilli.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Well, that's because broadcasts didn't commonly have this sort of -- these sorts of words or these sorts of images.",
  "Well, no, we know.",
  "I mean, we can -- it was not the case from 1927 till whenever you -- what, 1970-something -- that nudity commonly appeared on broadcast television or the various words we're dealing with here commonly appeared. So, it seems a bit much to say, well, they didn't bring any cases for that period. There were no cases to be brought.",
  "But that -- but that -- that cuts both ways. People who want to watch broadcasts where these words or expose their children to broadcasts where these words are used, where there is nudity, there are 800 channels where they can go for that. All we're asking for, what the Government is asking for, is a few channels where you can say I'm not going to -- they're not going to hear the \"S\" word, the \"F\" word. They're not going to see nudity. So, the proliferation of other media, it seems to me, cuts against you.",
  "Well, that's your argument there, is that it's not a legitimate objective to have a safe harbor.",
  "Well, but that depends what your audience --",
  "It depends what audience you're -- you're trying to get and the demographic. If you're trying to get an audience that is older, maybe you will decide this is what is going to attract them. They don't want sanitized language. They want to hear the -- the -- all those other words. If your target is a much younger audience, maybe that will happen. But the idea that you're -- the problem is going to go away because you're going to be good as you can be, that seems an odd way to analyze First Amendment problems.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Waxman.",
  "People understand -- what you're -- have demonstrated, I think, is that the context matters. People understand that, including children. When they hear a bad word when someone hits their thumb with a hammer, they understand that's different than having an adult stand in normal conversation and use the words. And it seems to me that your position is saying that the government cannot regulate with an understanding of what takes place in the real world. The government's effort is to try to understand the context. That's why you get a different rule in \"Saving Private Ryan\" than you get with Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. And what your argument seems to be is they can't take context into account.",
  "That's what you found -- that's what you've got over --",
  "That's what you've got over 85 years.",
  "I -- I'm going to let you get all four out. But on that, the reasonable deference to the broadcasters, your policy was not to allow people in the situation of Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie to use those words.",
  "So, if they deferred to your reasonable judgment, your friend's reasonable judgment, they would sanction those.",
  "Okay. Go on to number two.",
  "Your time's -- I think you are. Your time is about to expire. If you want to get your four points out, you'd better move.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Finish your sentence, please.",
  "Thank you, General, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1016, Coleman v. The Court of Appeals of Maryland. Mr. Foreman.",
  "Where -- where are you reading from, counsel?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Howard.",
  "Well, you can provide this, the kind of relief that's sought here, without waiving immunity, right? It's a matter of legislation.",
  "Could I just get back to the discussion before about how (D) relates to the others?",
  "Who do you think benefits most from subsection (E), men or women? That's the one about armed services obligations at the time the law was passed.",
  "You can finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Foreman, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Do you think it would be - -",
  "Do you think it would be -- how would this case come out if we were dealing with -- with subsection (E)? Do you think that should be treated separately than the prior ones?",
  "How?",
  "If -- if we think that you should look at these provisions separately, where with respect to (D) -- and I'm looking at one of our prior precedents -- has Congress unequivocally declared its intent to abrogate sovereign immunity?",
  "Unequivocally. Not on the basis of implications from -- from how the other provisions work. But if you do look at (D), is there any place where Congress unequivocally declared its intent to abrogate State sovereign immunity?",
  "Well, but your - - the answer you gave to my request depends entirely on a conclusion that (D) is linked to (A), (B), and (C) because, otherwise, you don't have the argument that it's precisely relief with respect to a discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-1399, Roberts v. Sea-Land Services. Mr. Gillelan.",
  "When -- one of the arguments on the other side that I thought made some sense was the idea that you should focus on a particular point in time when you're figuring out what the amount of the award is going to be; that it doesn't make - - that it's at least odd to say, well, we're going to calculate how much you're entitled to at this point, but in terms of the applicable maximum, we're going to wait however long it takes and calculate that as of this point. Doesn't it make more sense to figure out the applicable numbers at the same point in time?",
  "So, if we think - - if we think the statute -- in other words, your argument, your response, is that the statute is unambiguous and it can't be read - -",
  "-- in a more sensical way.",
  "Okay.",
  "It's not a serious - -",
  "Go ahead. You've been -- you've been waiting the longest.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Palmore.",
  "So, if you're - -",
  "So, if you're walking down the street, you're on a business enterprise, they haven't shoveled the snow, you slip and fall and you're hurt, you go home and say: Good news, I've been awarded damages.",
  "-- of the gray brief.",
  "But you're doing that -- you're doing that without an award.",
  "So, how can you say what the employer pays should be considered an award?",
  "It's without an award.",
  "But those aren't going to be the typical cases, I think. You said there may be cases, and I suppose there may be. I assume what happens -- employers just don't write checks. They say this is how we calculate what we owe you. And it is based on the maximum of this year, not any future ones, and if the employee says no, no, no; I have a right to get the -- then the employer will say, well, okay, I either agree with that or not, but you don't get a check.",
  "I -- I understand the amounts at issue here. What is a usual amount that's at stake in this sort of case? We're talking about the concerns -- I guess on both -- about gamesmanship, but how much difference are we talking about?",
  "I don't know; maybe you don't have statistics, on an average.",
  "The consequence -- I mean, there's the time value of money, too. The consequence of the employee saying I'm going to wait 5 years because I think the maximum is going to be a lot higher is that he doesn't get anything in the meantime, right?",
  "It's reasonable for an employer to say, okay, if you want to wait, I'll wait.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Palmore. We'll let Mr. Keisler speak for a bit. Mr. Keisler.",
  "But it's not the way it's used in 914.",
  "But how much of a practical problem is this? I understand the -- the amounts are here, but it's 5 years, and apparently the employee was happy to wait 5 years to get an award. Normally, if you're an employee and you're disabled, and the employer says, well, here's what we're going to give you, and it's based on the maximum of the latest we have, you're not going to say: I'm going to wait; these wages are going to go up nationally, and I'm going to wait a year; maybe I'll wait 4 years because I think there's a trend on national average wages, and I'm going to cash in on that; I'm going to be without money for the next 4 years and I'm disabled, but -- I mean, that doesn't sound to me to be a plausible situation.",
  "Well, no, I mean - - I don't know what the employers do, but usually in a situation like this, the employers have good lawyers and they write at the end of the check, you know: This is in full satisfaction of any claims under the -- the whatever.",
  "Does the maximum always go up?",
  "Theoretically, it can go down.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gillelan, if I got that right, you have 2 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-1018, Filarsky v. Delia. Ms. Millett.",
  "But your test -- and this is -- I think goes broader than the articulation of the test -- doesn't give this private attorney much assurance by itself. It's sort of a multifactor, is he coordinating, is he under the supervision, is he really doing public service? I mean, if the idea is to give him sufficient breathing room so he doesn't stop, and when, as in this case, he's threatened that we're going to sue you if you do this, he has to think, well, now, am I being supervised by the government? Am I coordinating with the government? Or I -- am I telling them what -- it -- the test itself undermines the asserted purpose.",
  "Lawyers are not supposed to be cowed by the exigencies of the situation. We're worried in qualified immunity with protecting governmental actors, to make sure they will feel comfortable doing the right thing rather than being intimidated in the situation we had here. Lawyers have that professional obligation in the first place. So, why does a lawyer need the -- the defense of qualified immunity?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Millett. We'll hear from Ms. Saharsky first.",
  "That's all right. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "So, if they don't work closely together at all and it's just this one fellow conducting the investigation, he wouldn't have qualified immunity?",
  "I'm sorry. No, he - -",
  "-- I'm wrong, or no - -",
  "So, what -- what if it's a 100 percent purely volunteer fire department? I mean, the town, whatever, contracts, out-sources, whatever, but it's just run by volunteers. Is your answer the same? I'm trying to get at your point about they're working with or coordinating with government employees. And your argument seems a little derivative. You're saying the whole point is to protect the government employees, and you have to have qualified immunity for the non-employee to do that. But does your argument apply when there are no government employees around?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. McGill.",
  "Your case - -",
  "No, you can finish your answer.",
  "Your case highlights -- I think is a very good example of why the lawyer ought to have qualified immunity. I mean, this was a case where it looks like there's a lot of threatening and bullying going on. I mean, the -- the lawyer says -- you know, we're going to figure out a way to name you, Mr. Filarsky. You're issuing an illegal order. If you want to take that chance go right ahead. You might want to think -- take a minute to think about it. I mean, it seems exactly the kind of situation for which qualified immunity was -- was developed. We want Filarsky to give what he -- do what he thinks is the right thing in this situation. We don't want him to be worried about the fact that he might be sued. And you have a lawyer here saying, well, if you do that, I'm going to sue you. So, Filarsky naturally, or some lawyer in that situation, is going to think, wow, do I really want to run that risk? Isn't that exactly why we have qualified immunity?",
  "Well, that's easy for a judge to say because they're absolutely immune, but for the lawyer who is sitting there and saying - -",
  "-- saying I'm going to sue you, if you were -- well, you are a lawyer. And you're sitting in that situation. Isn't that going to enter into your mind? You say, well, sue all you want; I don't care; this is the right answer.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, how do you know?",
  "Well, he had -- he had the chief issue the order, right?",
  "And then the chief later on says, well, he told me to issue the order. I mean, I'm not quite sure that things went exactly as they would if you had qualified immunity.",
  "Well, particularly - -",
  "Well, even as -- the reason it's an issue is because he says, look, I've got this stuff at my house. That's how his -- his defense is. I haven't used it; I've got the insulation there. So, you think it's still clearly established that it violates the Fourth Amendment for the city to say, okay, well, show it to us if you want to use that as your defense?",
  "What if Filarsky was there, you know, hired to help the fire department with these -- and he did absolutely nothing? He just sits there and watches. The battalion chief says, I want to do this; I'm going to go get the stuff; you bring it all out. And he just -- he just sits there, doesn't see any reason to offer any legal advice or opinion. Could you still sue him under 1983?",
  "Really? He has an obligation as a lawyer to speak up if he thinks something illegal is going on. That's his job. And he doesn't -- he just sits there quietly?",
  "What if he -- this for profits -- I -- the significance of that eludes me. Sometimes people act out of, you know, public service, and particularly in these sorts of situations, the town needs a lawyer, and he's helping out. What -- if he were purely a volunteer, it would be a different answer?",
  "And, well -- and what if he gives the city a discount? He's working for half -- half his fee because it's the city. He wants to help out, but he can't do it totally for free. So, it's 50 percent his normal rate.",
  "Are all of these - - are all of these objections applicable as well to the determination of whether there is state action from the attorney's conduct?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "But your -- your objection is not that he was investigating workplace conduct; your objection is that he was ordering people to tell your client to bring out stuff that was in his house.",
  "Yes, but telling people basically either executing a search or in effect executing a search, that is a uniquely governmental function.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-139, United States v. Home Concrete & Supply. Mr. Stewart.",
  "Well, but only if your reading of the Colony decision is correct, right? If we think that Colony definitively resolved the question before you, the regulation can't overturn that.",
  "Well, if they use the exact same phrase, and it's a fairly detailed - - it's not just a normal phrase they might use elsewhere, I think it's reasonable to assume that that phrase came in with the baggage it -- it carried from the Colony case; right?",
  "Well, about that argument, you rely very heavily on the fact that Justice Harlan used the term \"ambiguous,\" right?",
  "But he was writing very much in a pre-Chevron world. I -- he was certainly not on notice that that was a term of art or would become a term of art. And, of course, I didn't know him, but my sense is he was very gracious and polite. And you can see him saying, well, that's a good argument, but.... He's not the sort of person who would say this is it, this is it. I don't think you necessarily can take the use of the word \"unambiguous\" in his opinion to mean what it does today.",
  "Is there -- is there a case where we applied Chevron deference to a pre-Chevron opinion? In other words saying, well, the Court looked at that, but the Court said it was ambiguous; and so, we apply Chevron.",
  "Well, yes, that's the general principle. But the point you made just a few moments ago is -- I think is responsive to that, which is: We're not talking about the merits; we're talking about a statute of limitations. The whole point of a statute of limitations is some things that are bad are -- are -- are gone.",
  "You can't go back to them.",
  "At what -- at what level of the IRS bureaucracy can you feel comfortable that the advice you're getting is correct?",
  "A single district counsel -- you go to there and say, what do you think? And it tells you, and you say, well, that's fine, but I know you don't count; so, I want to talk to your boss and boss - -",
  "So -- so, what that -- what happened here is that the taxpayer came to the same conclusion as a district counsel of the IRS.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre, is it implicit that you always have a basis?",
  "Before -- if I could just interrupt you, before you do so, to follow up on Justice Kagan's question. Under our current regime, can you ever give more than a 70 percent chance? Because you have, in the absence of a definitive Supreme Court ruling, the IRS can reach a different result and it can do that retroactively. So, I mean, you don't disagree with that, right? I mean, if we determine that Colony was ambiguous, the IRS can change the rule in Colony, and it can apply that rule, new rule, retroactively. That's what our cases say, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Stewart, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Mr. Stewart, I know you've got a -- your third point, and I want to let you get it out, but you mentioned Brand X. Have we ever applied Brand X to one of our decisions? Have we ever said an agency by regulation can alter and change one - - a Supreme Court decision?",
  "Well, but that was applying it to a court of appeals decision.",
  "Right. We've never said an agency can change what we've said the law means.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1211, Vartelas v. Holder. Mr. Bibas.",
  "So, your expectations argument is that somebody trying to figure out whether to go ahead and rob the bank is going to say, well, if I do and I'm caught and I'm found guilty, I won't be able to take temporary trips abroad; so, I'm not going to rob the bank.",
  "Well, you're concerned under Landgraf, I think, with whether or not it disrupts settled expectations. And it just doesn't seem to me that this issue enters into the expectations at all when the pertinent act, which is the commission of the crime, not the pleading guilty, takes place.",
  "I would have thought your answer to my colleague would be: No, what they want to regulate is the staying in the country, and they're trying to make that as uncomfortable as possible in order to encourage the individual to leave. If he can't go to the, you know, parent's party, the cousin's wedding or whatever, he's just going to leave, and then once he does, he can't come back. Why would -- why would the Government care -- it's a question for them, I'm sure. Why would they care whether somebody that they don't want to be here stays here? It seems to me the exact opposite. So, I would have thought your argument -- your answer would be, no, what they're trying to regulate is not the coming and going, but simply the staying.",
  "Does it matter in the examples that you just gave that admission to the United States is purely a matter of legislative grace, while we might conclude that teaching, being a member of the bar, whatever, is not?",
  "I'm sorry. What - - an which privilege was that?",
  "Suppose that might have been regarded as such then but not under current law.",
  "When they decide to plead guilty?",
  "The operative issue here is when they commit the crime.",
  "So, this -- so, this - -",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Miller.",
  "Counsel, I have to -- I just don't understand this statute. This is somebody we would not allow into the country. And yet, the only thing we say is you can't leave. I just don't understand how that -- how that works.",
  "No. Right.",
  "Well, I know, and I understand that there is a limitation on actually deporting the person. But here I would think the one thing you want the person to do is leave. Maybe for a particular event, but maybe he'll decide to stay in Greece if once he's there for the -- but it seems very odd to say we're going to show you how much we don't want you here; we're not going to let you leave.",
  "What is the -- what is the policy underlying the rule that doesn't allow somebody who has a lawful status here to go to his grandmother's funeral - -",
  "-- and come back? It's going to take 4 days. He goes; he comes back. What policy supports prohibiting that travel?",
  "Okay. They're two different things, but I don't know that you've articulated what the policy is to prevent -- prohibit somebody from doing that.",
  "Could you go over again for me your distinction of St. Cyr?",
  "You don't argue that -- that the significance of what the individual is giving up makes a difference?",
  "Is there -- is there a difference in terms of what they face if they don't plead guilty? I've always had difficulty with St. Cyr and the notion that, say, someone pleads -- is facing, you know, 10 years, and they plead -- plead guilty to 2 years, that the -- the reason they did that is to, you know, avoid one of these immigration provisions. It seems to me it is to avoid 8 years.",
  "And I just wonder if the relative significance of what is at issue under the immigration law is something that we can take into account, or if St. Cyr prohibits that?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Miller.",
  "Mr. Bibas, you have 6 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1542, Holder v. Gutierrez, and the consolidated case. Ms. Kruger.",
  "You say that you think the statute is unambiguous, but it -- it doesn't address issues of imputation at all, does it?",
  "Well, if it doesn't even address it, it seems to me the best you can say is that it's ambiguous.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kinnaird.",
  "I don't know whether -- I'm having trouble applying the concepts of unambiguous and ambiguous in this situation. As far as I can tell, this is something that the statute just doesn't deal with, and I don't know that you characterize that correctly as ambiguous. It's just kind of off the table.",
  "But it doesn't have to grapple with everything that's not there. I mean, there are a lot of things that the statutes don't address.",
  "It seems to me that they don't have to grapple with everything that's there. You just have to say this doesn't address it. So, whoever is asking for the affirmative, which is you, loses.",
  "You're saying: We think this law should allow -- should provide for this, should be extended for this. And it's one thing to say, well, the statute's ambiguous; it talks about children in one category but not in another category; so, the issue's there; we don't know what they meant. It's another thing if it's something that's totally not on the table. I mean, if -- if you claimed that the law required every minor to get $500 a year, you wouldn't say the statute was ambiguous about that. You'd say it doesn't have anything to do with it.",
  "Isn't it -- why can't the BIA adopt or why doesn't the background principle apply that you're not entitled to admission unless you make an affirmative case for it? You say, well, the -- the government hasn't advanced any policy reason on the other side. Why isn't that the basic policy of the government?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kinnaird. Mr. Rothfeld.",
  "We usually like to start with the statutory language. Where is this issue addressed in this statute at all?",
  "What does the statute say about imputation of individuals' residence to grandparents?",
  "It says nothing about it. So, would you say the statute is ambiguous on whether or not residents' legal permanent residence status should be imputed to grandparents?",
  "I suppose one of the things he could take into account in exercising his discretion is whether we're actually dealing with a minor, or, as I understand in this case, it's someone who is quite a bit older.",
  "You -- you said you had two points. Do you want to get your second out, in half a sentence?",
  "Thank you. Ms. Kruger, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Counsel, in response to Justice Kennedy's question about whether they gave a policy reason, your answer was that they, you know, followed the history. I'm not sure that's the same as a policy.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1042, Freeman v. Quicken Loans. Mr. Russell.",
  "I -- your argument that \"percentage\" can include 100 percent is certainly true as a matter of logic. But in the phrase \"portion, split, or percentage,\" I think the more natural reading of \"percentage\" is something less than 100 percent. In other words, you're apportioning or you're splitting the fee with somebody else.",
  "You could have -- \"portion\" I suppose could still mean a full portion; \"split\" probably not. But, I mean, the more natural reading is surely a division.",
  "But the -- one reason -- one objection to your idea that, well, this covers partial, so it must cover 100 percent, is that it's a very different issue if you're talking about partial and 100 percent. If you're talking about partial, you have a classic case of a -- a kickback. But if you suddenly say 100 percent of an unearned fee, that's a much more difficult question to decide. In this case, for example, you get a whole bunch of things from Quicken Loans, including the loan and all this other stuff, and it's kind of hard to single out, well, this part is unearned but this part is earned; it's kind of a whole package. When you have a portion or split, it's an entirely different issue.",
  "Yes, but there -- it's a more -- it's a narrower issue when you're talking about a portion. Let's say the kickback goes to the appraiser. Maybe you can decide in that case whether the loan company really had anything to do with the appraisal at all. When the alleged unearned fee goes to the whole loan company, it's a little harder to say which part was unearned and which parts might have been earned.",
  "It's just -- it's the way these loans work, right? I mean, it's the same thing whether you pay 10 percent and no points or 9 percent and 3 points. You know, which one of those is earned or unearned, it's kind of hard to sort it out.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Russell. Ms. O'Connell.",
  "What does that mean? In other words, the rate that was offered -- they said you pay two points and you will get a rate of 8 percent. And you're saying that even if they didn't pay the two points, they would still get a rate of 8 percent?",
  "Thank you, Ms. O'Connell. Mr. Hefferon.",
  "So, you think there could be an earned kickback.",
  "If it's okay to get money for a referral, what type of kickback is not okay?",
  "What -- you were you about to tell us what we said in Long Island Home.",
  "Which -- putting aside the notice-and-comment point, which I think is at least ambiguous, which of our cases stands for the proposition that whether or not we give Chevron deference depends on the thoroughness with which the agency addressed an issue, rather than simply an announcement of its interpretation?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Russell, you have 5 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1472, Kouichi Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Limited. Mr. Fried.",
  "Well, that -- but she's not interpreting it. She's already got the thing in whatever language they're -- English, I guess. But, I mean, she's not interpreting; she's reading the English translation.",
  "Oh, I misunderstood the hypothetical, then. I'm sorry.",
  "I thought it was a situation where you've got a -- a document in -- in, say, French and the person translates it or interprets it -- I don't want to prejudge the issue -- and -- and then -- in English and then the person reads the English thing in -- in court. That's not interpretation at any point, is it?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Fried. Mr. Himmelfarb.",
  "One -- one of the things that concerns me is the impact of -- of cost allowance on the normal litigation incentives. An interpreter in court is one thing. When you suddenly get a situation where the costs could be quite large, particularly in a -- in a disparate way, not necessarily shared by both sides -- somebody goes into court; they know they're going to have to -- if they lose, they'll have to pay an interpreter this. And the other side comes in and says, well, we think we need to submit this 10,000 pages of -- of documents, which will have to be translated, and by the way, if you lose, you're going to pay for that. In other words, it is a much more variable element of costs than the interpreter.",
  "So, what -- so, what goes into the exercise of that discretion?",
  "Well, there are two -- there may be two permissible, but you don't dispute the fact that it is more natural and common to speak of someone interpreting oral communication and someone translating written, correct?",
  "Well, just to phrase your answer a different way, you're -- you don't know of any situation in the U.S. Code where \"translators\" -- or \"interpreter\" means \"translator\"?",
  "And you checked every one; so, there is none, right?",
  "It's an odd result because nobody's going to do it, because at that point you don't know who is going to get saddled with the costs. So, it wouldn't be likely that you would do something that would increase the costs, would it?",
  "Where are you reading from?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fried, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1320, Blueford v. Arkansas. Mr. Sloan.",
  "Well, it's --",
  "I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "Right, but that's the final say. You don't know what the jury did as a preliminary matter. I would think it in a case like this perfectly reasonable for the jury to say: Let's take a preliminary vote; we'll go down; and if -- if we all agree on something right away, that's what we'll do. Does everybody agree on capital murder? No, some don't. Does everybody agree on murder? No. Does everybody agree on manslaughter? Yes. Okay, we all know that manslaughter, he's at least guilty. Now let's go back and talk about the more serious offense, and some of us will try to persuade the holdouts. And yet, you would say as soon as they reached the point of saying, yes, he's guilty on manslaughter, they can't go back.",
  "You've talked about our manifest necessity decisions. It's true that we -- isn't it, that we said last year we have never reversed the district courts' exercise of discretion under the manifest necessity standard?",
  "Yes.",
  "In -- and under that -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "I don't want to -- I'm sorry for taking up your time, but your friend says you did not object when the judge announced that he was going to declare a mistrial; is that correct?",
  "Thank you, counsel. General McDaniel.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Sloan, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Sloan, General. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-210, United States v. Alvarez. General Verrilli.",
  "Well, where do you stop? I mean, there are many things that people know about themselves that are objectively verifiable where Congress would have an interest in protecting. High school diploma. It is a crime to state that you have a high school diploma if you know that you don't. That's something you can check pretty easily. And Congress can say: We want people to finish high school. It's a big thing to have a high school diploma. So, we want to make sure nobody goes around saying they do when they don't. What about that case?",
  "The substantial interest is the one that I've just said.",
  "Could I -- I want to follow up on Justice Scalia's question because I'm not sure I understood. The Government's position is that there is no First Amendment value in a false representation of fact, by which I understand you to mean not parody or something like that, but a statement that's intended to be understood as true. There is no First Amendment value in that statement. It may be protected because of the \"breathing space\" argument, but in whatever context, in whatever guise, there's no protection in that false representation as such.",
  "And I suppose it might have something to do with -- I don't know whether to call it collateral or not. I mean, I would think the concern in the midst of a political campaign is you have the U.S. attorney or the deputy district attorney bringing a -- filing a prosecution of someone 2 weeks before the election saying, well, you lied about this or that. And maybe there'd have to be a deposition, or maybe there'd have to be a trial. I don't -- nothing like that's involved here.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Verrilli. Mr. Libby.",
  "What is -- what is the First Amendment value in a lie, a pure lie?",
  "The value of what?",
  "What does that mean?",
  "No, not exaggerate -- lie.",
  "Well, but that was for literary purposes. No one is suggesting you can't write a book or tell a story about somebody who earned a Medal of Honor, and it's a fictional character; so, he obviously didn't. It just seems to me very different.",
  "That's not a statement about one's self. This is -­",
  "Excuse me. Sorry.",
  "It seems to me that the Stolen Valor Act is more narrow than that. And I would say, in that situation, you would not describe what the individual in Justice Breyer's hypothetical was as simply telling a -- a false statement about himself. It is about whether there is someone hiding in the attic. It is not about himself.",
  "In order to -­",
  "It seems to me that that's missing the limitation that the Government has read into this statute: Not damage, not for parody, not to avoid the discovery of someone who should be hidden, not in order to do something with respect to one's grandson. It's just a purely false statement about oneself. What -- what -- what is the First Amendment value in that, again?",
  "Well, of course, they do in countless areas, the state does, whether you're talking about defamation, trademark, perjury, all sorts of things. You can't adopt that as a general principle and apply it without regard to the situation.",
  "I don't understand the Government to argue that the speech at issue here is totally unprotected. I understand them to argue -- I mean, is -- it's totally unprotected. I understand them to argue that it can be limited under its \"breathing space\" rationale. In other words, it's not within one of the categories of totally unprotected speech. You do have to analyze it under the First Amendment, and you analyze it to determine if it chills protected speech.",
  "Well, not under your theory, right? I mean, it -- I mean, it's still a sanction for telling something that you say is protected under the First Amendment, whether you get 6 months or a medal of shame doesn't matter under your theory.",
  "How do we -- how do we know that? He was politically active, right?",
  "He was involved -­ well, doesn't it help a politician to have a congressional Medal of Honor?",
  "But it seems to me that your willingness to say that this statute is valid so long as there's some benefit to the person who lies, it's an awfully big concession.",
  "So, if he -- so, if he makes this statement at a debate when he's running for office, then you can prosecute him because getting the office is presumably something of value. It presumably has some pecuniary aspect to it.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Libby. General Verrilli, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Oh, yes.",
  "Thank you, General, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-9995, Wood v. Milyard. Ms. Lord.",
  "And that's what we said in Day, isn't it?",
  "No, no. Keep going with your --",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Domenico.",
  "That's a matter of discretion with the court of appeals?",
  "Please.",
  "Thank you, counsel. We will hear from Ms. Sherry first.",
  "Ms. Sherry.",
  "So, you're saying that if the court of -- court says, you know, you have a good state -- limitations defense, you would clearly win on that, but I'm going to ignore it, even though you didn't raise it?",
  "Would it be an abuse of discretion for the court not to accept a valid, evident statute of limitations defense on the ground that the State didn't raise it?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Lord, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Finish your sentence, please.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-45, Elgin v. Department of the Treasury. Mr. Schwartz.",
  "I'm sorry, just to clarify: No, they wouldn't say that? Or -- I'm -- I lost this, which way your \"no\" was going.",
  "But could I --",
  "Could I please verify your answer to Justice Kennedy before you move on?",
  "So, that is the rule --",
  "That's the rule that you would apply across the board so long -- only in the case of a facial challenge do you get to go to the district court? If it's an as-applied -- this law was unconstitutional as applied to me -- that's still before the MSPB?",
  "But that's not your position, as I understood it, in your response to my earlier question. You said that the -- it is all right to have as-applied constitutional challenges presented to the MSPB or not presented but then reviewed in the Federal Circuit.",
  "Okay, but -- but within the statutory scheme, are you saying that a claim that this statute is, while not facially unconstitutional, unconstitutional as applied to me -- Where does that go?",
  "I think it's probably mine.",
  "Where does -- where does -- where does that claim go?",
  "Yes, what type -- summer interns and FBI employees?",
  "I assume that's for very different reasons -- one because they are summer interns, and, you know, if they are impermissibly treated, it's kind of -- they're summer interns. There's no reason to get --",
  "I don't -- I don't mean that facetiously. I mean, what they're saying is that there's some level of de minimis personnel actions when you're talking about the vast Federal bureaucracy that we don't have to really give, you know, the whole panoply of rights. And FBI agents, I assume, because it's the sensitive nature of what they deal with. So, I guess what I'm saying is, do you want us to focus on the millions of employees who would now be going to district court or do you want us to focus on the small number that have facial constitutional challenges?",
  "Is it really a question of jurisdiction of the MSPB?",
  "\"Jurisdiction\" is a word with many meanings.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin.",
  "Could I ask you to pause --",
  "-- briefly on that question? So, the government -- if Mr. Schwartz comes in before the MSPB and says we have three witnesses who are going to testify only on the constitutional issue; I have this volume of evidence about what's happening in the military; it's only relevant in the constitutional issue; and, you know, it's going to take us 2 days to present this -- the government is going to say it's okay with us, right?",
  "They're not going to object that that's beyond the jurisdiction of the agency to decide.",
  "If I could just focus there. In your brief, you're quite careful, and you have been today, to talk to even if the MSPB lacked this authority. It's your position that the MSPB does lack this authority in fact; right? It's not just the MSPB's position.",
  "Well, I don't like that.",
  "I mean, the idea of -- the special masters floating around freely every time you get one of these cases -- I mean, what -- inevitably what's going to happen is that you're going to have a more or less permanent special master who gets all these things. You're not going to appoint 85 special masters if there are 85 of these sorts of claims. It seems to me you've got an agency there that's expert in the interrelation between the different provisions in the statute. And, you know, why don't -- why don't -- they make factfindings all the time in areas within their authority to decide. It seems to me it's ready-made for sending these things back.",
  "What if -- I guess that the party doesn't -- doesn't even have to raise its constitutional claim before the MSPB, does it?",
  "I mean, it's pretty odd to say that you've somehow waived a claim you couldn't pursue.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Feigin. Mr. Schwartz, you have 2 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1491, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum. Mr. Hoffman.",
  "You began by -- by --",
  "If -- if there is no other country where this suit could have been brought, regardless of what American domestic law provides, isn't it a legitimate concern that allowing the suit itself contravenes international law?",
  "But it was motivated, I gather, by assaults on ambassadors here within the United States.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "But whether -- I'm sorry.",
  "But under international law, it is critically pertinent who's -- who's undertaking the conduct that is alleged to violate international norms. If an individual private group seizes a ship, it's piracy. If the navy does it, it's not. Governmental torture violates international norms. Private conduct does not. So, why doesn't the -- why isn't the same pertinence -- your argument seems to be that all you need to do is find an event, torture, piracy, whatever, and then it's up to the domestic law whether or not particular entities can be sued.",
  "As a statement of your position.",
  "But it doesn't work when you're talking about state -- whether it's a state conducting the illegal conduct or somebody else. So, why -- that's not up to the domestic --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Ms. Sullivan.",
  "You're getting ahead of yourself. We haven't --",
  "We haven't decided that question just yet.",
  "Please.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hoffman, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "I'm sorry. In every nation in the world, you can get redress for this sort of thing, but I thought you told us earlier that there was no place where this suit could be brought --",
  "In other words, a suit by an alien against another alien for conduct that takes place overseas.",
  "Well, that just gets back to your basic submission, which is you define the international norm based on the act rather than the entire issue that's going to be litigated, which includes both remedy and actor.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 11-88, Mohamad v. The Palestinian Authority. Mr. Fisher.",
  "We usually like --",
  "We usually like to begin with the language of the statute.",
  "Well, then go ahead.",
  "So, they did this to --",
  "They chose that word to avoid any residual ambiguity. But they thought there was no ambiguity at all as to whether the term \"individual\" meant natural persons or organizational entities?",
  "But you have the -- you have the additional problem, though, that your reading gives a different meaning to \"individual\" in two sentences that are right -- actually it's in the same sentence: an \"individual\" who does the torturing, subjects an \"individual\" to torture. Now, I understand your argument that you can Have an organization doing the -- the subject thing, but how do you subject an organization to torture?",
  "You don't.",
  "So, \"individual\" in the one clause you say means \"organization\"; \"individual\" in the other necessarily does not.",
  "But Congress -- as you've indicated, Congress focused on the very question of whether organizations would be covered or not in the context of whether a state would be covered. It seems to me that the legislative history cuts strongly against you, putting even aside Congressman Leach. The issue was there. And if they meant to say, well, let's find a term that leaves some types of organizations out, states, but not others, we'll just say \"individual,\" and people will understand, oh, we don't mean a state, but they'll also know but we do mean another type of organization, a corporation.",
  "So -- but it's at least ambiguous, and you're saying, well, we want a term that's going to include individual persons and organizations but not state organizations. And the only term that fits perfectly is \"individual.\"",
  "Really?",
  "But you've been saying all along \"individual\" has a secondary meaning.",
  "So, why would they have picked the secondary meaning of a word rather than try --",
  "Well, the TVPA is an extraordinary step in terms of exposing liability, and it doesn't seem to me to be an odd idea that Congress would want to proceed carefully before establishing a said seem to bear that out. That's -- that's what's pulling --",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ferguson.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Fisher ended by saying there's no reason Congress would draw this line. Why would they want to hold the individual controlling officers of an organization liable for torture, but not the organization itself?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Gannon. Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-161, Armour v. City of Indianapolis. Mr. Stancil.",
  "Counsel, some -­ some time ago, I thought you were just about to tell us how much money the city says will be at stake if you prevail.",
  "And the -- the city says that's the total amount that's at issue if you prevail, if the taxpayers prevail on this claim.",
  "Is there an easier thing to administer than the system that was struck down in Allegheny Pittsburgh?",
  "Whatever you paid, that's what your assessment was. And they argued, well, this is easy; that's enough. And this Court said, no, it's an equal protection violation.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stancil. Mr. Clement.",
  "Well, that's simply because, as we said in Allegheny Pittsburgh, the basis for considering the equal protection claim is the rights that you're given under State law. In Allegheny Pittsburgh, it says you have the right to be treated equally with respect to assessments. And you weren't. Here the law says you have the right to be treated equally, or whatever it is, the apportionment, and they weren't. All that you're saying there is that State law gets to set the base. And if the State law says we don't treat people the same in extending sewer hook-ups, then that takes away your Equal Protection Clause. But it just sets the base.",
  "The change in policy -­",
  "The change in policy is from treating people equally to treating people unequally. I don't see how the fact that they're changing that policy addresses the issue at all. They're going from a system where everybody was subject to the same assessment to a system where some pay something and other people pay 30 times that. Yes, it's a change, but it's the change that presents the problem.",
  "And the city retains that option in this case going forward. The problem with -­",
  "-- your analogy is you're dealing with a situation -- you're saying, well, here's a violation and the law can -- and what does the law do? But this -- this is exactly 180 degrees away. There's no violation, and the law creates the violation. In that situation -­",
  "-- I think you're dealing with an entirely different case.",
  "Well, I think I don't see the answer -­",
  "Excuse me. I don't see the answer to Justice Scalia's question. You're saying this would be a rational system going forward, but you also promised the people that they would be treated equally over a certain period. When you start out it's not equal because somebody pays $400 and somebody else pays 10,000, and -­ but over the 30-year period, it's the same. That's why it's equal in the beginning, even though somebody pays 400 and somebody pays 10,000 because they're going to pay the same over the period. Then you lop off the period. So, you're not treating them equally. Go -- when you started. You can no longer say don't worry about the inequality; it will sort out in 30 years. Now you can't -- you have no way of telling them why it's not unequal.",
  "Well, there is a provision -- you said I'd search in vain for this provision in the Barrett Law.",
  "Well, I went and searched and 15 -­",
  "-- 15(b)(3)says, \"The costs shall be primarily apportioned equally among all abutting lands or lots.\"",
  "It says \"costs.\"",
  "Where -- where do I look to find that when they say the costs shall be apportioned equally, they are not referring to the costs, but they were referring to the assessments?",
  "The costs of the project are funded by the -- the sewer hook-ups, and some people pay 400 and some people paY 10,000.",
  "You just said it's not popularity. In page 1 of your brief, you say, \"The Barrett Law method eventually proved to be politically unpopular.\" Sounds like it's popularity to me.",
  "But that -- if I could -- you mentioned Heckler v. Mathews. In Heckler v. Mathews, the Court said, quote: \"Ordinarily, extension\" -- of the withheld benefit -- \"rather than nullification is the proper course.\"",
  "So, while it is true that you can cure a violation by leveling up or leveling down, ordinarily, extension of the benefit is the proper course. And that's for the reason Justice Scalia gave, because, otherwise, there would be no equal protection case brought.",
  "Well, what -- what did the Court mean when they said, ordinarily, extension is the proper course?",
  "When you say \"the other case,\" you mean every other project? Because that's -- that's, what, a class action; right?",
  "Well, if everybody -- if everybody entitled to a refund came forward, it would cost you $2.7 million. And it -­",
  "Okay. Three -­ $3 million. And you say the real problem is the huge administrative cost in trying to figure out who you owe it to. If it's that huge, all they do is somebody who comes forward, asks for a refund, verify that they're -­ you know, were a homeowner on the project, give them the refund.",
  "The most it's going to cost is $3 million.",
  "Amnesty -- I don't get -- amnesty is entirely different. Amnesty is for people who did something wrong. Nobody did something wrong here; it wasn't wrong to pay with installments.",

  "Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. Mr. Neiman.",
  "Counsel, when you – it's a little confusing to me, but when you refer to \"minimum,\" I assume that was because of the statutes prior to Graham had death as one of the other options, that that is no longer an option. So, it's -- it's a little awkward to refer to it as minimum when it's also the maximum.",
  "When you have -- when an individual is prosecuted for an aggravated murder that carries this sentence, is it typical to also charge lesser included offenses?",
  "And -- and in general, what is the distinction between exposure to the -- the maximum crime and a lesser included crime? In other words, what is the difference between aggravated murder and manslaughter? It typically turns on the state of mind, doesn't it?",
  "So, is there any reason to think that juries in a case where they have the option for lesser included offenses might be concerned in light of the age of the defendant about whether or not the requisite intent was formed? It seems to me that some of the issues that we've suggested justify a different treatment of juveniles have to do with mental development, and those same issues would be taken into account by a jury in considering which of a list of offenses the juvenile should be convicted of.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Neiman. Mr. Stevenson, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "What if they -- what if they do? I mean, what if, after our decision or even after the argument, States go back and say, look, the decision is based on the fact that they don't think we know our law, that we haven't thought about it; so, let's have a hearing about it, and then we vote that, yes, there should be or, no, there should not be a minimum age; we think at 16 -- whatever age they do. Then does the constitutional rule change?",
  "Once we get 30 States saying, look, we've thought about it and this is our answer, then whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits it or not changes?",
  "Right. But one of the things we take into account is societal consensus, and you say we should ignore the 30 -- whatever it is -- States that allow this because they didn't really think about it.",
  "So, I'm postulating -­",
  "-- let's make -- let's see if they have thought about it.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stevenson, Mr. Neiman. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 10-9647, Jackson v. Hobbs. Welcome back.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Holt.",
  "Do we know how old Laurie Troup was when she was shot?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stevenson, you have 8 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stevenson, Mr. Holt. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-199, Vasquez v. United States. Mr. Brindley.",
  "Could I --",
  "-- stop you there? I -- where in the Government's brief do you see the statement that the analysis should not look to the error, should not include the error?",
  "Where -- where --",
  "Where exactly is that in their brief? That the -- the question is whether a jury would convict him without considering the error. Because I look at the Government's brief, and they have fairly extensive analysis of -- of the error, why they think it's not important, why they -- you know. But I don't see them saying you don't look at the error at all.",
  "Yes, exactly. In other words, you look at the prejudicial effect of the erroneously admitted evidence and see if that altered the outcome.",
  "They say -- immediately after the sentence you gave us, they say \"looking at the evidence as a whole.\"",
  "Thank you, Mr. Brindley. Mr. Yang.",
  "You're going over the evidence. And I may simply be asking the same question Justice Kennedy asked earlier. But let's say you have a situation where it's the same thing, and at the -- you, know, and the improperly admitted evidence has the defendant saying: I'm guilty, I'm guilty. And the evidence is the same as all you've set forth at pages 2 through 9, very complicated, who's driving what, you know, kind of car where, and where they're meeting. And the jury goes out and comes back in 2 minutes: You know, the guy said he was guilty. Is that a situation in which we're supposed to then go back, look at all the complicated evidence, and see if a jury would have convicted? Or can we with a fair degree of confidence say that the error is what led the jury to convict?",
  "Counsel, when you began, if I'm remembering correctly, you said there were two ways in which your position was different from Mr. Brindley's.",
  "One I understand is that you look at a rational jury --",
  "-- and not the particular jury. What's the second?",
  "Briefly.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Brindley, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 11-262, Reichle v. Howards. Mr. Gallagher.",
  "I don't understand --",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "I assume you would include U.S. marshals?",
  "F.B.I. agents? So, you're talking about protective details.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lane.",
  "Well, what you've described is not when the person was arrested, right?",
  "The person was arrested later, when approached by the Secret Service agent, lied about whether he touched the Vice President; at that time, in a non-protected area, was carrying a bag, right?",
  "And wandering around. Turns out that he was looking for his son. But if you're the Secret Service agent, you see somebody who said your policies are disgusting, that person touches the Vice President, he -- he lies to you. He comes back, he's carrying a bag and he's wondering -- wandering around, do you think it's reasonable at that -- well, I guess you don't --",
  "To arrest the person?",
  "The reason it's multifaceted is because I'm trying to capture what might have been going through the Secret Service agent's mind at the time.",
  "Well, what would be going in a reasonable Secret Service's agent's mind at the time.",
  "So, what you have, under your theory, a person should put on his car a bumper sticker that says \"I hate the police\" and then every time they're pulled over, they will have -- certainly a plausible case is you violated my First Amendment rights. It's not because I was going 60 miles an hour; it's because of my bumper sticker.",
  "And the police officer -- at that point, he says, you know, I can't give a ticket to this guy without being hauled into court on personal liability because he's got a credible case that it was for First Amendment grounds.",
  "No, no. You've already got the officer in court. I mean, you get a speeding ticket, and most times they don't show up because they have got other things to do. Now he's got to show up in district court, in State court, to defend against this.",
  "Right. Well, this --",
  "Is that -- is that a case that you could state?",
  "He pulled me over, he gave me a speeding ticket, but the only reason he picked me out is because I had a bumper sticker saying \"I hate the police.\"",
  "Does that go to trial?",
  "Why doesn't it go to trial? And -- well, does it go -- I mean, do you get depose the police officer? You know, why did you stop him? Did you stop anybody else for going 65 miles an hour that day?",
  "So, the only way you can find out is you put in the evidence -- here's the bumper sticker -- and you put the police officer on the stand --",
  "-- and you say, why did you do it?",
  "And then all of a sudden -- I don't know why everybody doesn't have a bumper sticker.",
  "But they didn't arrest him -- they didn't arrest until after he lied, right?",
  "Well, summary judgment, that's -- you've already been in court for a long time when you're talking about summary judgment.",
  "Well, there is an easy way out of it. We could agree with the --",
  "One thing about your analysis that concerns me is that you seem to have a very black-and-white view of what's going on in the officer's mind: Did you stop -- did you arrest him because of retaliation or was it because of legitimate security? And I suspect that the people engaged in this type of thing have intuition. I mean, they don't sit there and say, well, let's see; is it because he says he didn't like the war in Iraq, or is because he's wandering around, looks like he's looking for something, with a -- with a bag? I mean, I assume they sort have experience and they calculate all this in and say I've got to do something. And how do you parse those different motivations?",
  "One reason that I, in fact, don't like the answer is because what the agent is now going to have to factor -- in addition to the hostility of the views, the touching of the Vice President, the lying about it, the wandering around with the bag -- is in the back of his mind, you know, if I'm wrong, I may be held personally liable in damages for taking some action that some jury somewhere is going to say was based on retaliation rather than my obligation to protect the Vice President.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument this morning in Case Number 11-398, Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida. Mr. Long.",
  "But they would apply even if the rule is not jurisdictional. The only difference would be that the court could enforce it or not enforce it in particular cases, which brings me to the Davis case, which I think is your biggest hurdle. It's a case quite similar to this in which the constitutionality of the Social Security Act was at issue, and the government waived its right to insist upon the application of this Act. Of course, if it's jurisdictional, you can't waive it. So, are you asking us to overrule the Davis case?",
  "Well, it seems - - you can't separate those two points. The idea that Congress has acquiesced in what we have said only helps you if what we have said is fairly consistent. And you, yourself, point out in the brief that we've kind of gone back and forth on whether this is a jurisdictional provision or not. So, even if Congress acquiesced in it, I'm not sure what they acquiesced in.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Long. General Verrilli.",
  "Justice Ginsburg.",
  "It was -- it was the calculation of the interests of the United States that your predecessor made in the Davis case. There, the Solicitor General exercised authority that we sanctioned to waive the Anti-Injunction Act. And, of course, that couldn't be done if it were jurisdictional.",
  "It makes it easy for the government to drop the other shoe in the future, right? You've been under the law subject to this mandate all along. You've been exempt from the penalty. So, all they have to do is take away the penalty.",
  "Well, except you - -",
  "You agree with Mr. Long, isn't -- I mean, I thought you just agreed with Justice Breyer that one of the purposes of the provision is to raise revenue.",
  "Thank you, General.",
  "Mr. Katsas.",
  "The whole point - - the whole point of the suit is to prevent the collection of penalties.",
  "Well, prevent the collection of taxes. But the idea that the mandate is something separate from whether you want to call it a penalty or tax just doesn't seem to make much sense.",
  "It's a command. A mandate is a command.",
  "Now, if there's nothing behind the command -- it's sort of, well, what happens if you don't follow the mandate, and the answer is nothing -- it seems very artificial to separate the punishment from the crime.",
  "Well, why would you have a requirement that is completely toothless? Pay - - you know, buy insurance or else. Or else what? Or else nothing.",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Katsas.",
  "Mr. Long, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Mr. Long, you were invited by this Court to defend the proposition that the Anti-Injunction Act barred this litigation. You have ably carried out that responsibility, for which the Court is grateful.",
  "We will continue argument in this case tomorrow.",
  "We will continue argument this morning in Case 11-398, The Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida. General Verrilli.",
  "Well, the same, it seems to me, would be true, say, for the market in emergency services: police, fire, ambulance, roadside assistance, whatever. You don't know when you're going to need it; you're not sure that you will. But the same is true for health care. You don't know if you're going to need a heart transplant or if you ever will. So, there's a market there. In some extent, we all participate in it. So, can the government require you to buy a cell phone because that would facilitate responding when you need emergency services? You can just dial 911 no matter where you are?",
  "It seems to me that's the same as in my hypothetical. You don't know when you're going to need police assistance. You can't predict the extent to emergency response that you'll need, but when you do -- and the government provides it. I thought that was an important part of your argument, that when you need health care, the government will make sure you get it. Well, when you need police assistance or fire assistance or ambulance assistance, the government is going to make sure to the best extent it can that you get it.",
  "That, it seems to me, is -- and it's a passage in your reply brief that I didn't quite grasp. It's the same point. You say, \"Health insurance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or broccoli; it is a means of financing health-care consumption and covering universal risks.\" Well, a car or broccoli aren't purchased for their own sake, either. They're purchased for the sake of transportation or, in broccoli, covering the need for food.",
  "I don't understand that distinction.",
  "Well, now that's a significant -- I'm sorry.",
  "It's the means of satisfying a basic human need --",
  "-- just as your insurance is the means of satisfying --",
  "The key -­",
  "The key in Lochner is that we were talking about regulation of the States, right, and the States are not limited to enumerated powers. The Federal Government is. And it seems to me it's an entirely different question when you ask yourself whether or not there are going to be limits on the Federal power, as opposed to limits on the States, which was the issue in Lochner.",
  "Well, but it's critical how you define the market. If I understand the law, the policies that you're requiring people to purchase involve -- must contain provision for maternity and newborn care, pediatric services, and substance use treatment. It seems to me that you cannot say that everybody is going to need substance use treatment -- substance use treatment or pediatric services; and yet, that is part of what you require them to purchase.",
  "Yes, but your theory is that there is a market in which everyone participates because everybody might need a certain range of health care services. And yet, the -- you're requiring people who are not -- never going to need pediatric or maternity services to participate in that market.",
  "I think you're posing the question I was posing, which is that doesn't apply to a lot of what you're requiring people to purchase. Pediatric services, maternity services. You cannot say that everybody is going to participate in the substance use treatment market. And yet, you require people to purchase insurance coverage for that.",
  "Is your argument limited to insurance or means of paying for health care?",
  "Well, now, why is that? Congress could -- once you -- once you establish that you have a market for health care, I would suppose Congress's power under the Commerce Clause meant they had a broad scope in terms of how they regulate that market. And it would be -- it would be going back to Lochner if we were put in a position of saying, no, you can use your commerce power to regulate insurance, but you can't use your commerce power to regulate this market in other ways. I think that would be a very significant intrusion by the Court into Congress's power. So, I don't see how we can accept your -- it's good for you in this case to say, oh, it's just insurance. But once we say that there is a market and Congress can require people to participate in it, as some would say, or as you would say, that people are already participating in it, it seems to me that we can't say there are limitations on what Congress can do under its commerce power. Just like in any other area -- given significant deference that we accord to Congress in this area, all bets are off, and you could regulate that market in any rational way.",
  "Exactly. You're worried --",
  "That's the area that Congress has chosen to regulate. There's this health care market. Everybody's in it. So, we can regulate it, and we're going to look at a particular serious problem, which is how people pay for it. But next year, they can decide everybody's in this market; we're going to look at a different problem now, and this is how we're going to regulate it. And we can compel people to do things -- purchase insurance, in this case; something else in the next case -- because you've -- we've accepted the argument that this is a market in which everybody participates.",
  "Right. Right. That's exactly right, but it doesn't seem responsive to my concern that there's no reason -- once we say this is within Congress's commerce power, there's no reason other than our own arbitrary judgment to say all they can regulate is the method of payment. They can regulate other things that affect this now-conceded interstate market in health care in which everybody participates.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. No, I think you're just --",
  "Unless I'm missing something, I think you're just repeating the idea that this is the regulation of the method of payment. And I understand that argument. And it may be --",
  "It may be a good one. But what I'm concerned about is, once we accept the principle that everybody is in this market, I don't see why Congress's power is limited to regulating the method of payment and doesn't include as it does in any other area. What other area have we said Congress can regulate this market but only with respect to prices, but only with respect to means of travel? No. Once you're -- once you're in the interstate commerce and can regulate it, pretty much all bets are off.",
  "Well, why didn't Congress call it a tax, then?",
  "You're telling me they thought of it as a tax, they defended it on the tax power. Why didn't they say it was a tax?",
  "Well, that's the reason. They thought it might be more effective if they called it a penalty.",
  "Thank you, General. We'll take a pause for a minute or so, Mr. Clement. (Pause.)",
  "All right. Why don't we get started -- again. Mr. Clement.",
  "Well, Mr. Clement, the key to the Government's argument to the contrary is that everybody is in this market. It's all right to regulate Wickard -- in Wickard v. Filburn, because that's a particular market in which the farmer had been participating. Everybody is in this market. So, that makes it very different than the market for cars or the other hypotheticals that you came up with, and all they're regulating is how you pay for it.",
  "And now maybe return to Justice Sotomayor's question.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Carvin.",
  "Well, surely --",
  "Well, surely, regulation includes the power to promote. Since the New Deal, we've said there's regulation in -- there's a market in agricultural products, and Congress has the power to subsidize, to limit production, all sorts of things.",
  "I don't -- I don't think you're addressing their main point, which is that they're not creating commerce in -- in health care. It's already there, and we're all going to need some kind of health care; most of us will at some point.",
  "Yet, we don't know who they are.",
  "No, no, that's not -- I don't think that's fair, because not everybody is going to enter the mortgage market. The Government's position is that almost everybody is going to enter the health care market.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Carvin. General Verrilli, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, General. Counsel, we'll see you tomorrow.",
  "We will continue argument this morning in Case Number 11-393, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, and Case 11-400, Florida v. The Department of HHS. Mr. Clement.",
  "Well, but it would have -- it would have passed parts of the hollow shell. I mean, a lot of this is reauthorization of appropriations that have been reauthorized for the previous 5 or 10 years, and it was just more convenient for Congress to throw it in, in the middle of the 2700 pages than to do it separately. I mean, can you really suggest -- I mean, they cite the Black Lung Benefits Act, and those have nothing to do with any of the things we're talking about.",
  "I don't understand - -",
  "Well, but that doesn't - -",
  "Finish your certain point.",
  "But the reality - -",
  "The reality of the passage -- I mean, this was a piece of legislation which, there was -- had to be a concerted effort to gather enough votes so that it could be passed. And I suspect with a lot of these miscellaneous provisions that Justice Breyer was talking about, that was the price of a vote: Put in the Indian health care provision and I will vote for the other 2700 pages. Put in the black lung provision, and I'll go along with it. That's why all -- many of these provisions, I think, were put in, not because they were unobjectionable. So, presumably, what Congress would have done is they wouldn't have been able to put together, cobble together the votes to get it through.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "How does your proposal actually work? Your idea is that, well, they can take care of it themselves later. I mean, do you contemplate them bringing litigation and saying -- I guess the insurers would be the most obvious ones - - without -- without the mandate, the whole thing falls apart, and we're going to bear a greater cost, and so the rest of the law should be struck down. And that's a whole other line of litigation?",
  "But what cause of action is it? I've never heard of a severability cause of action.",
  "Before you go, Mr. Kneedler, I'd like your answer to Justice Breyer's question. I think you were interrupted - -",
  "-- before you had a chance - -",
  "Justice Kennedy.",
  "Well, how is that - - what's exactly right? It's a question of statutory interpretation. That means you have to go through every line of the statute. I haven't heard your answer to Justice Scalia's question yet.",
  "How do you know that? Where is this line? I looked through the whole Act. I didn't read -- well - -",
  "Where is the sharp line?",
  "No, no. That - -",
  "That makes your case that the one provision should fall if the other does. It doesn't tell us anything about all the other provisions.",
  "Well - -",
  "But what if there isn't Medicaid expansion? We've talked about the individual mandate, but does the Government have a position on what should happen if the Medicaid expansion is struck down?",
  "So, it -- the Government's position is that if Medicaid expansion is struck down, the rest of the Act can operate - -",
  "-- without it.",
  "All of that was based on the assumption that the mandate was constitutional. And if -- that certainly doesn't stop us from reaching our own determination on that.",
  "Well, that's right. But the problem is, straight from the title, we have two complementary purposes, patient protection and affordable care. And you can't look at something and say this promotes affordable care; therefore, it's consistent with Congress's intent. Because Congress had a balanced intent. You can't look at another provision and say this promotes patient protection without asking if it's affordable. So, it seems to me if you ask what is going to promote Congress's purpose, that's just an inquiry that you can't carry out.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Farr.",
  "You -- you're referring to the Government's second position. Their first, of course, is that we shouldn't address this issue at all.",
  "I asked Mr. Kneedler about what procedure or process would be anticipated for people who are affected by the change in -- in the law and the change in the economic consequences. Do you have a view on how that could be played out? It does seem to me that if we accept your position, something - - there have to -- there has to be a broad range of consequences, whether it's additional legislation, additional litigation. Any thoughts on how that's going to play out?",
  "But if the challenge is what we're questioning today, whether -- if you're an insurance company and you don't believe that you can give the coverage in the way Congress mandated it without the individual mandate, what -- what type of action do you bring in court?",
  "Certainly.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Farr. Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Farr, you were invited by this Court to brief and argue in these cases in support of the decision below on severability. You have ably carried out that responsibility, for which we are grateful. Case No. 11-393 is submitted. We will continue argument in Case Number 11-400 this afternoon.",
  "We will continue argument this afternoon in Case 11-400, Florida v. The Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Clement.",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not sure my colleagues have exhausted their questions. So --",
  "He doesn't always check first.",
  "No, let's leave the wife out of it.",
  "That's enough frivolity for a while. But I want to make sure I understand where the meaningfulness of the choice is taken away. Is it the amount that's being offered, that it's just so much money, of course you can't turn it down, or is it the amount that's going to be taken away if you don't take what they're offering?",
  "Well, why isn't that a consequence of how willing they have been since the New Deal to take the Federal Government's money? And it seems to me that they have compromised their status as independent sovereigns because they are so dependent on what the Federal Government has done, they should not be surprised that the Federal Government, having attached the -- they tied the strings, they shouldn't be surprised if the Federal Government isn't going to start pulling them.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement. General Verrilli.",
  "But none of those have addressed the coercion question.",
  "So, do you think it would be all right for the Federal Government to say, same program: States, you can take this or you can leave it, but if you don't take it, you lose every last dollar of Federal funding for every program?",
  "But there's no coercion question at all?",
  "No, I know we don't have that here. How does germaneness get -- get to coercion?",
  "That's germaneness; there's no --",
  "So, it fails because it's not germane. But you're saying it would not fail because it was coercive?",
  "No, no. I know it's -- I know it's different here. I'm just trying to understand if you accept the fact or regard it as true that there is a coercion limit, or that once the Federal Government -- once you're taking Federal Government money, the Federal Government money -- can take it back, and that doesn't affect the voluntariness of your choice? Because it does seem like a serious problem. We're assuming, under the Spending Clause the Federal Government cannot do this. Under the Constitution it cannot do this. But if it gets the State to agree to it, well then it can. And the concern is, if you can say, if you don't agree to this you lose all your money, whether that's really saying the -- the limitation in the Constitution is -- is largely meaningless.",
  "No, no, I know. I'm just -- I know this -- I don't know if I'll grant it to you or not, but let's assume it's not this case. Do you recognize any limitation on that concern?",
  "Could you give me some assurance? We heard the question about whether or not the Secretary would use this authority to the extent available. Are there circumstances where you are willing to say that that would not be permissible? I'm thinking of the Arizona letter, for example. I mean, if I had the authority and I was in that position, I would use it all the time. You might -- you want some little change made? Well, guess what, I can take away all your money if you don't make it. I win. Every time, it seems that that would be the case. So, why shouldn't we be concerned about the extent of authority that the government is exercising simply because they could do something less? We have to analyze the case on the assumption that that power will be exercised, don't we?",
  "No, I appreciate that. I appreciate that, but I guess --",
  "What about the Arizona letter we just heard about today?",
  "It's been used to threaten --",
  "Of course, no State is going say, okay, go ahead, make my day, take it away. They're going to -- they're going to give in.",
  "Well, but that's just saying that when, you know, the analogy that has been used, the gun to your head, \"your money or your life,\" you say, well, there's no evidence that anyone has ever been shot.",
  "Well, it's because you have to give up your wallet. You don't have a choice.",
  "And you cannot -- you cannot represent that the Secretary has never said: And if you don't do it, we're going to take away all the funds. They cite the Arizona example. I suspect there are others, because that is the leverage.",
  "I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it.",
  "Wait a second. It's not -- it's not coercion -- well, I guess that's what the case is. It's not coercion --",
  "-- to say I'm going to take away all your funds, no matter how minor the infringement?",
  "No, what the --",
  "I’m sorry. Go ahead.",
  "Yes, but the question is not -- obviously, the States are interested in the same objective, and they have a disagreement, or they have budget realities that they have to deal with. And States say, well, we're going to cut by 10 percent what we reimburse this for or that for, and the Federal Government says, well, you can't. And no one is suggesting that people want to cut health care, but they have different views about how to implement policy in this area. And the concern is that the Secretary has the total and complete say because the Secretary has the authority under this provision to say you lose everything. No one has suggested in the normal course that will happen, but so long as the Federal Government has that power, it seems to be a significant intrusion on the sovereign interests of the State. Now, I'm not -- it may be something they gave up many decades ago when they decided to live off Federal funds, but I don't think you can deny that it's a significant authority that we're giving the Federal Government to say you can take away everything if the States don't buy into the next program.",
  "If it's such a good deal --",
  "-- why do you care? If it's such a good deal, why do you need the club?",
  "It's a good deal, take it. We're not going to -- if you don't take it, you're just hurting yourself.",
  "We're not going to --",
  "You have another 15 minutes — at least.",
  "Well, what --",
  "Obviously, the Federal Government isn't bound to that. And what if, after the 90 percent, they say, well, now -- from now on, for the States -- we're going to pay 70 percent? What happens then? Where does that extra money come from?",
  "There's no -- they can just bail out as soon -- whenever the government reduces the amount of the percentage --",
  "-- that it's willing to pay, the States can say that's -- that's --",
  "Oh.",
  "Well, the Secretary has the discretion. We're talking about something else. We're talking about fiscal realities and whether or not the Federal Government is going to say we need to lower our contribution to Medicaid and leave it up to the States because we want the people to be mad at the States when they have to have all these budget cuts to keep it up, and not at the Federal Government.",
  "I know, but you've been emphasizing that the Federal Government is going to pay 90 percent of this, 90 percent of this. And it's not something you can take to the bank, because the next day or the next fiscal year, they can decide we're going to pay a lot less, and you, States, are still on the hook, because you don't -- you say it's not an easy choice. We can say -- ask whether it's coercion. You're not going to be able to bail out of Medicaid. You just have to pay more because we're going to pay less.",
  "You mentioned the -- the Dole case. Now, what was the threat in that case, raise your drinking age to 21 or what?",
  "Do you remember the percentage?",
  "Yes. It's a pretty small amount. That's really apples and oranges when you're talking about lose all of your Medicaid funds or lose -- I thought it was 5, but 7 -- 7 percent of your highway funds.",
  "What was the threat in the stimulus bill? What would the State lose?",
  "Would anything be taken away, or would it just lose the opportunity to get the money?",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Clement, you have 5 minutes.",

  "Do you -- I'm sorry to interrupt your answer, but does your office review the amicus filings in the courts of appeals by the agencies?",
  "Is that the normal procedure?",
  "Well, but you -- you didn't even know about that.",
  "And yet, you expect the industry to know all about it; and yet, it escaped your attention.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Clement.",
  "And they don't make sales.",
  "Your long list sort of stopped one step short. They don't make sales.",
  "Is there -- let's say the doctor hears the spiel and the doctor says, okay, yours is the first thing I'll think of, you know, when I have a patient with this and this. I mean, is that a sale?",
  "So, what if the doctor, as I suspect a lot of doctors do, they listen to this guy, and they say, okay, I'll think of -- you know, when it comes up, I'll think of your product; and the next guy comes in from the other company, and he says, okay, when it comes up I'll think of your product -- are those two sales or no sale?",
  "But that's a firmer commitment when they say I'll buy it. The physician is just saying I'll think of your product when it -- when the need comes up.",
  "Certainly.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-5683, Dorsey v. United States, and 11-5721, Hill v. United States. Mr. Eberhardt.",
  "Of course, the statute itself says \"express,\" right? Talking about section 109.",
  "So, we're pretty far removed from the language of the statute, I guess.",
  "Oh, and I understand that. But presumably -- we also have the proposition that Congress, when it enacts legislation, knows the law. They would have known section 109 required an express statement if they wanted to apply the change retroactively. So, why shouldn't we hold them to that standard?",
  "Justice Scalia.",
  "Are we just supposed to assume that Congress knows that? I mean, if you had asked me how long is the usual time from conviction or -- I mean, arrest to conviction, I wouldn't know if it's closer to 90 days or 11 months.",
  "Well, right. But I mean -- and we assume Congress knows the law. I don't know that we can readily assume they know details such as that and evaluate their -- what would your position be if the Congress said do this as soon as practical but, in any event, no later than 8 months from now? Would we then think there's a fair implication that Congress meant it to apply retroactively or not?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Dreeben.",
  "So, why -- why 90 days? I mean, the Commission basically just took the ratio under the new Act and applied it, didn't they, throughout? They took the mandatory minimum formula that had been changed and changed it throughout the -­ the sentencing provisions?",
  "Certainly.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Estrada.",
  "Go ahead, Justice Sotomayor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Estrada.",
  "Mr. Eberhardt, you have 3 minutes.",
  "All those arguments have nothing to do with the provision about the Sentencing Commission is supposed to act quickly or any of that, right? Your argument is what rational reason could Congress have had to -- given the urgency of the problem, the seriousness, why wouldn't they have wanted the provisions to apply as you urged they should?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Eberhardt. Mr. Estrada, at the invitation of the Court, you have briefed and argued this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below. You've ably discharged that responsibility, for which the Court is grateful. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-551, Salazar, Secretary of the Interior v. Ramah Navajo Chapter. Mr. Freeman.",
  "So the consequence on the ground is that, if I'm a tribe and I want this money, and I figure out that this is going to cost me",
  "-- I sign a contract and say, this is going to cost me $100,000, because I know there isn't going to be $100,000. There's only going to be $80,000, and that's what I need, right?",
  "No, but it's -- well, if 80,000 is reasonable, the only way to get that is to ask for 100?",
  "It makes sense if you're looking at the reality of the budgeting process because in one case, that line item appears on the Department of Interior budget; and in the other case, it appears somewhere else in the Judgment Fund budget. And they can say it's not our fault. The Judgment Fund -- the Court made us do it --",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips.",
  "What page, for those of us who don't have it in front of us?",
  "Thank you.",
  "I think -- I think this may have been asked, and I'm not sure of the -- I understood the answer. This is -- is this on an ongoing, forward-looking basis? In other words, you enter into the contracts, and then you wait and see whether there are appropriations?",
  "Well, so doesn't it make -- I mean, doesn't the system that the government is operating under make a lot of sense? Because let's say the tribe says, look, we need a million dollars. The Secretary agrees to it. And then I assume the two of them get together and say, well, we'll try to get the appropriation for it. You know, you understand we may not get it, but this is how much you need, we'll go back and get it. If you get it, that's great. If you don't, well, then that's --",
  "Are you suggesting that --",
  "Are you suggesting that Congress has to go through each of those contracts and say, this is how much we're going to appropriate, this is how much -­",
  "Well, the question is whether it's the staff in Congress that's going to do it or the staff at the Department of the Interior?",
  "And I suppose Congress can reasonably determine that the people at Interior know better about how to do it than we do.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Freeman, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "I'm sorry. I didn't think that was responsive. Does the Secretary -- Justice Kagan can defend her own question -- but does the Secretary have the discretion to adopt something other than a pro rata distribution when there are not sufficient appropriations?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-166, RadLAX Gateway Hotel v. Amalgamated Bank. Mr. Neff.",
  "Well, isn't that -- isn't that pretty much what he bargained for when he insisted upon security before giving the loan?",
  "Well, you're depriving the secured creditor of the opportunity to hold on to the asset because he thinks it is, for perhaps a short period, unreasonably devalued. Right?",
  "Did -- did I cut off your answer to Justice Alito?",
  "Well -- Well, this is a case, though, where you would not want the asset sold. In other words, looking at it, he thinks, for particular, unusual situations, this is vastly undervalued; I am holding an asset that is going to appreciate if I hold onto it. So he doesn't want the asset sold.",
  "And what -- what is the doubtless equivalent of his claim? Measured by the current market conditions? Or does that include some premium, based on the assumption that it's going to increase in value over some period?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Maynard?",
  "Or -- or he is entitled to realize the indubitable equivalent of his claims. You really do just kind of elide the fact that the statute says, \"or.\"",
  "Your -- your friend on the other side suggests that (ii) and (iii) address different ways of protecting the secured creditor. (ii) is procedural, right? You can go through these procedures, and you can cram down, so long as you are going through these procedures, which include credit bidding. Or you can cram down if you ensure that he receives the indubitable equivalent, a substantive protection. What is wrong with that reading?",
  "Well, but there is, of course, a good reason, which is consistent with the policy of the Bankruptcy Code, which is you do want to look out for the other creditors as well. And if the secured creditor is getting, indubitably, the value of this security, why don't you weigh in the balance at least the interests of -- of the other creditors?",
  "Well, maybe in this particular case, but that's not going to be true in every case, and we are asked to issue a ruling that is going to apply in every case.",
  "Well, I know, but the whole premise of why this problem arises is that the security is worth a lot less than -- than it was, obviously, when it was -- was purchased. Or a lot less than -- a lot less than the claim that it was meant to secure.",
  "How does it -- how does it work in practice? Is this something that is subject of extensive negotiation? The secured creditor says, well, I'm interested in bidding in a credit bid, but I appreciate that that's going to make it difficult for you to get cash. And you've got these unsecured creditors who would want -- and so, what? I'm not going to credit bid, so long as -- or I will only credit bid up to this particular amount; or let's sit down and work out a deal, negotiate over exactly how we're going to handle my security. Is -- is that really how it happens? Or is that not -- or not.",
  "You said, earlier, we have never said that the specific has to be a subset of the general. How do -- how would it otherwise be specific and the one general? It seems, if they are not a subset, then they are alternatives. I don't see how the whole doctrine makes any sense, if the specific is not a subset of the general.",
  "So when we say, our doctrine says the specific controls over the general, the specific is a subset of the general?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Ms. Harrington?",
  "You have got a whole cadre of U.S. trustees that, presumably, can look out for the interests of the poor United States.",
  "I thought we were worried about the situation where it's a creditor.",
  "In those cases, of course, the trustee's there, right?",
  "Well, but, of course, it could bid up if it thinks that there are going to be other bidders, right? It has a lot more flexibility than the other bidders to -- to the extent of its security interest.",
  "That just begs the question, Congress gave them a right -- I mean, that's what we are deciding, right?",
  "Of course, valuing property is what bankruptcy judges do all the time, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Neff, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "If -- please.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-246, Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak. Mr. Miller.",
  "Just to interrupt, in other words, it's not to the title.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Well, they didn't here. I mean, when Patchak filed his suit, title had not yet passed to the Secretary. And he sought a stay.",
  "But nothing -- at that point, you thought nothing prevented the Secretary from moving forward, and in fact, the Secretary did move forward even though he'd already filed the suit.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett.",
  "Could I say, just for a moment, let's suppose the tribe -- the -- Mr. Patchak brings a nuisance action against the tribe for running a casino and imposing all these difficulties on the surrounding previously rural community. He says this is a nuisance. And the tribe answers and says: No, we can do this under the Indian Gaming Regulation Act. And Patchak then says: Well, no, because you don't have valid authority under that Act because the Secretary shouldn't have taken the land into title. Now, that is not a quiet title action. That is a nuisance action. Can he have that adjudicated in that suit?",
  "Right, right.",
  "Right. But there'd be no - -",
  "-- question of his ability to sue and put that question at issue.",
  "Well, but that's a question that's not before us.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Nelson.",
  "The Solicitor General in footnote 1 of his reply brief says that's the general rule, which I take it there might be exceptions to it.",
  "But I'm sure he'll tell us what those are.",
  "And the proposition would be simply that the government can't go in and -- and moot out a suit that was -- by its unilateral action, right?",
  "I mean, they seem to recognize that it would be a bad thing, since it's only by their grace, they've told us, that they don't do it right away anyway. They give people 30 days.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Miller, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "What specific -- do other consequences other than the ability of the Secretary to take land in trust flow from whether or not a tribe is recognized in 1934?",
  "Mr. Miller, I mentioned earlier your footnote 1 in your reply brief about whether the time of filing question for sovereign immunity purposes is limited to diversity cases. Are there -- you cite one case. Are there others going the other way?",
  "What - -",
  "So this suit would come out the other way if the person objecting was just over the border in -- in Indiana, instead of in Michigan? Because there would be -- it could be brought as a diversity suit.",
  "I'm assuming - -",
  "Even if it were a suit against the tribe, it would still be not a diversity action but a Federal cause of action?",
  "Okay. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-182, Arizona v. The United States. Mr. Clement.",
  "Counsel, maybe it's a good time to talk about some of the other sections, in particular Section 5(C). Now, that does seem to expand beyond the Federal government's determination about the types of sanctions that should govern the employment relationship. You talk about supply and demand. The Federal government, of course, prohibits the employment, but it also imposes sanctions with respect to application for work. And the state of Arizona, in this case, is imposing some significantly greater sanctions.",
  "We'll give you plenty of rebuttal time, but I'd like to hear what you have to say about Section 3 before you sit down.",
  "Justice Alito.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement. General Verrilli.",
  "Before you get into what the case is about, I'd like to clear up at the outset what it's not about. No part of your argument has to do with racial or ethnic profiling, does it? I saw none of that in your brief.",
  "Okay. So this is not a case about ethnic profiling.",
  "That's a question of enforcement priorities. Well, let's say that the government had a different set of enforcement priorities, and their objective was to protect, to the maximum extent possible, the borders. And so anyone who is here illegally, they want to know about, and they want to do something about, in other words, different than the current policy. Does that mean, in that situation, the Arizona law would not be preempted?",
  "Well, but you say that the Federal government has to have control over who to prosecute, but I don't see how Section 2(B) says anything about that at all. All it does is notify the Federal government, here's someone who is here illegally, here's someone who is removable. The discretion to prosecute for Federal immigration offenses rests entirely with the Attorney General.",
  "Right. So, apart from Section 3 and Section 5, take those off the table, you have no objection to Section 2?",
  "Exactly. You -- the Federal government has to decide where it's going to use its resources. And what the state is saying, here are people who are here in violation of Federal law, you make the decision. And if your decision is you don't want to prosecute those people, fine, that's entirely up to you. That's why I don't see the problem with Section 2(B).",
  "Only under Section 3 and Section 5.",
  "Let's say you're worried about - -",
  "Right. Right. For the notification, what could possibly be wrong, if Arizona arrests someone, let's say for drunk driving, and their policy is you're going to stay in jail overnight, no matter what, okay? What's wrong, during that period, by having the Arizona arresting officer say, I'm going to call the Federal agency and find out if this person is here illegally because the Federal law says the Federal agency has to answer my question. It seems an odd argument to say the Federal agency has to answer the state's question, but the state can't ask it.",
  "You think there are individual cases in which the state can call the Federal government and say, is this person here illegally?",
  "Okay. So doesn't that defeat the facial challenge to the Act?",
  "It is - -",
  "It is not an effort to enforce Federal law. It is an effort to let you know about violations of Federal law. Whether or not to enforce them is still entirely up to you. If you don't want to do this, you just tell the person at LESC -- if that's the right -- is that the right acronym?",
  "-- LESC, look, when somebody from Arizona calls, answer their question, and don't even bother to write it down. Okay? I stopped somebody else, is he legal or illegal, let me check - - it's -- oh, he's illegal. Okay. Thanks. Good-bye. I mean, why -- it is still your decision. And, if you don't want to know who is in this country illegally, you don't have to.",
  "Under 2(B), the person is already stopped for some other reason. He's stopped for going 60 in a 20. He's stopped for drunk driving. So that decision to stop the individual has nothing to do with immigration law at all. All that has to do with immigration law is the -- whether or not they can ask the Federal government to find out if this person is illegal or not and then leave it up to you. It seems to me that the Federal government just doesn't want to know who is here illegally or not.",
  "What if -- what if they just rolled in Whiting?",
  "That's a pretty good one.",
  "General, you have been trying valiantly to get us to focus on Section 3, so maybe we should let you do that now.",
  "No, keep going.",
  "I had a little - - wasn't sure about your answer to Justice Kennedy. Is the reason that the government is not focused on people who are here illegally, as opposed to the other categories you were talking about, because of prioritization or because of lack of resources? You suggested that if the -- every illegal alien that you identify is either removed or prosecuted, that that would cause tensions with other governments. So I -- I don't understand if it's because you don't have enough resources or because you don't want to prosecute the people who are simply here illegally, as opposed to something else.",
  "And your concern is the problems that would arise in bilateral relations if you remove all of these people -- or a significant percentage or a greater percentage than you are now. Nothing in the law requires you to do that. All it does is lets you know where -- that an illegal alien has been arrested, and you can decide, we are not going to initiate removal proceedings against that individual. It doesn't require you to remove one more person than you would like to remove under your priorities.",
  "And that -- and that arises under 3 and 5?",
  "But not 2?",
  "Section 5.",
  "Thank you, General.",
  "Mr. Clement, 5 minutes.",
  "Finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement, General Verrilli. Well argued on both sides. Thank you. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this term in Case 10-1491, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum. Mr. Hoffman?",
  "I suppose, if you have -- I suppose, if you have, as I think there probably is in this case, a number of plaintiffs, they can sue in a number of different countries, right? Some will sue in the United States, others in the United Kingdom, others in the Netherlands?",
  "You can. Ms. Sullivan?",
  "Well, I thought that was the most clear violation of an international norm. The one thing that the civilized countries would agree on is that you - -",
  "-- capture pirates.",
  "Well, have we crossed that -- we've crossed that bridge already, didn't we, in Sosa?",
  "The presumption applies to interpreting acts of Congress. We are over that. We're -- we're making this law up ourselves, right?",
  "Thank you, Ms. Sullivan. General Verrilli.",
  "Your successors may adopt a different view. And I think -- I don't want to put words in his mouth, but Justice Scalia's point means whatever deference you are entitled to is compromised by the fact that your predecessors took a different position.",
  "Briefly, yes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hoffman you have eight minutes remaining.",
  "Well, the United Kingdom and Netherlands don't think so.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 11-626, Lozman v. The City of Riviera Beach. Mr. Fisher.",
  "Well, that just has -- I understand that argument. It's got no connection whatever to the statutory language, right?",
  "Capable is in the statute, purpose is not, right?",
  "Before you get to Evansville, let's say it moved around, which is one thing, but also it had a raked bow; it wasn't square. Then -- then it starts to look more like a boat. It moves around more frequently. Its mooring -- I mean, if you have a sailboat and you pull it up to a dock, you hook up for water and plug in for power. It doesn't seem to me to be terribly significant.",
  "Aren't you just begging the question? You keep saying it was not a vessel to begin with. Why -- doesn't it just restate the question?",
  "Well, doesn't your argument beg the question?",
  "So it changes -- one -- the same thing is not a boat sometimes, and it is a boat. You've got a casino that's tied up for a month. During that time, it's not a boat. And then they move it around to go to the other side of the river, and during that time it is a boat?",
  "But -- but I'm just -- the hypothetical -- the hypothetical I've posed was meant to pose the question, well, sometimes things do both, and how do we tell which it is - -",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon.",
  "Can I -- can I interrupt you just there on the dredging? You say the function of the dredge was to carry people and equipment. I would have said the function of the -- the dredge is to dredge in the middle of the river.",
  "Right? And so - - and I don't know which of us would be right, so it seems to me that that function test is a very difficult one to apply.",
  "Well, I know what it said. I guess I would say, obviously, it serves a waterborne function, but I'm not sure the first thing I would say when I see one of these dredges in the middle of the river is its purpose is to move people and equipment. I would say its purpose is to dredge.",
  "No, I know but that's saying that it has to be able to move, and I agree with that. But its purpose is still to dredge, not to move.",
  "You could use it if you had a -- you know, a transportation boat, right? Any equipment you need to move, you put it on another boat and drop it off. The people who work, you bring them over and drop it off.",
  "Sure it is, isn't it? I mean, the superscoop doesn't go to the -- maybe it does -- go to the shore every morning, then come right out again? They move people back and forth with other boats, don't they?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Frederick.",
  "Just like an inner tube, right?",
  "Floats, can be towed, can carry a person.",
  "One of those inflatable rafts where most of the parts of the people - -",
  "Well, practical capability viewed in a real-world sense -- and you're about transportation -- you're talking about things that were built for transportation, right?",
  "Counsel, your example of the towing cleats highlights one of the difficulties I have; one, because obviously the question of, well, what if they didn't have the towing cleats, and then what if they had the towing cleats and then took them off, what if they were temporary towing cleats. One of the things, this is a jurisdictional statute and we like jurisdictional statutes to be clear and easy of application. Why do you think your test is easier than your friend's test?",
  "It's got -- it doesn't have -- the thing that makes something look most like a boat in my view is a raked bow. That tells you that that's what they want to use it for, to move through the water. This is straight up and down.",
  "It doesn't have a - - what are the things called on the side, the elevated sides that you'd look for in a boat.",
  "Well, but, I mean, there is some easy things to visualize as a problem. If this is a vessel, then the maid that comes on twice a week is a seaman under the Jones Act, right?",
  "I'm sorry, taken out of navigation, but not every time it's docked, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, you have 3 minutes left.",
  "That is -- what was used in the Higgins boats in World War II.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-184, Kloeckner v. Solis. Mr. Schnapper.",
  "Mr. Schnapper --",
  "But the critical point, I gather, is what standard of review the district court will apply to that exhaustion question, or the bar question, right? I assume you think that the standard review in the district court is going to be more favorable to your client than the standard -- the arbitrary and capricious standard that would be applicable in the Federal circuit? I guess --",
  "Even if you give up your CSRA claim, they can assert that defense?",
  "Suppose -- I'm sorry.",
  "So I suppose if you say, I was fired on the basis of race, and the agency says, no, you were fired because you were incompetent, you could take the incompetence claim to the MSPB, and if you win, saying, no, you were perfectly competent, they shouldn't have fired you, you get that relief and you don't need to proceed with the discrimination --",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Harrington.",
  "Now, does that mean that it is not a judicially reviewable action if it is thrown out on a procedural ground.",
  "Why is that? I mean, we think of a -- we review cases on procedural objections all the time and we think of those as judicially reviewable. It's -- it's a real stretch to say simply because it says \"judicially reviewable\" it means judicially reviewable on the merits.",
  "Could you say that again?",
  "A little more slowly.",
  "Okay. It's subject to judicial review.",
  "Now, the next -­",
  "Okay. So I thought that your argument in the brief reduced to the question that an action subject to judicial review in one section is not judicially reviewable in another. That's right?",
  "More slowly.",
  "I thought -- I thought I heard you to say, and this is what I understood your brief to say, that an action that is subject to judicial review is not judicially reviewable under 7703(b)(2).",
  "Okay.",
  "It's a tough argument.",
  "Counsel, getting back to judicially reviewable -­",
  "-- even if I accept your argument that that's not the same as subject to judicial review, isn't it an odd backhanded way to get to your position? This is not something about -- a provision about what's judicially reviewable and what's not. It's a notice provision. It says these actions have to be filed within 30 days after notice of judicial review.",
  "And then you say that judicial reviewability is the key linchpin that bases your argument, when it's really just in a sentence about notice.",
  "Well, yes, that's where the phrase comes in, but it does seem an odd way to establish that that is the critical element that tells you which provisions you can take forward when it just says your time is 30 days after you get notice of judicial review.",
  "And here the Government says, aha, judicial review, we think that does not mean subject to judicial review. Judicially reviewable doesn't mean subject to judicial review.",
  "Yes.",
  "As of. See, it shall be reviewable action as of. Again, it's just going to the timeliness.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Harrington. Mr. Schnapper you have 4 minutes left.",
  "You better remind me.",
  "Fifth.",
  "No, no. I -- I just --",
  "You are on number five.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will now hear argument in Case 11-192, United States v. Bormes. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "Well, then it's really the specific governing the general, but the other way around, right? The Tucker Act discusses specifically the liability and the sovereign immunity of the United States, and if the statute just generally doesn't address it, then the Tucker Act is the specific one and the other statute is the general one.",
  "You'd win under this argument, too, right?",
  "You win under this argument, too. It just seems to me that it's not quite right to say that FCRA -- FCRA does not specifically address the liability of the United States.",
  "The Tucker Act does. So the Tucker Act is the one that's specific, and it applies instead of the general language in the -- in FCRA.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Jacobs.",
  "I'm sorry. Before you get --",
  "But if you -- their argument is if you go to the Seventh Circuit, you don't get any money, right? Because if you're getting money from the United States, don't you have to go to the Court of Claims in a case like this?",
  "No?",
  "But your argument -- your answer is a little more complicated, because the statute doesn't say tort claims, it says claims sounding in tort, which means cases that aren't torts, but are like torts. And it seems to me the case you -- you -- you have here is like tort, an invasion of privacy or something like that.",
  "Well, your friend says that that's a fiduciary -- that's a trust breach, which has been regarded as different than a tort.",
  "Now, it does seem -- I mean, Justice Breyer's point. It does seem a little ad hoc. In other words, they don't fit quite together, and your answer is: Well, we'll just take whatever, you know, whatever we have to, to make it fit. It would go under the least imposing on the Government. It suggests that Congress did not expect the Tucker Act to apply if you've got to change the remedial provisions in FCRA to get it to fit under the Tucker Act.",
  "You can finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, Counsel.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, you have three minutes left.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-465, Johnson v. Williams. Ms. Brenan.",
  "The -- the court of appeals, whose decision we're reviewing, understood the Respondent to present a separate State claim and a separate Federal claim, correct?",
  "That's the predicate to the whole question we have before us, right?",
  "Any idea based on your experience how many separate claims are typically raised in a capital case of this sort?",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hermansen.",
  "Well, just the way you phrased it, if it addresses the bulk of the claims, under your theory it has to address every claim, correct?",
  "No, no. Not overlooked or omitted. Not discussed.",
  "Not analyzed in the opinion.",
  "You agree that if -- if this was raised when your friend was at the lectern -- if the court at the end said, not only denied, but said, I considered all other arguments not addressed, denied, then you have no case, correct?",
  "Well, you're not willing to assume that when the judge says \"denied.\" You're willing to assume that when the judge says: I've looked at everything, denied.",
  "It seems to me if you give them the presumption of regularity in the one case you ought to give it to them in the other.",
  "Well -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "No, the --",
  "The discussion you've been having with Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito highlights another problem with your approach, is that the court is going to have to decide in every case whether or not State law is coterminous with Federal law. And there was -- I don't know that the Ninth Circuit got that question right in this case or they got it wrong, but in every case, or many of the cases, the claim will be made on the part of the State, well, yes, they just said State law, but it's the same as Federal law. And the Ninth Circuit recognized that as an exception to their rule. Isn't that really going to cause all sorts of collateral litigation?",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Oh, it's not.",
  "Except in a case like Harrington v. Richter.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Brenan, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case No. 11-597, Arkansas Game & Fish Commission v. The United States. Mr. Goodhart.",
  "No, no, no, I don't -- why is that every flood? You go through your three factors, you could have lots of flood that aren't a substantial intrusion. You know, you get an extra inch of water, and then it recedes. And it's -- you know - -",
  "-- you get a note from the Corps of Engineers saying, we're sorry, it won't happen again. That's not -- every flood is not - -",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "So it's -- there is a little confusion about the Government's position, there was in the court of appeals. Is it -- I'm quoting from your friend's brief, and he says: \"The Federal Circuit adopted a categorical rule that temporary Government action can never be a taking if the Government does not intend to create a permanent flooding condition.\" Is that an accurate statement of your understanding?",
  "Well, there are pretty clear findings in the Court of Claims on the question of causation, right?",
  "So, so if the Government comes in and tells a landowner downstream that every March and April we are going to flood your property so that you can't use it, from now on, that's the way -- that's part of our plan, that's a taking for those 2 months, correct?",
  "No? The Government says you will not be able to use your land because of what we are doing for 2 months -- you have been able to up to now, but from now on, for March and April, you can't. That's not a taking?",
  "I'll grant you that it can decide whose land it wants to take. I just want to know why that's not a taking.",
  "So if the Government says we've got to release the flood waters and what we're going to do is we're going to have water trucks pull up behind the dam, we're going to load them up and we're going to drive them down river to this person's property and we're going to dump the water there?",
  "But your answer is that would be a taking?",
  "Well, I thought - -",
  "Right.",
  "Again, I think the Court of Claims' findings are to the contrary.",
  "They said the Government knew that this water was going to go right here, right?",
  "What if the Government decides for purposes of flood control -- I don't know -- I don't know the ecological way -- but the water has to percolate or whatever down in this area. So it goes onto this person's land and it cuts down $5 million worth of his trees. The same purpose, to assist in flood control. No doubt that that's a taking, right?",
  "Okay.",
  "Sure, sure. And so the Government then comes down and says, we're going to flood your land and we know -- again, looking at the factual findings -- we know that will result in your trees dying, but because we're doing it for flood control, that's just too bad. Different case when they go in with a chain saw than when they go in with the water?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, just before you get off, because I think part of the confusion, at least for me, is the difference between what the Federal circuit decided and what you're arguing. You seem to be arguing that it doesn't make any difference, it's not -- whether it's temporary or permanent, right? The Federal circuit thought it was dispositive that this they viewed as temporary and not permanent. So it seems to me that you're fighting, and you're fighting a lot of the court of claims' very exhaustive findings, to present a different argument.",
  "It seems to me that if we disagree, and we think it makes a difference that it doesn't have to be 50 years, but it might be something less, then maybe you've preserved all these other arguments or maybe not, but - -",
  "I know, but you agree -- you agree with the Federal circuit, but then you're presenting all these other arguments in which it doesn't depend. So, if we disagree with the Federal circuit, it seems to me that we ought to say that, and maybe you can make these other arguments about it's too far downstream or - -",
  "Or upstream, under your theory.",
  "It strikes me that that's a valuation question. But I understood you to say that if there was a pipe coming out of the dam and it went to somebody's -- right to the property line of somebody's land and that's where you dump the water, that would be a taking.",
  "Okay. I thought the factual findings in the trial court said that was this case, that you knew when you opened up the dam that this is where the water was going to go.",
  "What about 6 years later, when it was doing the same thing and the water went to the same place?",
  "If there's notice and comment -- so the choice is, there are 10 landowners downstream. The question is which one you're going to flood. And you flood number 2, and there is a public process in which number 1 and 3 through 10 get to say, yes, this sounds fine to me.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Goodhart, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel, the case is submitted.",
  "We will now hear argument in Case 10-930, Ryan v. Gonzales. General Horne.",
  "When treatment begins after some sort of initial hearing, right?",
  "Why is it -- I don't mean to be nit-picking, but why is it 6 to 9 months? 8 months -- I mean, why isn't it 6 months? Or 9 months? I don't understand why there's - -",
  "So 6 months? Or 9 months? What does it mean to be 6 to 9 months?",
  "Thank you, General.",
  "Ms. O'Connell.",
  "You said shortly after a reasonable period of time. I thought you were saying after a year. I think it's -- it's some guidance to say no more than a year. It's really no guidance to say after a reasonable time.",
  "What is the standard when the district court is deciding whether to stay the proceedings? We've heard a number of them, plausible basis in the record, truly plausible, Iqbal. Which - - which -- what is the government's position on the appropriate standard?",
  "\"Could\"?",
  "Your standard is \"could provide\"?",
  "You don't mean - - you're not suggesting that don't abuse your discretion is a limit, are you?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Marquez.",
  "Counsel? I'm sorry - -",
  "If -- if we think it's necessary to set some objective limit on how long an inherent authority could be exercised, is there any reason to adopt any limit, other than the one that the psychiatrists have suggested, which is, I gather, most people, if they're going to, will recover competence within 9 months?",
  "So if we're looking for a little more guidance than that and feel the need for an objective standard, other than abuse of discretion, you don't have any number that has any basis in psychiatric evidence or anything else, besides the 9 months?",
  "Nobody here thinks today -- no one's arguing that it prevents any kind of stay today, right?",
  "No. I didn't understand -- I thought everybody was focusing on limitation on stays. And surely, AEDPA is pertinent when it comes to recognizing the need for those limits, right?",
  "So did -- did he begin treatment prior to the district court order on Federal habeas?",
  "Well, so how -- what is this 9 months or 1 year? The amount of time he's under treatment or the amount of time from the district court determination?",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Horne, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, General, counsel. The two cases are submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-218, Tibbals v. Carter. Ms. Schimmer.",
  "I don't understand how your approach works. We, the defendant, the habeas petitioner, the allegation is made, I'm incompetent, there is support for it. The district court says, okay, I can't enter an indefinite stay, but you are going to be treated; I want you to come back in 6 months, okay? And we will look at it then. He comes back in 6 months, and there's been no change. What happens then? Another 6 months? At what point does it become indefinite?",
  "Well, give me a loose and soft rule. I mean, is it - -",
  "Is it two years? Or is it ten years?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michelman.",
  "I'm sorry. I -- I didn't follow that exactly. What -- what prevents them from picking up where they left off?",
  "Oh, it's adjudicated. Okay. Sorry.",
  "I'm sorry. Go - - finish your answer to Justice Alito.",
  "So what -- it's a truly suggested by the record standard?",
  "Well -- well, how is it compared to a motion to dismiss standard?",
  "Is it more stringent?",
  "Well, now we've gone from plausible to truly -- plausible -- well, truly suggested by the record. I mean, suggested by the record might be plausible. It seems to me that it's a pretty loose standard that entitles the defendant to a stay.",
  "Well, but in that case, the -- the whole basis of the analysis was that, although it was collateral, it really was the first opportunity to raise a particular claim. You say that, earlier, that trial judges do this all the time in the trial context. It's an important distinction in our jurisprudence if there's a difference in terms of the rights to which you are entitled preconviction and post-conviction.",
  "What is your -- what is your limit? You think there is no limit on the inherent authority, that these things can go on and on? Or as -- I mean, your -- your friend on the other side suggested, 1 year as a presumption? Do you have any limit?",
  "Did you say that the question is whether or not -- not whether he is competent today to assist his counsel, but whether he was 14 years ago?",
  "How in the world - - I mean - -",
  "Right. How is a - - do mental health professionals make those determinations on a regular basis?",
  "That's a pretty inefficient system, isn't it? That the judge has to learn a particular record to dispose of claims 1 through 9, when he knows that he's not going to be able to dispose of the petition until -- until the petitioner is competent, maybe a year later, then he has to go through the whole thing again?",
  "I don't see a district court saying, well, I'm not going to get into this until I can dispose of the whole thing.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Schimmer, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Well, I get to say that this is Case Number 11-345, Fisher against the University of Texas at Austin. And you get to say - -",
  "Well, I'm sorry. Now, I'm confused. I thought the 15 percent figure was the one that was arrived at with the 10 percent plan.",
  "We will afford you rebuttal time, since our questions have prevented you from reserving it.",
  "Mr. Garre.",
  "Counsel, before -- I need to figure out exactly what these numbers mean. Should someone who is one-quarter Hispanic check the Hispanic box or some different box?",
  "Well, I suppose a person who is one-quarter percent Hispanic, his own determination, would be, I'm one-quarter percent Hispanic.",
  "They would check that box. What about one-eighth?",
  "Would it violate the honor code for someone who is one-eighth Hispanic and says, I identify as Hispanic, to check the Hispanic box?",
  "You don't check, in any way, the racial identification?",
  "So how do you know you have 15 percent African American -- Hispanic or 15 percent minority?",
  "You say it's \"the same way.\" What is that way?",
  "There are student lists in each classroom that -- that have race identified with the students?",
  "Oh, you go back to what they checked on the form?",
  "That's a yes or no question. You go back to what they checked on their application form in deciding whether Economics 201 has a sufficient number of African Americans or Hispanics?",
  "What is that number? What is the critical mass of African Americans and Hispanics at the university that you are working toward?",
  "So how are we supposed to tell whether this plan is narrowly tailored to that goal?",
  "Counsel - -",
  "I understand my job, under our precedents, to determine if your use of race is narrowly tailored to a compelling interest. The compelling interest you identify is attaining a critical mass of minority students at the University of Texas, but you won't tell me what the critical mass is. How am I supposed to do the job that our precedents say I should do?",
  "I know what you say, but when will we know that you've reached a critical mass?",
  "Grutter said there has to be a logical end point to your use of race. What is the logical end point? When will I know that you've reached a critical mass?",
  "So you, what, you conduct a survey and ask students if they feel racially isolated?",
  "And that's the basis for our Constitutional determination?",
  "Okay. What are the others?",
  "At what level will it satisfy the critical mass?",
  "Yes, but at what level will it satisfy the requirement of critical mass?",
  "When -- how am I supposed to decide whether you have an environment within particular minorities who don't feel isolated?",
  "So, I say -- when you tell me, that's good enough.",
  "They don't -- they don't monitor, but race is the only one of your holistic factors that appears on the cover of every application, right?",
  "I'm sorry. The question was whether race is the only one of your holistic factors that appears on the cover of every application.",
  "We will give you a little more time since I'm going to give your friend a little more time.",
  "Just to be clear, are you arguing that she doesn't have standing in an Article III sense?",
  "You address that in your brief in one footnote, right? We have an obligation to consider it in every case, and what you gave us is one footnote in which you said it's hard to see how she could establish cognizable jurisdiction.",
  "What about -- what about our Jacksonville case that said it is an injury to be forced to be part of a process in which there is race-conscious evaluation?",
  "I thought your friend -- your friend told us that these remedial issues and damages issues had been segregated out of the process and are still available for remand.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "General Verrilli.",
  "It doesn't function more subtly in every case. We have findings by both courts below -- and I'm reading from the court of appeals opinion at Petitioner appendix page 33. \"The district court found that race is indisputably a meaningful factor that can make a difference in the evaluation of a student's application.\" If it doesn't make a difference, then we have a clear case; they're using race in a way that doesn't make a difference. The supposition has to be that race is a determining factor. We've heard a lot about holistic and all that. That's fine. But unless it's a determining factor, in some cases they're using race when it doesn't serve the purpose at all. That can't be the situation.",
  "You have to agree that it makes a difference in some cases.",
  "Okay.",
  "Just to get back to what we're talking about, you -- as I understand it, race by itself is taken into account, right? That's the only thing on the cover of the application; they take race into account. And the district court found -- and you're not challenging -- that race makes a difference in some cases, right?",
  "General, how -- what is your view on how we tell whether -- when the University has attained critical mass?",
  "Okay. I'm hearing a lot about what it's not. I'd like to know what it is because our responsibility is to decide whether this use of race is narrowly tailored to achieving, under this University's view, critical mass.",
  "Oh, yes.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Rein, 10 minutes.",
  "Just keeping the playing field level.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-702, Moncrieffe v. Holder. Mr. Goldstein.",
  "And that question's not before us today.",
  "Okay. Well, isn't the reason we don't look at the particular facts and particular case and don't depose four district attorneys, is that the Court has adopted a categorical approach precisely to avoid that type of inquiry in - - whatever it is, 750,000 cases?",
  "No, no, I'm sorry. We don't need that because we've adopted a categorical approach.",
  "841(b)(1)(D) lists the elements and conviction in -- Georgia, right?",
  "Conviction in Georgia under their provision satisfies -- has each of those elements. And under our categorical approach, that's the end of the inquiry.",
  "They want to do that at the tail end, right?",
  "Before you get on - - I didn't understand that to be their position at all. I mean, I suppose we -- I certainly will ask them because they're probably better able to articulate their position, but - -",
  "Go ahead.",
  "I'm sorry. Could you remind me what the \"it\" is that you're talking about?",
  "It's an order from the Attorney General - -",
  "-- to the immigration judges - -",
  "-- to?",
  "I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "Your use of the statistics, I think, assumes that Georgia and other States are prosecuting every case that comes before them because that's how you get -- you know, of these 750,000 nationwide, so much more than must involve tiny amounts. But, of course, perhaps they don't prosecute the cases involving tiny amounts, so that most of those cases, or some percentage of them, may in fact also involve the serious type of conduct addressed by the Federal statute.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shah.",
  "Well, will you pause right there. I don't -- you just made the argument that your position on Castro-Rodriguez is wrong. You say Congress took away the Attorney General's discretion. Then you come back and say, well, we're going to exercise that discretion under -- under Castro-Rodriguez, and this Petitioner in particular can take advantage of it.",
  "Is that -- is the authority for that Castro-Rodriguez?",
  "Is the authority for that the decision in Castro-Rodriguez?",
  "Right.",
  "This is - -",
  "Go ahead. I'm sorry.",
  "But this is -- this is a new position for the government. My understanding is that you -- your clients were on the other side of this position in Castro-Rodriguez itself; is that not correct?",
  "But that was a change in the government's position, wasn't it?",
  "So what does -- in a case in which the Attorney General can cancel removal, putting aside this case, what are the sort of things he looks at in deciding whether or not to cancel removal?",
  "So one of the things, presumably, is the amount of drugs involved, whether they were for intent to distribute for remuneration -- all the sorts of things that you say he can consider under the provision that says he does not have the authority to cancel removal.",
  "And the whole point -- the whole point is that there is no similar provision in the statute at issue in this case, right?",
  "Does that -- does the Castro-Rodriguez proceeding take care of those additional consequences?",
  "Sure. Oh, yes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1025, Clapper v. Amnesty International. General Verrilli.",
  "I don't see how that is pertinent. What you're saying is they don't have standing to challenge program A because they may also be injured under program B. And do you have an example of a case where we've held that?",
  "Well, there again, it depends how you phrase their injury. If you phrase their injury as being subject to surveillance under a particular statutory provision that they think is facially invalid, saying that, well, you're not going to get any relief because you're going to be subject to surveillance under a different provision, I mean, they may say, well, we may, or we may not, but we still have the right to cure the injury of being subject to surveillance under 1881a.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Jaffer.",
  "Our cases, of course, say, do say \"certainly impending,\" not \"substantial risk.\"",
  "No, let's leave that aside. You have two arguments; one is likelihood of future injury and the other is present obligations or cause. I want to focus on the former. Our standard is certainly impending, and you articulated it by saying, substantial risk. There is obviously a vast difference between those two.",
  "It's not enough, of course, to know that the government is using the statute. The whole question is whether or not your clients have been injured, not whether the statute's being used.",
  "I'm sorry, do you want to finish? If it's all right, could you finish the answer?",
  "Counsel, it seems to me that the concern you're talking about is present in every area of practice. If you're representing someone who is being prosecuted, you don't send an e-mail saying, you know, the government hasn't yet asked where you threw the gun, and we've got to be prepared to answer questions on that because, as you know, that's a real probable. I mean, you don't send messages like that through the e-mails or just talk casually over the phone either.",
  "Well, the plaintiffs aren't going to be monitored under the statute. Other people are, and your concern is collateral, that the plaintiffs' discussions might be picked up. But the plaintiffs are not going to be monitored as targets.",
  "Well, that's why I'm saying under your circumstances -- what you said is the government could come in and say: We're not going to monitor these people. Under the statute, you can say that today. The question is whether or not your clients' conversations can be picked up in an incidental way.",
  "Maybe it's a difference in how we're using the word monitor. You do know that your Plaintiffs have not been monitored.",
  "What you don't -- well, others have been monitored abroad, right?",
  "You're not monitored in the sense that this is the person's e-mail, and that's what we're going to collect information from, right?",
  "Right.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. And so the case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 11-696 -- 697, Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons. Mr. Rosenkranz.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Olson.",
  "Counsel, you said there are other defenses, including fair use. In -- in the catalogue that Justice Breyer recited, are all those fair uses?",
  "Well, which ones are -- I mean, I'm -- it seems unlikely to me that, if your position is right, that a court would say, it's a fair use to resell the Toyota, it's a fair use to display the Picasso.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Stewart.",
  "That's an awfully difficult maze for somebody to -- to get through. You have to start with the difficulty of the language here, and then you have to proceed and put the Quality King gloss over it; and, when you finally get to that point, you say, well, now you've got to read Bobbs-Merrill and figure out how the common law governs all that.",
  "Well, it's not that complicated under the Petitioner's approach. It says once you've you had a first sale, that's it.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosenkranz, you have four minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-564, Florida v. Jardines. Mr. Garre.",
  "Well, we've had a lot of -- we've had a lot of discussion about whether it's 5 minutes or 15 minutes or whether it's mothballs. I understood the issue before us to be whether or not under the Fourth Amendment it is a search for a dog to come up to the door and sniff, not with respect to - - we're not making a judgment, I thought, on the probable cause in light of the totality of the circumstances, but the ground of decision below was this is a search when the dog sniffs.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Could I follow up on Justice Breyer's question, because it strikes me as a little confusing. Does the dog, as soon as he or she is at the door, sniff and sit or sniff and not sit, or does the dog -- I mean, you've talked about the sniff is immediate. What -- what is the 5 to 10 minutes?",
  "And the whole process is -- is what?",
  "It doesn't take the 5 to 10 minutes to walk to the door. So the officer walks to the door, the dog sniffs right away and then?",
  "Where -- where in the -- where in the record do I find the few seconds point?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Blumberg.",
  "What were the mothballs there for?",
  "Okay, then - -",
  "Well, that's my question. Are we talking about the expectation of privacy in the marijuana or the expectation of privacy in the odor?",
  "Well -- well, no, that can't be right, because if you're letting smoke out that -- that -- I don't know, from the burning of a body or something, you don't say, well, because he's trying to conceal that you can't rely on the smoke.",
  "So I guess the question here is, if you appreciate the fact that the odor is coming out to the extent that you're going to put mothballs all around the house, it seems to me that you -- you may have an expectation of privacy in the marijuana plants, but you don't have an expectation of privacy in the odor, because you're emitting it out, out into the world, and it's the odor that was detected.",
  "That's like saying you put the -- the drugs in a -- in a bag to protect them from observation on the outside, but you use, you know, a clear bag rather than a, you know, opaque one or something. You didn't -- you weren't very successful. And -- when you began you said assuming that's what the mothballs were there for. That is what they were there for, isn't it? There is no other reason - -",
  "Well, our Fourth Amendment cases are very clear that they don't turn on the subjective intent of the particular officer.",
  "I thought you just said it depends on whether or not he's going up to the door to sniff or going up for something else.",
  "Yes, sure, if he's down on his knees; but, what if he goes up to the front door and sniffs? I mean, he's - -",
  "-- he's got to breathe. I mean, how do you tell whether it's different? I don't understand. He's going up to drop off, you know, tickets to the Policeman's Ball, and he smells marijuana. What is that? Is that a violation or not?",
  "So it depends on -- but if he's going up to sniff, it is a violation?",
  "Can odors be in - - in the equivalent of plain sight, plain smell? In other words, the officer goes up to drop off the Policeman's Ball tickets, the door is open, he sees the dead body. The officer goes up to sell the Policeman's Ball tickets, and he sees -- he smells the marijuana. Okay in both cases, right?",
  "So this depends upon how strong the odor is.",
  "If the -- let's say it's a townhouse that goes right up to the sidewalk. If the police go by with their dog intending to sniff, and the dog alerts, on the sidewalk but two feet away is the front door, that's okay, right?",
  "So it's okay?",
  "Well, let me make sure I understand you. The policeman is walking down the sidewalk with his dog, the dog stops and alerts. That doesn't constitute sufficient probable cause to get a search warrant to go into the townhouse. There's been no entry onto the property, just a policeman walking with his dog.",
  "Sure.",
  "He's walking the dog. He's not out searching. He's walking the K-9 dog, and the dog alerts on a house without any trespass. You think that's still bad?",
  "What is the constitutionally protected area in this case?",
  "Even though it's the sidewalk where people -- there's an implied license for people to walk up to - -",
  "But there is an implied license to walk up to the front door, right?",
  "Maybe this is the same question Justice Alito asked earlier, but people have different senses of smell. So what if there is some person who has, you know, the best sense of smell in the department, and they say, well, let's use him to go do the knock and talks when we suspect drugs; that way, he may discover the odor of marijuana when other people wouldn't. Is it -- is it -- is it wrong for them to select the person with the best sense of smell to do that?",
  "To do a knock and talk. You said knock and talks are okay.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Garre, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "Mr. Garre, welcome back.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Palmore.",
  "And you agree that that's an appropriate area of inquiry?",
  "The judge, presented with, here's Aldo, he was -- went to this school, he was certified, the judge can say, when was he last tested, right? When did he last go through some - -",
  "The -- the only thing really you say they can't ask about is what's - - what's his record.",
  "Do you -- I'm not sure it's relevant, but do dogs -- are their -- does their ability -- is it even across the board? In other words, if you have a dog that's trained and good at sniffing out heroin, the same dog is going to be good at detecting a bomb, or is there some difference?",
  "So you don't know whether -- in other words, are dogs good at sniffing things, or are they -- can they be good at bombs, but not good at meth?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gifford.",
  "I'm -- getting back to -- I'm confused about the difference between must and is required. What if the judge has before him or her a record, this is where the dog went to school and it's a bona fide school, this is where the dog was certified, he's trained every -- every, you know, couple of weeks or whatever it is, and the judge says, do you have any field records, and the officer says, no, and the drug says -- the judge says, well, then no probable cause. That's reversible error, right?",
  "You have, I guess, experts testify about whether -- what constitutes a good training program.",
  "What's the magic number? What percentage of accurate alerts or inaccurate is enough for probable cause?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre, you have 3 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 11-770, Chunon Bailey v. United States. Mr. Shanmugam.",
  "You said the difference is there's no immediate threat to the officers here. But there is a threat, I suppose, I mean, if he finds out about the search and comes back, if he sees the officers outside his dwelling, if there's somebody in the dwelling who can notify him, send him a message that the police are searching and he can get his confederates and come back. It seems to me that you're requiring that there be a larger number of police present at the site conducting the search, being lookouts for anybody that might come back, being able to detain people who are leaving as they approach. There's no immediate threat, but there's certainly a threat.",
  "Well, it requires more unless they want the guy to get away, I guess, right?",
  "We talked about - - we talked about officer safety. What about the safety of others? Suppose the place being searched is adjacent to a playground and there are, you know, dozens of children playing in the playground. The police are worried there would be a shootout and they want to detain the person, so they say: Well, let's wait until he gets a block down the street and detain him there for the safety of the kids. That has -- they can't do that?",
  "Yes, the precaution is let's wait until he's a block down the street because it will be a lot safer. Can they do that and be covered by Summers or not?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall.",
  "Well, we don't have anything like that in this case. We have them getting into a car, driving almost a mile away and being stopped at that point.",
  "As they're executing the warrant, I don't remember, was the -- did the individual know that they were executing the warrant in this case?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "So the danger to them is not at all like the situation with the dog and the armed guy just off the property.",
  "That's an argument in Summers I just don't understand. The argument is you can detain the people because they might want to give the officers assistance. Well, if they want to give them assistance, they don't have to be detained.",
  "It seems odd, you know, we're going to tie -- we're not going to tie you up -- we're going to keep you here, you can't leave because we think you might tell us where the drugs are.",
  "If they want to do that, they can. The question is whether you can detain them in the hope that they will decide to help you - -",
  "-- to give you the key to the cabinet.",
  "Yes, but the question is whether you have to detain them to do something you're saying they'd want to do.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam, you have 3 minutes left.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-820, Roselva Chaidez v. United States. Mr. Fisher.",
  "It's a surprise to the, what, ten courts of appeals who came out the other way?",
  "So maybe it was -- maybe it was a surprise to the members of this Court that disagreed with that - -",
  "-- with the ruling in Padilla.",
  "I think you've been -- you've been asked this, and I'm not sure I got your answer. Give me an example of something that -- like the consequences in Padilla that would not be covered by your argument?",
  "If you had --",
  "If you had that case, what would you rely on in arguing in favor of the habeas petition?",
  "You would start with Strickland, and you would talk with -- Padilla, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 11-1085, Amgen, Incorporated, v. The Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds. Mr. Waxman.",
  "Why -- why is that -- why is that the case? I would suppose, if there's no materiality, that means that the effect on the market price just happens to be zero.",
  "Well, why isn't that common to all parties?",
  "So at certification, you just assume that materiality -- you don't have to show it. If it's always a common question, you assume it, in trying to weigh out the number of -- whether or not common issues predominate or not.",
  "Yes, you may. Mr. Frederick.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Sherry.",
  "Do you -- do you agree that you have to show materiality to rely on the fraud-on-the-market theory to establish reliance?",
  "I -- I don't understand why that is. If you're trying to show reliance, and you show that it's an efficient market, and that the information was -- was public, doesn't that show reliance without regard to whether the statement's material or not?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman, you have 5 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-864, Comcast Corporation v. Behrend. Mr. Estrada.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Barnett.",
  "We are -- we are having an elaborate discussion, and you did in -- in the briefs, about whether or not this was a claim that was waived below. No court has addressed that yet. We're a court of review, not first view. So it seems to me that one option for the Court, since we did reformulate the question, is to answer the question and then send it back for the court to determine whether or not the parties adequately preserved that option or not -- that objection or not.",
  "Well, fine. I mean, and the district court, presumably, can decide based on the proceedings and all that below, all the scars and mess-ups, whether or not it was adequately preserved or not.",
  "Counsel, it -- it seems to me that your answer to Justice Sotomayor, which is whether it's more likely than not that this will be something that can be used at trial, one way to capture that is whether or not this evidence is usable, right?",
  "More likely than not whether it can be used at trial, that sounds like, is it usable?",
  "Well, I know the reason you're hesitating.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Estrada, you have five minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 11-1327, Evans v. Michigan. Mr. Moran.",
  "One -- one of the reasons we've said that underlies Double Jeopardy clause is to prevent overbearing conduct by the government. That's not an issue here, is it? You said the government gets one fair shot at conviction. And if there has been a legal error below, they haven't had a fair shot.",
  "Well, this business about the judge being a representative of the state, I'm not sure how far that gets you. The government is one of the adversaries appearing before the judge, and the judge is not supposed to take the government's side. So he is not really a part of the government. And it does seem to me that, if they had been thrown out of court because of a legal error, that's not a fair shot.",
  "No, I know that - - I'm just saying that that particular rationale for the Double Jeopardy Clause is not applicable in this case.",
  "That's looking at it from the defendant's perspective. We have said that the government should have one fair shot at conviction. And it seems to me that, if they lose because of an error, that's not a fair shot.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Baughman.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Moran, you have five minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-8976, Smith v. United States. Mr. Kramer.",
  "Mr. -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Finish your answer.",
  "Well, your argument basically reduces to the fact that, when it comes to the statute of limitations, you treat the conspirators as individuals, rather than as members of the conspiracy.",
  "Yes, well, that's not true with respect to other aspects of the conspiracy. If members of the conspiracy commit a murder, and it was anticipated and all that, the person that has nothing to do with that, other than being a part of the conspiracy, is liable -- criminally liable for that as well. Why is there a special rule for statutes of limitations? Well, why is he treated as an individual, rather than a member of the conspiracy in that respect?",
  "No, my point is that, once you prove the conspiracy, a member who doesn't -- that doesn't actually participate in the activities of the conspiracy, is still responsible for them. So it makes sense to say you can prove the statute of limitations with respect to the conspiracy, not with respect to each individual.",
  "Well, that's why it's very difficult to put the burden on the government, because the people -- he says, well, I told so-and-so I'm out of this business, I'm not going to do it anymore. And so the government, if they had the burden of proof, would say, well, I don't think that's true, I want to call the person you -- you talked to. And the person says, well, I'm not going to testify because I take my rights under the Fifth Amendment. There is no way the government -- in many cases, there would be no way the government can carry this burden of proof.",
  "I'm -- I'm having trouble understanding how this works. You said a while ago that the government has -- doesn't have to do anything? In other words, he puts on -- he says, I withdrew. And I told this -- the head of the conspiracy that I wanted no more part of it. And the head of the conspiracy says, well, I'm not going to testify. And then the government doesn't have to do anything?",
  "Well, how is that - - how is that carrying the burden that you say is on it to prove the absence of withdrawal beyond a reasonable doubt? It seems to me that, if the government just sits there and doesn't say anything, they'll never be able to carry their burden.",
  "Yes, but they've already done that. That's - -",
  "No, no, no. My hypothetical is, because we are talking about the criminal conspiracy, and the idea is did he tell those people he was out, they're probably going to say, I'm not going to testify. And so -- and you say, well, the government still doesn't have to do anything. It seems to me that you can't say that they've carried their burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, if they have nothing to say about an issue as to which you say they have the burden of proof.",
  "Believe what evidence?",
  "But there can't be any evidence because nobody is willing to testify under -- because they invoked their Fifth Amendment rights.",
  "Okay. Well, if the defendant does testify, and he says, I told the ringleader I want out, is an attack on his credibility sufficient to prove the absence of withdrawal beyond a reasonable doubt?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington?",
  "But what if it is?",
  "If it is charged in the indictment?",
  "What he's saying is that it wasn't proven to be within the limitations period with respect to him.",
  "But you've indicted -- you haven't indicted a conspiracy. You've indicted an individual, and it's not clear to me why you don't have to show that that was -- that that individual's conduct was within the statute of limitations period.",
  "At least, when he comes forward with -- under the burden of production, with evidence suggesting the opposite.",
  "Well, but Mr. Kramer says it's not that big a deal, I mean, you don't have to do -- he says you don't have to do anything at all.",
  "Justice Kennedy?",
  "All of this is questions for the jury under -- under the Petitioners' view, right?",
  "Well, but that last point seems to me spurious itself because, to prove withdrawal, he's got to accept the fact that he was in the conspiracy in the first place. So if he doesn't have a good withdrawal defense, it's unlikely that he would raise it because it would cost him any argument he has against participation in a conspiracy in the first place.",
  "Well, but, I mean, that works in a civil case. But, I mean, in a criminal case, it's kind of a big thing to say -- begin my -- my first argument is that, I withdrew from this horrendous conspiracy that's been going on.",
  "Or then I wasn't a part of it after that. That's a little different in a criminal context.",
  "You have -- you have to prove that every defendant did?",
  "Let me -- so you charge ten people as participating in this conspiracy, and the jury determines that one wasn't, then everybody's off the hook?",
  "So you don't have to prove - -",
  "Yes.",
  "You have to treat them as individuals.",
  "Which is what your friend is trying to argue for in this case?",
  "Well, when you say it wouldn't have made a difference in this case, you're basically saying you had some good evidence. But a jury could have always decided against you, right?",
  "Well, but I think it's a little much to say it wouldn't make a difference because the jury would definitely have ruled in your favor.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Harrington. Mr. Kramer, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 11-1175, Marx v. General Revenue Corporation. Ms. Zieve.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin.",
  "Well, that's a pretty odd way to balance. I mean, if you're -- if you're trying to balance, then you say, well, here's an idea, let's give them attorney's fees, but let's not give them costs.",
  "That's a very curious way to dilute what was otherwise a defendant-friendly provision.",
  "Finish that sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt.",
  "By all 50 titles, you don't mean each title, do you?",
  "You mean, like in Title IX --",
  "And Title XI?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Zieve, you have six minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 11-982, Already, LLC, d/b/a YUMS v. Nike. Mr. Dabney.",
  "You get a lot of what this extra stuff -- you know, that you say, well, even if this is all right, they're not going to sue me for that, there's all the collateral damage. You get a significant amount of that by the covenant not to sue. Nike can't go around giving out these covenants left and right because, if they do, they will undermine their own trademark.",
  "Where does it -- where does it do that?",
  "Okay. So if you take -- if that were taken out, is your case the same or not?",
  "Well, I guess maybe this is the same question Justice Ginsburg was asking. You're -- you're a lawyer in this area. You want to write a covenant that will satisfy the fellow on the other side, but what does it say? Can you do that? Or do you have to say, the only way this case can be rendered moot is if the trademark is totally invalidated?",
  "No, no, that's kind of a yes or no answer. Can you write a covenant that says something other than the trademark is totally invalidated?",
  "No.",
  "So you're saying that, in this case, there's no way -- I mean, I thought it was a practice that was not unprecedented for parties to grant covenants of this sort. You're saying this is unheard of, nobody -- nobody can do this?",
  "Mr. Dabney --",
  "-- if you had the -­ the various interests that you're asserting now -- we're not talking about mootness, but we're talking about Article III standing.",
  "I'm looking at what you're alleging, that you have plans to introduce particular shoes. People are considering investing in your company. Your opponent has intimidated retailers. If you brought a suit by yourself, is that sufficient to establish Article III standings? Are those the sort of concrete and tangible injuries that we've required?",
  "Just because you plan to introduce a particular line of shoes, you can bring a lawsuit?",
  "No. Okay. Just because people are considering investing -- somebody who came in and said, I've got this company, people are thinking of investing in it, and therefore, you want to proceed with your lawsuit?",
  "Well, that surely would not establish Article III standings. Everybody's cost of operation is increased whenever there's any trademark at all because you have to check and see whether it violates a trademark.",
  "No, I suggested it might not.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders.",
  "I thought your answer to Justice Kennedy's question might be that the -- an adverse decision from the agency covering you is an additional injury in fact that gives you Article III standing, unless the -- unless the basis for the agency's decision is you don't have any injury.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein.",
  "Counsel, could you go back to Justice Breyer's question and answer that?",
  "Answer Justice Breyer's question.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dabney, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1160, the Federal Trade Commission v. Phoebe Putney Health System. Mr. Horwich?",
  "Just so I understand your answer to Justice Ginsburg, you're saying there would be a difference if the charter said the authority may require -- acquire any properties to fulfill its mission and if it said the authority may acquire properties to promote its mission?",
  "So you think a general saying they may acquire properties doesn't implicitly say they may acquire all properties? That seems a pretty thin --",
  "Well, you've already told us that there can be State action for some purposes and not others.",
  "So the fact that you have examples where you might conclude, no, they didn't mean to do that, doesn't seem to categorically suggest that you prevail with respect to another one of the powers that are granted.",
  "I -- this may be completely wrong. You can tell me. I would -- would doubt that, in counties or municipalities of this size, you are going to have -- you know, five hospitals, and so that a -- the authority could acquire a hospital and yet still it not have any significant merger consequences on its face. In other words, when this law was passed, giving them the power to acquire hospitals, wasn't it the case that there would likely be only one other hospital or two, so that any acquisition of another hospital would have the merger consequences that this one had?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman.",
  "Can the State -- does the State have a procedure where it can give real-time approval? In other words, this is going on, and the hospital authority says, boy, the FTC is sending us these letters. State, could you do something to show that you approve this transaction, whether it's a special law or there is some organization, I guess, in some other case, setup, that could give its approval? Is there --",
  "No, I know. But I guess my point is can the burden of going forward be switched the other way? And can this hospital authority say -- you know, to the State, we would like some blessing on this, so that we can go ahead with it? So the choices aren't really build your own hospital or acquire the other one, in the abstract, but ask the State -- you know, what do you want us to do? Do you want us to build a new hospital? Or is it okay if we acquire this one?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 11-556, Vance v. Ball State University. Mr. Ortiz.",
  "Let's say you have a work room. There are five people who work there. And the employer has a rule that the senior employee gets to pick the music that's going to play all day long. And the senior employee says to one of the other employees -- you know, if you don't date me -- I know you don't like country music; if you don't date me, it's going to be country music all day long. Now, that affects the daily activities of that other employee. I would have thought, under your theory, that means that that senior employee is a supervisor.",
  "Well, that could be -- that could be far more severe than, for example --",
  "It could be far more severe than simply saying, all right -- you know, you're going to -- as in this case -- you're going to be cutting the celery rather than -- you know, baking the bread, or whatever.",
  "Well, but, I mean, there are places where the environment -- you know, an assembly line or something like that -- where the task may not be that different, but how you -- the environment in which you have to perform them may be far more significant than whether or not you're attaching the door handles or the front fenders.",
  "Well, exactly. And I would have thought the benefit of the Seventh Circuit's test was that you don't have to go through those case-by-case basis. I think we can have a reasonable debate about whether the music you have to listen to for eight hours is objectively a significant enough interference with the daily activities to qualify under your test. But the Seventh Circuit test makes clear -- it doesn't give any kind of immunity; it just makes clear what type of analysis is going to be applied to the allegation.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan?",
  "What about -- what about the music hypothetical?",
  "Where -- where do you think your test comes out on that?",
  "Why -- it doesn't really have to do with the number of tasks. It isn't an assignment of tasks. It's something that clearly affects the daily activities of the employee in a way that could be used to implement or facilitate harassment.",
  "And -- and your tests sort of use that, just as you've posed it, as some broad continuum in which we're going to have countless cases trying to figure out whether music falls closer to this end or -- you know, what -- the senior employee controls the thermostat, is that closer to this end or that end? Or cutting onions? It seems to me that every single case has its own peculiar facts, and courts are going to be -- have to figure out where on the continuum it resides.",
  "How do you know that? Are you just saying they have not generated actual Federal -- Federal court reported cases? Do you have any idea how this works on the ground when people complain about the exercise of authority by a coworker who has specific responsibilities that might be reviewed as supervisory?",
  "The EEOC lawyers think the EEOC plan is working just fine.",
  "You've -- you've talked several times about this going along the spectrum. Where -- where are we supposed to cut off the -- where's the cutting line in the spectrum?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre.",
  "Every -- every time -- every time you adopt a rule rather than a multifactor analysis, there are going to be particular cases that fall outside the rule that look like a harsh result. Now, here it simply affects the nature. It doesn't give any immunity for harassment, it just affects the nature of the showing that might be made. You have no difficulty, as representing an employer, by saying that in every case an allegation of this sort is made you have to go through a case-by-case description of the particular responsibilities, whether it's the thermostat, whether it's the music, whether it's the assignment of everything -- that the employee does, and decide on that basis whether or not you should compensate the victim, or -- or whether or not you should go to court?",
  "Well, I think -- I think your friend on the other side was -- made a good point in his reply brief, which is the variety of circumstances you think courts should look at just happen to correspond with the factual issues that you would have resolved in your favor.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Ortiz, you have 4 more minutes remaining.",
  "That's all in the record in this Court.",
  "Just not in the Joint Appendix.",

  "Was the plan available to the employee at any time before this litigation?",
  "Are they -- are they advised that they can ask for the plan?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Palmore.",
  "Counsel, the -- the position that the United States is advancing today is different from the position that the United States previously advanced. You make their point in footnote 9 of your brief. You say that, in prior case, the Secretary of Labor took this position. And then you say that, upon further reflection, the Secretary is now of the view -- that is not the reason. It wasn't further reflection. We have a new Secretary now under a new administration, right.",
  "I think it would be more candid for your office to tell us when there is a change in position, that it's not based on further reflection of the Secretary. It's not that the Secretary is now of the view -- there has been a change. We are seeing a lot of that lately. It's perfectly fine if you want to change your position, but don't tell us it's because the Secretary has reviewed the matter further, the Secretary is now of the view. Tell us it's because there is a new Secretary.",
  "Then tell us the law has changed. Don't say the Secretary is now of the view. It's not the same person. You cite the prior Secretary by name, and then you say, the Secretary is now of the view. I found that a little disingenuous.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wessler.",
  "Is this the part -- I might be mixing this up with something else, but is this the part where he says, unfortunately, the courts don't agree with that?",
  "Counsel, can -- I want to give you an opportunity to respond to the argument that you've waived, the -- the -- your argument based on the distinction between the summary of the plan and the plan. And there are two things that concern me about that, in particular. The summary of the plan, which you've had all the time, says, on page 1, \"This is only a summary. Complete plan details are contained in a legal plan document. If there is any difference between the information in the summary and the legal plan, the legal plan\" -- \"the legal plan document will govern.\" So when you had the summary, you were on notice that, if there were any difference between it and the plan, the plan would govern. You received a copy of the plan in June of 2012. Okay? And as late as August 29th of 2012, two-and-a-half months afterward, you filed a Joint Appendix that didn't -- didn't contain the provision that you say now governs. So why shouldn't you be held to have waived that? The first time we found out about that was in your red brief that was filed -- June, July, August, September -- three months -- October -- four months after you had the plan. So didn't you waive it?",
  "Which was four months after you had the plan and -- and the plan was lodged with us last week for the first time.",
  "The problem is that the district court interpreted the plan as precluding the claim you're making here. And your argument that that's not true is based not on the summary of the plan, but on the plan itself.",
  "And what the district court does is it defers to the administrator's interpretation of the plan. So the district court found that the administrator's interpretation was not arbitrary and capricious. So what your friend is arguing is that, well, you are kind of stuck with the district court interpretation, and you can't, at the last minute, argue that it shouldn't control because of some other document.",
  "Well, no, Cigna didn't tell you that. The plan -- the summary told you that. It says, \"Complete plan details are in the legal plan. If there is any difference between the summary and the plan, the plan controls.\" So you didn't need Cigna to tell you that.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-9307, Henderson v. United States. Ms. Gilley.",
  "Well, this is a -- I mean, the time from the district court decision in this case to today is how long?",
  "So it's 2 years -- in any case in which -- in a typical case in which this happens, you've got 2 years of cases, right?",
  "Where in Johnson did they -- I'm looking at the para -- two paragraphs the Court spent on this in Johnson. Where did they look at the text? I mean, obviously, they quoted the text, but the analysis seems to me to be based solely on judicial efficiency.",
  "No. I'm looking at where they talked about this particular question, the second prong, as they -- they put it.",
  "He was the Chief Justice, by the way.",
  "It matters to one of us.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall.",
  "Counsel, I -- it strikes me that we are having a very unusual discussion, in that we are competing policy considerations that have been raised. This is a -- a rule with particular language, and I don't think we'd be having this type of a discussion if we were dealing with a statute. I think there would be a different focus. Obviously, the policy concerns would be raised but in a different context. Do you have authority for the proposition that we have more flexibility in interpreting the Federal rules than we would in interpreting the statute?",
  "I mean, it highlight -- it -- just to take a moment -- it was highlighted for me in your brief when you said, well, Johnson, there was a special circumstance, so they read this rule, then, this way. This is not a special circumstance, so we are going to read the rule a different way. Is it because these are rules as opposed to statutes?",
  "Counsel --",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1059, Genesis HealthCare v. Symczyk. Mr. Mann.",
  "Counsel, what if the district court -- this proceeding -- you filed the suggestion of -- of mootness, whatever, and the judge says, okay, I have this suggestion of mootness, I also want to address the certification issue, the mootness argument is scheduled for three months down the road, the certification issue for two months down the road; isn't this just a question of what order the district court wants to address these two issues?",
  "Justice Kennedy.",
  "Counsel, I don't know that you've answered my question sometime ago, but what -- if the judge can simply order the two determinations in a way that certification is addressed before mootness, does that take care of your problem? Obviously, if you grant certification, there is an ongoing controversy. And under Roper and Geraghty, if you deny certification, the relation-back doctrine applies.",
  "Well, there's no doubt that --",
  "I'm sorry. There's no doubt that that -- in that situation, the case goes forward, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal.",
  "I'd like to begin with the question of whether or not you waived that argument.",
  "No -- did you waive it or not?",
  "Well, that was not the way the case was presented in the body of the petition, and I would suppose, if that were your objection, that it wasn't received, wasn't accepted, we might have heard about that, as you -- as you suggest.",
  "And if, in fact, we thought we were dealing with a case in which the Rule 68 offer was not accepted, we might have thought differently about whether to grant it.",
  "You -- you rely on the question presented. Your reformulated question doesn't have that feature in it.",
  "What -- what benefit does this -- why are you arguing so much? You -- you will have an entry of judgment in the favor of your client who is, according to you, similarly situated to lots of others. Why don't you just -- if somebody comes forward, just take them in, go in, you get a check for $7500, or whatever it is, you get attorneys' fees, and you can do that as often as you want.",
  "Well, I know. But that's the fortuity of the fact that she didn't accept the offer. And we are dealing, perhaps, with a case on the record, as presented to us, where she did accept the offer, if you waive that argument. So -- so assume the case where the offer is accepted.",
  "It doesn't matter in terms of what the judge is supposed to do with your motion to certify, if nobody else is in the case? I mean, isn't that one of the factors? I don't know if it's even a sort of good-faith pleading if -- if -- you want certification, but there is no nobody else there.",
  "Thank you, counsel. We'll hear from Mr. Yang now.",
  "I'm not sure I understand. You think there is a live case, not if he doesn't cash it, but I guess, as Justice Breyer was asking, if it's a day late? You -- you said, well, there was a past injury, it was a day late, it -- it -- you know, could be redressed, by telling him what? Pay him again? Or --",
  "Well, you would also have what's usually known as no injury.",
  "So you think a court has to go through the whole process of a trial if the check is a day late and the employer says, I'm sorry, here's -- you know, whatever the interest is on the check?",
  "I'm sorry. Could you directly answer my question about --",
  "Yes.",
  "Or the plaintiff says no -- no standing.",
  "And -- and, as we've said, at every stage of the litigation.",
  "So if you're due -- if you're due $100 from your employer, it's a day late, he gives you $100, and he says, well, here's another dollar for interest, that, as you said, doesn't eliminate the past injury?",
  "Certainly.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Mann, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 11-338, Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center and Georgia-Pacific v. The Northwest Environmental Defense -- Defense Center. Mr. Bishop.",
  "Before -- before we get into that, congratulations to your clients -­",
  "-- getting almost all the relief they're looking for under -- under the new rule issued on Friday.",
  "And thank you for calling it to our attention.",
  "Well, but it's -­ it's an unusual situation for us to rule in a case -­",
  "-- where the issue has ongoing significance and that's taken away. And what we would be doing is, when there is a new rule, we would be considering quite a lot of difficult issues to determine what the old rule was, so that you can unravel what the Ninth Circuit has upheld.",
  "Is this a -- is this a new rule that they -- I too haven't had much of a chance to look at it. But is this a new rule? Or is it an amendment of the existing rule?",
  "Are you sure you want what you're asking for? What if we go ahead and decide this case and rule against you?",
  "Now, I suppose that your clients and others similarly situated -- or I -- I guess it would be the Respondents -- can challenge the new rule, right?",
  "So you would have, simultaneously pending, a case involving the interpretation of the old rule and a challenge to the new rule.",
  "Each of which would have the same issue.",
  "Are you -- which issue are you talking about? The industrial activities issue or the silvicultural?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart.",
  "Were you as surprised, as we were, to learn about that final rule?",
  "When did you learn that the final rule would be issued on Friday?",
  "You had no idea before Friday that this was coming out?",
  "In early November?",
  "Maybe in the future, you could let us know when something as definite as that comes. There were 875 pages on the merits briefing in this case, and if we knew that the final rule was imminent, we could have rescheduled the case for April or-- or something along those lines.",
  "Oh, I know, that there was a proposed rule. Is it your experience that proposed EPA rules become final within a couple of months, particularly?",
  "Well, maybe. And it would have been best if we had known about this in early November.",
  "Do you -- are you saying that the private companies would not be liable for civil penalties, even though the alleged violation was ongoing at the time of the district court litigation?",
  "Well, can I stop you just for a moment? EPA made clear that the conduct was not unlawful. We have a new regulation. The fact that they have issued a new regulation doesn't mean that the reading -- doesn't mean that that's a demonstration that the prior conduct under the old regulation was lawful. Now, I know you've taken the position that it was not, but you've got a court of appeals decision saying it was.",
  "That -- that would have to be based on the assumption that the Ninth Circuit decision was wrong.",
  "I -- I'm having trouble seeing how we can dismiss it as moot when there would remain pending claims for civil penalties and injunctive relief, which you've already said you want to take a closer look at, and attorneys' fees. Now, you seem fairly confident that they'll lose on those, but you felt pretty confident that you'd win on this.",
  "Is this something that -- in terms of mootness, we should evaluate under the voluntary cessation doctrine?",
  "The EPA has changed its ways.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher.",
  "So if we do that -­ if we dismiss as improvidently granted, you still go back and you -- you get your attorneys' fees, you get the civil penalties, you get remediation because the law governing your case would be the existing Ninth Circuit opinion.",
  "Well, the case is not -­",
  "I was just going to say the case is not going to be over if we dismiss.",
  "Because, as you just said, it's interlocutory.",
  "I thought -- I thought -- I'm sorry. I thought they said that their rules mooted this case.",
  "Well, if we -- if we dismiss as improvidently granted, are you suggesting that the Ninth Circuit would then be the -- be a court to consider this?",
  "I'm -- I'm just thinking if we vacate, perhaps another court will consider it, but if we dismiss as improvidently granted, the Ninth Circuit will, quite reasonably, think they are done.",
  "Well, I mean, they're done -- they are done in terms of their interpretation of the regulation and the applicable law.",
  "Well, I think the -­ the Ninth Circuit had the -- of course, EPA's views before it. I don't know, if I'm the Ninth Circuit, why I would reconsider my ruling, in light of this new regulation.",
  "I mean the ruling in the -- the decision that they -­",
  "-- issued that's before us today.",
  "No.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bishop, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1231, Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, there's a little bit of at least facial incongruity in your position. Congress sets in place the 180-day limit. Then you say, oh, well, that, we can go beyond that. The Secretary puts in the 3-year limit, and you say that's it -- you know, that's the dead drop-off. I would have thought what Congress says is entitled to greater weight than what the Secretary says.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Manning.",
  "Why don't you -- why don't you take another minute to finish your answer?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Roth.",
  "Counsel, I'm about 5 minutes behind. The gg provision that you said the government didn't cite -- you mentioned a provision that ended, anyway, with gg.",
  "Is that in your brief?",
  "Is that in the amici's brief?",
  "Is it anywhere that I can find, other than -- I mean, is it in the appendix to any brief?",
  "It's a little bit much to chide the Solicitor General for not citing it when nobody cited it.",
  "Well, subject to arbitrary and capricious review under Chevron?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Manning, you argued and briefed this case as an amicus curiae at the invitation of the Court, and you have ably discharged your responsibility, for which the Court is grateful. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 11-460, Los Angeles Flood Control District v. The Natural Resources Defense Council. Mr. Coates.",
  "Well, it seems to me that they present a very direct syllogism. You have a permit that sets these monitoring stations where they are. The monitoring stations show exceedances, you have violated your permit. What -- what's wrong with that?",
  "Right. But I understand the argument to be that that's the problem that your permit imposes on you; in other words, that this is where the monitoring station is supposed to be. What is it monitoring, if not discharges from the MS4, for which you're responsible? The government suggests that there could be different rules about whether you have to show the allocation or if that's your responsibility.",
  "Well, you don't -- you don't question that there was an actual discharge. The storm sewer system in Los Angeles hasn't been shut down, right?",
  "So there are discharges, right?",
  "You don't dispute that there was at least some small amount of pollutant, even below the -- the permit level, from your point sources, do you?",
  "Well, I'm asking you whether -- I mean, isn't it -- doesn't common sense suggest -- you have asked in your permit for a limit on how much of a --",
  "-- particular pollutant you can discharge.",
  "You wouldn't do that, unless you expected to discharge some.",
  "Well, why did you put the monitoring sources where they are, if that wasn't what was going to measure your compliance with the permit?",
  "Well, the government says that that question -- you're saying, I understand, there are other discharges -- well, you're by far the dominant discharger, but I understand there are others, and they may contribute as well to what the monitoring station says. But the government's position is that, well, that's how you wrote the permit without any allocation; and that whatever allocation issues you have may be between you and the other dischargers, but that doesn't affect the showing of liability.",
  "Where is that? I know we've got the permit. Where does it read that way?",
  "So what -- what percentage of discharges come from you, as opposed to the other members of the MS4 --",
  "Give me an estimate.",
  "What -- what goes into these discharges, besides the rainwater runoff?",
  "Okay.",
  "So your -- your hypothesis is, in some of these minority dischargers, that, for some reason, their rainwater would have a different amount of pollutants than your rainwater?",
  "Justice Kennedy. Ninth Circuit's error here a factual one, because it was based on the location of the stations? Or was it a legal one because it misinterpreted our Miccosukee case?",
  "Where -- where is that requirement?",
  "Where is that requirement that you're now doing?",
  "So you are not doing it now?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shah.",
  "Doesn't that always say that in the judgment of the Court?",
  "Does it say, \"It is so ordered,\" in the judgment that we release?",
  "The reason it would not look at Malibu and -- what's the other one that we're already --",
  "Yes -- would be because it wouldn't comply with the cross-petition rule.",
  "We're are not going to send it back to them to --",
  "Do -- do you have a position on the cross-petition issue?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Colangelo.",
  "Well, where is the permit's own terms? Your friend cited JA 93, which says each permittee is responsible only for a discharge for which it is the operator. So where does the permit clearly show the opposite?",
  "Well -- Looking at 109, it strikes me as a little bit circular to say – to say they have the responsibility to carry out inspection and surveillance and monitoring to ensure compliance with the permit, and their point is, well, we're not -- we're not not in compliance with the permit because you haven't -- there hasn't been an allocation of the discharges to them.",
  "Well, I think that might be -- I think that might be right, but that gets back to the question of whether the permit is -- is poorly drafted.",
  "And -- and I guess the idea is they're changing the permit so to -- to cure that problem.",
  "Well, this is all fine and good. Your -- your friend, though, says you should have cross-petitioned because the relief you seek expands the judgment below, and there are all these cases saying you can't do that.",
  "Well, I understand that, but -- it seems reasonable, but they do cite a lot of cases that say you can't do that. You can't just sort of say, oh, I give up on the others because the judgment, I guess, is one whole, and you would be changing the judgment.",
  "Where on 4 to 5?",
  "Are the provisions -- excuse me, the provisions we've been talking about, the three that you cited and the one that you’re -- are they boilerplate? Do they show up in every typical stormwater permit?",
  "Yes. What about the one that says each permittee is responsible only for a discharge for which it is the operator?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Coates, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Well, I understand, and you do cite a lot of cases for that, but I can't figure out what sense it makes. I mean, if you're willing to give up Santa Clara and Malibu, you're -- you're safe there, and that's the only thing you've won. Why does it -- how does that make sense?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-1347, Chafin v. Chafin. Mr. Manely.",
  "I thought you said that that time period was tolled -- the period that she was in Scotland would be tolled.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Counsel, do you agree with your -- with the Petitioner, just reading a sentence from its brief, that \"mootness requires that relief be impossible\"? Do you think that's the right standard?",
  "What this Court -- Court has always said, if it's an Article 3 inquiry under standing, and it said that it's not supported by injury that is speculative or conjectural. It seems to me, when you start talking about, well, the Scottish court might do this or the Alabama courts might do this, that -- that sounds pretty speculative and conjectural.",
  "So do you think it's -- I mean, I know you've got a laundry list of things, but, as I understand it, you think it's enough that, if the Court issues an opinion, the Scottish court might do something as a result of that?",
  "I thought one of the arguments, maybe it was the Petitioner's and not yours, was that one reason it wasn't moot is because the Scottish courts might look at the case differently.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cullen.",
  "One thing -- one thing the Court can do is give him back $94,000.",
  "He has no -- his ability to challenge the propriety of the order that he pay $94,000 is gone?",
  "Well, that's not quite fair to say we -- we haven't decided whether we're going to appeal. I mean, the -- the stay motion was made immediately upon the determination of the merits by the district court, and the district court said no. So, I mean, didn't they do everything they could have done to -- to get a stay?",
  "Well, that's out of respect to the district judge, who's just issued a ruling on the merits. I mean, saying -- you know, we have to consider your -- your ruling, not -- you know, we're taking you up right away.",
  "It seems to me -- and I may be taking the opposite position from one of my colleagues, but the -- the best thing is to hold things up briefly, so that the child doesn't go overseas and then have to be brought back, particularly if you have situations where there can be an expeditious appeal. And I think most appellate courts would appreciate the -- the benefit of that. It seems to me, if you -- if you're correct that the decision is moot, it's not going to be a -- there is going to be a rush to judgment by the individual that wants to take the child away.",
  "So everything turns, under your view, on whether or not the district court gives the losing party the 48-hour stay or whether the mother in this case decides to stay in the United States until the U.S. proceedings are done. The incentives if you prevail are for the custodial or the parent with control over the child to leave immediately. Even after a motion has been filed -- if a motion for a stay has been filed, that's not a stay. Get on the first plane out, and then you're home free. That seems, to me, to be a very unfortunate result.",
  "No, no. I know, but the point is that the other side says that the decision was wrong.",
  "And -- you know, most -- not most, but many district judges don't like to immediately say, after they have issued a decision, well, there is a good likelihood that I'm wrong, and therefore, I'll issue a stay.",
  "So there has to be at least a period before somebody can go up to the court of appeals and get a stay, and if you're right, what's happening during that 48 hours or 24 hours is that the parent with control of the child is trying to find the first flight out, and once she does, it's all over.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Manely, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Well, that sounds awfully speculative and conjectural. That doesn't sound -- whether you're analyzing it under standing in the first instance or mootness later, that doesn't sound to be the sort of concrete injury that's required.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 11-1450, the Standard Fire Insurance Company v. Knowles. Mr. Boutrous.",
  "Would your position be the same if the issue were not the amount sought but rather the substantive claims? Say there are two different claims the class member -- the class could raise. One would yield damages of $4,900,000. The other would yield damages of $10 million. Do you have the same objection in a case in which the prospective representative only pleads the first claim?",
  "Well, but you do seem to have a difficulty with your position about how far it goes. You make the point in your briefs about the statute of limitations question. In other words, it's not just how much they claim, but where they decide to cut off the statute of limitations and so forth. It seems to me that it's a bit of a slippery slope if you start saying we're going to look at what the class could -- could recover in deciding whether or not, not simply whether or not this representative is adequate, but whether or not it's below or above, above or below $5 million.",
  "Your approach leads to particularly perverse results. You're at the position of arguing that -- you know, they are seeking less than $5 million, but we're responsible for a lot more damage than that. And of course, you don't concede it, but you do say, if in fact we're liable, the damages are going to be a lot greater. Could -- I assume that admission could be used against you under principles of judicial estoppel.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Let's go by seniority. Justice Alito.",
  "Well, you're assuming that it's a bad thing for the class members to have their claims limited. But it may well be a good thing for them to have their claims limited if that gets them into what would reasonably be regarded as a more sympathetic forum.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick?",
  "And you -- I assume you agree that if at the adequacy hearing, if there ever is one, and it's demonstrated that well, in fact, the amount in controversy is $10 million, then you would be obviously not an adequate representative.",
  "What if you had a case where a lawyer brings an action in Miller County and says, I represent -- I want to represent the class of people with these claims and these claims, whose names begin with A to K. It turns out that's $4 million. Then, in the next county, at the same time, he files a case saying, I'd like to represent these people whose names begin L to Z. In each of those cases, it's $4 million. I take it you don't have any objection to that?",
  "But is a counsel who proceeds on that basis, is there any reason to question his adequacy, let's say he's fully representing, bringing all the claims and all the damages. He's just decided to break it up from A to K. Somebody from L is not going to say, well, he's inadequate when he's representing him just because he could have represented everybody in the other action.",
  "Counsel, you realize, of course, you are on pretty thin ice. You are talking about a Senate Report and now you are talking about proposals that weren't enacted. Your -- your friend on the other side focuses on the statutory language which tells you how to find out how much is at stake.",
  "Another thing he might be worried about is that if this action is allowed to proceed, although on its face it's worth $4 million, they're going to have to make a determination whether to settle for a particular amount or not. And if they make a determination that they've got to settle for whatever it is, 20 -- you know, $20 per class member, that is going to set the limit for other classes, including the class members who opt out of this action, the class members from Missouri. And the point is that, for a variety of reasons, that this gives extraordinary leverage to the individual class representative of a sort that -- precisely the sort that Congress was worried about.",
  "It's going to be worth a lot more because, if you go to trial, you're going to have a judgment that they should have been giving the general contractor whatever --",
  "-- pickup it is in every case. And so that is going to be extremely valuable. It's going to be worth a lot more -- but the downside, it's going to be a lot more than $5 million.",
  "It's very difficult -- one reason, it's very difficult to speculate about Congress, what they speculate about what they would have intended. Presumably, they may not have thought about the idea that there will be class actions worth a lot more than $5 million, but the plaintiff's lawyer will only ask for less than $5 million.",
  "Why did you decide to file in Miller County?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Boutrous, you have four minutes.",
  "(Nods.)",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 11-9540, Descamps v. United States. Mr. Johnson.",
  "But it's not California's problem, right? We're talking about Federal legislation and how that operates.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Horwich.",
  "The point would expand -- this would expand the problem that you've identified, that the Shepard approach, the existence of the documents, how carefully they've been developed, it would expand that fortuity to a far greater number of cases.",
  "The -- I'm not sure that it achieves greater sentencing equity when you have two defendants who have done exactly the same thing in California, and because of the fortuity of what the plea colloquy looked like in one case as opposed to another, when it really didn't matter one way or another in that situation, one person qualifies under ACCA and the other doesn't.",
  "And presumably I agree that you don't have -- you don't have empirical evidence. But given how -- it does seem to me that it's a broad expansion of the category of cases to which you would apply the modified categorical approach under your position.",
  "You can.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Johnson, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1274, Gabelli and Alpert v. the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Liman.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall.",
  "Well, but that ignores the point that has been raised, is that this statute does not just apply in the SEC context. How many cases have you found across the board in the range of those areas that Justice Breyer catalogued?",
  "So it depends really on how many enforcement officers the SEC has, is it reasonable for them to have been aware of the particular item in some publication. Maybe if they've got 1,000 people reviewing it, but maybe not if they have 10; and that's just not the -- I mean, it's not just the SEC; it's all these other government areas. It seems to me that it's going to be almost impossible for somebody to prove that the government should have known about something. And which part of the government? I mean, it's a big, big government, and particular agencies -- well, you say, well, the Defense Contractor Board should have known, but does that mean that the U.S. attorney's office or the Defense Counsel's office should have known? It seems to me that, at least with respect to that aspect, you really are eliminating any real -- it's certainly not a lot of repose if the idea is, well, I've got to establish that this particular government agency should have known about this. You certainly can't sit back and say, well, 5 years has gone by and --",
  "They can't point to a single case?",
  "So you think it's significant if you can't point to a single case?",
  "And the reason -- the reason there's no private action -- right of action is not because the government could seek civil penalties, it's because Congress hasn't provided a private right of action.",
  "But it didn't -- it didn't necessarily think, and that's why we have a case, that they could seek civil penalties 10 years later, 18 years later, however long, so long as they were busy doing other things and didn't have a chance to know.",
  "Counsel, you made the point earlier that it would be very odd that it's only the sovereign that doesn't benefit from the discovery rule when other people can. But it's when it's the sovereign that's bringing the action that the concerns about repose are particularly presented. You know, the sovereign, with all of its resources, can decide to go after whomever it discovers, however many years after -- whether it's the Social Security recipient that Justice Breyer mentioned or -- or anyone else. So I at least don't find it unusual that it's the sovereign in particular that doesn't get the benefit of whenever you happen to find about it rule.",
  "Would you agree that when we're talking about the interests in repose that the one plaintiff we should be particularly concerned about is the government?",
  "What about the -- what about the Halper case?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Liman, you have 5 minutes remaining. ON BEHALF OF THE Petitioners",
  "I'm sorry. What case?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 12-98, Delia v. E.M.A. Mr. Maddrey?",
  "Well, but it can -- it can participate in that process, can't it? Its -- its money's at issue?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Browning?",
  "Well, but it's worse than that. He does care because the smaller amount means that the victim is going to actually get to keep more and that's all the victim's lawyer is concerned about, and that's fine with the tortfeasor's lawyer because otherwise he would have to pay more.",
  "Sorry to --",
  "It's the same point.",
  "What about fair?",
  "Exactly what?",
  "I was going to say, how do we know what's fair and appropriate? You come in -- let's say you have $20,000 in medical expenses and a claim for pain and suffering. And they come in and they recover a million dollars, right? So what's appropriate in that case? The other side will say, well, we settled on a million dollars, pain and suffering was really 20 million and we came down to a million. So what's fair allocation in the case of the medical expenses? It seems to be an entitled -- entirely artificial judgment. To the extent it's not, it depends on the views of the two parties negotiating and I thought we established that that is entirely subject to manipulation.",
  "It's -- it's a little better than that, but go ahead and answer.",
  "You've said several times that the way you do this is based on the judge's experience and so on with -- with the cases. And I think what your -- your friend on the other side is saying is that's pretty much what's going on here except over time -- I mean, would it be all right if over time the judge says, well, typically, sometimes it's 25 percent, sometimes it's 35 percent, over time, it's sort of 33 percent. And so we're going to have that as an absolute rule so that we don't have to go through these proceedings every time just to make sure that it's 30 percent rather than 33 percent. What's -- I guess it's Justice Kagan's question -- what's wrong with the bright-line rule here?",
  "Well, we're dealing with a North Carolina statute. Don't they get deference along the same lines?",
  "Well, it can't be very clear because CMS took the opposite position before this case, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders?",
  "Is that a reasonable -- this is the Federal district court?",
  "So it's not a State Procedure?",
  "What if -- what if the other -- the parties I guess are coming in and saying, well, that's not how juries work. They don't care that this measure of damages is particularly calculable. They come to a general view. You've got medical expenses, you've got pain and suffering. They make a judgment about that. Would that be a good argument to make?",
  "So how would it take it into account? You said, well, because the medical expenses are readily calculable, we assume that that's what the jury meant first, and then the other stuff is extra so the State can get it. But maybe sometimes they just come to a -- a total figure and they don't care how it's allocated. You say, well, that's an argument they can make. Well, what's a judge supposed to do in a particular case?",
  "So this is a real, significant increase in the burden on the State under the Medicaid program. You're saying yes, you can try to recover recovery from third-party tortfeasors, but if you do that you've got to set up this apparatus where everybody can come in and you've got to prove what the allocation was and all that. So -- I mean some -- 34 States haven't done that, right?",
  "Well, yes, for your purposes. But I'm interested in -- in my purposes. And I'm trying to figure out whether or not that's a significant financial burden on the State -- if they're going to go about trying to recover this money, that they've got to provide some apparatus, administrative, judicial, whatever, to make a calculation that I still don't understand what it's addressed to. And -- and not only that, but even if you do know what it's addressed to, you just take into account all these things and come up with an equitable.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Maddrey, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case Number 11-1425, Missouri v. McNeely. Mr. Koester.",
  "In some cases I suppose the judges actually want to read the affidavit and give it some thought. It's not going to be 3 minutes.",
  "Members of the Court have intruded on your rebuttal time, including me, so we will give you a little extra.",
  "You can finish your thought.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shapiro.",
  "What about a breathalyzer, do you need a warrant for that?",
  "I know what Missouri's position is, and I know it's not a breathalyzer test. But if the logic of your position leads to the requirement of a warrant for breathalyzer, that would be pertinent in analyzing your position.",
  "So does that mean -- the last footnote in the Solicitor General's brief talks about some other methods, including a urine sample. Not as accurate as blood, but it can help achieve the same result. One of the things that I think affects the view in this case is it's a pretty scary image of somebody restrained, and -- you know, a representative of the State approaching them with a needle. But I take it you would say you need a search warrant for a urine sample, too?",
  "Yes.",
  "What about -- what about this device that you just sort of hold in front of that you don't have to blow up the balloon, you just hold it in front of the individual and it measures to some extent blood alcohol content, or at least whether the individual's been drinking? Surely you don't need a search warrant for that.",
  "You're in an odd -- odd position to be making -- it's an understandable position -- your argument is these warrants are just easy as -- as pie. You just send in this thing, the judge does it in an instant, it doesn't take very long at all. It seems to me that that diminishes the protection of the Fourth Amendment to a far -- far greater extent. The idea is that the prosecuting attorney is supposed to spend some time looking at this before submitting it to the judge and the judge is supposed to spend some time examining it. But the idea that you're going to do these things in a half hour seems unreasonable to me.",
  "Well, I'm sorry, what's the relevance of that?",
  "But it depends upon when the last -- if a person left the restaurant right after they had a nightcap and then left, but if they just had drinks before, I mean, the problem seems to be there in either case.",
  "You don't know when the person's last drink was.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Koester, you have -- we'll give you three minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 12-25, Maracich v. Spears. Mr. Guerra?",
  "It's kind of hard to argue, when you have (b)s (1) through (14), that (b)(12) is the core provision. Usually, it's -- it's 1 of 14 items in a list.",
  "How -- how is somebody conducting an investigation in anticipation of litigation -- it hasn't started yet -- acting as an officer of the court?",
  "Well, that just seems to me to be saying a lawyer is always acting as an officer of the court.",
  "When you're preparing a discovery request, when you're -- anything -- anything that the officer functions --",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement?",
  "One thing we also know about the \"in connection with\" language is that we have said, it can't really mean \"in connection with,\" as broadly as that -- the Morales case, I guess, it has to have a more narrow meaning. Otherwise, everything would be covered.",
  "It would be -- it would be a very poor lawyer who couldn't figure out how to write this -- the letter he's going to send out in a way that it could not be said to be investigation, as opposed to solicitation. If you have a problem with the windshield wipers, you just send a letter saying, there is this big problem with windshield wipers. I am a lawyer, I'm representing -- or I hope to represent, or I will represent a group of people who have this problem, and I think we will recover some damages. Would you like to be a witness in that case? That is in anticipation of litigation, but it's also, quite plainly, an effort to solicit clients, not just witnesses.",
  "So where -- where is the line?",
  "No, that's the words -- that's the words of the statute. I'm trying to figure out what they mean. If you think there is some type of solicitation that the statute was meant to prohibit, how do you draw a line that prohibits that, but allows the sort of thing that you want to do?",
  "That doesn't have to be filed in court, that may just be --",
  "-- residing in the brain of any lawyer who's looking for work.",
  "Well, that's -- well, that's right. I understand your point, that this is -- they're not separate categories, and there's no overlap. But the word is \"harmonizing,\" and the problem is we have to give some limiting construction to \"in connection with.\" And it seems to me that, if you are involved in that endeavor, it does make sense to see how what you're going to cover under the \"in connection with\" relates to what's exempt under the other provisions.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Well, if they are -- if they were thinking they might bring an ADA suit --",
  "Your position does create a special -- the point your friend makes -- it does create a special exemption from a solicitation bar for lawyers. Lawyers can solicitate -- you know, Acme Products can't.",
  "In connection with something they hope might someday become litigation, depending upon the answers they get.",
  "Would you want to start the suit? It doesn't matter in your position.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Guerra, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-9335, Alleyne v. United States. Ms. Maguire?",
  "That sounds like -- that sounds like an argument that it's wrong, and that is, of course, the first step in -- in the stare decisis analysis. It doesn't sound, to me, responsive to Justice Kagan's question is, in what sense is it unworkable?",
  "It started, \"Mr. Chief Justice.\"",
  "That's -- I'm not sure that that's -- you've emphasized several times that it takes away the discretion of the judge. That seems, to me, to be a matter between Congress and the Judiciary and not a Sixth Amendment question.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Ms. Maguire, you have five minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next this morning in Case 11-9953, Boyer v. Louisiana. Mr. Bourke?",
  "How much money would be needed for investigation and experts before you would acknowledge that that would be competent representation?",
  "Well, I mean, Justice Alito's problem seemed, to me, to get back to Justice Scalia's point, is that he seemed more interested in the funding than a speedy trial, the funding that would be provided by the State under its procedures.",
  "And, as Justice Alito pointed out on several occasions, what the defense lawyer said was, let's put it off and see if we can get funding, let's put it off until there's the funding hearing, let's put it off and put it off, as opposed to saying, I want a speedy trial, I'm entitled to it now, if you don't have the money, I don't get a speedy trial, I get off scot-free.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Sigler?",
  "What about --",
  "What about your friend's argument that he couldn't ask for a speedy trial without an affidavit saying he was ready to go to trial?",
  "Justice Alito, I think, has a question pending.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bourke, you have about 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1351, Levin v. United States. Mr. Feldman?",
  "I don't quite understand your answer to Justice Ginsburg on the \"for purposes of this section.\" What the section does is provide that the remedy against the United States is exclusive. But what the 1089(e) goes on to say is that the 26 -- the 2680(h) provision doesn't apply. So I don't see how that -- I mean, the -- the reference is to the exclusivity, not to the waiver of the limitation on -- on intentional torts.",
  "Justice --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Shah?",
  "Well, the \"unequivocally\" -- we have a lot of cases that say you don't get -- you certainly get the benefit of the \"unequivocally\" standard, when you are talking about a waiver of sovereign immunity in the first instance, but you don't keep getting the benefit over and over again when you are talking about, as in this case, an exception to an exception to an exception.",
  "Well, but that was because, at that point, there was an exception to the exception of sovereign immunity.",
  "And you're going even a step further, to say you get the benefit of the unequivocal test that you've set forth at even the next stage.",
  "No, you've already -- you've already used up your benefit of an unequivocal requirement when you've got the interpretation of the FTCA itself, which is the waiver of sovereign immunity.",
  "Wait a minute. You agree with me that you don't get the benefit of your higher standard of interpretation with respect to 2680(h)?",
  "But then the -- then the heightened standard of use sort of resurrects again, when you get to considering an exception to 2680(h).",
  "And that was successful. The Court relied on that argument several times in its opinion.",
  "We certainly -- we certainly cited Smith.",
  "Your friend -- your friend says that, in Smith -- I'm sorry for the confusion -- the Court addressed your argument on the meaning of the Gonzalez Act several times.",
  "So you want us to decide the case with the unequivocal question before us, in other words, deciding whether that benefit to the government applies in this type of case.",
  "It seems to me to be you are really upping the ante here, and it may well -- I have no idea why the government took the opposite position below, but that's -- that's putting a lot more at stake in this case than the particular statutory position.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feldman, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Mr. Feldman, the Court invited you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae, and you have ably discharged that responsibility, for which the Court is grateful.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next this morning in Case 11-1447, Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District. Mr. Beard?",
  "And I will afford you some additional time, since our questioning intruded on yours.",
  "Mr. Wolfson?",
  "Does it make any difference, in his refusing to do anything more, whether the condition is onsite or offsite?",
  "Those are all State -- State law provisions you are talking about.",
  "What about is there -- is there anything in the Federal Constitution that limits the conditions that you can demand?",
  "But that's -- but there is no -- there is no restraint on the agency. It can ask for the moon -- before it will give a permit?",
  "Do you know of any case where the government has lost a Penn Central case?",
  "Let me present - - I'm sorry.",
  "It doesn't happen very often.",
  "Just -- just to nail it down, your -- your position is that there is no limit in the Federal Constitution on what the agency can demand as a condition for the issuance of a permit?",
  "But -- but the Takings -- the Takings Clause does not.",
  "Sure it would have been -- sure it would have been, if they just went along -- to a landowner, and the landowner is there, minding his own business, and they say, well, you own some property, so give us a 1 million dollars to build a football stadium. That would be -- that would be unconstitutional, right?",
  "One of the things the -- the Federal provision, the Takings Clause, is designed to prevent property owners from having to bear the costs that should be borne by the people as a whole. The football stadium example, there is no reason that a particular landowner should have to pay for the football stadium, simply because he owns property. The Takings Clause is designed to make sure that those exactions are not imposed on property owners, but spread more evenly across the citizens who benefit from it. And I guess I don't understand why you say that the Takings Clause is the one provision that doesn't apply in that type of situation.",
  "The generally applicable regulation in the football stadium hypothetical is not generally applicable. It says, you are the owner of this property, and if you want to develop it, you've got to build a football stadium.",
  "I think that your point goes to the question that has been raised about -- there's no permit issued. He didn't accept the -- the permit. And I don't understand that proposition. Are you saying that, if you are confronted with an unconstitutional condition, you have to accept it, and then you can challenge it? You can't simply say you denied that on the basis of an unconstitutional condition, and that's wrong?",
  "Okay. I'm trying to get to the Federal. You often fall back to the State provisions. I'm looking at the Federal Constitution. And, assuming the State provisions give you no relief, is it your position that he has no claim, unless he accepts a permit with unconstitutional conditions?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Wolfson. Mr. Kneedler?",
  "Well, what about -- what about the football stadium? Do they -- can you pick a particular landowner? I mean, you took a case in which there is no question, under Nollan and Dolan, about the relationship, proportionality, and nexus. Let's put those to one side because the issue is whether Nollan and Dolan apply. Can the government say, okay, you want a permit, we will give you the permit, if you fund the new football stadium?",
  "But the one constitutional provision that is concerned with protecting property owners from having to bear burdens that should be borne by the public at large is not applicable?",
  "Do you agree -- your friend on the other side cited a number of places in the record, where he thought your condition was satisfied, that the denial of the permit was expressly based on the failure to comply with the offered conditions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Beard, you have three minutes.",
  "Finish your thought.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Counsel. The case is now submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next this morning in Case Number 11-1118, Gunn v. Minton. Ms. Webre?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michel? Is that correct, \"Michel\"?",
  "It's not -- it's not -- I guess it's not their hypothetical law. They would be saying, this is what we think the Federal law requires, and while we're happy -- or not happy -- but it's interesting that the Federal circuit thinks something else, but that doesn't bind us.",
  "What about just the -- just the flip side of this case? Let's suppose they said, the one -- no, you don't need an expert. So it's not belt and suspenders; it's neither belt nor suspenders. That's going to affect the conduct of the lawyers in the State in the way that would be disruptive of -- of the uniformity of Federal patent law.",
  "Well, right, the requirements of the Federal law. The question is there's going to be a different interpretation of what that means in the State court and in the Federal circuit.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1545, City of Arlington, Texas v. The Federal Communications Commission and the consolidated case. Mr. Goldstein?",
  "So your understanding of jurisdiction and what you're arguing for today is nothing more or less than this is a provision as to which Congress did not give the agency law-making authority. You do not defer to the agency with respect to this provision because it's outside its jurisdiction in the sense that it gets deference.",
  "Right. Now, the reason -- the reason we are hearing all about jurisdiction and it's kind of dressed up --",
  "-- is simply because the means by which Congress made clear it was not giving the FCC authority to get deference, however that is phrased, is this 7(a), which speaks about nothing will limit the authority of the States.",
  "If it weren't for that, if it were some other type of provision, that -- we wouldn't call it jurisdiction, but we would just say, the FCC doesn't get deference to it.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli?",
  "Well, that's right, but your argument it seems, to me, can't be -- let's say you have a general statute, and you've got a provision at the beginning that says this is -- authority to interpret this is delegated to the agency. And you go along, but then, all of a sudden, in -- you know, Section 123, it says it doesn't get any deference interpreting this provision. Now, you would not say that the first general one controls the specific withdrawal of deference, would you?",
  "No. You would say you don't get deference on 123. And, as I understand the case -- and that's why I persist in thinking there's no great disagreement here, your friend on the other side is saying that, particularly given 7(a) and some other things, you should read 7(b)(2) as if Congress had said, Agency, you don't get any deference here. You can read it that way, they say, because 7(a) says nothing shall limit what the State can do, other than what's here in the statute. And, if you let the FCC -- if you give them deference, you're letting something else limit what the State can do. So why -- and then you dispute, it seems to me, just whether that you should call that jurisdiction or not because people think of jurisdiction as meaning, oh, you don't get through the door. But, if what they mean by jurisdiction is simply that the agency gets no deference on this point, then it seems to me everybody's saying the same thing.",
  "Ambiguity in the provision that says, Agency, you get no deference? Or ambiguity in the substantive provision at issue?",
  "Well, but, if there's no ambiguity on the provision that says you get no deference, then it doesn't matter whether there's ambiguity on the subsidiary one, right?",
  "Okay.",
  "Right. Well --",
  "Your friend on the other side has another set of arguments about why you should treat this particular provision differently, and that is because it concerns the authority, or lack thereof, of State and local government agencies. Now, does that play any role at all in your analysis.",
  "We are not -- you know, obviously, the dividing line between State authority and Federal authority is a more significant one than some of the other questions as to which agencies get deference, which is whether rates are reasonable or not reasonable. And this provision is written in terms of a preservation of State authority. And your view would give the Federal agency deference under Chevron -- very considerable deference in defining when there should be Federal authority and when there should be State. Is that, at all, a pertinent consideration?",
  "Normal -- I'm sorry I interrupt you, but the normal rules of statutory construction include a clear statement rule?",
  "Who has to -- who has to be clear on their statement? Which way?",
  "That it intended to intrude upon State authority?",
  "No, it wasn't going to be that. That -- the idea that there is no difference between the Federal judiciary defining the limits between the State and Federal power and having an agency of unelected bureaucrats responsible to the executive saying when the State controls and when the Federal controls, those are vastly different propositions.",
  "Yes.",
  "But they have also said -- they have also said, in (7)(a), that those are the only limits, not add on to this any limits that unelected bureaucrats might decide to impose, and will give them -- and the courts must give them vast deference in enforcing those limits.",
  "I'm sorry. Is it AT&T v. --",
  "Okay.",
  "But, in rejecting that argument in Section 2 of the opinion, the author of that opinion in nowhere, in no place, applied Chevron deference in answering that question. It was entirely de novo, unlike in Section 3, when it was finally decided, okay, we've got the answer here, and, now, we will defer to the agency on the substance of the determination.",
  "Does it cite --",
  "-- in Part 2, which is --",
  "-- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 pages of analysis of the Chevron case?",
  "Does it say they are applying Chevron deference?",
  "Okay.",
  "You're talking about",
  "Okay. What is there about (7)(A) that you think is ambiguous?",
  "Well, but, I mean, your argument there is basically saying, when the statute says something is reasonable, it means that the Commission doesn't have -- it's a jurisdictional question whether it's reasonable or unreasonable. But it seems to me that this provision is quite a bit different. It talks about the authority of a State. And, usually, when we are talking about the authority of which entity can -- can govern, we view that as jurisdictional. There may well be cases at the margin that are -- that are difficult. But -- but your argument is, basically, reasonable or unreasonable is the same as State or Federal.",
  "No, no. I'm not talking about the federalism values. I'm talking about your argument that, oh, once you say you can draw a jurisdictional line here, people will argue you can draw it everywhere.",
  "Yes, that's exactly right. That limits it. And -- and the question then is, of course, whether that's enforced in court -- enforced in court or before the agency; right?",
  "Well, whether the -- whether the standard is defined in -- by -- through direct judicial review or by the agency, with deference to the agency.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Goldstein, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-10362, Millbrook v. United States. Mr. Paolella.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Bucholtz.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Paolella, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bucholtz, this Court appointed you as an amicus curiae to brief and argue the case in support of the judgment below, and you have ably discharged that responsibility for which the Court is grateful. Thank you. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next this morning in case 11-796, Bowman v. Monsanto Company. Mr. Walters.",
  "Why in the world would anybody spend any money to try to improve the seed if as soon as they sold the first one anybody could grow more and have as many of those seeds as they want?",
  "That's true, that's true in the case of any patented article, right?",
  "So the patent system is based, I think, on a recognition that contractual protection is inadequate to encourage invention.",
  "Well, you only need one -- I mean, you throw the seeds on the ground, one or two of them are going to grow and you still have the same case, right?",
  "I'm sorry, maybe I didn't read this right. I thought what he did was plant all the commodity seeds, and then applied the Roundup, so that all that was left was the Roundup resistance seeds, and then he used those.",
  "How come that's not a problem the first time you plant?",
  "No, no. I mean the very first time, you get nothing but Monsanto Ready -- Roundup Ready seeds and you plant those. Are you telling us you have the same problem with them growing at different rates and all that?",
  "So that doesn't make the commodity seeds any different?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Sherry?",
  "Well, but I mean, this -- the reason it's never is because this is an entirely different case. It's the reason it's here because you have the intersection of the Exhaustion Doctrine and the -- the normal protection of reinvented articles. So I don't think it gets you very far to say that we've never applied the Exhaustion Doctrine that way either. We have never applied the Reinvention Doctrine to articles that reinvent themselves like plant seed.",
  "So when -- when are the patent rights exhausted in the seed?",
  "I'm putting aside all the contracts and stuff.",
  "That sounds like the patent rights haven't been exhausted then.",
  "You mean it’s been exhausted with respect to the one bean?",
  "That's always the case because it's a very -- the other cases haven't involved the -- this situation where you are talking about a self-regenerating product.",
  "Well, we haven't had that case either.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman.",
  "Well, is that how it works?",
  "No, I mean I'm serious. I mean, your example, it seems to me, is not quite on point because it's not a situation where the intended use of the vaccine necessarily results in regeneration of it. In your hypothetical, CVS was going to some lab and making more, right?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Mr. Walters, you have five minutes remaining.",
  "What -- what about Mr. Waxman's suggestion that we've already decided this in Microsoft v. AT&T?",
  "I'm sorry, I didn't follow that answer to Justice Scalia's question.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning first in Case 12-17, McBurney v. Young. Mr. Gupta?",
  "All -- all he has to do is get somebody from -- from Virginia to ask for him, right?",
  "Well, but you don't have to pay the person too much, he just has to write a letter saying, give me these documents, right?",
  "Well, an increased cost of -- I don't know how much -- 100 bucks, right? Go -- write a letter, say you want these documents, and, when they come to your house, give them to me.",
  "But this -- this is not -- this is not a regulation of commerce. It's a State practice that may have an incidental effect on commerce, and the incidental effect may be disproportionate, depending upon whether you're State or local, but it's not a regulation of commerce.",
  "What if the State of Virginia says, as a policy, we want to help Virginia businesses, and so we're going to open a business training, best practices institute, where you're going to learn how to be a better business person, but the only people who can come in are -- are Virginia businesses.",
  "Under your theory, because that will have an effect -- an incidental effect on commerce in a way that's discriminatory, is -- is that unconstitutional?",
  "Is that -- when you're talking about impact, is that a Pike analysis?",
  "Well, I thought, if it was facial discrimination, you're not concerned about impact.",
  "I thought a question of talking about the effects on interstate commerce, that's the -- you know, the Pike analysis.",
  "Is this -- is this your Privileges and Immunities argument or your dormant Commerce Clause argument?",
  "So then it's not enough that this is a big deal to your client. It has to be something that is essential to hold the country together as a national unit. And it seems, to me, it's a bit of a stretch to say somebody gathering records about commercial -- under FOIA fits that description.",
  "No, but, see, they're just to get into those. Again, I think a lot of those examples you -- you do have access under other statutes. You're talking about mortgage rules and all that. Aren't those all -­",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Getchell?",
  "So the -- if I understood your answer to Justice Sotomayor, the only reason you don't let out-of-Staters get these records is because of the added overhead costs?",
  "Well, I know. But -- but -- so why don't you do it anyways? Just -- just as I asked your friend, it doesn't seem like that big a deal. It doesn't seem like that big a deal for you either. If you can recoup overhead costs from people who request -- and I'd assume you would be able to -- why don't other people -- people from West Virginia may have interest in how Virginia government operates, too. And -- and, again, if -- what cost is there to you, other than overhead? You don't want to keep how Virginia government operates quiet from outsiders when you let in -- its citizens get the access, do you?",
  "Well, that's under the Privileges -- the Privileges and Immunities argument.",
  "Okay. But what about the Dormant Commerce Clause?",
  "No, I know -- I understand your argument. I'm just asking you why bother? I mean, what -- what's the -- and that's certainly pertinent to some of the Commerce Clause analysis. And I haven't heard anything, other than the overhead costs. And I think you can recoup that from the requesters.",
  "Why not?",
  "Well, you've got to maintain and generate the database, anyway, for Virginia citizens who are going to ask for it. This is not an added cost. It's an added cost if you have to hire an additional person to handle -- as far as I can tell, just these two people.",
  "It's no more complicated a system if you let out-of-Staters have access, too. You say we want a simple system. It's going to be the same system, whether you win or lose.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Gupta, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 12-43, PPL Corporation and Subsidiaries v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Mr. Clement?",
  "Wait, Justice Kagan. No, Justice Kagan.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Connell?",
  "Counsel --",
  "We had a lot of -- your friend had a lot of questions on the different periods -- the initial periods and changing the D value and what that did to the -- that is not an argument that you've made, is it?",
  "Well, but that is -- again, that's not an argument you've made.",
  "Well, the amicus did, but I don't think we should do a better job of getting money from people than the IRS does.",
  "No, that's a good articulation of the argument you haven't made.",
  "I thought you were saying that that argument was wrong because you looked to the predominant character of the tax and that it's either a tax -- it's either an income tax or it's not. It wouldn't be an income tax on the vast majority of the companies where it was the same and not on the companies where it was a large value or the other way around. You look at the predominant characteristic and you decide whether it's a tax or not on that basis.",
  "But there is no difference between what the Commissioner says the regulation means and what it says.",
  "It doesn't seem to move the ball much, one way or the other.",
  "What if you -- go ahead. What if they impose this -- what you would call valuation tax every year, and it was based the same way, it's based on profits that year, saying, we're going to say, we think the value of this company is now this much because they made -- whatever -- $20 million last year. And so we impose this -- this set tax. The next year, we think its value is this because they made -- you know, 10 million, so we are going to impose this tax.",
  "Based solely -- based solely on the amount of income?",
  "How could -- a property tax calculated that way? In other words, based on income from the property?",
  "But if they said, we are going to multiply it by a price/earnings ratio.",
  "Based on how much you earned.",
  "Which sounds like income.",
  "Well, the \"how much you earned\" part sounds like income.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear next this morning in Case 11-10189, Trevino v. Thaler. Mr. Wolf?",
  "The district court, the trial court?",
  "Has the Texas -- have the Texas appellate courts ever sent a -- a claim back for an evidentiary hearing?",
  "So as far as you know, the court -- the appellate court's never done that?",
  "Okay. Why does Texas afford people in your client's position a new appellate counsel?",
  "Well, your friend says, page 18 of his brief, that you do. He says, \"Under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 21, direct appeal counsel can supplement the record with evidence developed by investigators and experts, the ones that are appointed and paid for by the State on appeal.\" Now, is that just wrong?",
  "Okay.",
  "Oh, surely -- surely, the trial court in Texas, when it gets a new trial motion within 30 days, and the new counsel on appeal says, well, I have reason to believe -- well, we can see that there wasn't an adequate investigation of mitigating circumstances or whatever made below, and I would like the time to conduct -- you know, the psychological evaluation or to contact these witnesses, is the trial court going to say no?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Oldham?",
  "Justice Sotomayor.",
  "Even beyond the 75 days?",
  "Finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wolf, you have seven minutes remaining.",
  "Justice Kennedy.",
  "Well, what are -- what are these investigators, experts, they're available to the new appellate counsel, what -- what are they supposed to be doing?",
  "Yes, the direct appeal attorney. You say -- basically, you're saying there's no way they can do anything within these time limits, and, yet, the State procedure provides for investigators and experts. It seems to me it would be odd for them to provide for people and to pay for people who can't do anything.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-126, McQuiggin v. Perkins. Mr. Bursch?",
  "I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "Well, now, your friend on the other side, I think, argues that that -- they put that in expressly because they limited what would be the otherwise applicable miscarriage of justice provision in the question that's before us now.",
  "What is your -- what is your answer to that?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Readler?",
  "Counsel, you say, on page 17 of your brief, that this Court has applied the manifest-injustice exception to limits created by Congress. What's your best case for that?",
  "What -- what do you mean, acts of Congress? Your sentence says, applied at the limits created by Congress. I read that to mean statutes of limitations. But that's wrong?",
  "With 2255 -- remind me?",
  "And said what with respect to time --",
  "Said what with respect to the time limits?",
  "So -- so, when you said limits, you didn't mean time limits; you meant substantive limits?",
  "Procedural limits. Do you have a case that applies it to time limits? Which, of course, is the question we have here.",
  "Right. But you said limits created by Congress. So just -- I mean, I should read \"limits created by Congress\" not to mean time limits, but procedural or other limits.",
  "Right. And I guess that's the point of my questioning and your friend's position. There have never been any time limits created by Congress that have been abrogated by a manifest-injustice exception.",
  "Right. And the difference is, in Holland, we are dealing with equitable tolling, which had applied as far back as -- you know, whatever the law goes to limitations; in other words, equitable tolling, which is different from the abrogation, I think, that you are asking for.",
  "Well, it's -- I'm not sure that's right. They don't want to definitely file within one year, if they don't have anything to say. You know, if it takes a certain amount of time before they either acquire it legitimately or can find somebody or -- I don't know, in this case -- you know, the codefendant dies, everybody has no reason any more -- you know, to object and pin it on him. There are a lot of reasons that it's in some of these prisoners' interest to drag things out and then to file. They don't have anything to say within the one year and need time to either, from your point of view, legitimately develop the evidence or, from your friend's point of view, to concoct it.",
  "Your friend responds to that point, I think, by saying that every State allows collateral review in that instance and that what we're talking about is simply preclusion of the second bite at the apple -- or a third bite at the apple, I guess, by -- by assumption, in the Federal system.",
  "What about the actual innocence claim?",
  "Is that the most -- is that the most -- I thought I understood your friend to say -- he can correct me if I'm wrong -- that every State has an avenue for considering that.",
  "And how long did your -­",
  "So is this established after -- after some kind of evidentiary hearing, the delay, whether he delayed for a particular purpose or not?",
  "Why -- why did your client wait 5 years after the last affidavit?",
  "Well, but, I mean, the whole question -- and your friend made the -- made the point -- the question is how many are filed, in how many cases does the claim arise, not how few times it's upheld.",
  "How do you know which of these are meritorious and which aren't? Is this the meritorious -- I assume you think this is a meritorious one?",
  "And your friend says nobody can reasonably think this person is innocent. Maybe he has constitutional claims. But, if you look at the evidence, is this something, at the -- a preliminary stage, you look and say, oh, this guy's clearly innocent, and this goes forward? Or is it one that you can cast aside?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bursch, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Go ahead, briefly.",

  "We will hear argument next this morning in Case 12-207, Maryland v. King. Ms. Winfree?",
  "Your -- your procedure limits the collection to certain violent offenses, right?",
  "But your argument would not be so limited, would it? Under your theory, there's no reason you couldn't undertake this procedure with respect to anybody pulled over for a traffic violation?",
  "Well, I understand. But there's no reason you couldn't, right? I gather it's not that hard. Police officers who give Breathalyzer tests, they can also take a Q-tip or whatever and get a DNA sample, right?",
  "Well, how long does it take to -- to undergo the procedure? You know, you say, ah, and then -- you know.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben?",
  "Yes, but that doesn't mean, for example, that you can go into their house without a warrant.",
  "Well, that -- this is a factual question. I understand your emphasis on the fact that it only looks at 26 loci, and they are supposedly not connected in any way with other information. Does the sample that you retain, can it be evaluated more broadly? In other words, saying, well, the law says we only look at these 13, but we have this saliva, we want to look at all sorts of other stuff.",
  "That argument only makes sense if we're in your -- your future world where it's 90 minutes, right?",
  "It depends on -- if we have a situation such as Maryland says, 11 to 17 days, the footnote, whatever, the amicus brief says something else, but you are not going to put off the bail hearing for 2 weeks?",
  "According to Samson and Knights, you're dealing with people who are still subject to the -- a criminal sentence.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Shanmugam?",
  "Well, that is right. But I'm curious as to why your position is that -- let's say he served his time. He's no longer subject to the criminal justice system. He's not on parole; he's not a probationer. You concede that the DNA evidence can be taken from him, correct?",
  "What is the pertinence of the fact -- I mean, this is not something that people are or can keep private. I mean, if you're in the interview room or something, you take a drink of water, you leave, you're done. I mean, they can examine the DNA from that drink of water.",
  "Doesn't that compromise the -- the expectation of privacy?",
  "No, it's not a --",
  "My question was not trying to get at whether it's a search or not. It's whether -- it's getting at the reasonableness of the expectation of privacy that the -- your DNA is protected from examination when it's left wherever you happened to have been.",
  "Well, I mean, isn't that part of the -- isn't that part of the question, whether there is a legitimate expectation of privacy in a person's DNA?",
  "Well, I know, but you're simply just -- you're -- I guess that's begging the question. And -- well I'd just be repeating my question -- how legitimate is it to you to expect privacy in something that the police can access without you even knowing about it, without any voluntary or involuntary -- if you take a drink of water, if you leave behind a cigarette butt?",
  "There are two different -- two different interests. One is we want to solve unsolved crimes; and the other is we want to be sure -- we have someone in our custody, and we want to be sure, before he is released back into the community, that he isn't a person who has committed five violent crimes before that. Now, your brief says, well, the only interest here is the law enforcement interest. And I found that persuasive because of the concern that it's going to take months to get the DNA back anyway, so they are going to have to release him or not before they know it. But if we are in a position where it now takes 90 minutes -- or will soon take 90 minutes to get the information back, I think that's entirely different because, there, you can find out whether -- it's just tied in with the bail situation, do you want to release him or not?",
  "Well, that's because -- that's because we are not yet at a situation where it takes 90 minutes. Sure, it's not going to do you any good if it's taking 4 months or whatever it took in this case. But, if it's at the point where it's 90 minutes, it would be critical to make that determination.",
  "Well, let's put it this way. Let's -- let's say the judge or the magistrate is going to make a bail determination and he says, well, it's important to me to know whether you are going to commit another crime. So we are not saying you have to give a DNA sample, but it will enter into my calculation if you refuse to do it.",
  "Well, what does that mean? Is that okay or not?",
  "Well, we do it -- doesn't that sound just like a Breathalyzer? You are pulled over, they say, we want you to take a Breathalyzer test. They say, you don't have to, but, if you don't, your license is suspended for 6 months or whatever. Why isn't that the same thing.",
  "You -- you disclose all of this intimate private information when you take a drink of water and leave -- leave the glass behind.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Winfree, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "How can I base a decision today on what you tell me is going to happen in 2 years? You say, in 2 years, we will have this rapid DNA available, but we don't now. Don't I have to base a decision on what we have today?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-62, Peugh v. United States. Mr. Kinnaird?",
  "What if you have a law that sentencing judges must consider these factors, and one of the factors is whether the defendant has strong family ties that will be -- you know, jeopardized or whatever, if he's incarcerated. You don't want to take him away from his family because that will penalize other people. And then Congress thinks that's not a good idea and they take that away. Is that an ex post facto violation? It increases the factors of -- or the risk that the defendant will get a higher sentence. Before, he could take advantage of the fact that he had -- you know, a particular family situation; later, he could not. That's a change in what the sentencing court must consider and is to his prejudice.",
  "Well, under -- under our modification of the guidelines approach, isn't that just a list of factors that the Court should consider -- or must consider?",
  "So what if the -- what if the law said the court must begin with a comparison of what the average sentence is across the country, okay? And the data collection, over time, becomes more sophisticated, and they can give you a more accurate number for what the average sentence is. And it turns out it's higher than what their informal survey was before. Is that an ex post facto violation?",
  "No, no. It'd be the same -- it'd be the same thing. One of the things that the Sentencing Commission considers is, of course, what the average sentences were around the country. And let's say that the law says that's something you have to consider, and the technology or the range of -- of judges that they can survey becomes more sophisticated, the number goes up.",
  "Yes.",
  "And so the answer --",
  "And so the answer to my question is?",
  "Just -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "So just getting more accurate information violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, in the framework that you've set forth?",
  "I'm sorry, who prevails? The government or the --",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin?",
  "What if -- I'm sorry. Are you finished?",
  "A good -- good advocate. Let's say you had a statute -- not a guideline, a statute -- that said a sentence for a particular offense will be 5 years, but the judge can lower it to 4 years, if he thinks it would be a manifest injustice to sentence to 5 years. That provision is later repealed. Now, it just says that the sentence should be 5 years. Does that violate the Ex Post Facto Clause?",
  "No matter how narrow -- no matter how narrow the original grant of discretion is? In other words, only in the case of manifest injustice or however dramatic you want to limit the available discretion.",
  "How would -- how would a court --",
  "Right. How would a court go about answering that question?",
  "So it's a statistical evaluation of the kind we were talking about. You look, and you say, well, it's only once in a blue moon that a judge invokes the manifest injustice provision, so it's not increasing the risk. On the other hand, well, every four out of five judges do, and, therefore, it is an increase. Is that how you --",
  "You can finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kinnaird, you have 3 minutes left.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "This is Case Number 12-133, American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant. Mr. Kellogg.",
  "I'm a little confused about this business about pooling resources and whether it's prohibited or permitted. Tell me exactly what your position is on that.",
  "Well, it seems to me -- I don't see how that concession is at all needed by the other side. I mean, let's just say they have a trade association or something. They -- they can all get together and say we want to prepare an antitrust expert report about what American Express is doing, and they do, and then presumably, one of them can use it in the arbitration. Any problem with that?",
  "Well, again, that doesn't seem too difficult. You either have your trade association or you have a big meeting of all them and say we need to pay for this expert report and once we've got it -- you know, I'm going to represent each of you individually in individual arbitrations and I'm going to win the first one, and then the others are going to fall into place and they'll get a settlement from American Express that's going to be -- satisfy their concerns.",
  "Okay. And you have no problem with that.",
  "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just a follow-up one, briefly. Is the -- is there collateral estoppel effect in the arbitration that would be applied to subsequent --",
  "Okay.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement?",
  "It's a little much to expect them to come back and say, oh no, no, no, you don't have to prove all this. The only thing you've got to prove is it's going to cost you $25,000. That's an odd position to put them in.",
  "What is -- tell me how the no -- no sharing of information and confidentiality, how does that work again? You can't, if you're a trade association, get together and say, I think we should have a study of Amex's whatever. And then you put together the study, and then one of your members says -- you know, that's a good study, I'm going to go -- go to arbitration. They can't do that?",
  "Well, what if you do -- I mean, what if you do it, is that just part of your trade associations, they think this is -- you know, they're not talking about particular arbitration or anything. They just prepare a -- a report, and then once you see the report, you say, my gosh, I had no idea, and then you file your claim for arbitration.",
  "It seems to me my point is simply that there's no sharing, confidence, it seems like an awfully amorphous provision that would be very difficult to enforce.",
  "We'll afford you some rebuttal time. Mr. Stewart? Oh, no, we won't.",
  "Just being generous this morning. Mr. Stewart?",
  "Which is correct?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kellogg, you have rebuttal time, 6 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-96, Shelby County v. Holder. Mr. Rein?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Our questions have intruded on your rebuttal time, so we'll give you the 5 minutes and a commensurate increase in the General's time. General Verrilli?",
  "Can I ask you just a little bit about that record? Do you know how many submissions there were for preclearance to the Attorney General in 2005?",
  "3700. Do you know how many objections the Attorney General lodged?",
  "One, so one out of 3700.",
  "Just to get the -- do you know which State has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to African American voter turnout?",
  "Massachusetts. Do you know what has the best, where African American turnout actually exceeds white turnout? Mississippi.",
  "Which State has the greatest disparity in registration between white and African American?",
  "Massachusetts. Third is Mississippi, where again the African American registration rate is higher than the white registration rate.",
  "Justice Alito.",
  "General, is it -- is it the government's submission that the citizens in the South are more racist than citizens in the North?",
  "Well, which you said it is not, and you don't know the answer to it.",
  "A need to do what?",
  "And not -- and not impose it on everyone else?",
  "I don't -- I don't understand the distinction between facial and as-applied when you are talking about a formula. As applied to Shelby County, they are covered because of the formula, so they're challenging the formula as applied to them. And we've heard some discussion. I'm not even sure what your position is on the formula. Is the formula congruent and proportional today, or do you have this reverse engineering argument?",
  "To -- to the problem or -- or was the formula congruent and proportional to the remedy?",
  "Well -- I'm sorry.",
  "You have an extra 5 minutes.",
  "Thank you, General.",
  "Mr. Adegbile?",
  "Do you agree with the reverse engineering argument that the United States has made today?",
  "I guess -- I guess the question is whether or not that disparity is sufficient to justify the differential treatment under Section 5. Once you take away the formula, if you think it has to be reverse engineered and -- and not simply justified on its own, then it seems to me you have a much harder test to justify the differential treatment under Section 5.",
  "Well, we also said congruent and proportional.",
  "Well, the Fifteenth Amendment is limited to intentional discrimination, and, of course, the preclearance requirement is not so limited, right?",
  "Have there been episodes, egregious episodes of the kind you are talking about in States that are not covered?",
  "Well, then it doesn't seem to help you make the point that the differential between covered and noncovered continues to be justified.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rein, 5 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in case 11-1518, Bullock v. Bank Champaign. Mr. Byrne?",
  "Well, I mean, it's often the case that -- that children don't want to go into the family business and it's often the case that some of them do and some of them don't and the idea that one of the children who wants to put the money back in the family business is -- you know, you wouldn't think that was wrong when the other children want to take the money out or put it somewhere else. That's not at all unusual.",
  "But there is a shortage of accounts at the end of the day. It's just a question of what day it is. When he takes -- takes the stuff and it's a lost -- it's either viewed as a lost opportunity or an increase in the risk to the beneficiary, and that's a loss to them at that point. The fact -- it's like a bank robber giving back the money. There is no loss to the bank, but it's still a crime.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bensinger?",
  "So if he made nothing on the deal, and it just turns out he got whatever the -- the trust was getting under its interest rate and gave it back, there'd be no defalcation because there'd be no loss in the sense of a lost opportunity?",
  "I'm sorry. I understood your answer to Justice Kagan to be that you -- there must be a loss, right?",
  "Right. Does there have to be a loss for there to be a defalcation?",
  "So taking the money out is sufficient for defalcation even if it's brought back in full and even if there is no lost opportunity.",
  "But there is still a loss. I mean, when you're investing obviously the return is part of it, but also the question is what risk you assume. And the trust would have suffered because during that period they were incurring a greater risk. That's one reason you set up a trust, so you don't -- you protect people from that risk.",
  "Mr. Gannon?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Byrne, you have five minutes left.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-71, Arizona v. the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona. General Horne.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, you may.",
  "Ms. Millett?",
  "Ms. Millett, is there -- I take it under your theory what the EAC allowed Louisiana to do was wrong.",
  "Yes, I know. I'm assuming that, and I'm saying they were wrong.",
  "You've got a great deal of reliance on what the EAC has done, and I'm saying if it's not doing a very good job, I'd be -- I'd question whether or not the fact that the EAC is going to implement it is sufficient assurance that the Act reads the way you say it does.",
  "It's not just different forms. You'd have different voter rolls then, right, depending on which form?",
  "No?",
  "I would have thought since you allow -- contemplate a State form that has different requirements than the Federal form, you would then end up with two different voter rolls.",
  "Some people that registered under the State form, some people that registered under the Federal form.",
  "Yes, but it doesn't work the other way.",
  "You can satisfy the Federal form, so you're on the Federal list, but not satisfy the State form, so you're not on the State list.",
  "Please.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan?",
  "As -- as Louisiana has done.",
  "But it's certainly things that were not required on the Federal form.",
  "How is that consistent with the statutory purpose to streamline registration?",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Horne, two minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 12-142, Mutual Pharmaceutical Company v. Bartlett. Mr. Lefkowitz.",
  "One of our cases --",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang?",
  "Well, but it's a little different. Our cases are focused on the concern that the State is going to impose on the manufacturer a different duty than the Federal government. That's not what's going on in a strict liability regime. They're saying, we're not saying you should have a different structure, we're not saying anything about warning, we're saying if you do this, you're going to have to pay for the damage. It's not -- it's not a different duty. And I think that's what's underlying the argument that, well, you can just stop selling because you don't have to adjust how you're going to make the drug. You understand that it's going to be the same as the Federal drug, but our system is, you pay for the damage.",
  "But is that meeting a standard under State law that your friend's argument says, that's not what we're talking about here. The standard is the same. It's just a question under strict liability that if you follow the same Federal standard and market this in our State, you're going to pay the compensation for the reason of -- you know, spreading the costs. We don't want you to do something different. We just want to say that you want to do the same thing as the Federal government, and then you're going to have to pay. It's different than the -- at least that's how I understand their argument, which is that it's different where the situation says, yes, you can market it and avoid payment, but only if you do it our way. That's a different duty for the manufacturer.",
  "Briefly.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick?",
  "I'm not so sure -- I'm not so sure it works that way because of the jury point. They didn't say that yes, you can market this drug, it benefits -- you know, 99.9 percent of the people, but there is that 0.1 percent, and you're going to have to compensate that person. They said the risks outweigh the benefits, period. So you should not market this at all. And it does seem inconsistent with the -- the Federal regime.",
  "Well, what do you in that case? You've got one jury saying the risks outweigh the benefits, can't do it. And then you're saying well, later, there might be another jury saying yes, you can.",
  "So you are saying there is a huge difference between saying you didn't put the warning in, so you are liable for $9 million, and saying, you are liable for $15 million, but if you put the warning in, you are only liable for 9 million?",
  "But -- but just to get back to my -- to my question. You say there is a difference between saying, you have to put on warning and you are going to be liable if you don't, and saying, you are liable no matter no matter what because it's strict liability, but if you put on a warning it's reduced. If you are a drug manufacturer, you are supposed to see a difference in those two situations?",
  "Well, just -- I'm sorry to interrupt you. But your friend on the other side, of course, says PLIVA involves strict liability as well. So it did not say you must change the label.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lefkowitz, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-236, Sebelius v. Cloer. Mr. Horwich.",
  "I just want to make sure I heard you right. You said if it sounds jurisdictional, we should say it is, and you win.",
  "But your conclusion is that it is not jurisdictional.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fishman?",
  "So if -- if you're preparing one of these filings, and you're all set to go, and on the day before your filing you say, oh, gosh, it doesn't look like we're going to be on time. You should still go ahead and file because you might be able to apply for attorneys' fees. While if you file it the day that it's due and you find out the day after, oh, my gosh, we weren't on time, then there's no question that you could apply for attorneys' fees.",
  "My hypothetical was not that you had two days and you made it in time, but that before the -- the time -- after the time expired or you were ready to file on time, but then you decided on further research, oh, this isn't going to look like we're going to comply. We thought we had the time, but we don't. You should still go ahead and file, right, so that you might be able to get the fees?",
  "Well, that's a tough position, isn't it? I mean, if you have got a difficult and tough and complicated case, well, you get no fees; but if you've got an easy one, well, then you get fees.",
  "I thought you were -- I thought you were giving us that argument when you said under the fees all you need is reasonable and good faith.",
  "So is one reason that should affect the exercise of discretion is that you didn't comply with the statute of limitations?",
  "Is the -- what's the relationship between your position and equitable tolling? I mean, your case, I think, is unusual in that there was a fair amount of confusion about when the statute of limitations might run or that's your position. I would think a lot of the cases where the attorney doesn't meet the limitations deadline will involve things like -- you know, I was delayed by Hurricane Sandy or -- or whatever, or we tried to file, and it got lost in the mail. Are those things that -- I mean, should that be considered under the rubric of equitable tolling, or under -- under your idea that you don't have to file on time anyway?",
  "I understand that, but I would assume the more typical case is when you miss a filing deadline is because the lawyer, whether for good reasons or bad, missed the filing deadline. And I'm just curious if you would -- if it's not sufficient to support equitable tolling, whether it is, therefore, unreasonable when it comes to attorneys' fees?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-123, Horne v. Department of Agriculture. Mr. McConnell? ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL",
  "Thank you, Mr. McConnell. Mr. Palmore?",
  "When did you first raise the argument that it was jurisdictional?",
  "And now you are -- now you are changing back again and saying it's not?",
  "You relied on that when you got to rehearing. You didn't rely on that before you went before the Ninth Circuit, right?",
  "I have to say -- I think it comes with less than good grace for you to criticize the other side for not having raised a particular argument. But I do want to clarify that you have no objection at this point for reversing the Ninth Circuit on the ground that they erred in saying that this -- they should have dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Palmore. Mr. McConnell, you have 3 minutes remaining. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will have argument next in Case 12-52, Dan's City Used Cars v. Pelkey. Mr. Bouffard?",
  "Let's say you park your tow trucks on somebody else's parking lot, and you don't pay the rent. So they sell your tow truck. Is your claim against your landlord preempted?",
  "How does -- so if your tow truck is involved in an accident, is that -- and a suit is filed for negligence. Is that preempted?",
  "I'm just looking at the statutory language. It says -- you know, \"related to a service of a motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property,\" and you know, your motor -- your truck is involved in transporting property. That's the claim against you, that you don't -- you don't render good service because you're negligent in a -- and it just seems to me to fit within the terms of the statute, if you adopt as broad a reading as you adopt.",
  "Yes. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shaughnessy?",
  "But it seems to me that you can't ignore the fact that part of what tow trucks do is store things. I mean, it's a necessary and integral part of the motor service, the transportation of property, that they do. And regulation of the storage will affect the services that they provide.",
  "It's not just like -- it's not just like storing anything else.",
  "Well, it isn't too -- I mean, this is a provision of course in the Federal Aviation Administration Act. Whatever rule we adopt is going to apply to air transportation as well. And is your position, for example, that things related to a hangar at an airport, that those are not covered by this at all? It seems to me that there the connection between the transportation and the storage, the storage of the airplane, you can see a little bit more clearly how that would affect what the airplane -- you know, can do. A lien -- you can't take the airplane out of the hangar because you didn't pay the rent or whatever.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yelin, welcome.",
  "Well, it's -- I asked your friend on the other side the question. Storage is part of what tow trucks do. Maybe in a way that -- you know, cross-country trucks don't. And it seems to me if you have a local jurisdiction who figures out, well, this is a great way to make a lot of money or -- you know, to give -- or the other way -- you know, you can charge -- charge a lot because we want to keep subsidized tow trucks. I mean, why isn't that fairly directly related to the service they provide?",
  "Well, but I mean, maybe these, but you can easily imagine that these types of laws would be subject to abuse and would have an adverse impact on the towing company and, therefore, on the transportation of property.",
  "Well, now we only -- now we not only have to decide whether this type of law is related to it, but once we say some of those laws might be and some won't be, depending upon the impact in a particular case.",
  "Every law doesn't have to be considered in its application. If you say you can't speak out on the sidewalk, it doesn't matter what they apply it, you can consider that law absolutely.",
  "Well, why doesn't this one really whack them, though? It's treble damages and all that. You can answer my question, yes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bouffard, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Please.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-135, Oxford Health Plans v. Florida. Mr. Waxman?",
  "Finish your answer.",
  "Yes, but it's not exactly -- this is not the only clause that provides for arbitration. It is not the standard boilerplate so you could say when he interprets it, he's really making a decision about arbitrability. And you can follow -- I mean, you may disagree with it, I may disagree with it -- but you understand the reasoning. It says, no civil action be brought, all such disputes will go to arbitration, this is a class action, this is a civil action, so it must go to arbitration, and therefore, it's there. Now, you -- you may not agree with it, but it -- it at least purports to be an interpretation of the language rather than a general rule.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katz?",
  "I think that's inconsistent with the law that's developed -- actually in fairness to the arbitrator, after he'd made his initial decision, which is that if you have something that just says disputes and doesn't address the issue of class arbitration at all, that you can't have class arbitration.",
  "Could you get back -- I'm sorry, go ahead.",
  "Getting back to Justice Breyer's question, I thought his -- First Options is fairly strong authority for him because there you have a situation with the arbitrator determining that a particular entity or individual is bound by the agreement. And we said that's something that we will review de novo, without deference. Why isn't it the same here? In other words, not everything an arbitrator says is subject to the deferential standard of review, even if he purports to say I'm interpreting the agreement, which I think the arbitrator in First Options did?",
  "But the difference is in First Options. The one thing First Options says is the question of who's going to be bound by arbitration is decided by the court de novo. And in the class context, you are binding 19,999 individuals who did not agree to be bound, depending upon the particular interpretation.",
  "And this may not -- I'm not sure it's relevant, but it -- it might be. I thought the purpose of arbitration was to decide these things quickly. This has been going on 11 years, right?",
  "It's not -- it's not a facetious question because I think one of the concerns about class arbitration is that it -- it eliminates the supposed benefits of arbitration because you can't have sort of quick and rough and ready determinations when it's going to bind 20,000 people.",
  "Well, but surely --",
  "I'm sorry. Finish your answer.",
  "But under -- under -- that provision, the partiality provision, is addressed to favoring one party as opposed to another party. I think Justice Kennedy's question goes to an institutional concern about an arbitrator making a decision of this sort that goes, not to -- not to partiality between parties, but a problem about the way the system would work, that would create an incentive for an arbitrator, implicit or explicit, to reach a ruling that expands his authority.",
  "I'm sorry to just interrupt. For most of that two centuries, courts refused to enforce arbitration agreements. That's the whole reason we have the FAA.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Katz. Mr. Waxman, you have 2 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 12-416, the Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis. Mr. Stewart.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Weinberger?",
  "Yes, certainly.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Stewart, you have five minutes remaining.",
  "Well, I thought Mr. Weinberger's point was that this is always going to happen because it's very easy -- as he said, you put a sign on your neck saying, generics line up to get your payment. That seems quite different than saying there's another firm out there in the abstract that -- that might want to enter into a similar market sharing arrangement. This is a very different system.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 12-144, Hollingsworth v. Perry. Mr. Cooper?",
  "Mr. Cooper, we have jurisdictional and merits issues here. Maybe it'd be best if you could begin with the standing issue.",
  "Well, that would be -- I'm sorry, are you finished?",
  "Okay. That -- that may be true in terms of who they want to represent, but -- but a State can't authorize anyone to proceed in Federal court because that would leave the definition under Article III of the Federal Constitution as to who can bring -- who has standing to bring claims up to each State. And I don't think we've ever allowed anything like that.",
  "Counsel, if you want to proceed to the merits, you should feel free to do so.",
  "Mr. Cooper, we will afford you more time. You shouldn't worry about losing your rebuttal time, but please continue on.",
  "I'm sorry, maybe you can finish your answer to Justice Kagan.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cooper.",
  "Mr. Olson?",
  "Mr. Olson, I cut off your friend before he could get into the merits. So I think it's only fair --",
  "I know --",
  "Well, I think it's only fair to treat you the same. Perhaps you could address your jurisdictional argument?",
  "I suppose there might be people out there with their own personal standing, someone who performs marriages and would like that to remain open to everyone but would prefer not to perform same-sex marriages, or other people. We seem to be addressing the case as if the only options are the proponents here or the State. I'm not sure there aren't other people out there with individual personalized injury that would satisfy Article III.",
  "You should feel free to move on to the merits.",
  "I'm not sure, counsel, that it makes -- I'm not sure that it's right to view this as excluding a particular group. When the institution of marriage developed historically, people didn't get around and say let's have this institution, but let's keep out homosexuals. The institution developed to serve purposes that, by their nature, didn't include homosexual couples. It is -- yes, you can say that it serves some of the other interests where it makes sense to include them, but not all the interests. And it seems to me, your friend argues on the other side, if you have an institution that pursues additional interests, you don't have to include everybody just because some other aspects of it can be applied to them.",
  "Oh, that's only because Proposition 8 came 140 days after the California Supreme Court issued its decision.",
  "And don't you think it's more reasonable to view it as a change by the California Supreme Court of this institution that's been around since time immemorial?",
  "So -- so your case -- your case would be different if Proposition 8 was enacted into law prior to the California Supreme Court decision?",
  "So it's just about -- it's just about the label in this case.",
  "Same-sex couples have every other right, it's just about the label.",
  "Sure. If you tell -- if you tell a child that somebody has to be their friend, I suppose you can force the child to say, this is my friend, but it changes the definition of what it means to be a friend. And that's it seems to me what the -- what supporters of Proposition 8 are saying here. You're -- all you're interested in is the label and you insist on changing the definition of the label.",
  "How do we know -- how do we know that that's the reason, or a necessary part of the reason, that we've recognized marriage as a fundamental right? That's -- you've emphasized that and you've said, well, it's because of the emotional commitment. Maybe it is the procreative aspect that makes it a fundamental right.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli?",
  "You don't think you're going to get away with not starting with the jurisdictional question, do you?",
  "Justice Breyer.",
  "I don't want to -- I want you to get back to Justice Alito's other points, but is it the position of the United States that same-sex marriage is not required throughout the country?",
  "Well, you can go on.",
  "But you are willing to wait in the rest of the country. You saying it's got to happen right now in California, but you don't even have a position about whether it's required in the rest of the country.",
  "So it's got to happen right away in those States where same-sex couples have every legal right that married couples do.",
  "But you can wait in States where they have fewer legal rights.",
  "Can I ask you a problem about --",
  "-- I -- it seems to me that your position that you are supporting is somewhat internally inconsistent. We see the argument made that there is no problem with extending marriage to same-sex couples because children raised by same-sex couples are doing just fine and there is no evidence that they are being harmed. And the other argument is Proposition 8 harms children by not allowing same-sex couples to marriage. Which is it?",
  "But you also tell me there has been no harm shown to children of same-sex couples.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Cooper, to keep things fair, I think you have 10 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument this morning in Case 12-307, United States v. Windsor, and we will begin with the jurisdictional discussion. Ms. Jackson?",
  "Well, I would have thought --",
  "I would have thought your answer would be that the Executive's obligation to execute the law includes the obligation to execute the law consistent with the Constitution. And if he has made a determination that executing the law by enforcing the terms is unconstitutional, I don't see why he doesn't have the courage of his convictions and execute not only the statute, but do it consistent with his view of the Constitution, rather than saying, oh, we'll wait till the Supreme Court tells us we have no choice.",
  "You can finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. That was more than a sentence.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan?",
  "On the first one, is there any case where all the parties agreed with the decision below and we upheld appellate jurisdiction? Any case?",
  "All the parties agreed with the decision below and we nonetheless upheld appellate jurisdiction.",
  "No, it wasn't raised -- it wasn't raised or addressed, and that had the distinct situation of an appeal, direct appeal from an Article I tribunal.",
  "Okay. So putting Lovett aside, since none of this was discussed, is there any -- any case?",
  "So this is totally unprecedented. You're asking us to do something we have never done before to reach the issue in this case.",
  "No, it's not just -­ it's not unusual. It's totally unprecedented.",
  "Sometimes you do and sometimes you don't. What is the test for when you think your obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed means you'll follow your view about whether it's constitutional or not or you won't follow your view?",
  "So you say we shouldn't be concerned about that part of Chadha because the issue wasn't joined there?",
  "But we should take Lovett as a binding precedent even though the issue wasn't addressed at all?",
  "You can finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement?",
  "What if you -- what if you disagree with -- the executive is defending one of your laws, if that's the way you insist on viewing it, and you don't like their arguments, you say, they are not making the best argument. Is that a situation in which you have standing to intervene to defend the law in a different way than the executive is?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Jackson, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Sure.",
  "Ms. Jackson, before you sit down, I would like to note that you briefed and argued this case as amicus curiae at the invitation of the Court, and you have ably discharged the responsibility, for which you have the gratitude of the Court.",
  "Thank you. We'll now take a very short break and turn to the merits. (Recess.)",
  "I meant that we would take a break, not that -- we will continue argument in the case on the merits. Mr. Clement?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Clement. General Verrilli?",
  "I suppose your -- you agree that Congress could go the other way, right? Congress could pass a new law today that says, we will give Federal benefits. When we say \"marriage\" in Federal law, we mean same -- committed same-sex couples as well, and that could apply across the board? Or do you think that they couldn't do that?",
  "Well, no, my point is it wouldn't -- you don't think it would raise a federalism problem either, do you?",
  "Okay.",
  "So just to be clear, you don't think there is a federalism problem with what Congress has done in DOMA?",
  "Oh, so it would be central to the inquiry if Congress went the other way, too?",
  "I understand that. That's your equal protection argument. It's not very responsive to my concern that I'm trying to get an answer to. You don't think federalism concerns come into play at all in this, right?",
  "I know the equal protection argument would be different.",
  "So as soon as one State adopted same sex marriage, the definition of marriage throughout the Federal code had to change? Because there is no doubt that up until that point every time Congress said \"marriage\" they understood they were acting under the traditional definition of marriage.",
  "So you don't think that when Congress said \"marriage\" in every one of these provisions that they had in mind same-sex marriages?",
  "So that was the view of the 84 Senators who voted in favor of it and the President who signed it? They were motivated by animus?",
  "Thank you, General. Ms. Kaplan?",
  "Could I ask you the same question I asked the Solicitor General? Do you think there would be a problem if Congress went the other way, the federalism problem? Obviously, you don't think there's an equal protection problem --",
  "-- but a federalism issue, Congress said, we're going to recognize same-sex couples -- committed same-sex couples -- even if the State doesn't, for purposes of Federal law?",
  "I just am asking whether you think Congress has the power to interfere with the -- to not adopt the State definition, if they're extending benefits. Do they have that authority?",
  "No, no. I know that. You're following the lead of the Solicitor General and returning to the Equal Protection Clause every time I ask a federalism question. Is there any problem under federalism principles?",
  "With Congress passing a law saying, we are going to adopt a different definition of marriage than those States that don't recognize same-sex marriage. We don't care whether you do as a matter of State law, when it comes to Federal benefits, same-sex marriage will be recognized.",
  "Is the --",
  "So 84 Senators -- it's the same question I asked before. 84 Senators based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people?",
  "Well, does that mean -- times can blind. Does that mean they did not base their votes on moral disapproval?",
  "I suppose the sea change has a lot to do with the political force and effectiveness of people representing, supporting your side of the case?",
  "You don't doubt that the lobby supporting the enactment of same sex-marriage laws in different States is politically powerful, do you?",
  "Really?",
  "As far as I can tell, political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case.",
  "Well, but you just referred to a sea change in people's understandings and values from 1996, when DOMA was enacted. And I'm just trying to see where that comes from, if not from the political effectiveness of -- of groups on your side of the case.",
  "I understand that. I am just trying to see how -- where that that moral understanding came from, if not the political effectiveness of a particular group.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Kaplan. Mr. Clement, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 12-167, United States v. Davila. Mr. Feigin? It is Feigin, right?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yablon?",
  "What -- what if you have the situation where the judge is conveying purely factual information? There's a -- a plea bargain on the table for one year and the judge says, you should know that I -- I have these cases a lot. The last ten cases that went to trial where the defendant was found guilty, I sentenced them to a minimum of 12 years. Pure facts. The facts might have the effect of pushing the defendant one way or another, but it's also factual information of which he ought to be aware.",
  "Well, we do need to have a good sense of how far your -- your per se structural argument is going to reach before we decide -- in deciding whether it's appropriate or not.",
  "What -- what about the hypothetical that I posed?",
  "So if he -- if it's my example and he says, this is what I've done the past ten times, so you ought to think long and hard about whether a bargain for one year is a good deal.",
  "It's kind of a fine line to -- to draw, isn't it?",
  "Now -- well, but you've answered a lot of these questions by saying, you know, it's hard to draw the line and, you know, maybe in that case, maybe in this case. Most -- our precedents where we recognize structural error and -- and plain error are ones that are pretty easily categorized. Did a magistrate conduct voir dire or did he not? You know right away one way or the other. Here did he participate enough? You know, well, if he told them how many times he sentenced people this way, it's not, but if he said you ought to -- you ought to pay attention to what I'm telling you when you'd consider whether to plea or not, well, then it is. It -- it seems to me in the typical plain error cases, we're very -- the categories are very sharply defined.",
  "I would say in both of those examples, the line -- the gray area, if you were, is really quite narrow than here, where almost every time you've been asked a question about a difficult hypothetical, you say, well, maybe, maybe not. And I think that's quite different than saying is the court closed or not or was the person -- you know, did he represent himself in fact or not. And those just strike me as much easier cases.",
  "Yes, but if you were -- if you were arguing whether or not it's -- it's categorical error when the magistrate conducts voir dire, it'd be pretty hard for somebody to come up with a tough hypothetical.",
  "How do we -- if we're giving this guidance, what do we say about the fact that he had a different judge subsequent to this, that he filed a speedy trial motion after this coercion, which suggests that he wasn't coerced all that much. Are we supposed to take all that into consideration, too?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin, 13 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-398, Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics. Mr. Hansen?",
  "Do you dispute that you can patent, however, a process for extracting naturally-occurring things?",
  "So isn't that -- why isn't that a way to, in effect, have patent protection for the product? Does somebody who wants to use the product, the DNA -- extracted DNA in this case, have to find a new process from -- to extract it if they want to have it available?",
  "Oh, no -- yes, I know. I'm assuming it isn't, that they discover this process and it leads to a -- a particular product. Does anybody who wants to use the product either have to get a license for the process or find a different way of extracting it?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "General Verrilli?",
  "But I -- I thought the basic general approach here was we have a very expansive view of what is patent eligible and then we narrow things through things -- issues like obviousness and so on. Why -- wouldn't it make more sense to address the questions at issue here in the obviousness realm?",
  "If you got something that's big, it seems to me pretty obvious that you could take a smaller part of it. That the idea -- a smaller part of something that's bigger is obvious. Now, yes, you can have a patent on the process of extracting that small part, but I don't understand how a small part of something bigger isn't obvious. And if it is, I don't understand why this -- these issues aren't addressed at that stage.",
  "I'm -- I'm not sure that's responsive to my concern. Your answer said well, here are a lot of reasons why this shouldn't have patent protection. My question goes to whether we ought to focus on those reasons at the eligibility stage or at the obviousness stage.",
  "Briefly, please.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Castanias?",
  "Can I --",
  "Can I get back to your baseball bat example?",
  "My understanding -- my understanding is that here, what's involved, obviously through scientific processes, but we're not talking about process. Here, what's involved is snipping. You've got the thing there and you snip -- snip off the top and you snip off the bottom and there you've got it. The baseball bat is quite different. You don't look at a tree and say, well, I've cut the branch here and cut it here and all of a sudden I've got a baseball bat. You have to invent it, if you will. You don't have to invent the particular segment of the -- of the strand, you just have to cut it off.",
  "Okay. You've got the cDNA.",
  "I'm sorry, I still don't understand what -- in what sense it's different than just snipping along -- along the line.",
  "Okay. So that's a particular -- where you snip. We're talking about though the patentability of what's left --",
  "-- after you've snipped it.",
  "I don't understand how this is at all like that because there you're obviously combining things and getting something new. Here you're just snipping, and you don't have anything new, you have something that is a part of something that has existed previous to your intervention.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hansen, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Why don't you take another minute. You weren't afforded an opportunity to use the time you were reserved.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 11-798, American Trucking Associations v. City of Los Angeles. Mr. Lerman?",
  "That matters -- that matters in your view whether it's a key component of commerce or not. If it's -- if it's a particular highway, a particular street, you think Castle doesn't apply in that case?",
  "Well, I think you have to get into it since I asked you a question about it.",
  "So they say there's this particular road, through a State park or something, that's scenic, and sometimes the trucks drive on the side of the road and it causes damage to what the State's trying to preserve. And they have a rule, look, if you do that three times and we warn you, the fourth time you can't use this road. That is preempted?",
  "There is another road not too far away. You've got to use that one.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash, welcome.",
  "Well, that's not true. I mean, a commercial enterprise might want to attract customers because of its reputation as a -- as a green company because of its reputation of hiring local workers. I think you have too confined a notion of what -- what's good business.",
  "Finish your answer.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosenthal?",
  "Well, but like a lot of criminal penalties, that's the whole point. They keep people from doing crimes. It doesn't seem to me to be very probative to say we've never had to throw anybody in jail or we never had to prosecute anybody criminally. They have a coercive effect that a private operator cannot avail itself of.",
  "Right. And I've heard of facial attacks to criminal statutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lerman, you have 4 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-399, Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl. Ms. Blatt?",
  "Could -- could I hear her answer, please?",
  "Is it your position that the preference is absolute or is it simply a factor to be considered with the other -- in other words, if every other factor suggests that the best interests of the child are served by placement with the adoptive couple, does the preference under 1915(a) trump all those other interests?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement?",
  "Finish the answer.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld?",
  "Do you think that's correct under the Act? Where in the Act does it say that you need to consider whether or not the father is a -- would be a good parent? I thought your reading was that it doesn't matter, all that matters is that he has in his case 3/128ths Cherokee blood.",
  "Could -- could I go back to what you just said about (f)? You think custody covers someone who has never had custody of the child because it refers to something beyond the accepted definition?",
  "But (f) doesn't say \"child custody proceeding.\" It says \"continued custody of the child.\"",
  "But not me, right?",
  "This is not -- (f) is not about terminating parental rights. It's about what -- I mean, it's about custody, right?",
  "In what proceeding, the adoption proceeding or custody determination?",
  "If -- if you had a tribe, is there at all a threshold before you can call, under the statute, a child an \"Indian child\"? 3/256ths? And what if the tribe -- what if you had a tribe with a zero percent blood requirement? They're open for, you know, people who want to apply, who think culturally they're a Cherokee or -- or any number of fundamentally accepted conversions.",
  "I mean, is it -- is -- would that child be considered an Indian child, so a father who had renounced any interest in her until he found out about the adoption would have all these rights?",
  "No, no. That's why I asked it. It's a different question.",
  "So return to what is a hypothetical question and not what the statute provides. Under your argument, a tribe that did not require any blood requirement, but simply enrollment, could be considered an Indian child.",
  "Yes, yes, you have somebody who has no Indian blood, he enrolls in my hypothetical tribe, has a biological child. That child would be an Indian child and the father would be entitled to the protections you're arguing for.",
  "Well --",
  "I'm just wondering is 3/256ths close -- close to zero? I mean, that's -- that's the question in terms to me, that if you have a definition, is it one drop of blood that triggers all these extraordinary rights?",
  "He was excited, but there is no doubt he paid nothing during the pregnancy and nothing at the time of the birth, right, to support the child or the mother?",
  "So he was excited by it, he just didn't want to take any responsibility.",
  "You have an extra -- you have an extra minute.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Kneedler?",
  "But he didn't want anything to do with the child if the mother had kept the child in her care. It was only when she wanted to put it up for adoption that he had developed this interest in the child.",
  "But what's -- is -- is -- are the would-be adoptive parents required to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs under (d)?",
  "So that it's a tribe -- if the tribe wants to defeat the adoption, all they have to do is do nothing with respect to the father's --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Ms. Blatt, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 12-246, Salinas v. Texas. Mr. Fisher.",
  "Well, he's not in custody. So let's say he's answering the questions. All of a sudden, he gets a particular question, and he says, you know, it's getting late, I think I'm done, and going to go home. Is that an invocation of the Fifth Amendment right?",
  "Well, is that something --",
  "Is that something that could be used against him at trial?",
  "Well, it's probative if that he says that -- he's answering all the questions, they're fine. All of a sudden, they say, well, is your shotgun going to match the shell?",
  "Then he goes, gosh, it's late, I'm going to go home. That seems as --",
  "That seems as probative as the silence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Curry.",
  "Particularly since he did want to talk some more, right?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-418, United States v. Kebodeaux. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Well, in Comstock, it was very different than the situation here because the analysis was that the Federal government basically was the source of the problem in incarcerating sex offenders away from the State so that no State felt an obligation to do something with the problem of their release. You don't have anything of that sort here.",
  "So your argument depends in no way on the fact that he was convicted of a Federal offense or -- or incarcerated for that offense, nothing at all? We're just here arguing about the retroactivity under -- whether they have the authority under Article I to impose punishment for not registering under State law?",
  "Yeah, but if they can do that. But that's not what they've done here. Your argument, as you told me a while ago, is linked to the Federal offense and the incarceration.",
  "It’s because the States were not doing anything about it.",
  "Here you have a situation where I think at the time every State dealt with the issue of whether the sex offenders should have to register or not.",
  "Your argument based -- your argument based on Congress's authority with respect to the military, your Article I argument, and you say it doesn't make a difference that he's no longer in the military, does that -- do you come out differently if the basis for jurisdiction is asserted to be inter -- interstate commerce?",
  "The fact that somebody at some time in their life traveled across State lines means that the Federal government can go back, even though their activity that's challenged in the particular instance is only intrastate, and still assert jurisdiction over them?",
  "I'm getting confused between two different assertions of a Federal interest. Earlier you talked about the integrity of the military forces. They go back later, they think they should address the fact that people were engaging in criminal activities when in the military, they weren't -- they weren't found out, they weren't prosecuted. Later on they can go back. But then you say that the interest that's at issue here is preventing recidivism, and that doesn't seem to have anything to do with the integrity of the military force.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Ms. Fuentes.",
  "Well, how -- I'm not sure that makes much sense. You're saying if they're relying on the enumerated power with respect to the military, they can do more than if they're relying on the enumerated power over interstate commerce?",
  "So in what sense --",
  "Well, in what sense does it then depend on which enumerated power they're invoking?",
  "They say -- they say it exists by virtue of the enumerated power to regulate the military forces.",
  "Well, I'm trying to see why you're saying the enumerated power under the Spending Clause allows them to take this subsequent action, but the enumerated power under the Military Clause does not.",
  "I would have thought that if you're arguing under the Necessary and Proper Clause, that you need an enumerated power that the Necessary and Proper Clause is going to serve. But I don't see how it makes a difference which enumerated power you're talking about.",
  "I get to ask the questions. You don't.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "And that's not limited. You've limited it to sex offenses, but the -- Congress could say it's important to us that people who serve in the military behave correctly even after they're released. So it is a Federal offense to do anything that violates State law for the rest of their lives, and your argument would say, well, that's part of their authority to regulate the military and so it's okay.",
  "So your answer to my question is yes, Congress can do that. It can say anyone in the military is subject for the rest of their life to Federal jurisdiction. Whatever is a State law crime is a Federal crime.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, counsel, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1221, Hillman v. Maretta. Mr. Ruttenberg?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Johnson.",
  "Of course, if the ex-wife were in bankruptcy proceedings this money would not necessarily go to her, right? It would go to the bankruptcy estate?",
  "So -- so why is the State law any different --",
  "-- with respect to divorces?",
  "He'd have to be dead by the time the issue comes up.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Goldenberg.",
  "Well, how far -- how far does that go? Obviously, the benefit becomes the property of the named beneficiary, but it's not like to her enjoyment. She may want to spend it on something, but it's going to be -- have to go through bankruptcy, it's going to have to go through other claims like any other property under State law.",
  "Well, but I mean, we do get these cases over and over again. I mean, it is the sort of thing that -- it may be very easy to do, but it is the sort of thing that people often overlook.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ruttenberg, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 12-10, Agency for International Development v. The Alliance for Open Society International. Mr. Srinivasan.",
  "Well, but I guess the problem is that there are a number of different ways you could carry out the program. And let's say you have an organization that focuses on a particular -- you know, the administration of hospitals or whatever it is that's covered by the program, and they regard this issue as collateral to what they're concerned with. There -- there have to be some limitations on what type of loyalty oath you can require them to sign, isn't there?",
  "Well, what if they --",
  "I appreciate that. What if they're not? What if the government has, in addition to this policy, a strong policy in promoting -- you know, recycling, and so they require everybody with whom they're going to do business, every grantee, to adopt a policy in favor of using renewable resources? Any problem with that?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bowker?",
  "I don't see why this is a -- you talk about banning their speech. The government is just picking out who is an appropriate partner to -- to assist in this project. It wants to go and find people who, like them, are opposed to prostitution, and all they want to do is make sure that you're opposed to prostitution. It's like any other sort of condition -- you know, we want to make sure that you haven't been convicted of tax fraud over the last 10 years, so sign a certification that you -- you haven't. Yes, it's related to speech, but the whole program is about that. Why would they want to sign up with somebody who didn't share the objectives of the program?",
  "So it would be a different case, in your -- your view, as if -- when they have those criteria, they have one of them is, oh, by the way, you must agree with the objective of the program, which is to eliminate, to the extent possible, prostitution and sex trafficking?",
  "So let's just say the government wants to have an ad campaign to discourage people from smoking and they are looking for ad agencies to -- to help them with it. And an ad agency comes in and says, look, we are the best ad agency there is; we know exactly how to get to the markets; we know what's persuasive and all of that. And yet -- and then the ad agency says -- you know, come work at our agency if you smoke; we think smoking is okay; we have smoking breaks; we do all this. The government can't take that into account?",
  "Well, isn't that part of what's going on here? One of the things we want to do is eradicate prostitution and sex trafficking, and we want you to get that message out, and the one thing we're sure of is if you're not in -- if you're in favor -- or you're not opposed to it because you have other objectives, you're not going to help get the message out at all?",
  "But that is saying this is what's happening in Rust, okay? And Rust is okay. That's very different from saying, it has to be that way, and, if it's any other way, it's no good. It seems to me that you're just taking the limitation on the facts in Rust and saying that is an absolute requirement, which is a misreading of the case.",
  "You can always choose me, too.",
  "Your approach, it seems to me, is just dealing with the breadth of the program. If the program here solely concerned prostitution and sex trafficking and not other areas where you say, look, we do a great job in these other areas, we just don't get involved in that area. But, if the sole program was on prostitution and sex trafficking, you -- you wouldn't have a leg to stand on, would you?",
  "So you're an organization --",
  "I just want to make sure I -- the government has a program to develop water resources, and let's say it's in South Africa before the abolition of apartheid. And there's a pro-apartheid group and an anti-apartheid group. And you're saying the government can only decide which one is better at digging wells, and it can't say, we're going to prefer the anti-apartheid group?",
  "Viewpoint on apartheid. It can't say -- so the other one shows we've got a better record, we dig the wells quicker.",
  "It goes to the effectiveness of the program. It's related to it. The United States doesn't want the company or the organization that goes into a village and says, we're going to bring – you know, this is from the United States, we're bringing you fresh water, and it's a -- it's a pro-apartheid group. That does undermine what they are trying to do, just as in this case, to have the organization providing the services that your organization provides be identified as as an organization that doesn't want to abolish prostitution.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan –",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next this morning in Case 11-889, Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann. Mr. Rothfeld?",
  "How does -- how does Oklahoma apply its law in this situation? I assume there is normal priorities and they will get applications from a lot of people. But they have to -- what do they have to give Texas? Up to 25 percent? I mean, they can't just say -- deny it because another Oklahoma user has priority, or all this. How does that fit in with the existing administrative structure?",
  "But it's got to give Texas at least up to its 25 percent, right?",
  "I guess what I'm asking is, does the Compact give Texas special priority apart from what Oklahoma -- Oklahoma's priorities would be?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Connell.",
  "Well, where, if you're relying on the Compact and its language, where do you come up with this idea that States first have to try to get their 25 percent from water within their borders? I don't see that anywhere.",
  "Well, it seems to me that you like some provisions of State law, but not others.",
  "What do you do -- what do you do with a situation -- let's say there's Oklahoma water available to Tarrant that is closer than the water they would get from somewhere else in Texas. Do they have to incur the additional expense to get Texas water, or can they take the cheaper route and get Oklahoma water?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt?",
  "Are they licensed?",
  "Anywhere close to of the 25 percent they claim entitlement to?",
  "I was hoping you did.",
  "I'm talking about Subbasin 5.",
  "Texans.",
  "Well, it never -- it never says that. I mean, that's why we have a case. It never says it has to be from your State. And I appreciate your -- the focus in your argument on State sovereignty, but this is an interstate Compact. And the whole point of interstate compacts is that we have to -- each State has to give up a little here or a little there to solve a problem. So I -- I guess it's -- I don't know why these basic principles of State sovereignty apply in the context of an interstate compact.",
  "You feel a lot of what?",
  "Oh.",
  "You are representing Oklahoma.",
  "But that's the same problem. Even if you take within State, all of these people, if they were applying for water in Texas as well, there'd be the same issue there. One of them would beat the other one. It's a question of priority. You're just claiming that everybody from Oklahoma should have -- well, not absolute priority, but - -",
  "Well, I thought that was what your -- the other side does envision, that it doesn't -- it's not bound by the borders, but it's bound by the agreement, the Compact. Compacts compromise the individual State sovereignty. That's the whole point of them.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning first in Case 12-357, Sekhar v. United States. Mr. Clement?",
  "Why isn't that -- you focused on transferability when you began. Why isn't that completely transferable? I have leverage against this official and if you want him to recommend yes on your investment, you have to pay me a certain amount of money. And you can transfer that. You've got everybody in, say, you know, the association or whatever and you can auction that off. It seems to me it's perfectly transferable from the defendant to anyone else.",
  "Well, but the lawyer's going to make recommendations in many other cases as well. And if you have an application coming up and you want a favorable recommendation, you can go to the -- the individual that has the leverage and say, I will pay you this much money if you can get the person to give me a favorable recommendation. And that's transferable from the person with the -- the leverage to -- to someone else.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington.",
  "You -- you point out, of course, that it was based on the New York law, but what do you do with the point that they did not carry forward the separate crime of coercion, which was in the New York law but not in the Hobbs Act?",
  "What do you do with the fact that the State authorities did charge it under coercion?",
  "It seems to me you could characterize the right to work as more of a liberty interest than a property interest.",
  "So you draw a distinction between extorting someone not to go to work and extorting him how to do his job once he's at work?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, 5 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "Our last case of the year is 12-484, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar. Mr. Joseffer?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lauten.",
  "Over -- over a powerful dissent.",
  "But it would have been so easy. There -- it's -- it's a set, race, color, religion, sex or national origin. And why would they leave it out?",
  "Why would they leave \"or in violation of Section 2000e-3(a)\"?",
  "I know your argument is, well, look, the Court's already said, well, that's -- that's included, but they've got two provisions fairly close to each other, and I don't know, if they're running through the usual list, why they wouldn't have just run through a list as it appeared in (g)(2)(A).",
  "All right. Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Sherry.",
  "Where are they -- where are they going to be weeded out? On summary judgment or on -- after trial?",
  "Just before you do that --",
  "-- because I understood we are talking about what possible reason there could be for drawing this distinction. It seems to me that the protection against discrimination -- race, color, religion, sex -- that sets forth the basic principle of -- of fair and equal treatment. The anti-retaliation provision is more functional. The way you protect against that discrimination is you make sure people don't retaliate when they complain about it. Now, that seems, to me, to be an order of -- of hierarchy removed from the basic principle. So, perhaps, you would have a different standard of causation when you deal with that.",

  "Could you -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "Well, but the Lynch -- the Lynch case was 2 years before the Michigan legislature adopted --",

  "And that's where you are putting -- not all of your eggs, most of your eggs, right?",
  "Well, that's the -- that's the whole case. The whole -- the whole point is that the law made that moot because the law under Michigan did not specify diminished capacity, and it's a code State, so you only get what they specified. I --",
  "Well, but you'll at least -- well, maybe not. I mean, would -- would you acknowledge that the force of Lynch was arguably diminished by the fact that Michigan passed a statute that did not mention the diminished capacity defense 2 years after it?",
  "I'm talking about Lynch.",

  "So if ­­ if I'm trying to get a home loan and they ask you what assets you have and I list a couple of stocks, and, in fact, it's fraudulent, I don't own them, that's a covered transaction, that's a 10b­5 violation?",
  "The only element of fraud in there was by the bank itself. They're the only ones whose purchases or sales could be said to have been affected by the misrepresentation. And of course, they can't ­­",

  "But somebody else ­­ somebody else was, right?",
  "Not by the purchase or sale, right? They were affected, according to your theory, by the fact that, oh, they told us there were these stocks, but the actual purchases and sales, the fraud did not go to the purchase and sales of the covered securities; they went to the CDs.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Goldenberg.",
  "Well ­­ but nobody is suggesting that the SEC can't take action with respect to the noncovered securities. So to the extent there's diminished confidence in the securities markets, the SEC has all the tools available to address that. The question is the different one under SLUSA.",

  "The prior district court determined that he was. The Respondents alleged that he was an employee in their complaint. I presume, depending upon how we rule on the qualified immunity issue, the parties may want to revisit their positions on that question as the case goes go forward. And the district court in the first instance, I suppose, would be the one to decide whether they're allowed to revisit the issue in light of the change in his perception of the law or not.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Theobald.",
  "Well, we said the exact opposite in Wilkie in footnote 4. I mean, you can say it's only a footnote, but it is what we said.",
  "Well, your brother ­­",
  "­­ who just sat down, explained that the Seventh Circuit's ruling didn't consider the issue that you're ­­ you're talking about now.",
  "Was that the ­­ was that the first one or the second one?",
  "So you don't want ­­ you don't want to ­­ you don't want to give it up, which makes sense. I mean, you've got a client. It depends on what we do, right? I mean, depending on what our ruling is, it may be advantageous to you to argue, as you alleged in your complaint, that he's an employee.",
  "Well, just to get this clear, you asked for this ruling from the Seventh Circuit. And ­­ and you won based on a factual record that was no different then than it is now. You asked for this ruling based on these facts, you won, and now, you want to insulate that from any review. I mean, I think it'd ­­ it'd be a feather in your cap if you can pull it off. But it seems to me ­­",
  "It seems to me that, since you asked for the ruling on the merits and got it, we ought to be able to review it, to determine whether it's right or wrong. And to the extent there's a factual issue that would persist in the case, if it goes back on qualified immunity, you and the parties can reposition themselves on that. I mean, it is an issue that was apparently close enough for one district court to say, yes, the other district court, on looking at it again, to say no. The deck will be reshuffled depending on how we rule. And as I see you standing there, I don't see you willing to concede for ­­ for the future that he's not an employee.",
  "Well, then I assume ­­ if you're saying the qualified immunity ruling should not be reviewed because this person was not an employee, but instead covered by GERA, right? Is that what ­­",
  "Well, they didn't address GERA in the preclusion ruling, right? So presumably, they get another ­­ they get a chance on an interlocutory appeal. The whole thing is ­­ qualified immunity is supposed to protect them from trial. And if you say the GERA issue wasn't ­­ wasn't considered, even though the Seventh Circuit's ruling was sweeping and didn't distinguish, well, they should have a chance to assert qualified immunity under that ground, I would think.",
  "In the Seventh Circuit, even though they ­­ you had that reference to him being exempt, the Seventh Circuit basically said it didn't make a difference, right? Whether he was covered as ­­ as an employee or not covered or covered under GERA or anything else, under their analysis, it doesn't make a difference.",

I thought it was in your brief that you had said, look, the fact that it turns out to have been a very bad deal ­­ you know, the bargain was one year, and the sentence after guilty was 20 years, that, I take it, you say is not a corroborating factor.",
  "Right.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Newman?",
  "If I could move beyond the particular facts to some of the broader points that the Solicitor General has raised? If you don't have the requirement of at least some corroboration, then all you have in every case is a completely self­serving assertion, I wouldn't have pled guilty – if you know, if I had known this or I had known that. And everybody will raise that argument. Everybody raises ineffective assistance of counsel anyway, and they will just add onto it this plea assertion. I mean, shouldn't it be ­­ the Sixth Circuit really went out of its way saying there is no requirement of corroboration at all.",
  "So you think the Sixth Circuit was wrong in what you are characterizing as dicta? You think it was wrong to say that and that the other circuits which require something in addition, that that's the rule that we should adopt?",
  "Well, I thought ­­ maybe I'm misremembering, but the Sixth Circuit distanced it itself from the other circuits, didn't it?",
  "Now, you are telling me the circuits have always done this. So the Sixth Circuit at least thinks it's doing something different?",
  "Well, if there is always going to be objective evidence, that's like saying you don't have to have corroboration.",

  "Ms. Murphy, we haven't talked yet about the effect of the aggregate limits on the ability of donors to give the minimum amount to as many candidates as they want. The effect of the aggregate limits is to limit someone's contribution of the maximum amount to about nine candidates, right?",
  "Is there ­­ is there a way to eliminate that aspect while retaining some of the aggregate limits? In other words, is that a necessary consequence of any way you have aggregate limits? Or are there alternative ways of enforcing the aggregate limitation that don't have that consequence?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Burchfield. FOR SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL,",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "General Verrilli.",
  "That's because they can transfer the funds among themselves and to a particular candidate. Is ­­ is the possibility of prohibiting those transfers perhaps a way of protecting against that corruption appearance while, at the same time, allowing an individual to contribute to however many House candidates he wants to contribute to? I mean, the concern is you have somebody who is very interested, say, in environmental regulation, and very interested in gun control. The current system, the way the anti­aggregation system works, is he's got to choose. Is he going to express his belief in environmental regulation by donating to more than nine people there? Or is he going to choose the gun control issue?",
  "What ­­ what is the framework ­­ what is the framework for analyzing? I agree with you on the aggregation, but it has this consequence with respect to limiting how many candidates an individual can support within the limits that Congress has said don't present any danger of corruption. So what is the framework for analyzing that? Give you your argument with respect to the transfers and the appearance there, but it does have that other consequence on something we've recognized as a significant right. So ­­",
  "Sure.",
  "But the ­­ the consequence is ­­ just to get back to my prior question, the consequence is you are telling somebody who doesn't want to give 3.4 million, but wants to contribute to more than nine House candidates, just up to the maximum, which would be the $5,000 per the double cycle, you are telling him that he can't make that contribution, however modest, certainly within the limits Congress has said does not present the problem of corruption, to a tenth candidate. I appreciate the argument you are making about the 3­point­whatever million­dollar check and the need for the aggregate limits to address that. I understand that point. But what do you do with the flip side? I mean, you can't pretend that that is pursued with no First Amendment cost quite apart from the one that's there. It seems to me a very direct restriction on much smaller contributions that Congress said do not present a problem with corruption.",
  "No, but that wouldn't ­­ doesn't normally get you very far on the First Amendment. You could not have a rule that says the ­­ the Post or the New York Times can only endorse nine candidates ­­",
  "­­ because ­­ I mean, it's completely content neutral; you don't care who the tenth is, but that ­­ that limit would not be ­­",
  "Is there ­­ is there any way to prevent the concern you have about the 3­point­whatever­it­is million­dollar check without imposing the limit on the person who wants to support ten candidates, rather than one?",

  "What Judge Sentelle said in his opinion for the D.C. Circuit is that based ­­ agreeing with everything you've said, that means that the misstatement of basis might be obvious on the individual partner's returns. What's wrong with it might be obvious, but it still is made on those returns, and therefore, that doesn't fall as a partnership item.",
  "Mr. Stewart, if I could focus at a somewhat higher level of abstraction. I understand the general underlying thrust of your friend's position to be that overstatement of basis goes to ­­ you know, miscalculations. It was actually $20,000, you say it's $40,000, and that's where the penalty comes from. Well, this case is quite different. We are kind of wiping out the whole transaction, and then you're kind of artificially saying, well, if you wipe out the whole thing, when you come to basis it should be this and that. And ­­ and it's not sort of a fraud or misstatement with respect to the basis itself. It follows from a broad sham determination, and that sham determination is made at the partnership level, not the partner level.",
  "I understand that, but if you were telling people what happened here ­­ maybe you would ­­ I don't know that your first statement would be, they overstated their basis. I think you would say, they engaged in a completely sham transaction, which had ­­ which had some obvious, as the D.C. Circuit put it, some obvious consequences. But still, the ­­ the driving determination was that it was a sham transaction.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre.",
  "You say that ­­ you say that that's not true because individual partners may respond differently to the partnership determination with respect to basis.",
  "Some of them are going to put in something else, but somebody may put in zero for a number of the reasons that the IRS's counsel suggested.",
  "And now, I suspect that those will be only in rare circumstances, and I guess that's why the D.C. Circuit said, even though the result here may be obvious, it nonetheless depends on the outside basis determination.",
  "And I think what I understand your friend to be saying is it's not just that it's obvious, but it's ineluctable, and therefore, it doesn't depend on the outside partnership determinations. So does your case hinge on the perhaps unusual situations where you have one of these partners having a fit of conscience and decides to put down the real number or has some other adjustment to it?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart, you have five minutes left.",
  "Perhaps ­­",
  "Let me ­­ let me pose perhaps a less friendly question.",
  "What do you do with your friend's hypothetical? On the tax returns, you say, I gave a painting to a charity worth a million dollars. Andin fact, he did not. And he says, what you are doing is you are going to go in and say, That wasn't worth a million dollars; it was worth nothing, when, in fact, what you should be saying is, You didn't give the painting at all.",
  "Well ­­ but if you determine that the partnerships were shams, that's like saying that there were no partnerships.",
  "And if you say ­­ you know, I didn't really give the painting, that means that there wasn't any painting. It seems to me they're pretty closely parallel.",

  "It's a significant factor. And ­­ and the problem, the difference, all things don't lead to the same place. 1404 says to the district court, look at a hodge­podge of things, including the interest of justice, and ­­ and figure it out and ­­ you know, maybe they will give the contract some weight or maybe they won't, and if they do, it's not clear how you weigh the contract against the interest of justice. It gives a broad discretion. It says they may transfer. 1406 is an entirely different animal. It says you shall dismiss or ­­ or transfer. It's sort of a ­­ you know, you have the safety valve to transfer, and I don't know why you ­­ you so cavalierly dismiss, oh, it's in the contract, of course, but we've got more witnesses.",
  "Well, that couldn't have come as a surprise.",
  "No, but the reason for these clauses ­­ the enforceability of these clauses is critically important to a lot of modern commerce. If you ­­ I don't know what the details are here, but a lot of times your company ­­ and they are doing business now all across the country, and you say, I don't want to do business all across the country if I'm going to get dragged into different courts, who knows where, with different ­­ where the juries are different, I want to do business around the country, so long as, if I am going to be sued, it's right here. So I'm only going to do business with people who are willing to say, if I have a problem, I will sue you right here. That's ­­ that's critically important to modern ­­ modern commerce. And the idea, well, you're going to let a court say, well, but there are a few more witnesses here ­­ you know, it's convenient to them and all that, that ­­ that seems to be throwing a significant wrench into the process.",
  "Well, what facts are ­­ what facts are ­­ in the normal case, what facts are going to be pertinent? I mean, you've got the contract there. I mean, I suppose you can always say, we entered under duress and all that, but that wouldn't seem to me to be typical in the normal commercial case in which these provisions are critically important. What facts are going to be there?",
  "But what type ­­ what type of materiality?",
  "Well, the venue provision ­­ I mean, if they go to the trouble of putting a venue selection ­­ forum selection provision in, I would say it seems pretty material.",

  "Why is that any ­­ any different?",
  "So if there were a provision in the Michigan Constitution that says the board of regents is authorized to enact these programs, in other words delegated from the people in the Constitution to the board, and then the people change the delegation by saying, no, it's no longer ­­ we're no longer going to leave that up to the board, we're going to make the decision ourselves in the Constitution, how is that any different?",
  "So I mean, you could say that the whole point of something like the Equal Protection Clause is to take race off the table. Is it unreasonable for the State to say, look, race is a lightning rod. We've been told we can have affirmative action programs that do not take race into account. Socioeconomic diversity, elimination of alumni preferences, all of these things. It is very expensive. Whenever we have a racial classification, we're immediately sued. So why don't we say we want you to do everything you can without having racial preferences. Now, if the litigation determines that we're required to have racial preferences, this statute has an exception and ­­ and allows that.

  "Right.

If it ever turns into something that's going to be enforced, we won't enforce it, or it won't be enforceable without a judicial determination about equitable estoppel and all these other things that are very difficult to apply.",
  "Well, but there's no ­­ there's no employer who is going to have a plan put together and say, well, I'm not going to do this unless the statute of limitations for claims runs from the proof of loss. And if you tell me it's got to run from the exhaustion of remedies, I'm just not going to give a benefit plan. That's an implausible scenario.",
  "Well, it's hard to see what you mean by the exceeding rarity. I suspect there are more than nine cases where people are looking at the running of the statute of limitations and they're saying, well, I've got to sue if I don't get this and when do I have to hire a lawyer. And the last thing you want in this process is to get lawyers involved at the claim procedure. And they say, well, there's only 10 months left, I'd better hire a lawyer, you know, and instead of the informal resolution, you've suddenly got lawyers involved. Why isn't that a legitimate concern? On the other hand, if you wait until the claim is exhausted, you may ­­ you may not need the lawyer at all. But if you don't know when that period is going to run, you'd better get one early ­­ sooner rather than later.",

The typical lay person who's got a claim for $9,000 in disability benefits or whatever, you know, may not know. Better get a lawyer to tell her. It just seems to me that you keep it as an informal resolution ­­ inexpensive resolution process if you tell somebody look, you don't have to worry about getting a lawyer until we tell you whether we're going to deny your claims or not.",
  "Well, that's my point. I'm not talking about the need to go to litigation. I think there are probably more than 9 people who had to hire lawyers before they even had a decision.",
  "Well, and it's probably a claimant that doesn't have all that much experience with the legal system and doesn't know well how long does it take, you know, to get a complaint ready and ­­ I don't know. It just seems to me that the problem of a statute of limitations that runs before the claim even accrues requires people to worry about their legal rights in a way that ­­ the simple rule about when your benefits are denied, that's when the period starts running.",
  "Did I ­­",
  "Did I understand ­­ did I understand you earlier to say we have not had a case where we have overridden plan terms in ERISA plans?",
  "Well, simply ignore. I mean, is there any in which we have overridden plan terms?",
  "No.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "I'm sorry, you have 4 minutes left.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 12­464, Kaley v. United States. Mr. Srebnick.",
  "I thought your answer might have been that, yes, in fact, the property is entitled to greater protection because it's going to be used to hire counsel that will keep the person out of jail long term, even if he can be put in jail pending the trial.",
  "And I suppose, if the government knows it's got to go through a hearing where it has to lay out part of its case, it may well decide at that point it's not worth it, so it's not 24 or 25. Who knows how many hundreds of times the government would have sought to seize the assets, but didn't because they knew they would have to justify it at a hearing.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "But none of that goes to his ability to hire his counsel of choice. I mean, that seems to me to make this case quite different. It's not that property is more valuable than liberty or anything like that. It's that the property can be used to hire a lawyer who can keep him out of jail for the next 30 years, so the parallels don't strike me as useful.",
  "I understand the theory. In reality, it's not terribly ­­ it's not great insulation from the overweaning power of the government.",
  "I don't see what this case, frankly, has to do with the grand jury at all ­­ or review of the grand jury determination. You don't have to put forward, in this hearing, what you put forward before the grand jury at all. You could put forth different stuff. You could put forth less of it. Maybe you don't want to show your ­­ your whole hand. Maybe the party, on the other side, they don't want to show their whole hand, too, so they don't want to show all this other evidence that's going to prove ­­ prove their innocence. It­ It's an entirely separate proceeding. Now, maybe the fact of the grand jury indictment should be given some weight or not, but it's not reviewing a particular determination. It's the judge making a determination on what he or she has before him at that particular hearing.",
  "No. It's not, in the sense that, before the grand jury, you say, okay, here, we showed the grand jury these six things, and they said yes. You look at those six things; that’s there's the probable cause. At this other hearing, you say, I've got ­­ I'm going to show you these two things, and the other side has these three things. And the judge, at that point, says, well, you don't have enough to restrain the property. It's not reviewing the other determination. It's an entirely separate proceeding.",
  "That's because they didn't have the good lawyers they wanted to hire.",
  "I'm sorry. Are you talking about cases in like the Second Circuit and the D.C. Circuit, where you do have these hearings?",
  "I­ I raised this point earlier. It may be because the government, particularly when it may have tenuous probable cause basis, decides it's not worth it to go through this hearing to seize and retain the assets. And it just seems that the statistics are phony, in the sense that, where the impact of this is going to be is not in reported cases; it's going to be when the U.S. attorney says it's not worth it, it would jeopardize the trial on the merits, and so they don't even go through the process of restraining the assets.",
  "More that the facts, since the funds are traceable, anyway and they'll have an opportunity to get them at the end, even if they don't get their restraining order, makes it not worth it.",
  "You're making it sound like you would lose the whole case. This, to some extent, is a little bit of a side show. You want to send the Kaleys to jail, and you want the assets that you think are traceable to it, and that's all well and good. But it's not like the whole case falls apart depending on whether or not you can restrain the assets or not.",
  "Yes, but they're ­­",
  "Sure. But now, you've touched on something that I think is very pertinent. They are used to pay restitution to the victims. I mean, the whole point here ­­ and presumably, it's something that your friends on the other side would raise in one of these hearings, is there are no victims, right? That's the theory. And maybe it will fall apart, and the judge will say, of course, there are victims, but as I understand it, the hospitals ­­ you know, gave them to the people; the companies didn't want them back because they would have to give a credit. You know, I'm sure the government has a different view of the facts, but that's a good example. Okay, this is going to be used to pay restitution to the victims. They come in and say, well, just give me five minutes, Your Honor, you'll see there are no victims. What's wrong with that.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Srebnick, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Counsel, I think your quotation from the D.C. Circuit was ­­ was not quite on point. My understanding is the court was asking for empirical evidence that this has caused a particular problem, not whether they could point to any concerns. I think we've seen the concerns laid out today.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12­609, Kansas v. Cheever. General Schmidt.",
  "Thank you. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Even if ­­ even if the defendant does not submit an expert of his own, but simply puts his mental state in issue?",
  "Why would it only be for ­­ why would it only be for impeachment purposes? It's directed at some statements that he said, which are not going ­­ not terribly pertinent to the mental diagnosis, but valuable evidence, and the defendant takes the stand; can the government call ­­ here's this person, he happens to be the doctor that took the ­­ the examination, but he learned some things here that we think are helpful.",
  "Counsel, your time has expired.",
  "Mr. Katyal.",
  "It's just the fact that the evidence here is based on the defendant's statements. If you had a physical object, you wouldn't say it's the ­­ the murder weapon. You wouldn't say that, if the defendant submits a study about the murder weapon, the ballistics, this and that, you wouldn't say, well, all the government can do is cross­examine the defendant's expert. You say, no, they get to do their own study. The reality of what makes this different is that here, when you're submitting and preparing psychiatric evidence, it's based on ­­ the ballistics testing is statements from ­­ from the defendant, and it seems to me unfair to say the defendant's expert has access to that ballistics evidence, but the State does not.",
  "No. I understand that. But it just so happens that the way you do the ­­ the testing on the evidence when you're talking about psychiatric evidence is to ask questions of the defendant. That's how you do it. That's the parallel to whatever ballistics tests they do on the ­­ on the firearm.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Katyal. General Schmidt, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "What if ­­ what happens if the defendant is going through this examination, they ask him this, he tells them this, that, and all of a sudden, they ask him a question, he said, I'd rather not answer that. I mean, is he allowed ­­ allowed to do that?",
  "Why? Because it might incriminate me?",
  "That's a little bit different. I understand terminate, then they'd say, well, look, you don't get to put your expert in. But what if it's just ­­ you know, particular questions? What happens then?",
  "Don't forget it. Why don't you try a quick response?",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "Our second case is Case 12­417, Sandifer v. United States Steel. Mr. Schnapper?",
  "Counsel ­­",
  "We began with the assumption that the unions are on your side. Is the United Steelworkers of America on your side?",
  "Well, it does seem to support to notion that this is something that should be left to the collective bargaining process.",
  "No, the point would be that the steelworkers gave up something when ­­ you know, it's part of a bargain. Okay? If they say, all right, we're not going to count this time, but ­­ you know, you've got to give us ten more cents an hour or ­­ you know, greater cafeteria facilities or something. It's a normal part of the bargaining process. And it seems to me that, if they're willing to give it up to get something else, what's ­­ what's the benefit to them of saying you can't do that?",
  "Well, counsel, the whole approach here ­­ you are saying you are not going to give us a test, you are just going to criticize ­­",
  "­­ their test. I mean, it's ­­",
  "So what about heavy duty pants ­­ you know, blue jeans that somebody ­­ the thick ones that you use because the work environment will involve ­­ you know, grease and hot things and all, but that you wouldn't necessarily ­­ or a particular worker wouldn't wear off the steel mill site? Is that clothing designed to protect against work hazards? Or is it ­­ some people would wear that outside the steel plant; other people wouldn't.",
  "Yes, yes, but there are heavier­duty blue jeans that are made out of a particular fabric that you would see commonly in the steel mill, but you maybe wouldn't see commonly outside.",

  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12­158, Bond v. United States. Mr. Clement?",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli.",
  "General, let's suppose there's a multilateral treaty, the ­­ the international convention to ensure that national legislatures have full authority to carry out their obligations, i.e., that the national legislature has the police power. And Congress passes a statute saying we have the authority to prosecute purely local crimes pursuant to this international convention that the President has signed. Any problem with that?",
  "Why?",
  "And just to press it further, the ­­ the point is that it's a transfer of authority from the States to the national legislature. I don't know why you'd look to the national legislature to say, well, we'd never do that.",
  "At a time when the Senate was elected by the State legislatures.",
  "Well, I don't know why it would not be a valid exercise of the treaty power. A case like Medellin caused serious conflict with our international obligations because we held, look, the Federal government does not have the authority to tell the sheriff in Texas what to do. That caused a great deal of strain in ­­ in our international relations. And I think the United Nations could well say, look, we don't want treaty parties to have to deal with whether it's somebody in this State or somebody in that province who has the authority, so every signatory must have the authority. It doesn't strike me as not reasonably related to international obligations.",
  "No, no. I know your ­­ I know the case ­­",
  "So the ­­ the purpose of my hypothetical was try to find out if there's any situation in which you believe an erosion or intrusion by the Federal government on the police power could be a constraint against an international treaty.",
  "Well, it seems to me that if you say there may be an outer bound, but this case isn't one of them, you're subjecting yourself to the same criticisms that have been leveled against the other side, that you're proposing a case­by­case evaluation with respect to each treaty.",
  "But there are a lot of treaties, particularly I think Justice Alito pointed out, after the World War II era, where you have international conventions affecting everything. We have international conventions on the abduction of children, international conventions that ­­ human rights. They cover a vast swathe of ­­ of subject matter. And it seems to me the only thing you're saying that is a limit on what the treaty power can be as a source for is some determination, no more ­­ less ­­ no less arbitrary than the lines other people are asking us to draw between what's appropriate under the treaty power and what's not. And I just would like a fairly precise answer whether there are or are not limitations on what Congress can do with respect to the police power. If their authority is asserted under a treaty, is their ­­ is their power to intrude upon the police power unlimited?",
  "Okay. The treaty is valid.",
  "Okay.",
  "So you would rather have the Court determine, if we're concerned about the intrusion on the police power, whether treaties are valid or not than whether ­­ determine whether particular implementing legislation is valid or not.",
  "I know this case. The point of the hypothetical is I'm trying to get your general principle. I can imagine treaties that you would say are within the treaty power, again, particularly in the post­World War II era, but that could give rise to implementing legislation that I think would be extraordinary from the point of view of the framers and the power that it gave Congress to intrude upon State authority.",
  "It's ­­ it's kind of question begging. I mean, the whole point is that some people think we do have exactly that in this case. Now, usually, when we have a case that implicates significant and serious bilateral concerns, we get a lot of briefs and all that from our ­­ our treaty partners. Is ­­ is there any concern that's been expressed in any concrete way by them about whether Mrs. Bond is prosecuted?",
  "No, no. Yes. So nothing in ­­",
  "I'm sure that the people who've worked in the national branch of government, particularly for the State Department, would like to have as much authority as they can get to negotiate treaties. We're concerned about limitations on other. Do we have any briefs from State legislatures, State authorities, concerning intrusion on their prerogatives?",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.",

  "We will next hear argument in Case 12­815, Sprint Communications v. Jacobs. Mr. Simeone.",

  "So ­­ but, I mean, is there a different category, some of the normal regulatory interests are important and other regulatory interests are not? I mean, it seems to me the line that Younger drew ­­ or that I thought it was drawing, between criminal and civil has been eroded to a considerable extent. But your friend analogized that the other cases, for want of a better word, to ­­ they're sort of quasi­criminal or at least touching upon the process as opposed to a particular proceeding. I mean, do you think that the abstention applies in the case of every regulatory proceeding?",
  "Well, how do you ­­ how do you tell which ­­",
  "I'm sorry, it's going to what?",
  "Oh.",
  "Well, don't all ­­ it's sort of like the important State interests. I assume the State's not doing anything, unless they think it's important. And any type of administrative proceeding, remedial or otherwise, has to a have some bite to it. There has to be something that is going happen to you if you don't do what they tell you to do. So in that sense, I mean, almost every administrative proceeding is coercive.",
  "Well, my point is it doesn't seem like much of a limiting test, if you can say any time ­­ sort of any time anything bad can happen to you as a result of an administrative proceeding, that's coercive. It doesn't seem like a serious constraint on the application of Younger.",
  "Why is ­­ I'm sorry. I was just going to say why is that? Presumably, the State is resolving that dispute pursuant to some State law or State regulation, State policy. I don't know why the ­­ the State interest is unimportant simply because it's the resolution of a private dispute.",

  "Well, it would make ­­ it would make no sense for a defendant in a class action brought by consumers to ever settle the case. It's going to have to pay twice. It's going to have to pay consumers, and then it's going to have to pay you because you can, say, well, we want restitution, and we are not going to distribute it to the class members, but we're entitled to it. And I assume the amount of the restitution is based on some estimate of the class ­­ the consumers' claims.",
  "Is there ­­ is there ­­ what is your understanding under Mississippi law, which you know a great deal more than I do, about any limits on a parens patriae action? Let's say there was one purchaser in Mississippi of LCDs, whatever, or two or three. Could you bring a parens patriae action on their behalf?",
  "Well, I know, but I'm trying ­­",
  "Unlikely as a practical matter or as a legal matter?",
  "Did the State interest that's being ­­ the State interest that is being asserted is damage to the consumers?",
  "Because it harmed members of the population of Mississippi, right?",
  "Damage to ­­ having less money is a damage to the consumer.",
  "What prevents ­­ what prevents attorneys general from around the country sitting back and waiting until every ­­ as private class actions proceed, and as soon as one settles or one ­­ the plaintiffs' class prevails, taking the same complaint, maybe even hiring the same lawyers, to go and say, well, now we are going to bring our parens patriae action, we know how the trial is going to work out, or we know what the settlement is going to look like, and we are going to get the same amount of money for the State?",
  "Well, that's got not nothing to do with it, does it?",
  "I'm sure it's a serious matter when a plaintiff class recovers for, as in this case, an antitrust violation or whatever and ­­ what's the answer? I'm sorry. I'm repeating my question.",
  "So the answer is that there is nothing to prevent 50 attorneys general ­­ 51, from saying, every time there is a successful class action as to which somebody in my State purchased one of the items, we are going to file a parens patriae action, the complaint is going to look an awful lot like the class action complaint, and we want our money?",
  "I'm sorry, counsel, but you told me the State's own interest was in protecting its consumers, so it would be able to file this suit every time its consumers have been harmed, as demonstrated either through settlement or suit. That's the State interest, protecting its consumers.",
  "But you can't provide any reason why they wouldn't do so and, presumably, would start doing so with greater frequency if you prevail in this case.",
  "It doesn't have to be the same case. It can be the next case on the court's docket. The first case is In Re: LCD Litigation, and the second case is State of Mississippi v. LCD Manufacturers.",

  "But wouldn't we look at it differently if there were ­­ suddenly, if there were a proposal today, for the first time, to say let's adopt a motto, \"In God we trust\"? Would we view that the same way, simply because it's ­­ in other words, the history doesn't make it clear that a particular practice is okay going on in the future.

  "What exactly ­­ since you are adopting the coercion test, what exactly is coercive in this environment? Having to sit and listen to the prayer?",
  "They are asked to participate, and ­­ but not in any tangible way. They say, well, I'm not going to participate. And everybody's just sitting there.",
  "Well, just to be clear, are you talking about what would be satisfactory to the Second Circuit or satisfactory to you? Because you don't accept the Second Circuit's approach.",
  "We've already excluded the atheists, right?",

If the other person had been in the back room instead of at the door or if the other person had been away for a minute, Randolph by its terms would not apply, because it said physical presence. So it's not even extending Randolph to its logical conclusions. It specifically said, we are not reaching anything beyond physical presence.",

  "Well, that's ­­ it seems to me that this is a difficulty for you, the structure of the treaty.

They say, look, you have got a dispute, if you don't resolve it, you bring it in court.",
  "Nothing about arbitration even in the background. Then they say, if you want to go to arbitration, you can. So, when you look at just the structure, it seems to suggest that Article I ­­ 8(I) is not part of the arbitration provision. It stands there and says, this is what you do, and then the arbitration kicks in later.",
  "Well, that ­­ your argument would be better there if this was Article 8 ­­ you know, arbitration of disputes or ­­ you know, parties can arbitrate, but, first, they must do this. No, it just ­­ you know, says settlement of disputes. The first thing is you can go to court here. The second thing is, if you want to arbitrate, you do this.",

  "Well, the problem is ­­",
  "You're ­­ it's a point on which I'm regularly confused.

And it seems to me clear that those ­­ what do you call them, preconditions or whatever, that that ­­ the argument that that's for the arbitrator to decide. They may well decide that ­­ you know, you didn't comply, so you don't get to arbitrate. But it seems to me, typically, under First Options and Howsam, that is for the arbitrator. Now, what makes it distinct in your case? What, is it just the order that they're in? Or what? Or is it something special about a sovereign's agreement?",
  "It all gets down to the question, how do we tell ­­ you know, the contract formation from the blue paper, right? I mean, if it says ­­ you know, we agree to arbitrate, and we use these rules and those rules say you have to have it on blue paper, and it's not on blue paper, they say, oh, we didn't agree to have it not on blue paper. How do we distinguish between those two scenarios?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein, five minutes.",
  "I'm not so sure you don't have to do anything, you just submit the paper. It says you have to submit it to the decision of the competent tribunal. And if the submission requires, okay, now, you have to file your brief, and you say, I'm not going to, I'm not sure that you've submitted it to a tribunal for its decision.",
  "That seems that you're not totally circular in begging the question. I don't know that a sovereign would be anxious to submit its sovereignty to three international law experts.",

  "Can you prosecute people who frequent this illegal casino?",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal.",
  "Well, you don't it ­­ You don't have a square ruling, so I want to make clear, because both you and the Solicitor General have suggested this as an option: You think it is all right for the State to go in and arrest every employee, management ­­ you know, labor, who is participating in this casino and subject them to criminal sanctions, civil penalties and an injunction. You have got no problem with that?",
  "You, as a tribe ­­ you, as a tribe, would have no objection to that action?",
  "Well, I know, you could suggest different ways, and the State could tell you ­­ you know, go fly a kite, we are prosecuting these people. And you'd have no objection to that?",
  "Okay. What about Ex Parte Young? Are you willing to waive the tribe's sovereign immunity in an Ex Parte Young action? Because, in your opposition to the complaint in this case, you raised sovereign immunity as an objection to the Ex Parte Young ­­",
  "Not just are available; that you would not assert sovereign immunity if they brought an Ex Parte Young action.",
  "I don't see how an arbitration works. The Federal government has a very keen interest in whether this is Indian land or not. And the arbitrator is going to decide that in a way that's going to bind anybody?",
  "So ongoing, as far as the tribe and the State is concerned, they proceed from then on as if this is Indian lands, even though the Federal government is saying, no, it's not.",
  "Yes. So the arbitration doesn't get ­­ so the arbitration doesn't get you anywhere at all.",
  "If we get ­­ go ahead.",

  "The Federal government, the Solicitor of Interior has said these are not Indian lands, the NIGC has adopted that interpretation. The NIGC has said, but we can't do anything because they are not Indian lands, and we work on Indian lands. And then they've referred, as I understand, the matter to the United States Attorney who has, thus far, not done anything, right?",
  "So, basically, as I see it, the Federal government is saying, States, you can't take action against this illegal casino. We're the only ones who can. We agree that it's illegal, but we are not going to do anything.",

  "Counsel, could you tell me where you think they concede that some States ­­ that their position would lead to a different result in some States?",
  "I thought they were saying that, in some States, it's not an implied term of the contract, but a different sort of provision.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yelin.",
  "What if you had a decision by the Minnesota supreme court on common law contract principles and it said ­­ you know, when the parties use the word \"sole\" in a contract, we interpret that to mean subject to reasonableness constraint. The parties here use the word \"sole.\" Would the application of that principle violate ­­ would that be preempted or not?",
  "Well, \"reasonable\" means ­­ I mean ­­ you know, the ­­ the airline says \"sole\" means sole. We don't have to explain why we did it. And the Minnesota court said, no, when you say \"sole,\" it has to be reasonable. It can't be, for example, for no reason. It has to be for some articulated reason.",
  "Well, let's say going forward. Going forward, the parties know that this decision is out there, and they say, \"sole.\" So it means they're using the term, subject to the gloss that's been put on it by the Minnesota supreme court. So what about in that case?",
  "We would assume, then, that the parties knew, whenever they used the word \"sole,\" they actually meant subject to reasonableness as interpreted ­­ interpreted by the Minnesota supreme court.",
  "So you're not going to give me \"reasonable\" for anything?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, if you're going to give me \"reasonable\" ­­ in other words, the parties' express terms do not say \"reasonable\"; in fact, the most natural reading is that it's not reasonable, but they take the contractual ­­ the interpretation that the Minnesota supreme court has adopted, I don't know why the same rule wouldn't apply when the Minnesota supreme court says there is an implied condition of reasonableness across ­­ across the board and that the parties contract against that background, just like they do when there's a specific interpretation of the word \"sole.\"",
  "I do agree, it seems pretty inconsistent with the normal presumption against preemption that we apply out of respect for the State legal regimes, to say we're going to adopt a broad prophylactic rule.",
  "You ­­ go ahead.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Rosenbaum.",
  "And that's no clearer than the ­­ the government's view, and it seems to me to be a particular problem when you're talking about the objectives of the ADA, to say that the rule varies from State to State, particularly since, of course, we're dealing with airlines that go to a lot of different States. I mean, it seems to me that the loosest State, from the point of view of the preemption, is going to set the standard.",
  "Yes. It's a general rule that it depends upon the particular circumstances. That's the same rule, but in its application, it certainly varies from State to State.",
  "I don't think it helps your argument to say that your position promotes the purposes of the ADA because the whole point of that ­­ of the preemption provision, is that that's for the Federal government to determine, not for different state laws, what promotes the purposes of the ADA.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Clement.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next this morning in Case 12­873, Lexmark International v. Static Control Components. Mr. Loy.",

  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Chemerinsky.",
  "So you raised a ­­ you ­­ you mentioned the green line, and Mr. Horwich represented some facts about it outside the record, quite properly alerted us that it was outside the record, I just want to give you a chance to respond to that.",
  "You need the express permission of the base commander to drive down the road. It's just that he has given it to ­­ to the public at large.",
  "Because it's been ceded by the United States for the convenience of the traveling public.",
  "I thought you just answered the question from Justice Sotomayor by saying, no, no, the utility easement doesn't work because the military commander has not granted permission to anybody else to use that easement. Here, we have a public road easement, and you said that's different. And my question was: No, it's not, because the military commander has given permission to use that easement. Now, I want to know what distinguishes the two cases.",
  "Well, that's usually the sort of determination that's left to the military commander. I can think of a lot of reasons why the commander would not want a gathering of people on the road, but would be willing to let people drive through the road.",
  "Well, it indicates, as the ­­ the barment order does, that he does see some kind of threat by allowing somebody in there who's vandalized the base in the past.",
  "Is there ­­ can there be a temporary forfeiture of First Amendment rights?",
  "Well, I'm talking about what this case is about, which is the temporary exclusion. Would your case be the same if Mr. Apel was barred for one year?",
  "No, he can traverse it. He can traverse. There ­­ there's no question of that. Could he be barred from participating in protests for a year because he vandalized the base?",
  "Now, here, as I understand it, he was barred permanently, subject to the right of him to apply for removal of the barment.",
  "To avoid ­­ just to interrupt ­­ to avoid grave constitutional doubts.",
  "I'm sorry. The Rule of Lenity, you said in favor of a criminal defendant.",
  "We're talking about barment here. Is that a criminal sanction?",
  "Right, but this doesn't ­­ you're not allowed to collaterally attack the barment decision.",

  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12­315, Air Wisconsin Airlines v. Hoeper. Mr. Cohn.",
  "Material to ­­ to what?",
  "I mean, you can have a defamatory statement about a pilot that's not material to ­­ you know, air safety. Is that what materiality goes to, the particular reason that the statement is made?",
  "So you're saying you can't defame ­­ someone gets immunity for a statement that would be defamatory in the common law context if made generally, but because it's made in the context of information about flight safety, that's somehow immune?",
  "So you call some TSA official and say this pilot ­­ you know, is having an affair. That's immune?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin.",
  "Of course, you don't ­­ there's no reason ­­ and, presumably, a good trial judge wouldn't instruct the jury on those two separate questions using the same word, right? I mean, you could articulate what you mean by \"material\" in ­­ in each context. In other words, you don't have to say it would be material to TSA. It would say just, as my colleague has suggested, whether or not TSA would have done anything different if a different formulation had been used.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Russell.",
  "So you're saying, if it made a difference in their mind whether to send one officer to his house or a SWAT team somewhere else, that's material, and you lose immunity?",
  "If the difference ­­ if the difference in the language causes TSA to do anything differently, then you lose immunity?",
  "A different effect ­­ a different effect on who?",
  "The TSA. So ­­ but that's what I'm saying. Let's say the TSA person looks at it and says, ah, this is ­­ you know, if it had been phrased as you say, ah, this is silly, I'm not going to do anything. But he says, well, it looks silly to me, but I'm going to send it to my supervisor. That's a different effect on the listeners' mind, and you say that difference causes the airline to lose immunity.",
  "So am I right in understanding that there be two ­­ you would view these two scenarios differently? The same historic facts. Somebody calls and said this happened, this happened, this happened. He was acting crazy. And the next one, this happened, this happened, this happened, and he's crazy. Do you think you lose immunity in the latter case, but not the former case?",
  "You would lose in both?",
  "So a layperson ­­ a layperson who ­­ you know, just looks at this and said, he's acting crazy, they're not immune from that? If they called TSA and say that, everything is true, I guess you would say up until that characterization.",
  "But they would be ­­ the airline would be immune?",
  "No, no. I know. But I'm trying to find out if you think there's a difference between the person's subjective, uneducated evaluation, \"He was acting crazy,\" and a difference between that person saying, \"He's crazy.\"",
  "Well, you're not suggesting it would be a different case if they just said he's unstable, as opposed to he's mentally unstable, are you?",
  "Well, that's what you were saying.",
  "When Justice Kennedy posed the question that he was unstable, you said, \"mentally unstable.\" And my point is that that doesn't make any difference to your case, does it?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, but it affects your belief is different in a context like this. It may not affect your belief, but you may decide, but given what's at stake, I don't think he's mentally unstable just because somebody calls and says that, but I'm going to send it up to my supervisor, make sure he feels the same way. And you tell me that you lose immunity if he says, I don't think he's mentally unstable and ­­ you know, throws it away, in that ­­ as opposed to when he says, I don't think he's mentally unstable, but let's see what the boss thinks.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cohn, you have three minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next this morning in Case 12­992, Ray Haluch Gravel Company v. The Central Pension Fund. Mr. Himmelfarb.",
  "Why would the case be over? Presumably, you incurred attorneys' fees, seeking to recover the attorneys' fees.",
  "Well, but I thought, with respect to pre­litigation attorneys' fees, you said you can treat those differently because they're set and determined. You know what they are. It would seem to me, in most cases of an auditor's report, that's also true.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feldman.",
  "I thought the procedure was, regardless of who prevails, it's not piecemeal appeals. I mean, they often combine the two in the court of appeals for consideration.",
  "Well, even if it's ­­ if they don't need ­­ you don't need Rule 58, at least the practice I was familiar with, you file for attorneys' fees, they calculate it ­­ unless the appellate court is moving with surprising speed, the first appeal is still pending by the time the district court rules on the attorneys' fees.",

  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12­1182, Environmental Protection Agency v. EME Homer City Generation and the consolidated case American Lung Association v. EME Homer City Generation. Mr. Stewart.",
  "That's ­­ I was just going to say, that just is because of, in the latter case, because contribution happens to be used in both an affirmative and a negative sense. The question is, for example, whether somebody who fatally stabs somebody and someone who fatally shoots them have each significantly contributed to the bad result.",
  "Or ­­ or not significantly contributed in ­­ in ­­ contributed in varying degrees.",
  "Well, when you mention the fact that the States didn't address the good neighbor requirement ­­ of course, you hadn't come up with their budgets that they had to meet at the time that they had to promulgate their SIPs. Now, at a different point in your brief, you emphasize how incredibly complicated it is for States to determine how much they must reduce their emissions to take care of the fact that they significantly contributed to downwind pollution. And yet, you would impose on those States the burden to issue the good neighbor program without knowing how much you expect them to ­­ to meet.",
  "So ­­ so if you were working for one of the upwind States and you were facing this 3­year deadline and EPA had not told anyone how it intended to interpret the State's obligations under the good neighbor policy, what would you have told the State to do?",
  "Right. So ­­ but the head of the State EPA comes to you and says, how much do we have to reduce our emissions to satisfy our requirements? And you would tell them what?",
  "Well, but that kind of glosses over the fact that, as you say elsewhere in your brief, this is a ­­ is your analogy, right ­­ a spaghetti matrix or something? And so there's no possible way for the State to know how much of a burden you expect them to address, and yet, you're saying, well, you've got to do it, and you've got to do it within 3 years, or we're going to take over the responsibility.",
  "But could I address the first thing first? I'm not sure that's right. I think EPA has an easier job dealing with it as a group. They say, look, here are these States, here's what you have to do. But any individual State has no idea what its particular role is going to be in your group resolution.",
  "Including ­­ including the overcontrol argument? Or would that have been done?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mitchell, why don't you give us 30 seconds or so? Mr. Mitchell.",
  "Well, it's ­­ it's certainly ­­ it's certainly hard, but it is what the statute says; and it seems to me that, if EPA had taken a different view, it would have been contrary to the statute.",
  "You can finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Mitchell. Mr. Keisler.",
  "What is ­­ what is your answer ­­ do you have an answer to Mr. Stewart's basketball hypothetical? I mean, I thought that was pretty good.

  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 12­794, White v. Woodall. Ms. Lenz.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Komp.",
  "Well, but then the reservation certainly suggests that, at the time the instruction was requested, it wasn't beyond any fair­minded dispute, which is the standard. No one's talked about the standard yet. The standard is that ­­ which you're complaining about ­­ that the error has to be so well understood and comprehended in existing law to be beyond any possibility of fair­minded disagreement. And it seems to me if, shortly after the instruction was requested, the court itself said, oh, that's different, we're not talking about that, it certainly suggests that it was a subject of fair­minded disagreement.",
  "Not only that. Your position must be that that is so clear as to be beyond fair­minded disagreement.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, but you're saying it has to be clear, objectively beyond reasonable disagreement, to say that, when the court says lack of remorse in a sentencing guideline case, it still thinks there's a different rule for lack of remorse in a selection case such as this.",
  "I thought your friend told us that future dangerousness was an eligibility factor, rather than a mere selection criteria.",
  "I'm sorry. It left in ­­ Estelle left intact what?",
  "So ­­ so your argument is when Mitchell said ­­ whether it applies to lack of remorse or acceptance of responsibility for the sentencing guidelines, that's a separate question. We don't have any view on it. But at the same time, the Court said well, of course, it applies in ­­ in the other ­­ other context.",
  "But that's perfectly clear. I mean, if you were arguing the other way, you would say, well, the question is whether it's clearly if there's a clear difference between lack of remorse in the sentencing guideline case and lack of remorse in a capital case, and everybody knew that, so that when Mitchell just said it doesn't apply to lack of remorse in the sentencing guidelines, nobody would think that meant that there was an open issue on the capital context.",

  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Moskowitz.",
  "Well, the ­­ whether or not the child is settled in a particular case is certainly going to be a significant consideration in the custody determination, isn't it?",
  "But that cuts against you in some respects. You say there is such a big difference, and therefore, it is very important that the kidnapping parent do the best he or she can to conceal the child's presence, so they get beyond 13 and into 12.",
  "Those are us from the Midwest think it's actually easier to hide a child in New York.",
  "Briefly, please.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. O'Connell.",
  "Justice Scalia.",
  "I would think it would be very unusual for a family court in that situation not to go ahead with the custody proceeding before it because it would think the child is settled. Now, do I send the child back. So that they can do the custody proceeding in England, or just go ahead and do it here? Don't you think most family court judges would say, let's just go ahead and do it here?",
  "What kind of reasons ­­ what kind of reasons would there ­­ would there be?",
  "To send the child back?",
  "So you would visit on the child the behavior of the parent?",
  "Justice Scalia?",

  "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12­1281, the National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning. General Verrilli?",
  "You say ­­ you say that it would repudiate the constitutionality of appointments. You don't suggest that those ­­ the actions of those appointees would be invalid going back however far you want to go back, do you?",
  "Well, let's just talk ­­ let's focus on that. What, instead of saying, \"No business shall be conducted,\" the order said, \"It is not anticipated that any business will be conducted.\" Does that suffice to eliminate that period as a recess?",
  "Yeah. Well, it's difficult and harder, but it also suggests that you're just talking about a couple of magic words that the Senate can just change at the drop of a hat, so maybe the point is not that significant.",
  "But the compromise they settled on in moving away from that is that the President will nominate and the Senate, if it so chooses, can confirm a nominee. You spoke of the intransigence of the Senate. Well, they have an absolute right not to confirm nominees that the President submits. And it seems to me, following up on Justice Kagan's point, you're latching on to the Recess Appointment Clause as a way to combat that intransigence, rather than to deal with the happenstance that the Senate is not in session when a vacancy becomes open.",
  "Well, the Senate has ­­ the Congress and the Executive have come together to address those sorts of problems in a vast number of cases by providing that there can be an acting general counsel of the NLRB to deal with that situation.",
  "Your ­­ it's your argument ­­ your friend on the other side says one flaw with your argument is that it makes the words \"it may happen\" or \"happen during\" superfluous, that the clause would mean exactly what you say it means if you took those words out. And your response ­­ the only one I could see on the reply ­­ your reply brief, page 13, is that those words were put in there to quote, \"confine the President to filling vacancies that actually exist at the time of appointment.\" Now, is that ­­ do you really think that they put that language in there because they were afraid the President would fill appointments that don't exist?",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Francisco.",
  "Well, before you do so, I mean, is the Senate's power, in your view, so comprehensive that if they passed an order saying, we're actually never in recess, people can be reached ­­ you know, we can call people back. So for purposes of the Recess Clause, we are never in recess.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Estrada.",
  "Yes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli, 6 minutes.",
  "And you argue that the Senate sort of acquiesced in that and everybody's come together, but what would you expect a Senator to do?",
  "You know, the President appoints somebody during a recess contrary to the Respondent's view, what's the Senator who objects to that supposed to do?",
  "Well, you would object to that, wouldn't you?",
  "On the same grounds that you're objecting here.",
  "Well, then that's not something that is effective for the Senate to do if ­­",
  "­­ you think it's unconstitutional.",
  "Well, that’ll show them. The Senate says we don't agree with your recess appointment, and you say, well, that’s too bad, the appointee is still in office.",
  "Well, some of the Senators did ­­ Senator Byrd ­­",
  "­­ famously objected to the President's assertion of that power.",
  "No, I just want to make sure I understand. Your idea is the Senator who objects should do what?",
  "But suppose the Senator says, look, I object to that, I think it's unconstitutional, but I'm not going to ­­ what can I do? The only think you do is impeach the President, right, for violating the Constitution. And he says it's not worth it for the ­­ one of the officers on the NLRB ­­",

  "I should know this, but who's going to get stuck with the extra couple hundred thousand dollars? Is that the trustee in an individual capacity or someone else?",
  "They don't recoup that from anywhere else, right? They are on the hook for that?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Katyal.",

  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington.",
  "What is the ­­ you do have good facts on your side. But what if the offense is simply the failure to list a particular asset? Does that justify a departure from the usual rule?",
  "No you know, it's a ­­ it's a bank account that's held in ­­ you know, a separate name or it's separate real estate. It's fairly common for debtors to leave off some assets they want to conceal. Is that, as a general rule, sufficient to justify this unusual authority?",

  "But they are not really not alternative ­­ well, maybe it's all right to say they are alternative arguments, but they are mutually exclusive arguments. I mean they are alternative in the sense that they led to the same result, but the one argument is that this is A, and the other argument is this is not A.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang.",
  "Why then did no one from the Department of Interior join your brief?",
  "They don't have a choice, do they? I mean, it's ­­",
  "Maybe the reason you don't have records on this, which strikes me as pretty unusual that the government doesn't know what it owns, is that for decades, you didn't think that you owned a reversionary interest.",

  "You would concede that your case would be ­­ you would not have a case if we were dealing with factual findings?",

  "You're right. We've been talking about backup arguments to backup arguments. Your central argument is that the consent of the parties can overcome what Stern identified as a structural separation of powers problem.",
  "Well, I guess that's my question. Is there any other case where we've said the consent of the parties can overcome a constitutional structural separation of powers?",
  "We've already told the district court, haven't we, that its Article III status is infringed when he refers or when there's a reference to a non­Article III tribunal?",
  "So if the district court refers the case to his law partners, and that's fine with the parties, that law partner can enter a final judgment in the case subject only to appellate review?",
  "Is that what you're saying?",
  "The Special Masters do not enter final judgment subject only to appellate review.",
  "But the appellate review is the important thing. The Article III court, under your submission, is giving up its authority to enter factual findings. It's giving that authority to a non­Article III tribunal, and it can only review those findings under clearly erroneous standard.",
  "Well, I know it's the current system under the magistrate judges. We held that unconstitutional in the bankruptcy context.",
  "Finish your sentence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon.",
  "That's what I thought severability was. If you carve ­­ if you find part of it unconstitutional, you ask whether what is left can stand. You don't say that we're going to rewrite what is left.",
  "Or it may be because the particular claim at issue in Stern was one that wasn't expected to arise in the normal course in bankruptcy proceedings.",
  "Your ­­ your position is ­­ I mean, the authority to decide cases, which is our Constitutional birthright, we said in Stern that Congress can't take that away from us. And your position is that two parties who come in off the street, if they agree, they can take that away from us.",
  "No, it's the parties, the parties who are ­­",
  "You said, \"It's the consent of the parties that allows a proceeding we have determined to be unconstitutional to go forward.\"",
  "The point of everything that you said is, they do not comply with Article III.",
  "Does the district court have that authority after the entry of judgment?",
  "Arbitration is a matter of contract between two parties. Nothing happens in an arbitration until you get a district court to enter a judgment enforcing the contract. It seems to me totally different from the situation we're talking about here.",
  "But you ­­ I'm posing a question to you, I guess.",

  "So if I did the same thing to two different people and one is injured and the other isn't, I am using physical force one time but not the other time?",
  "Where is the actual physical force being applied?",
  "Okay. So if they bump against the wall and that injures somebody but doesn't injure another person, it's use of physical force in one case but not the other?",
  "But only one was injured.",
  "I'm sorry. I ­­ I'm having trouble grasping the concept. If somebody is lying down and somebody goes behind them and says boo and they have a heart attack and die, is that physical force?",
  "But it might not include scaring the person and the person having a heart attack.",
  "But doesn't that assume the conclusion of the case?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld.",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, you still owe Justice Breyer an answer.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld. Ms. Sherry, 5 minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11­681, Harris v. Quinn. Mr. Messenger.",
  "Are there any ­­ you suggest, in response to my colleague's question, that they could ­­ the State could pay healthcare providers different rates. Is there ­­ are there any limitations? We're talking about Medicaid reimbursement.",
  "Are there any limitations that would prevent differential rates of pay, reimbursement, under Medicaid for the same services?",
  "Jump in whenever you'd like.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Smith.",
  "I thought Medicaid had something to do with how much they were reimbursed. You're saying Medicaid is beside the point?",
  "If you hire a homecare provider to provide homecare services, isn't how much the person is compensated ­­ you have a Medicaid program, a cooperative program with the Federal Government, doesn't it set the rates with which those services are reimbursed?",
  "Well, right, that ­­ it's a cooperative State/Federal program. But isn't there ­­ are you saying the wages have nothing to do with how much the ­­ the Medicaid reimbursement for these types of services?",
  "But they don't just give you a bunch of money and say, Well, here it is, you figure out how much you want to ­­ I mean, I thought this case had something to do with the fact that Medicaid was used to reimburse these employees, and you're saying it has nothing to do with that at all?",
  "I just want to know ­­ not what their challenge is. I want to know where the money comes from. It comes from Medicaid, and I assume Medicaid sets some parameters about how much you can reimburse homecare providers.",
  "So you can negotiate whatever rates you want with the homecare providers, regardless of what Medicaid says about those services?",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "One thing, Mr. Smith, the first word in your brief is \"Medicaid.\" I don't understand because the argument can be made that Medicaid reimbursement rates is an important public policy issue, not simply a labor issue. Now, let's say you have a teachers' union, okay? They think it's a very important public issue. They have a platform. They engage in activities to get higher Medicaid reimbursement rates. Is that something that a nonunion member would have to pay for, or would they ­­ would that expense be segregated out of what they must pay?",
  "Teacher ­­ teacher union, okay?",
  "They have a political position on Medicaid rates. They spend money to advance that position. If you're a teacher, but you're not a member of the union, do you have to pay for that expenditure?",
  "Right. Same ­­ same public ­­ same expenses for Medicaid ­­",
  "­­ but you're a homecare provider. Your union spends to get higher Medicaid rates. You're not a member of the union. Do you have to pay for their political activity to raise Medicaid rates?",
  "So one ­­ I'm sorry. If I could just finish the thought. So the same speech with respect to one union is a speech on a matter of public concern, but with respect to another union, it's not?",
  "Okay. So it's Medicaid. Now, is that part of the chargeable expenses or not? This union wants to talk about Medicaid reimbursement rates. Can a nonunion member be compelled to share that expense?",
  "I mean Medicaid reimbursement rates. That's what I mean by Medicaid reimbursement rates.",
  "So in this case ­­ in this case, if this union negotiates over Medicaid reimbursement rates, it is chargeable.",
  "Even though, what I understood your answer to be, is that Medicaid reimbursement rates had nothing to do with this case.",
  "And that includes Medicaid reimbursement rates.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General.",
  "General Verrilli, does Medicaid have anything to do with this case?",
  "Right, right.",
  "Right. Your statement of interest ­­ your statement of interest explaining why you are here today discusses the effect of the Medicaid program.",
  "If the ­­ if the union wants to talk about Medicaid rates with the State because they would get a higher wage or could get a higher wage if Medicaid reimbursement was higher, is that within the ­­ their functioning as a union rather than a political group?",
  "Oh, so if the union wants to say, Look, the only way our people are going to get higher wages is if there's a higher Medicaid reimbursement rate for this service, that is not within the scope of collective bargaining?",
  "Please finish your thought.",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Messenger, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Please.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 12­1315, Petrella v. Metro­Goldwyn­Mayer. Mr. Bibas?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Perry.",
  "Does the laches defense bar everything in the future? It is, after all, a rolling statute of limitations.",
  "To the extent your concern is reliance, okay, wait until the reliance is ­­ you know, off ­­ off the table. Then you've got three years to go ahead.",
  "Well, not just injunctions. I mean, let's say they ­­ you know, they released the Blu­ray version or whatever, and so, in a particular two­year period, you make a lot of money, and the suit should have been brought before that. Well, starting when the sales go down, you still have a three­year period where you're making the routine amount.",
  "Briefly.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bibas, five minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument in Case 12­9490, Navarette v. California. Mr. Kleven.",
  "So if the tip ­­ so if the tip is, is this car is driving by and throwing bombs out the window, okay, every ­­ you know, whatever, 500 yards, the police find the car, they have to wait until they see the person actually throw a bomb out the window themselves, before pulling them over?",
  "So your answer is yes, the car is going there, and he's throwing a bomb out, and it goes off, but he has to wait till he sees them throw out another bomb?",
  "Well, what if you have caller ID. I mean, you have one of these anonymous flip phones, right? You can buy them, it's prepaid. You call up and say, I'm ­­ you know, John Smith, I've seen this, and they look, there's the caller, there's the number. Then they can do it.",
  "Well, isn't that all caller ID gives you?",
  "Do we have any indication that this is a serious problem? The false tips?",
  "Well, is that ­­ is that true? I mean, how many people die from drunk driving versus how many people dry­­die from firearms?",
  "I was just going to say, we have held that the ­­ the standards are loosened in the vehicle context because your expectation of privacy is diminished when you're out on the road driving along in ­­ in a vehicle. Does that have any pertinence?",
  "What if there's no way for the officer to corroborate the allegation? You know, you see ­­ see somebody on the street grab a young child, throw her in the trunk of the car, and then take off. And somebody calls with an anonymous tip saying, this fellow ­­ you know, in this car, has got a child in the trunk. The police can follow the person ­­ you know, for hours and they're not going to see any corroborating evidence. Can they pull that car over?",
  "So just ­­ your answer in that case is that the police cannot pull that car over?",
  "Well, let's expand it a little bit. It's a ­­ it's a one­lane ­­ two­lane road going down, but it merges into ­­ you know, an eight­lane expressway. You have one police car. It's going to be hard for that police car to maintain surveillance. And you say they've just got to let them go.",
  "Well, just in terms of your position, do you think they could pull the car over?",
  "Really? Okay.",
  "So the ­­ the atomic bomb, the level of danger is great enough, but the young girl in the trunk, the level of danger is not great enough?",
  "Well, but you ­­ what if ­­ what if the person said, okay, my name is this ­­ you know, my phone number is this; this guy drove me off the road. They can't corroborate that until they stop the guy. Or you're saying they have to? They have to wait, they have to make the call, see if the guy is there. Are you the guy that just called? So that guy's got to talk on his cell phone while he's driving.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Laurence.",
  "What ­­ what if the call is ­­ you know, I'm driving, this guy just drove by me, I looked over, he didn't have his seatbelt on. I mean, can the police pull that guy over?",
  "Well yeah, there are laws against driving without a seatbelt because that protects people's lives.",
  "I've never understood ­­ what good do those ­­ you know, let's say that I'm at a party, I don't like somebody there. I see they have a couple of drinks. I know what kind of car he drives. I know the ­­ I can look at the license plate. I call ­­ you know, ten minutes later. I know where he goes driving home. There's this car. It's a white whatever. It's got this license plate. It's swerving all over the road.",
  "Whether he is or not, the police go up, they pull him over and find out, yeah ­­ you know, he fails the breathalyzer, and I get my revenge.",
  "I was just going to say my point is it need not necessarily be a personal observation of the person operating the car. It may be prior knowledge. And I gather one of the issues we're concerned about is people using this to ­­ you know, exact revenge or ­­ or do something else having nothing to do with whether or not the person is violating the law on the highway.",
  "Thank you, counsel. No, no. We're going to hear from Ms. Kovner first. Ms. Kovner.",
  "Well, where does that ­­ I think this is the question Justice Kagan asked earlier ­­ how does the nature of the offense affect the reasonableness of the suspicion?",
  "I mean, in either case, you have ­­ let's say the seatbelt and the swerving driver. It's the same witness. He said, still, it's a white Ford. The reasonableness of the suspicion would seem, to me, to be totally divorced from what it's about.",
  "Well, that's just not true. It's ­­ it's an acquaintance, I know what kind of car he drives, I know where he's going. I didn't see anything on the road, but I call the police and say, oh, there's this ­­ you know, white Ford swerving all over the road.",
  "No, I'm talking about the concern that you want to have the police pull over people that you don't like, where you know somebody's got something bad in the car, and you don't like it, and so you're going to take advantage of the fact that the police don't have to observe anything, and yet, you can still get them to pull over this person.",
  "What about the danger from the police side? In other words, they know ­­ or they suspect that the guy driving the white car has a lot of marijuana in the trunk. They have no basis for pulling him over. And they say, well, guess what, we got an anonymous tip that he was driving erratically, so we pulled him over.",
  "What protection is there against that?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kleven, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Yes, I have another one, too.",
  "So somebody has five drinks and goes and gets in the car, that's not intentionally trying to harm someone? Or recklessly trying to harm ­­",

  "Well, but there wasn't ­­ there wasn't a strong lobby in Congress saying we're the group that supports Ponzi schemes, so maybe it makes more sense to have a broad construction of that provision.

And to say ­­ you look at it and say well, the purpose is this, even though there's no words in the statute that have anything to do with straw purchasers, I think, is very problematic.",

So that the one individual is responsible for that harm, regardless of what else happens. Now, he may say, well, it's kind of unfair to stick me with that, but that's a different question than the aggregate causation issue that you're addressing. If you have expert testimony, and there will be expert testimony on the other side, that says it normally requires counseling for someone, when they find out, without regard to anything else, that an individual has viewed this, why doesn't that require ­­ or at least allow assessment of the ­­ the whole amount?",

  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cassell.",
  "Well, but responsible for those as a proximate result of the offense.",
  "The only offense shown here in this case is the possession of the two pictures. So how ­­ how can all of those amounts be the result of the possession of two pictures?",
  "Well, you understand the statutory principle, that it says, \"any other losses suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offense,\" which suggests that the prior losses are also limited as a proximate result of the offense.",
  "Why would­­ Why would it make sense to say that he's liable for lost income, whether or not it's a proximate result, but when it comes to other losses suffered by the victim, they have to be the proximate result?",

Now, if you take away proximate cause, the argument can be, well, I had to undergo counseling in a particular period, so I wasn't able to get a master's degree in this. Because I didn't get a master's degree, I wasn't able to get a better­paying job, and therefore, I'm entitled to the income from the better­paying job that I would have gotten if I had a master's degree, if I didn't have to take the counseling. Now, unless you limit that by proximate cause, it's entirely open­ended. It's not confined, as you said.",
  "No, no. I'm talking about proximate causation.",
  "No, it's not a simple case. You said, rhetorical exaggeration, every word in the statute leads to that. But the key words don't. The key words are \"proximate result of the offense.\" And it's difficult to argue that the entire amount is a proximate result of the offense of two pictures.",

That position does not implicate your concern about the broad reach of EPA regulation, does it?",
  "I understand. But they would only be applying that with respect to sources that are already required to operate under PSD permits.",
  "You have three and a half minutes left.",
  "No. You will get 5 minutes of rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Mitchell.",
  "Thank you, General Mitchell.",
  "About the Best Available Control Technology, I think I have an idea of what that looks like with respect to sources already regulated, because they're relating to the NAAQS. You know, filters, scrubbers and all that; I'm sure it's oversimplified. But what does Best Available Control Technology look like with respect to greenhouse gases?",
  "Right. But am I ­­ am I right because the greenhouse gases do not affect ambient air quality in a way that the current or the NAAQS provisions do? I mean, you're dealing with regulation of energy usage, right, as opposed to emissions of lead, emissions of the other NAAQS provisions?",
  "The same sort of thing as with ­­ for domestic uses, as the energy efficient light bulbs.",
  "No, but my point is it relates to energy consumption as opposed to particulate emission.",
  "If you ­­ if you regulate ­­ I'm talking about your two distinct arguments in your ­­ in your brief. If you prevail on the first: In other words, greenhouse gases may be regulated with respect to sources that are already subject to permitting, my understanding, it gets you to 83 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions.",
  "Prevailing on the second argument gets you to 86 percent.",
  "So this is a fight ­­ putting aside your first argument ­­ about an additional 3 percent, and yet according to the Petitioners that brings in this huge regulatory problem, of, you know, regulating the high school football game and what­not.",
  "The lights at the game.",
  "I'm sorry. I didn't get an answer to ­­ hear an answer to Justice Alito's question and I think it's an important one. There are currently criteria pollutants under the ­­ under the Act.

I mean, is this a particular assertion of authority only with respect to greenhouse gases or does it cover any pollutant under the Act?",
  "Can you publish a NAAQ for greenhouse gases?",
  "Okay. Let's pick ­­ there is a pollutant that isn't currently regulated, and science advances to the point where you think it should be regulated. Can you change the 100 and 250 thresholds for that new covered pollutant?",
  "That's the 80 ­­ that's the 8386 question, right?",
  "Well, that has local effects. I mean, everybody knows there's smog in Los Angeles versus Montana, right?",
  "You've got to follow ­­ you've got to follow the plain text of the statute there.",
  "Yeah, but the plan of the statute is 250 tons per year, too; and you've changed that to 100,000 tons per year.",

  "Well, you've got five extra minutes, to be ­­ to be fair. And one thing ­­",
  "You had already gotten going, I didn't want to disturb ­­ you don't think that greenhouse gases should be regulated at the 250­tons­per­year level, right? You said Congress did not intend that, and it would be absurd.",
  "So what level do you think they should be regulated at? In other words, what intelligible principle are you taking from the statute to say we're going to ­­ we're at 100 now. We're going to aim for 50 or ­­ in other words, if you had all the resources you need, what level would you pick as the proper one ­­",

  "When the bank got it, it was worth $200,000, but all of a sudden it's, you know, Love Canal or something, and it's worth nothing.",

  "Well, what if they get ­­ they get the house and as soon as they get it, there are ten offers at $500,000 or more, and the amount of the restitution is, you know, $300,000 or whatever. But the bank says, you know, I think the market is going to go even higher, so I'm not going to sell it right away, I'm going to wait, not an unreasonable length of time, but I'm going to wait. And then the market craters. I mean, is the same rule then, that they only get what they were able to sell it for?",
  "I know banks like to get rid of property as soon as possible, but, you know, they make decisions at some point, let's wait before we sell this. Is that commercially reasonable?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Green, you have 5 minutes remaining.",
  "Well, but the only reason he would have been trespassing is because, in fact, he did not live in the house as he promised the bank he would when the bank gave him the money.",

  "Well, I'm just saying, the point ­­ you're quite correct, the Federal Circuit was established to bring about uniformity in patent law, but they seem to have a great deal of disagreement among themselves and are going back and forth in particular cases, in this area specifically, about what the appropriate approach is.",
  "Well, what about Judge Moore's point that when you're talking about pure issues of patent law maybe you're right, but when you're talking about baselessness, that's something that the district courts actually have more experience with, whether it's under EAJA, whether it's under AEDPA, whether it's under qualified immunity. That's an issue they see all the time, so maybe they are more expert than the Federal Circuit.",

  "We're deal ­­ we're dealing with a term that could be read in many different ways: exceptional. Right? Maybe that means 1 out of 100; maybe it means 10 out of 100. And why shouldn't we give some deference to the decision of the court that was set up to develop patent law in a uniform way? They have a much better idea than we do about the consequences of these fee awards in particular cases. And since we're just ­­ as Justice Kennedy pointed out ­­ dealing with adjectives ­­ you know, meritless, frivolous, exceptional ­­ why don't give some deference to their judgment?",
  "Do you agree with the Solicitor General's test that fees are authorized when they are ­­ I'm quoting ­­ \"necessary to prevent gross injustice\"?",
  "Well, now, I was surprised at that because I would have thought your friend on the other side would say that. I mean, gross injustice sounds like a very tiny portion of cases; lower than meritless. I mean it's ­­ injustice is bad too. It's doesn't mean you just loss, but there's something very unjust about it. Gross injustice, well, it's just some more adjectives, and it's the test ­­ I gather that's the test you adopt.",

Would it be appropriate for that officer to apply lethal force to prevent the vehicle from resuming the high­speed chase?",

Now, how were the officers supposed to decide on the spot whether there is a greater danger that people are going to get hit by a stray bullet or there is a greater danger that people are going to get hit by the car?",

  "That's a statement that is inconsistent with RFRA, isn't it? The whole point of RFRA is that Congress wanted to provide exceptions for the religious views of particular ­­ including proprietors, individuals.",
  "Yeah. But the wisdom you cited is the idea that you don't have imposed, on the basis of religious beliefs, exemptions or ­­ or limitations. And it seems to me that was the whole point of RFRA, to tell the courts that that is exactly what you should do unless the exception satisfies the strict scrutiny test.",

Whether it applies in the other situations is ­­ is a question that we'll have to await another case when a large publicly­traded corporation comes in and says, we have religious principles, the sort of situation, I don't think, is going to happen.",
  "Well, that's a question of State corporate law. It's not a question of who can bring an action under RFRA. Could I just raise ­­ eight courts of appeals, every court of appeal to have looked at the situation have held that corporations can bring racial discrimination claims as corporations. Now, does the government have a position on whether corporations have a race?",
  "So that ­­ so that a corporation does have a race for purposes of discrimination laws.",

  "Those were decisions ­­ those were decisions that Congress made, right?",
  "Well, the grandfathering is not a decision that Congress made, is it?",
  "Well, but that of course is an issue that's being hotly litigated right now, right? Whether the employees can get the coverage when you're talking about the religious organizations.",
  "But you're relying ­­ you're relying on it to make your point with respect to the accommodation, and then you're criticizing your friend for relying on the same thing in making his points.",
  "Well, if Congress feels as strongly about this as you suggest, they can always pass an exemption, an exception to RFRA, which they have done on other occasions. And they haven't done it here.",
  "Well, we've already discussed that there is no case holding that they can't, right?",
  "I'm sorry, I lost track of that. There is no law on the books that does what?",

It's violating traffic regulations, which is the broken taillight. I understood my colleague's question to be there is no objective security rationale.",
  "Well, no. I thought the question was there's no differential security rationale. In other words, maybe it's not the question my colleague asked, but I'll ­­",
  "­­ I'll ask it.",
  "Let's say you have to move the President in an emergency situation. You've got two options, go through the anti­Bush crowd or go through the pro­Bush crowd, and you've got to do it right away. Is it a justified security rationale to say that we think it's more likely that it will be problematic if you evacuate the President through the anti­Bush crowd than through the pro­Bush crowd?",
  "So in other words, the viewpoint itself constitutes a security consideration?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wilker.",
  "Mr. Wilker, let's say something happens back in the patio area where you ­­ you're the head of the Secret Service detail. You've got to evacuate the President right away. Do you go through the anti­Bush crowd or through the pro­Bush crowd? You've got to decide right now quickly. I'm serious. You have to make a split­second decision. Which way do you go?",
  "No, no. They are both the same. That was one of your propositions, that there is no way to distinguish there. It's too late. You've taken too long to decide. It's a serious point.",
  "You've got to decide like that.",
  "No. I know. But if we're trying to decide whether viewpoint can ever be a security justification, we have to consider all of the possible situations. So again, if you had to decide right now do you go through the anti­Bush crowd or the pro­Bush crowd? Guns are going off, explosions. Which way do you go?",
  "Really?",
  "Well, but with respect, my point is that we do have to adopt a general principle, and if we say viewpoint can never be a consideration, then you have to say when there is an emergency going on, it's just as likely there will be a problem if we go through the pro­Bush demonstrators or the anti ones, which seems to me to be, on its face, implausible.",
  "So then you think there ­­ well, there may be situations in which viewpoint alone may be a security consideration.",
  "Well, Iqbal says a little bit more than that, not that you just have to allege facts. In Iqbal, and just quoting here from page 681, the Court goes on to consider the factual allegations in the complaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement, and they go on to say, but given more likely explanations, they do not plausibly establish this purpose. So based on just your complaint, we have to determine whether there are more likely explanations. And we have in your complaint the idea that they are at the front of the alleyway, it's a six­foot wooden fence. Can we ­­ we certainly can look at those in deciding not simply whether you've pled the cause of action, but whether it's more plausible than those other justifications.",
  "That's what we said in ­­",
  "Just to make sure, we're talking about the 15 minutes between ­­",
  "Between when and when?",
  "Right.",
  "And the first ­­ they first cleared the alley, right?",
  "And then the movement that you're concerned about.",
  "Now, doesn't it make sense, just hypothetically, if you're the Secret Service agent and you suddenly have this challenge dropped in your lap at the last minute, you say, okay, here's the thing, the first thing we've got to do is clear the alley, right, because that's right up against where he's standing. So you take care of that. You clear the alley. Then after you have more time to assess the situation, you say, okay, now we've got to get these people who are at the foot of the alley, we've got to move them. In other words, they had to act not in an emergency situation, but reasonably quickly and they did it step by step.",
  "But here's where we get back to Iqbal. It doesn't have to be so compelling. It simply has to be more likely, is the quote from Iqbal on 681, and it has to be an obvious alternative explanation. And that's enough, no matter what you've alleged.",
  "So discovery is your answer. And of course it is. You've got allegations. You're going to go to trial. The first thing you're going to do is file interrogatories, you're going to file requests for admission, you're going to file discovery requests to the Secret Service. And the district court's going to have to allow some of that, isn't he, if he's allowed your allegations to go forward?",
  "The first thing you'd want ­­ I say the first thing you'd want to know is whether this was a departure from established policy. So the first question in ­­ if I were drafting interrogatories would be, what is your policy with respect to moving demonstrators at a presidential event? What do you do? And I can see the Secret Service saying, well, that's kind of a bad thing to make it public because there are people out there who want to kill the President, and if you go through your discovery and say, this is how we look at that situation, this is what we do, that gives people a ­­ a guideline for how to break through the security arrangements.",
  "I suppose you would then seek discovery with respect to those 12 other episodes, because you're saying those are viewpoint discrimination, how can you decide until you know the facts of those?",
  "The same range of things that we talked about earlier: Interrogatories, requests for production, discovery, with respect, not just to your case, but to the 12 others?",

  "I mean, part of ­­ I'm sorry. If you want to ­­",
  "I mean, the dilemma we're talking about, which is you've got inside information and if you do something with it, it's going to hurt the beneficiary, I mean, isn't that just a reflection of the fact that these are really bad investments? I mean, you're putting all your eggs in one basket. Your ­­ your ­­ your job depends on the company and your ­­ your retirement depends on the company.",
  "So that's why you're in this awkward position of saying if the company is doing something bad, you know, having inside ­­ inside information that should be disclosed because it affects the stock price, then it's going to hurt not only the company, but also your retirement stock.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Long. Mr. Mann.",
  "Well, but affected is not quite enough. I mean, this trustee's job is to buy the company's stock. In that particular fund, it's 100 percent, other than the money you need to buy and sell. So he has the easiest job in the world. He gets up in the morning and says, \"I think I will buy some of this company's stock.\"",
  "That's what he's supposed to do. And I think that what every Court of Appeals has recognized is that that is by definition prudent, because that is the settlor's objective with one exception. If everything is going, you know, south and the company's collapsing, well, then he does have the obligation to do something. So I don't understand how you keep ­­ can say that he has breached a fiduciary duty of prudence when the people investing in this ought to know what they're going to get is the company's stock.",
  "Well, what is exactly the duty of prudence? Presumably, you buy ­­ you invest the funds in the company's stock, whether it's going up or going down, right? If you have the funds, all you can do is invest them. The stock is down half a point or whatever. You still buy it, right?",
  "Well, what's the answer to my question?",
  "No, no. I didn't ask a question about the duty of loyalty.",
  "I asked a question of whether or not the trustee is imprudent because he buys the stock because it's gone down ­­ you know, gone down 10 percent.",
  "Well, can we talk concretely instead of just saying, well, they've got to do what a prudent fiduciary can do? Are they allowed to take into account the impact of a decision to stop buying on the beneficiaries? The stock is going down, if the trustee stops buying, that's going to cause a drop in the value of the shares and that's going to hurt the beneficiaries. So what does he do? Does he say, I shouldn't buy any more because I think it's going to go down some more? Or should he say, I should keep buying because otherwise all of the holdings, and this is all they are invested in, their holdings are going to go down?",
  "I asked for an answer to the question. And I ­­ it doesn't ­­ it's not going to help me to have this mantra as opposed to ­­",
  "The status of the trustee, whether it's an interested party or a disinterested fiduciary, is disclosed to the beneficiaries, I take it, at the outset? They can decide that they don't want to invest in that particular fund and there are nine other options because of that potential conflict?",
  "If they wanted ­­ they got four percent matching funds if they were in that fund?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "Well, what exactly, concrete terms, what do you do as the trustee? You have this information, inside information that says that the stock is overvalued. Do you sell? In which case the beneficiaries' holdings go way down and they sue you, or do you not sell? In which case when the information comes out, the beneficiaries sue you because their value goes down. What are you supposed to do?",

  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kneedler?",
  "Counsel, I don't have a very good understanding about how this works in practice. Let's say that the discovery request on a French bank, the prevailing party has reason to believe that this is where Argentina deposits its rental income from properties around the United States. They know, they think they know, that Argentina has ­­ you know, owns a townhouse that it rents out in the United States, and they think they will be able to discover where that is by going to the French bank account and saying, well, every month they get $10,000 from this address in the United States. Can that be discovered or not?",
  "So they can ­­ so the defendant that ­­ the prevailing party files a request saying, give us anything that has anything to do with assets in the United States on the French bank and that's fine?",
  "Do you leave out the diplomatic ­­",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Olson?",
  "What exactly does that have to do with the issues before this case?",
  "It seems to me that that context is totally irrelevant. You have a question, it doesn't matter what the basis of the underlying judgement is. The question is one of discovery.",
  "I'm sorry. Finish ­­",
  "Well, but doesn't that seem pretty extraordinary? You just said you can get a discovery about a plane that says Argentine Air Force on the side of it. That seems, to me, to go to the heart of what the Deputy Solicitor General was talking about. That's pretty intrusive at a sovereign level to say you can find out how many jet fighters Argentina happens to have.",
  "Just before you get over there, I thought your position was that yes, you can ask for discovery related to, you know, the Argentine Air Force.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Blackman, you have 3 minutes remaining.",

  "Well, you ­­ you insist that they ­­ there has actually been a probable cause finding that their speech would violate the law before they would have standing?",
  "Even in a case like this, where the procedures can be triggered by any citizen in the State?",
  "Is that a realistic proposition? I mean, first of all, in the first place, surely you don't expect them to come in and say, I'm going to say something totally false and I'm afraid I might be prosecuted for that. But then you have to say they have ­­ you would never imagine that somebody else might think in a hotly contested election that their speech is false?",
  "How many proceedings have been brought under this Ohio statute?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Murphy?",
  "Are you ready ­­",
  "Are you prepared to represent to us that if they do the exact same thing the next election that they did in the last one, that you will not take action against them?",
  "I guess it was in the case of COAST; the problem is other people are going to be intimidated from helping them engage in their political speech. What was it, a billboard? The billboard company said ­­",
  "­­ I'm not going to let you put your sign up on my billboard, I might be liable. So, I mean, they may have a certain fortitude and proceeding based on all the reasons that you've given, but they need third parties to help carry out their message and there is no reason to think those third parties have any commitment to their political message at all and the slightest whiff of, oh, this is going to be legal trouble, they say, forget about it.",
  "Well, no, but a defamation action, people sue everybody all the time. No one's going to take that seriously. In fact, it's probably going to redound to the benefit of SBA and COAST to say the congressman is, you know, bringing a defamation action. It highlights it, but it's another thing to have the State involved making a determination that there's probable cause that you lied.",
  "Well, how many of those do you know were mooted out by the election?",
  "In other words, the proceedings are going on and people's speech is being chilled and it's back and forth, then the election is over, and people say, oh, forget about it.",
  "500. You gave us some answers about how many of the 500 resulted in criminal prosecutions. And all I want to know is how many of the 500 proceedings were mooted out by the fact that the election took place.",
  "Well, that will speed things up.",
  "You don't even want ­­ you don't even want the district court to decide it. You want to go through a certification process that will bring in a whole another court system.",

  "Just to make sure I've got ­­ there's no reason it's a user­specific copy, is it? They're making 10,000 copies. It'd be much easier for you if you'd just have to make one copy and everybody could get a copy.",
  "Surely, you can make a program where you have just one copy and starting it at different times. You don't need every viewer to have his own copy.",
  "That's just saying your copy is different from my copy.",
  "But that's the reason we call them copies, because they're the same.",
  "All I'm trying to get at, and I'm not saying it's outcome determinative or necessarily bad, I'm just saying your technological model is based solely on circumventing legal prohibitions that you don't want to comply with, which is fine. I mean, that's ­­ you know, lawyers do that. But I'm just wondering why ­­",

  "Justice Alito.",
  "Counsel, could I ­­ we hear that argument a lot, that there's never been any showing of any problem in these other circuits. But do you have any study to support that? I mean, is it ­­ I don't know that we ­­ how you would tell. I mean, because these ­­ these proceedings, not everybody is going to say I'm going to appeal, particularly facing the IRS, and go forward. Do you have any basis for the argument that this has not been a problem in the other circuits other than the fact that what, we haven't had a case yet or the courts of appeals haven't had a case?",
  "Well, not necessarily great. One thing that ­­ when we articulate a new standard, sometimes we like to apply it to the particular case to give clearer guidance over exactly what we mean.",
  "And in this case ­­ and particularly here when we're not being asked to resolve a legal question in the particular case, we're just trying to say what do you need to show a hearing ­­ require a hearing. They've got more ­­ you know, they've got more than just a bare allegation. They've got the summons ­­ first of all, it's the third request for an extension. They've got the summons immediately after they refuse to grant it. They've got a contention that this is to circumvent the Tax Court's limits. They support that by the fact that when Moog came for the deposition, you only had the Tax Court lawyers there, not Mr. Freefielder who was ­­ Frierfielder, who was running the investigation. That's more than just a bare allegation.",
  "There were ­­ there were three or four, not two.",
  "I'm sorry. Maybe because it's a tax case, if you could slow down just a little bit.",
  "No. It's a little bit more than that. It's the third request for an extension. And how often does the IRS request the taxpayers to waive the statute of limitations?",
  "Well, I know. But Congress has established these statutes of limitations, and the IRS has enormous leverage. They're sitting here saying, well, we could file this thing saying you owe $150,000 in taxes or you might ­­ or you could give us more time and we'll think about it longer. And my sense, just from looking at the cases that come in and cert petitions, that happens almost always. They're always saying give us more time, give us more time. And I don't know how many times it happens three different times ­­ I mean three successive ­­",
  "And we want you to do it within whatever the statute of limitations period is.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Marod.",
  "What is it that you want to ask ­­ I suspect at this hearing you want to call her?",
  "What do you want to ask her?",
  "Without ­­ without giving up your ­­",
  "Without giving up the element of surprise.",
  "What ­­ what general areas of inquiry would you like to explore?",
  "In your ­­ in your experience, how often does the IRS ask a taxpayer to waive the statute of limitations?",
  "I suspect that's your judgment. But in your experience, how often do they do it?",
  "Thank you, counsel. 4 minutes, Ms. Harrington.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 13­339, CTS Corporation v. Waldburger. Mr. Murray.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Murray. Mr. Palmore.",
  "Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Korzen.",
  "Well, and the whole purpose of a statute of repose is ­­ is very different. That's to give you a drop, you know, completely finish date, so whatever was ­­ was latent or not latent, it's over with. It's a different purpose than a statute of limitations.",
  "Well, why would you ­­ why would these four States have two of them then? I mean, if they are doing the same thing, why have two different ones?",
  "Well, it depends whether they have a discovery rule or not, whether it's a period when an action may be brought or whether it's a period after which an action may not be brought. And the whole purpose of this was to require a discovery rule. And once you require a discovery rule, the statute of repose has completely independent meaning, complete ­­ serves a completely independent office.",
  "Well, but the purpose of the statute of repose is not to preserve latent causes of action. It's quite the opposite. It's to put an end to in particular latent causes of action that haven't been brought.",
  "Well, wait. On the one hand I thought you just told us they were respectful of the States' concerns. And now you say they completely abolished repose periods.",
  "Well, I'm sorry. Not the State law with respect to repose.",
  "But you said it wanted to have polluters on the hook, but they didn't even take ­­ if the State did not have any basis of recovery, this did nothing about that at all. It did not ­­ it did not require States to adopt particular remedies or extend the remedies to cover this. If they didn't have remedies for this type of action, the act ­­ the provisions we're talking about now did nothing about that at all.",
  "Is there any sign that that's happening? I mean, it seems to me that these are, as you know, rare and have been rare for some time, right? I mean ­­ do you really expect States to start suddenly enacting statutes of repose?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Murray, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13­369, Nautilus v. Biosig Instruments. Mr. Vandenberg.",
  "But it can't mean any spacing, because anyone skilled in the art would know the hand has to cover it. So you're basically talking about a fairly narrow range between one side of the hand and the other and not too close together but they don't ­­ don't work. And that seems to me that someone skilled in the art can just try a couple of things and see where ­­ where the trial and error. Trial and error makes ­­ could mean a very difficult thing, like Edison discovering what works in a light bulb. But here you've got a very limited range and someone skilled in the art will just, well, let's try it, you know, close to the middle, let's try it to so far apart. But it's not any spaced relationship.",
  "Do you ­­ do you have any disagreement with a standard that's articulated by the Solicitor General? He says that, you know, a patent satisfies the requirement if, in light of the specification and the prosecution history, a person skilled in the art would reasonably understand the scope of the claim.",
  "Well, that's what I'm having trouble dealing with. I would suspect your friends on the other side will say yes, right, that they accept that, too. And you say, but it can't be insolubly ambiguous or not amenable to construction. And they say, well, that's not really what the Federal Circuit said. So until we get to the application, I don't see much disagreement among any of you about the standard or what's wrong with the Federal Circuit's articulation. And the questions kind of suggest we move very quickly into the particular invention and the application. And I'm just ­­ I'm curious what you want us to do if it seems like in every case, we have to get right into the application rather than the legal standards.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Harris.",
  "So it was fair, as I suggested earlier, nobody agrees with that formulation; right?",
  "Is it part of an answer to Justice Breyer's question that the diagram shows them equally spaced or is that not relevant?",
  "What ­­ what about the case that he postulated, an abstract one, where you have two perfectly reasonable constructions. What ­­ what happens then?",
  "Could I ­­ could I just go back to my ­­ you know, the two reasonable. Is there a range? The Chevron ­­ the Chevron analogy again comes to mind. Let's say one is more reasonable than the other, but they're both reasonable. What type of range do you have before you say that the patent is invalid?",
  "You mean the answer?",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Gannon.",
  "But you say something like \"appreciably better,\" that's a term that may acquire meaning over time. Just like reasonableness, we get a good sense of what it means. Is it your sense that the Federal Circuit has been applying its test in this case? I mean, not in this case but in a series of cases that is ­­ it is close to appreciably better or is it something quite different?",
  "Yeah, nobody likes those phrases ­­",
  "Are you finished with your answer?",
  "Can you do it in a sentence?",

  "Yes, but it was expressly distinguished in Morris.",
  "Those are two very different things. You spend a fair amount of time in your brief talking about court of appeals decisions from other circuits. But I think it's a little bit of a heroic leap to assume that employees are familiar with court of appeals decisions in their own circuit. Do you really think we should be looking at the opinions from other circuits in deciding whether the law was clearly established in a different circuit?",
  "Well, if you say the Eleventh Circuit is out on its own, it seems to me to be a concession that their law is different from the law that you're arguing for. And, again, my point is: Do you ask a ­­ a State employee to recognize, yes, this is the law in the Eleventh Circuit, but they're out on their own. So we're going to follow a ­­ a different law?",

  "Well, what is he ­­ what is he supposed to do? I mean, he gets a subpoena, and the ­­ the other side or somebody, this independent counsel, says, you know, what's going on? What do you know about, you know, from your job responsibilities? What happened or did you ­­ is this person taking money? Is this person showing up? What's he supposed to do? He says, gosh, if I ­­ if I answer, I'm going to lose my job or could, and if I don't or answer falsely ­­ the Fifth Amendment protects him from incriminating himself.

  "But you are suggesting he can be fired if he does it.",
  "When you say it's protected, does that ­­ you mean under the ­­ it qualifies under the first step in Garcetti. It doesn't mean that he can't be disciplined under the Pickering analysis that follows that.",
  "Right. But even if it is, you could say that it is ­­ when you say it's protected, you mean that just it gets to the Pickering analysis, not that ­­ not that the employee is ­­",
  "Really? Well, let's say it's ­­ his job is to investigate corruption in the agency.

Surely he can be disciplined for that. I mean, let's say the ­­ his superiors were not ready to call off the investigation at that point.",
  "Well, I thought it was just because the facts came from your employment. If you're conducting an investigation and you find out that, you know, so­and­so is taking a bribe because that's your job, I don't know that you have a First Amendment right to go out and say that, when, for example, your superior would say, oh, we are about to set up a sting operation, we are going to get the ­­ the goods on her.

Obviously, in some sense, anybody who is supporting the loan, you know, you can describe, well, they're applying for it.

  "If ­­ that may be a problem with the FAA. But the FAA was adopted because State courts were hostile to arbitration and Congress didn't like that. Now, how were they hostile to arbitration? They were hostile to arbitration by adopting special rules of contract interpretation that disfavored arbitration. And in those instances, what the FAA says is that that's what they wanted to stop, special rules of contract interpretation, ordinarily a matter of State law, but not when it's hostile to the FAA. And what could be more hostile to the FAA than to interpret a phrase that says nothing about the FAA to dispense with our holdings about ­­ as they came about ­­ our holdings about what the FAA has to say. And to do that even though there's a provision in the contract that says this is governed by the FAA.",
  "In other words, I understand ­­ I'm sympathetic to the notion that this is a matter of State contract interpretation, but that is precisely what the FAA was getting after, State judges interpreting contracts under special rules hostile to arbitration.",

  "­­ surely, that's a Federal question.",
  "I guess I don't understand why it's a question of way out of bounds or slightly out of bounds. It's a question of whether it demonstrates hostility to arbitration. And I think the way you show that is you say, well, look, here they found a number of provisions illegal, and they struck the whole thing. Here, every other case that's not about arbitration, when they find a couple of provisions illegal, they just sever those; they keep ­­ you know, try to keep in effect the rest of the agreement. That's a different rule for arbitration contracts than other contracts. It's not a question of way out of bounds or way in bounds. It may be a hard question in some cases; it may be easy in others. But it's a very simple question of ­­ of what the rule is. The rule is does it demonstrate hostility to arbitration contracts?",
  "That's ­­ I understand the point and ­­ but, as I understand the arbitration law, if you have an arbitration agreement, says you're going to arbitrate workplace disputes, but not safety disputes ­­",
  "­­ and if there's an issue, is this a safety dispute or not, that's covered by the arbitration agreement. The arbitrator decides that.

  "Well, presumably, the Kansas Supreme Court is familiar with Michigan v. Long, as we are, and they're on notice that if they start putting the Federal authorities mentioning the Eighth Amendment 8 times, that the court is going to look at it as a decision based on Federal law. The whole point of Michigan v. Long was that ­­ so that we wouldn't have to do what we've been doing for the last 10 minutes, which is to debate whether a decision that mentions both State and Federal law is based on State or Federal law.",
  "So anything ­­ anything that was presented to them. I think you said earlier burden of production.",

  "Okay. Now, if ­­",
  "Right.",
  "What was the other one?",
  "The incentive award?",
  "You ­­ is there any concern that a plaintiff who has received or has been offered all relief that he could receive is an appropriate representative plaintiff of parties who have not gotten all the relief?",

  "No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.",
  "The injury they identify is we don't think companies should public false ­­ publish false information about you. Is it the end of the standing inquiry to say they published false information about me, or do you have to ask were you injured in some way by that publication?",
  "So it's in ­­ so what ­­ what would you say the injury in fact, not in law but in fact, is in that case?",
  "But our cases have always said actual injury in fact. And I thought that meant that that was different than actual injury in law. You're saying when we say injury in fact, we really mean injury in fact or injury in law?",
  "That's a very different question. I understand generalized grievance. You can't just say ­­ even I think you gather ­­ any citizen in the United States can sue about this. You have to particularize it to some extent. But that's a different question as to whether there's actual injury.",
  "Justice Alito.",
  "I thought they had some ­­ I thought they had some disclaimer that Spokeo does not verify or evaluate each piece of data, It makes no warranties or guarantees about any of the information offer ­­ offered.",
  "How is that saying if it's not accurate you're a ­­ he's a liar?",
  "I think that's what the disclaimer is saying.",
  "But I want to ­­ as I understand ­­ I take the falsity out of the ­­ the hypotheticals to get exactly what your position is on the ­­ the breadth of Congress' power. So let's say the statute says anybody who's publishing information about you has to pay the individual $10 a year. They think that's a good way to regulate it. It's information about you, good, bad, or indifferent, pay them $10 a year, no more, no less. Spokeo, or whatever that business is, pays you $20 one year. Now you've been ­­ the statute has been violated with respect to you, a particular individual. Can that ­­ and there's statutory damages of $10,000. Can that individual sue?",
  "Now, does that individual have injury in fact because the statute has been violated with respect to him?",
  "Oh, no, no, no. You have to have published information about an individual. Every individual who you publish information about gets $10 a year.",
  "So there'd be no standing ­­ that person would have no standing, even though Congress gave him standing?",
  "Yes.",
  "So if the statute ­­",
  "­­ says $10, no more, no less, he gets $20, does he have standing to sue under that statute?",
  "No, no, no. Any ­­ you have ­­ I said this just before. They have to have published information about you. If they don't, they don't have to pay you anything.",
  "The Ninth Circuit didn't address that question, did it? I mean, as I understand it, I'm looking at the footnote, you know, on page 9A, it says it doesn't matter because you ­­ the statutory injury in law is enough.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart.",
  "Mr. Stewart, let's say your ­­ your ­­ Congress thinks that the president is not doing enough to stop illegal immigration. So it passes a law that says, anyone in a border state ­­ so it's particularized ­­ who is unemployed may bring an action against an illegal immigrant who has a job. And they get damages, maybe they get an injunction. Can Congress do that?",
  "Well, I think that's kind of avoiding the hypothetical. I mean, let's ­­",
  "But presumably you would raise those issues after the action's been filed, and ­­ and, you know, you could raise those issues as an amicus defending the action.",
  "Yes, we're talking about Congress says, Well, these people who are unemployed, illegal immigrants have jobs, they should be able to sue to stop that because the ­­ you know, because they ­­ Congress thinks the president isn't doing enough.",
  "I mean, you know the ­­ you know the objection behind ­­ behind my hypothetical.",
  "Which is Congress can say, basically, to a group of citizens, you get to enforce one of our laws because we're giving you a cause of action. It doesn't matter whether you've actually been injured or not; we just have to particularize it to some extent. And I would have thought that the ­­ the president would be concerned about Congress being able to create its own enforcement mechanism. I thought that you would be concerned that that would interfere with the executive's prerogatives.",
  "How ­­ how ­­ the difference is that this is dealing with the requirement of a case or controversy which has always been recognized as at the core of Article III jurisdiction. And we have a legion of cases that say you have to have actual injury. That's what makes it a decision appropriate for resolution by the judicial branch. And it seems a little bit more important than saying you can challenge particular statutes.",
  "Was it ­­ then that's not what the Ninth Circuit based its decision on. The Ninth Circuit says he had standing by virtue of the alleged violations of his statutory rights, without respect to whether there was harm to his employment process or related anxiety.

But that doesn't necessarily mean that you would include the jurisdictional element when you're saying, well, what does the crime ­­ what is the ­­ what is the harm or evil sought to be prevented? And in a statute like this, it seems to me that that's what Congress is concerned about, not the technical elements like, for example, venue. I mean, is venue an element if it's listed under the ­­ the criminal provision? Well, sure. It's an element that could have to be proved depending on the terms of the statute.

  "Yes, but Congress is talking about, okay, they have to pay the filing fee. Certainly Congress didn't focus, I wouldn't think, on whether it's ­­ well, I assume they didn't focus on whether it's per case or per prisoner, because it's really quite unclear.",
  "I wanted to talk about that. I ­­ the first reading, two struck me as different than one, because in ­­ in one you're talking about, oh, this is what the Court should do. But on two you say this is what's required of the prisoner, and it just says up to 20 percent. Now I know one says required two, but it immediately shifts its ­­ he's required to pay the whole thing, and that's the important point. But ­­ but two, it says this is what's required of the prisoner, monthly payments of 20 percent of the preceding month's income.",
  "To me that seems to be more a prisoner focus than a case­by­case.",
  "I'm not sure that's responsive to my point. I guess what I was saying is I don't think it carries forward the case­by­case basis because it speaks solely of what's required of the prisoner in a way that doesn't address case by case at all. I mean, that's why this is such a confusing statute.",
  "Of 20 percent of the preceding month's income. To me, I ­­ well, I would think at least as reasonable as you're reading, to say when you look at what is required of the prisoner, 20 percent of his income, that doesn't have anything to do case by case, because what you would require, of course, is that he pay 40 percent if there are two cases, or 60 percent if there are three, or all of it, if it's above $10. And I think he ­­ anyone ­­ someone looking at that may say, no, he's only supposed to pay 20 percent of his income.",
  "Well, yes, but he doesn't get off the hook for the other ones. It's just ­­ has to pay it further down, you know, it's ­­ it's like a mortgage. I mean, you get 30 years, you have to pay it further down. If you're on 15 years, you have to pay it less.",
  "I mean, it's not like he's getting off Scott­free.",
  "Well, he pays the 20 percent in every case right away.",
  "You agree with that interpretation?",
  "Then I don't think it's fair to rely on it.",
  "Ms. Saharsky, I find ­­ I ­­ I think others may too. I find the issue that's before us very difficult to resolve based on the statutory language. Is there any doctrine tantamount to the rule of lenity in interpreting a criminal statute that applies here? Because the thing that strikes me most is the extreme harshness of your position. We're talking about earning 23 cents an hour, filing fees of $350, $505. And the money is used to ­­ for what? Phone calls to family and friends, stamps for letters, and to buy books. And you're going to take the last, you know, whatever so that someone who's in there for 20 years can't even buy a book? That seems very, very harsh. And you seem to be willing to interpret the ambiguity in the statute to save the last $10, but you're unwilling to interpret what I think at least I regard as the ambiguity in the statute to allow prisoners ­­ I mean, they are prisoners.

  "Just a thought. Well, if you're there for 20 years, maybe you should let them buy a book.",
  "I'm sure they are ­­ I'm sure they are very good libraries, too.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Oh, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14­990, Shapiro v. McManus. Mr. Kimberly.",
  "Well ­­ I'm sorry. Well ­­ I'm sorry, why don't you ­­",
  "What do you do if your argument in ­­ in a case that might go before a three­judge court is that the Court's precedents should be overruled? It's clearly foreclosed by the Court's precedents, but maybe there's a very good argument that the ­­ those precedents are ­­ haven't withstood the test of time or whatever. What happens then?",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "But it's a very difficult line you're drawing, and ­­ and I understand Bell v. Hood. But you're saying he can't do it. He can't determine that the three­judge court is not required just because the plaintiffs are wrong, but he can make that determination if they are really wrong. And ­­ and your brief in the analysis and all this, it ­­ it is always ­­ it's ­­ it's like a thesaurus. It's just a collection of adjectives that all mean \"frivolous,\" \"insubstantial,\" you know. And I'm not sure it gives a great deal of guidance to ­­ to a court.",
  "Well, you call it ­­ I guess my concern ­­ you call it a rule, but it's really not much of a rule. It's just kind of a ­­ I don't know, a sense that something is ­­ is really bad, as I guess I said earlier, as opposed to just bad. And I think that's an awfully fuzzy line to ­­ to draw, but fuzzy in ­­ in when you're talking about jurisdiction where you like to have very precise and clear rules.",
  "Let me get back to the question Justice Kagan asked. It was certainly the case when the law was enacted that the three­judge court was viewed as an anti­plaintiff provision. The idea was that single judges were too quickly issuing injunctions, you know, blocking the State enactments, and they thought that would be less likely if you had three judges. I'm not sure if that's still true today, but it certainly was when the law was passed.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sullivan.",
  "I mean, the other alternative is it's a three­judge district court, and then we have to take it on the merits. I mean, that's a serious problem because there are a lot of cases that come up in three­judge district courts that would be the kind of case ­­ I speak for myself, anyway ­­ that we might deny cert in, to let the issue percolate. And now with the three­judge district court, no, we have to decide it on the merits.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kimberly, you have 11 minutes left.",
  "So now you have ­­ now you have cases quite often, particularly in the most sensitive ones, decided by a vote of two to one. So I don't know how that ­­ how that particular answer is very responsive to the concern that Justice Breyer has pointed out, which ­­ which is one I share.",
  "Just to follow up: In ­­ in recent years, is it true that in reapportionment cases, the majority of the way we've handled direct appeals has been summarily?",
  "No, no. I'm just talking statistically.",
  "When you say \"taking\" them, I mean, they're being presented to us. We have no choice, but taking ­­",

  "Counsel, if ­­ if you prevail here and are representing a fund, what would you advise them to do so they don't confront this result in the future?",
  "When you say \"they act promptly,\" what do they act promptly to do? And is it always the case that they can act promptly enough?",
  "Well, presumably in the ­­ in the hypothetical, your ­­ your opposing counsel will be advising the recipient to, I ­­ I suppose, spend it right away, because then there won't be anything left; it will have been dissipated, or put it in different accounts, or ­­ or commingle it with, you ­­ you know, a variety of things. And I'm just wondering if the solution you're advocating is going to make life a lot more complicated and expensive for the funds, which is, of course, contrary to the idea of preserving the assets.",
  "How ­­ how do you find ­­ how does the Plan find out that there's been a settlement?",
  "I'm sorry. The lawsuit between who and whom?",
  "You mean by the beneficiary to recover ­­",
  "­­ the tort claim?",
  "And how is the Plan notified of that?",
  "Would it basically, ignoring the impact of that letter by a beneficiary, be a basis for the sort of fraud action you were talking about earlier?",
  "So the ­­ the beneficiary, even the beneficiary's counsel gets a letter saying, by the way, we have a lien on this, you know, good luck. I hope you recover a fair amount. But if you do, make sure you put it in a separate account. Make sure you notify us. And ­­ and if the beneficiary or the lawyer just ignores that, that's not a basis for fraud?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders.",
  "You thought ­­ you thought ­­",
  "But you thought Great­West adopted a ­­ a narrower understanding of what equitable meant in this context than you thought was appropriate.",
  "All ­­ all of those things you say ­­ all of those things you say the Plan can do, though, are ­­ are a lot more complicated than simply saying they should be able to recover that to which they're entitled under the agreement. And when you get into ­­ we've noted before that we try to avoid complicating the procedures in this area, for the simple reason that nobody has to set up one of these plans. And if they don't know, you know, how much it's going to cost in advance and all of them just say, well, it's not worth it, and if I've got to go and file injunctions or this or that every time somebody makes a ­­ has a tort recovery, you know ­­ but I'm not going to do it. I won't set up one of these plans.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal.",
  "It has to be pretty easy for you to protect yourself, doesn't it, as soon as at some suitable time after the injury you do write a letter to the person and say, look, you need to know that if you sue somebody, the money is ours, and because we have these rights of subrogation, or let us know if you're going to, and we'll show up in court with you and ­­ and ­­ and help you? Where ­­ see, I guess it would probably be pretty easy to ­­ to monitor it yourself. I mean, the court's computerized dockets, you just punch in \"Montanile,\" and ­­ and whenever that pops up on the docket and you find out right away. It's certainly long before the case is resolved. It ­­ it doesn't ­­ I mean, I ­­ I think your friend has ­­ has a significant point that it's actually not as hard as it might appear.",
  "Right. I mean, that's the point we have made in our precedents, but it can't ­­ you can't carry that so far that otherwise you would say, well, the Plan always wins.",
  "Well, I don't know that you can read our precedence in this area to say that they're very flexible. I mean, Sereboff, the difference between equitable lien for restitution and equitable lien by agreement, you ­­ you know, you can get, you know, deficiency judgments as opposed to legal judgments, and whether one's sort of an adjunct to the equitable action or freestanding. It's an area where the ­­ the equity rules strikes me as very technical.",
  "So you don't have priority over other creditors. So if Mr. Montanile owes somebody money, he ­­ it's all right if he takes money from the fund and pays that debt?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stris, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "I'm sorry, counsel. You say he filed a cert petition. Is that on behalf of the same client this year?",
  "Well, I'm just trying to ­­",
  "Are you saying that, because he represented a different client and took a position in that case, he's somehow bound by that here?",
  "Well, I would be surprised by the proposition that lawyers are somehow collaterally estopped if they take a particular position on behalf of one client from taking a different position in a different case.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14­1146, Tyson Foods v. Bouaphakeo. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Justice Sotomayor.",
  "Mr. Phillips, do you have ­­ do you have a theory as to why the jury awarded less than half of the damages that were requested? Did they ­­ I take it they didn't identify particular workers.",
  "Did they ­­ did they disagree with the 18 minutes, 21 minutes?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick.",
  "Counsel, we don't know why the jury reduced the requested damages by ­­ gave less than half. I mean, it could have been because they thought the evidence on the ones who just put on smocks or whatever as opposed to the ones who had the mesh Armour ­­ you see, I don't believe what you said about the ones who don't put on the mesh Armour, so we're going to give zero dollars on that. But I believe the ­­ the validity of your ­­ the experts' testimony on the ones who put on the mesh Armour, so we're going to award that. Or maybe they thought, you know, they would just discount the whole thing, or ­­ you know, we don't know why. So because they used average statistics over varying jobs with ­­ even your expert admitted varying times, depending upon the classes, there's no way to tell whether everybody who's going to get money was injured or not.",
  "Well, if you have ­­ you have ­­ I understand that, but do you have a substantive answer? Because it's one thing for us to write an opinion saying this is a horrible problem, but they didn't ask for instructions, so don't worry about it.",
  "It's another thing. We need to know whether we should address the ­­ the mechanism by which this was presented to the jury, and then we can deal separately with a waiver issue.",
  "That sounds like the same answer you gave before.",
  "Is there a substantive? Yes. We could say, okay, the problem is they didn't ask for a special verdict. They didn't divide it between the people who were engaged in different functions than the killers, stunners.",
  "And I suppose some of them like to chat while they're putting on the equipment, and others are more down to, you know, let's get this on as quickly as possible. And ­­ and some of them have different sorts of jobs that require different sorts of equipment.",
  "Well, there was not evidence to support that they'd have different equipment that they put on?",
  "So ­­ so your ­­ your submission is that, in fact ­­ well, what ­­ what about 18 and 21? You must have thought there was some difference.",
  "So ­­ so the variation that is ­­ at least troubled some of us, 30 seconds, 10 minutes, you're saying it's not because the 30­second person is actually going to spend 9 1/2 minutes at the end of the walk, and the 10­minute person spent all the time at the beginning of the walk, and there's no difference between the people who clean up and the people who actually slaughter the hogs because the clean­up people are going to slaughter the hogs at four hours at the end of the shift. And the ­­",
  "So ­­ so we should ­­ again, there's a ­­ a basic issue that's presented, but you're saying in addition to avoiding it because of the objection is their lack of objections at all, we should not be reaching the substantive issue because, in fact, there was no variation in the time?",
  "What was it?",
  "Let's see if you remember what she said. What was it?",
  "And ­­ but the ­­",
  "You left boots out.",
  "But ­­ but the knife wielders had a lot more than that.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Prelogar.",
  "Do you think ­­ how do you know they relied on the representative evidence? The number was ­­ was more than 50 percent of what was asked. The expert was cross­examined. We don't know, for example ­­ they rejected the 18 minutes but accepted the 21 minutes. The fact that the jury did not give you the damages sought seems to me to call into question the significance of the statistics.",
  "Well, but they ­­ they saw the evidence on which the calculations were based, right?",
  "They saw the donning and doffing of the sanitary gear and the protective gear. Couldn't they have made judgments based on those actual differences to reject some of the representative statistics?",
  "And maybe you don't know because you're the ­­ in an amicus posture, but was the person who normally is, like, hosing down the floor paid as much as the person who performs the most intricate knifing operation?",
  "And yet, your ­­ both you and your ­­ your friend are telling me that, well, we shouldn't treat those jobs differently because they often switched back and forth.",
  "You ­­ you agree it would be an extension of Mt. Clemens to apply it at the liability stage as opposed to the damages stage, right?",
  "No. Go ahead.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips, you have five minutes.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We will hear argument next in Case 14­419, Luis v. United States. Mr. Srebnick.",
  "What do you do about Monsanto?",
  "Right. So what is the logic that says it doesn't violate the Sixth Amendment if it's tainted funds, but it does if it's untainted funds?",
  "Well, but is ­­ doesn't it make sense the ­­ the sort of substitution rule? I mean, if you've got $10 million in drug activity ­­ money and you had $5 million, and you spent $10 million, you can't say, you know, oh, I spent the drug money, you can't touch the $5 million. It seems to me that's what the statute is doing when it says whatever it's a reasonable substitute or assets substituted for.",
  "How do ­­ I ­­ I don't know how these things actually work. I mean, the defendant obviously has daily expenses, and ­­ and that the government's freeze order apparently goes beyond the money she has. What, does she get an allowance or ­­ or something?",
  "So ­­ so if her ­­ putting aside lawyers, if her daughter's tuition bill comes due, she can't pay that?",
  "But she can surely pay the rent or the mortgage?",
  "I guess you're ­­ I think this may be Justice Sotomayor's point. Your argument, you're distinguishing tainted and untainted assets, and I understand that. I just don't understand that if you can freeze the assets despite the Sixth Amendment when they're tainted, I don't understand why it's not the same rule when they're untainted. You may have ­­ may have statutory arguments, you ­­ but if you have arguments, it has nothing to do with the constitutional right to counsel.",
  "But you're not ­­ you're not looking for CJA rates, are you?",
  "I didn't think so.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.",
  "Well, that was said in the context of the government's submission that there's a difference between tainted and untainted, right? Your ­­ your argument in Monsanto focused on the tainted aspects of the proceeds.",
  "It takes the ­­ it ­ it establishes that right in the same way as the issue here, without counsel on the part of the defendant, because you ­­ I assume Kaley applies to untainted assets as well as untainted.",
  "So add to the context of what Justice Breyer was concerned about. You not only can do that, you can do that without giving the defendant any type of hearing, right?",
  "I thought ­­ I thought under Kaley, the defendant didn't have to be provided a ­­ a hearing with respect to the pretrial ­­",
  "­­ seizure of assets.",
  "Counsel, how ­­ I don't know how these things work. Let's say you get an order freezing the assets, and it's $10 million, and ­­ and the defendant comes into the court, whatever, and says, look, my lawyer is going to cost $100,000, one percent of the assets that are at issue here. Then you would argue, no, even though it's only a tiny fraction of what we're seizing, the Sixth Amendment doesn't even entitle him to one percent of the assets that might ­­ might end up being forfeitable?",
  "How does it work? Like the ­­ you know, the daughter's tuition bill comes due, you know, and it's whoever ­­ you know, who knows how much these days, $60,000. And the defendant cannot pay that?",
  "Well, why was it ­­ why would it be ­­ if he can exercise equitable discretion for the daughter's tuition, why ­­ why not when the Sixth Amendment is at stake? And, you know, counsel of choice, it turns on that, it would seem to me that if there's going to be a case in which equitable discretion will be exercised, it ought to be in that situation.",
  "Well, and they're all cases in which the defendant has not been found guilty. And ­­ and in all those cases, I mean, all you have to do, all the governments have to do, all the State governments have to do, is provide for a fine and argue, then, well, unless we ­­ if we don't freeze the assets, there won't be money left to pay a fine. So this could apply ­­ I guess this is the point. This could apply to every crime on the books.",
  "It goes to the Medicaid trust fund?",
  "The ­­ will go to the victims?",
  "Does that go to the victims in case?",
  "I'm sorry?",

  "Maybe you should ­­",
  "You ­­ you just get your exception out and then answer ­­",
  "Your ­­ your ­­ your argument really does ­­ this is true of all jurisdictional defenses, but I think it's particularly problematic here, which is it encourages gamesmanship. I mean, if you have what you think is an arguable statute­of­limitations argument, you know, take your chance at trial, and if you win, fine, but if you lose, then raise this statute­of­limitations argument.",
  "What's malpractice? It sounds like a ­­ a good practice to me for his client.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Martinez.",
  "Counsel, you can ­­ you can imagine cases, can't you, where the instruction on an additional element could cause prejudice to the defendant?",

  "Well, but I think the government suggests that this is exactly a case where it's not so easy to figure out when the constructive termination was.",
  "When the resignation occurred.",
  "Well, that doesn't mean it was easy or ­­ or hard.",
  "Well, you know that the case ­­ you know, someone says this is ridiculous, I can't take it anymore, I will resign in three months. I mean, what is the date of constructive termination then?",
  "No, no. It's ­­ it's, you know, I think it's fairly common for people to set a resignation date at some point in the future. You know, a schoolteacher will say as soon as this school year is over, I'm out of here.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Carroll.",
  "You say this isn't going to be a problem much. I think it's going to be a problem a lot of times. People are in jobs and they're, you know, suffering this particular type of adverse work environment or discrimination, but quitting your job is a very big deal. I think you have to plan out when that's going to be, and just because you can't take it anymore doesn't mean that you could quit work right away.",
  "Oh, sure, it doesn't require you to quit, it just requires you to tell your boss, you know, I can't take this anymore. And now I've got to conciliate with you, but, you know, it creates complications in the workforce if you raise that type of issue.",
  "I suspect most employers could figure out who is complaining in these types of situations.",
  "What ­­ what is your position on the government's stance?",
  "Factual question.",
  "I think it's an example of the difficulty of trying to figure out when the discrimination occurred if you have this last­act kind of thing.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wolfman, four minutes.",

  "\"This\" being what the ­­ the violation ­­ what you say is the violation of the Federal law.",
  "So do they just have to expand their allegation and say, okay, we're not going to call it \"a Locate,\" but we think it's fraud when you're, you know, short­selling this and you're supposed to have ­­ and you haven't borrowed this much, blah, blah, blah? In other words, just creating a parallel duty ­­ which I understood you to tell Justice Alito that would be okay. Instead, they're using a shorthand, \"the Locate.\" Is that ­­ is that all the ­­ the only difference?",
  "So you would have no ­­",
  "You would have no case if New Jersey passed a law saying, as a matter of New Jersey law, we hereby adopt, you know, everything under the Securities Exchange Act, including, in particular, Regulation SHO. That is State law. We're following the Federal law because, you know, we think it's easier to do that than write up our own securities code. That's fine with you?",
  "Yes, it is. It's saying ­­ it's saying wherever it says Federal law as ­­ we just strike that and put in New Jersey law. They can do that. They can adopt whatever law ­­ source of law they want.",
  "Even though it's precisely the same at the same level of detail, you have to say under your theory that if you sue just under the New Jersey law, that's okay.",
  "Right.",
  "No, the duty under New Jersey law is passed by whatever statute they enact saying we ­­ us too, we want to do it as well, as a matter of New Jersey law.",
  "Yeah.",
  "And as New Jersey ­­ as New Jersey law.",
  "But it seems to me ­­",
  "The only one who benefits from that are ­­ are printing companies. You say they can't say, we adopt Regulation SHO as New Jersey law; they have to actually go ahead and reprint everything that SHO says, and then it's okay.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Stris.",
  "That's a yes­or­no question, counsel.",
  "Well, I just ­­ yes. I mean, but there are parts of your complaint that go in much greater detail and focus on the Federal Rules. I ­­ I think Paragraph 33 says, you know, as set forth in detail herein, the defendants violated the trading rules and regulations requiring that they actually deliver shares they owed to the DTCC to settle short­sale transactions.

  "Well ­­",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Bash.",
  "Well, but a consistent theme in our cases, when you say a mere burden is not enough, is that the government wants employers to, one, set things up ­­ they don't have to ­­ and two, they want the money to go to benefits, not to go to administrative and bureaucracy expenses. Is it your view in analyzing this question, do we look at what would happen if 50 States adopted different programs, or do we look at just Vermont because Vermont happens to be first?",
  "Yeah, I think that's right. So you don't think 50 different regimes of reporting is going to require a significant diversion of money away from benefits to administration?",
  "What kind of a record do you need to show that?",
  "Of course you can't have a record of what 50 States are doing if it's a hypothetical question.",
  "So we go through at one point ­­ all of a sudden there ­­ the 11th State that does this, and it's the 11 different things, we say is that a burden? Is that a sufficient burden? We say no. But then when 30 States do it, maybe it's a different answer. That seems like a very odd preemption analysis.",
  "Well, but this goes to basic, very comprehensive reporting of data. It's not simply, well, if you run a daycare center, you have to comply with the rules about daycare centers. Of course you do. It's quite different. One of the things ERISA plans do is report data and compile data. And it seems to me that the analysis that says, well, daycare centers you can. That seems a little bit off basis.",

  "So you think that ­­ you think the concerns are on the same level: Forcing somebody in a State court to be subjected ­­ a New Yorker to be subject to jurisdiction where everyone's from Massachusetts because it's Massachusetts court.

I mean, the ­­ the preclearance process at the Department of Justice is famously opaque, and usually the States and municipalities have to go through, or had to go through, several layers of back and forth, here's a proposal ­­ it's sort of a bargaining process. I don't know how confident you can be that ­­ that it wasn't necessary.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Brnovich.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Mr. Smith.",
  "Well, let's not ­­ let's talk about that for a second. If action in redistricting or overpopulation would constitute illegitimate racial discrimination, can the answer that we're doing that to comply to get preclearance from the Justice Department legitimize that?",
  "No, my ­­ my question is if the action that is taken would otherwise constitute illegitimate racial discrimination. I'm trying to find out if the Justice Department's procedures can trump the requirements of the Constitution. In other words, it's ­­ it's an issue of ­­ you know, we ­­ we said in Ricci v. DeStefano that it's not an excuse ­­ not a complete excuse for intentional discrimination, that you're trying to avoid liability under Title VII ­­",
  "­­ for discrimination on the basis of effects.",
  "And I'm wondering if it's somehow different. If the Justice Department is insisting on conduct that would constitute a violation, if they're insisting on more than they should be, is that a defense for the ­­ for the redistricting?",
  "I understand that.",
  "But it doesn't say that all bets are off.",
  "Well, it seems to me you're avoiding my question.",
  "What if the requirements that the Justice Department asks for, for preclearance go too far?",
  "Right. So ­­ so whether or not preclearance is a defense depends upon whether the Justice Department is insisting on too much.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington.",
  "Is ­­ is 10 percent really de minimis? I mean, I think you can say it's minor, but de minimis strikes me as misleading when you're talking about 10 percent.",
  "I know it has, yes.",
  "If the ­­",
  "What is the position of the United States on the question of whether it's permissible to intentionally take partisanship ­­ to use partisanship as a guiding principle in redistricting? Is that permissible or not?",
  "I know you haven't. It seems very unfortunate. It's a little difficult for us to address it since that's one of the main questions in the case.",
  "So you're ­­ you're unwilling to tell me whether intentional use of partisanship in redistricting is acceptable or not?",
  "I mean, you don't have a position on whether that's acceptable or not.",
  "There's a difference between something's a necessary evil and saying it's evil.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Harrington. General Hearne, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "But where ­­ where is the district in which ­­ or the State in which partisanship does not play a role in redistricting?",
  "No, please. Finish.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 14­940, Evenwel v. Abbott. Mr. Consovoy.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Keller.",
  "Well, why don't they use that under Section 2, then?",
  "The Voting Rights.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, it is ­­ it is called the one­person, one­vote. That seems to be designed to protect voters.",
  "Do you have any idea how often this is a problem? I mean, it is a case that, of course, around the country, people use total population. But it seems to me that there will be a lot of areas where, in terms of the actual numbers, it's not going to make a difference. Do you have any idea?",
  "But only in ­­ only in those particular handful of ­­",
  "And I'm not suggesting ­­",
  "Well, what if it were you had the same minor or de minimis deviation allowed there? In other words, if you're within ­­ the deviation between total population and voter population was within ­­ under 10 percent, does that take care of many of the areas where it's a problem?",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Gershengorn.",
  "That's often used for Section 2.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Consovoy, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 14­981, Fisher v. The University of Texas at Austin. Before we get started, I'll advise the lawyers that this is our only case this morning, so we intend to grant the parties ten minutes or so of extra time and the amicus five minutes. So Mr. Rein, no need to rush.",
  "Well, but I don't understand. How do you do that?",
  "Could you associate a number with \"the very small\"? I guess it would be the number of students who were admitted with the consideration of race who were not also ­­",
  "Yeah.",
  "Two and a half percent difference in entering class numbers or number of minorities admitted?",
  "The number is important to me. Is it ­­ is what any ­­",
  "I can ask your friend on the other side, but ­­",
  "Of what? Of numbers ­­",
  "But in Parents ­­ in Parents Involved, you indicated that at some point the actual benefit of the program turns out to be not really worth the very difficult decision to allow race to be considered if at the end of the day it generates a certain number. And I'm trying to figure out what that number is.",
  "Right. Right.",
  "The ones who would ­­ the ones who would have made it ­­",
  "I suppose ­­ I suppose if they tender it, you don't have to accept it either, right?",
  "Thank you, Counsel.",
  "Mr. Garre.",
  "And ­­",
  "And you're talking about the 2004 plan?",
  "Excuse me. One of the things that it said is that you would review the plan every five years. Has that happened?",
  "How did you measure ­­ how did you measure whether or not the plan was working ­­",
  "­­ under the review that you undertook?",
  "No. What did you ­­ what did you look to?",
  "Well, you're talking about the time ­­ Grutter said that we did not expect these sorts of programs to be around in 25 years, and that was 12 ­­ 12 years ago. Are ­­ are we going to hit the deadline? Is this going to be done on ­­ in your view in 12 years?",
  "I understand. I don't know whether that's a yes or no. But it was important in the Grutter court that these were a temporary ­­ as necessary, temporary expedience because we're talking about giving you the extraordinary power to consider race in making important decisions. And we don't do that as a matter of ­­ matter of ­­",
  "­­ course. And so it was important in Grutter to say, look, this can't go on forever, 25 years. And when do you think your program will be done?",
  "Well, how ­­ what percentage of the class is ­­ what legacy is that a consideration for?",
  "I'm sorry. That's not ­­ that's not the question. It's whether students selected under the holistic process without giving extra points because of race.",
  "Wait. What are you telling me? The holistic process, if race is not expressly considered, will not result in any minority students?",
  "What ­­ what unique ­­ what unique perspective does a minority student bring to a physics class?",
  "You're counting those among the classes in which there are no minority students. And I'm just wondering what the benefits of diversity are in that situation?",
  "Thank you, Counsel. General Verrilli.",
  "In addition to the ­­ this is in addition to the 10 percent?",
  "But the problem, I guess, which is one issue that we haven't looked at is how do you tell how many of those ­­",
  "­­ would have been admitted if their race were not ­­",
  "If none of that is true, how does the University know when it has achieved its objective?",
  "At what point does it say, okay, the plan has worked?",
  "Okay. So how ­­",
  "­­ how should they do it?",
  "No, no. I understand you disagree with their proposal.",
  "I know you don't agree with their approach.",
  "I'm trying to get at the ­­",
  "­­ at a ­­ at a more concrete ­­ and so to look at what they say they want and see if they've done it, but how do you see it?",
  "The reason I ­­ I think it's a matter of concern is ­­ what I heard from Mr. Garre were a lot of numbers. He said, look, this is why it's needed, and ­­ and, you know, we will know we're doing better when the numbers look better. And I just wonder whether the idea of surveys ­­ I looked at one of these surveys ­­ I don't remember this record or the ­­ the prior one ­­ and I have to say it was kind of sophomoric. I mean, do you feel that you've had enough interactions ­­",
  "­­ with ­­ I mean, that was ­­ this is consideration of race. It's a very serious matter.",
  "And to pass out some survey and see, I don't think is an adequate ­­",

  "Thank you, Mr. Carvin. General DuMont.",
  "But it's not ­­",
  "No. Go ahead. Finish.",
  "It's ­­ it's hard to visualize this in a pure employer­employee relationship, when the collective bargaining agreement, itself, has to be submitted for public review and public comment. That ­­ that suggests that you're doing more than simply regulating the employment relationship.",
  "If your ­­",
  "If your employees have shown overwhelmingly that they want collective bargaining, then it seems to me the free­rider concern that's been raised is ­­ is really insignificant.",
  "What is ­­ you said you agree with that. You agree with that everything they're negotiating over is a public policy question?",
  "Why?",
  "If you disagree with that, what is ­­ what is your best example of something that is negotiated over in a collective bargaining agreement with a public employer that does not present a public policy question?",
  "It's all money. That's money. That's how much money is going to have to be paid to the teachers. If you give more mileage expenses, that costs more money. And the amount of money that's going to be allocated to public education as opposed to public housing, welfare benefits, that's always a public policy issue.",
  "Is there ­­",
  "Is ­­ is there any ­­ is there any legal argument or factual basis on which the State of California disagrees with the position of the union?",
  "Well, we have ­­ I'm trying to sort out. We have, as you know, three Respondents here, and I'm trying to sort out the different position. Is there anything ­­ in ­­ any way in which your presentation disagrees with the union's presentation in its ­­ in its brief?",
  "Thank you, General. Mr. Frederick.",
  "And all of that would still survive if the Petitioners prevail, unless your basic argument that if you do away with agency's ­­ agency fees, the unions are going to collapse and not be in a position to negotiate those safety requirements.",
  "I'm sorry. They're getting additional equipment that the county may not be able to afford?",
  "Well, I ­­",
  "It sounds to me like your argument cuts exactly the opposite way. The ­­ the problem that's before us is whether or not individuals can be compelled to support political views that they disagree with. And you're saying, well, the reason they should be able to, because if they do, then those political views are going to prevail. They are opposed to particular funding. That's why they don't want to join the ­­ that's why they don't want to join the union, because the union is pushing that. But you say you should force them because then the union will prevail, contrary to the objecting employee's views.",
  "Can you ­­ can you ­­ do you think you can find one employee who doesn't?",
  "You don't think.",
  "Justice ­­",
  "Justice Sotomayor.",
  "Mr. Frederick, your ­­ your ­­ I think you would at least agree we're dealing with some sensitive and important constitutional issues. What is the ­­ the burden on the union that counter ­­ weighs against those of simply requiring opt­in as opposed to opt­out? At least then you ­­ you ensure that people are making a conscious decision about supporting the union before they're compelled to do that.",
  "And what you're saying, it's easy for the person to check a box saying I opt out. It's also easy to check a box saying opt in.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "General Verrilli.",
  "The ­­ the fact that Abood has been around for 40 years, does it affect your point at all that the main justification for Abood that's being advanced today is one that Abood did not adopt?",
  "Pickering justification, that's what I hear most prominently in the presentations, and yet Abood did not even cite Pickering.",
  "In ­­ in ­­ in terms of that, but in terms of the substantive analysis, it can't really seriously be called a Pickering case.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, General. Three minutes, Mr. Carvin.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 14­1516, Duncan v. Owens. Ms. Shapiro.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Levenstam.",
  "I think we've gotten pretty far afield from the issue here. Which case of ours clearly established that it's due process­error when a judge speculates about an issue that is not pertinent to guilt and there's sufficient evidence of guilt on all the elements? Which case of ours says that?",
  "I just want to ­­ I mean, under AEDPA, isn't it critical that there be a case ­­",
  "­­ as opposed to what you're saying is the case is: Well, you know, we have cases that say you can't be guilty if there wasn't evidence of guilt.",
  "But that ­­ that's a ­­ our cases clearly make sure ­­",
  "­­ that that's too high a level of generality.",
  "Taylor ­­ Taylor says the problem is the judge said you can infer from the fact that the person has been arrested and indicted, right? Is that ­­ that's Taylor?",
  "Okay. Well, that's very different from here. The judge is the factfinder. He's not instructing anybody on anything. What about Williams? That ­­ they ­­ the Seventh Circuit only cited three of our cases, right?",
  "Well, I know. But that doesn't count, right? It's the ones that the Seventh Circuit counted ­­ cited under AEDPA.",
  "Yeah. Well, what about three cases: Taylor is about an erroneous instruction to a jury. That's not what this is. Williams. Williams. That's the prison attire case, right? The people are ­­",
  "Nothing like that is here. That's an outside influence on the ­­ on the factfinder. And Holbrook is the sheriffs who were ­­",
  "­­ blanketed. Nothing like that happens here.",
  "That's ­­ what is exactly what he's done?",
  "What if the ­­ what if the record said ­­ the judge says, okay, I ­­ you know, the ­­ the State has satisfied all of the elements required for murder in ­­ in Illinois. You know, the real issue here is about these gangs selling drugs. In other words, is there ­­ and if, in fact ­­ I mean, does that make a difference?",
  "Okay.",
  "Now, why don't we accept the presumption that the judges are presumed to know the law and are following it, and interpret that in light of ­­ in light of that record?",
  "Because you don't challenge that there's sufficient evidence of guilt, do you?",
  "So wait. So they're ­­ what they were talking about is the identification?",
  "And you're saying what the judge said is I don't think Larry Owens was the guy? I don't ­­",
  "­­ think ­­",
  "So he's saying you think he determined that they had not really identified the perpetrator. And yet, because he thought it was a drug ­­ this guy was a drug dealer, well, he ought to be found guilty anyway?",
  "No, but it's very important ­­",
  "­­ as we try to read this statement, and I'm ­­ I think it's ­­",
  "­­ if you think the judge did not think this was the guy but the guy who happened to be there was a drug dealer and so he sentenced him on first degree murder, I ­­ that's a pretty incredible submission.",
  "Well, what are you ­­",
  "Well, I thought ­­ I thought you said that the real issue was that the judge did not think that the witnesses were credible.",
  "But I ­­ I'm sorry. You said the problem is with the evidence that linked him to the ­­",
  "But you're not challenging the sufficiency of that evidence.",
  "Well, but credibility was the key issue in the trial, right?",
  "But that ­­ seems to me like you're challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, and I ­­ again, as I ­­ as the case comes before us, we assume there is sufficient evidence to convict under every element of the crime.",
  "I'm sorry, counsel. Maybe I'm just repeating myself. That sounds like you're arguing the sufficiency of the evidence.",
  "Yes, you're saying we're not challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. We are challenging the Illinois court's determination that it was harmless error that there was not sufficient evidence.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Shapiro, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14­8913, Molina­Martinez v. United States. Mr. Crooks.",
  "I was ­­ I was just going to say under that ­­ I suppose the defendant really wouldn't insist on a resentencing if that were the ­­ those were the facts, would he? In other words, it was incorrectly a maximum of 87 and he got the maximum, you say, oh, well the correct one could give you up to 96. If I understand it, the defendant is not going to raise that objection, is he?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Meisler.",
  "I ­­ I am concerned about getting hung up on the labels. Okay? If you ­­ so don't say it's a presumption. We still have, don't we, the question of what happens if nobody ­­ and who loses if there's no evidence to move one way or another in a tie? It doesn't matter if you call it a \"presumption\" or not. Who bears the burden of at least moving forward, and certainly the burden of proof, if one of these errors is on the record?",
  "Now, does that individual showing, can it be made on the basis purely of the mistake in the Guidelines, there is no extraneous evidence? If you have a case where the erroneous range is 20 to 40 and the judge gives 20, and the correct range is zero to 20, is that a case in which the defendant has established plain error?",
  "I don't want to know anything more about it because if the judge is within the Guidelines, he doesn't have to say anything more about it.",
  "Okay. So now let's say ­­ I mean, this is why the problem is ­­ is ­­ whether you want to call it a presumption or whatever, is so difficult. What if the Guideline was 20 to ­­ to 40 and the judge said 30, and the correct Guideline was zero to 30? In other words, he's half in the middle of the wrong one. Do you say, well, maybe it's an error, maybe it's not? What ­­ what in that case?",
  "That's ­­ that's why I don't understand why it's one answer, zero to 20 and 20 to 40, and another answer when it's zero to 30 and 20 to ­­ when it's halfway as opposed to just at the bottom.",
  "Don't you usually ­­ don't you usually have a plea colloquy or something in the record in those types of cases?",
  "Well, no. If it's ­­ the sentence is within the Guidelines, the judge doesn't have to say anything at all. So it's very difficult for the defendant to go back and say, here's what the error was even though there's also a clear error, a plain error in what the original calculation was.",
  "Well, but there are the other factors under the Olano test.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Crooks, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14­770, Bank Markazi v. Peterson. Mr. Lamken.",
  "Sorry, Mr. Lamken. I don't understand the fixation on how many cases we're talking about. I thought ­­ I mean, I understand the argument. But at least I think perhaps the more significant concern is what Congress is doing in that one case, which is you have a body of law that tells you when you can attach funds and when you can't, and instead of letting the court decide, that Congress comes along and says those funds can be attached. They could do that in two cases. They could do it in ten. They could do it in every case involving Iran. That doesn't seem terribly significant to me. What seems significant is what they are doing in that case.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Olson.",
  "Well, the issue doesn't have to do with liability. It has to do with the authority to execute ­­",
  "­­ which is a ­­ which is a separate matter.",
  "Well, what if ­­",
  "Sure.",
  "What if, Mr. Olson, Congress passed a law that said, you know, there are a lot of challenges to the statutory interpretation under a particular statute, say the Health Care Act, and it said in any case involving a challenge to the statutory interpretation of the Secretary of HHS of that act, once it finds jurisdiction, the Court will enter judgment agreeing with the Secretary's purpose.",
  "Well ­­ well, but ­­ I mean, this Court has a lot of decisions about how to interpret statutes. And what Congress is saying in my hypothetical is, well, that's good for you; we want you to adopt the Secretary's interpretation in every case involving it.",
  "But by ­­ by saying that, you're saying it's okay.",
  "I think that's a little surprising. In other words, Congress can pass a statute and then say whenever the statutory interpretation of the executive branch is challenged, you, Court, will enter judgment in favor of the Secretary.",
  "Not in a particular way. They don't care. They don't think this clause ought to be interpreted this way. They are just saying whenever it is challenged, you, Court, adopt the Secretary's interpretation.",
  "We don't know what the interpretation is going to be. We just trust the Secretary ­­",
  "­­ more than we trust the courts.",
  "But there's a difference between causing ­­ affording deference and entering a judgment.",
  "Let's make it even clearer: The ­­ the ­­ the Court has issued its decision saying it agrees with the Plaintiff's interpretation, but the mandate hasn't issued yet, and Congress says, boy, we don't like that decision. They pass a law saying in that case, this is the interpretation you should adopt.",
  "Well, they don't say, \"We're changing.\" What we say, \"We want you to enter judgment in this case in favor of the Secretary.\"",
  "And just so you understand what I'm concerned about. You know, there are places in the world where courts function just the way our courts do, except every now and then, when there's a case that the ­­ the strong man who runs the country is interested in because a crony is one of the parties or whatever, and he picks up the phone and he tells the court, You decide this case this way. And I don't care what you thought the law was, decide it this way.",
  "I'm not sure I see what the difference is here.",
  "This law applies only to me. Everybody else, it comes out differently.",
  "Don't you think there ­­ don't you think there can be an equal protection ­­",
  "I suppose this applied to us as well, right? Congress can tell us how to rule on cases pending before us? You know, they have a committee every year at the start of the term. They say, well, what cases are up there? They read the briefs. And they say, well, we think this one should come out this way. And they pass a law telling us, in case number 15185, the Supreme Court will enter judgment, or, you know, more specifically directed to the pending matter.",
  "Well, it doesn't have to say the petitioner wins. It sees what the question presented is, and then they say in any case in which, and then read the question presented, you can attach the funds or you can recognize Puerto Rico as a sovereign or whatever else the case involves.",
  "Agree with her what?",
  "It's not the Plaut ­­ it's not the Plaut case. It's not even tweaking the law. As in here, it's saying, an issue has arisen in this case of whether or not this and this, and in that case, case number 14 whatever, the answer is this. Now, it makes it clear that Smith wins, but they don't just say that. They say, you're arguing this in this case. In this case you have to rule in favor of Smith and then the judgment.",
  "And all this Court has to do is sign on the dotted line?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler.",
  "You're saying Congress has to be cute about it. They can't say Smith wins. But they can say in the case of Jones v. Smith where the critical issue is this, we can change that in a way so Smith wins. And don't worry about the law generally, because it's just this case.",
  "It's just a cute way of saying Smith wins.",
  "It becomes a problem ­­ with respect, it becomes a problem because our job is to decide cases. And before a lawsuit is filed, there's no case. But when there is a case, Article III says that's our job. Their job is to pass laws; our job is to decide a case. When there's a dispute under one of the laws they pass, that's our job.",
  "Thank you ­­ thank you, counsel. Mr. Lamken, you have six minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 15­1808, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. Valle. Mr. Landau.",
  "Why does that ­­",
  "Why does ­­ why does the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have that authority? Where did it come from?",
  "But it had complete authority under the Territorial Clause whether to do that or not, right?",
  "So that would ­­ I ­­ it would seem to me, then, that the authority to do it came from Congress when they passed the ­­",
  "­­ the law authorizing Puerto Rico to adopt a Constitution of its own.",
  "Why is ­­ I mean, you seem to fix on invited as somehow different than authorized.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Unikowsky.",
  "We need to involve counsel in the dialogue.",
  "Briefly.",

  "Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Landau.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14­1280, Heffernan v. City of Paterson, New Jersey. Mr. Frost.",
  "Well, but the ­­ the First Amendment talks about abridging freedom of speech, and I thought the case came to us on the proposition that he wasn't engaging in speech at all. That he was not engaging in association, he was not engaging in trying to convey a message, he was just picking up a sign for his mother. And if that's the basis on which the case comes to us, I'm not sure how he can say his freedom of speech has been abridged.",
  "Well, let me just ­­ to clarify what I ­­ how I thought the case was presented. Let's say the employer comes in to Smith and says, you know, Smith, I saw you getting a ­­ a ­­ a political sign, and you're ­­ and you're ­­ you're fired. And Smith says, it wasn't me. I was off, you know, in a different town then. In other words, it's a pure mistake of fact. Your answers, it seems to me, you try to get advantage of the fact that there ­­ you could perhaps have argued this was expressive activity. Say, oh, he was at a meeting, a political event. He was getting a sign. But your theory, I thought, didn't depend on that at all.",
  "It was simply a mistake of fact. And then ­­ now, can the person who wasn't even there, can he bring a First Amendment challenge to his dismissal?",
  "Okay.",
  "Is there a remedy for your client, apart from this action under the First Amendment? Does he have civil service protections of any kind or ­­ or ­­ I don't know ­­ collective bargaining?",
  "Let's just say: What would happen if the boss comes in and says, you know, for the ­­ you didn't turn off the lights last night. You're fired. Can he ­­ is there a way for him to say, I was on leave yesterday. It wasn't me.",
  "No, no. My point is that maybe this shouldn't be a constitutional violation if there are adequate remedies to address what may or may not be a First Amendment issue.",
  "Okay.",
  "Just ­­",
  "You may.",
  "Ms. Anders.",
  "How do you know we haven't seen a flood of meritless lawsuits in that context?",
  "Yeah, the one that you were just referring to.",
  "You're looking at the reported decisions rather than ­­ you haven't done any survey to see how many complaints have been filed in ­­ in this type of case?",
  "I don't know why ­­",
  "Please.",
  "I don't know why the right isn't the right to be free from arbitrary employment action based on a mistake. That's his objection here. You made a mistake; you thought I was, you know, being politically active. I wasn't. I mean, isn't ­­ is there such a right under New Jersey law, you can't be fired for an arbitrary reason, or you can't be fired for a mistaken reason?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein.",
  "What is ­­ what is the other law here? What ­­ what relief does he have?",
  "Well, do ­­ do you agree that the Petitioner is entitled to relief under that provision of the collective bargaining agreement?",

  "In one case.",
  "Does it ­­ is it a pertinent consideration in terms of the impact on Federal jurisdiction? I mean, this is standard, run­of­the­mill commercial dispute about a commercial accident. And adopting one position would limit the number of times that such disputes would be brought in Federal court. The other one will expand it. Is that ­­ I mean, does Americold really feel that it's not going to get a fair shake in the Kansas courts in this case?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Duggan.",
  "Would you describe beneficiaries as a member ­­ member of a trust? I mean, as you articulate it. I think what's different than this, and Carden sort of gets you past the trust. But you then have to still make a choice: Okay. We're not going to look at the trust. Do we look at the trustees or the beneficiaries? And I ­­ I don't know if I'd call beneficiaries members of a trust.",
  "I just have one question on the Safeway and Kraft business. In the Tenth Circuit, you can ­­ you advised the court that you thought they were dispensable, nondiverse parties, but they hadn't appealed.

  "Right. Now, is there any basis for distinguishing the submerged lands from the ­­ I don't know what to call it ­­ from the land land that are in the other inholdings or do you understand the government's argument to be that they are treated the same?",
  "Why don't you take ­­ the ­­ the rest of us are interested in your answer to Justice Breyer.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Kovner.",
  "Well, in other words, the interests aren't the title. This is subsidiary. It's ­­ it's water that the U.S. holds title to and interests in that water, even though they are not reflected in the title?",
  "It has to hold title to the interest.",
  "Well, that's where I kind of stumbled in your argument, because you're not claiming title to the submerged land. It's clear that's in the State ­­",
  "­­ right? You're ­­ you ­­ you rely on the reserved water right. Is that ever expressed as \"title,\" as opposed to a ­­ the words ­­ \"usufructuary right\"?",
  "Well, it's just a ­­ I'm sorry to pause ­­ pause there. I understood with reserve water doctrine is usually, you know, we need water to do this, so we get ­­ we have a reserve right to 40 percent of the water, or the initial flow, or whatever. I've never thought of it as a basis for general regulatory authority.",
  "Well, but if that's right, I mean, it ­­ it ­­ it's right because the question is do these things apply solely to public lands. And you say, well, the second sentence doesn't matter because we say they don't apply solely to public lands. That's not a very significant protection for the inholders.",
  "I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "What does ­­ you ­­ on page 24, and I think you have mentioned this several times, so ­­ you talk about this isn't a problem because your authority is circumscribed and you have the inholdings are ­­ have substantial protections against Park Service regulation.

  "Do you ­­ do you think the statute that authorizes you to regulate is the one that says \"the Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as the Secretary considers necessary or proper\"? Would you ­­",

  "So danger ­­ danger or harm, is that what it's limited to? Or could it be limited to scenic, environmental, noise impacts?",
  "No, but your authority is not limited if you get Chevron deference. If you get Chevron deference on determining what you think is necessary or proper, the idea that that's a substantial circumscription of your authority doesn't seem to me to be a valid one.",

  "How is that consistent with the language in Solem that Justice Ginsburg read?",
  "What's ­­ what's vague about the language where non­Indian settlers flooded into the opened portion of a reservation and the area has long since lost its Indian character, we have acknowledged that de facto, if not de jure diminishment may have occurred.",

  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash.",
  "Finish your sentence, sir.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Watt.",
  "What ­­ what's the number? What percentage of people have to have warrants before you can imply that whenever an officer stops someone, it is to, you know, illegally search them because they're very likely to have an arrest warrant?",
  "Well, I suppose that's related. I mean, your brief had a lot of numbers in it. And if only one out of a hundred people have arrest warrants, then I think you really couldn't imply that that was the purpose of the stop.",
  "And some of these numbers ­­ obviously, you have, in particular communities, high numbers, but some of them didn't strike me ­­ I was surprised how low they were. 323,000 is a big number, but that's the entire State of Florida.",
  "Why is that? You mean every time a police officer pulls somebody over and runs a warrant check, it's because he thinks it's likely there's a warrant? Might it ­­ might it be to protect him when he walks up to the car? He'd like to know that the person is wanted for murder, right?",
  "But I guess ­­ I mean, you do require us to determine whether or not he ran the warrant check to ensure his safety in ­­ in this interaction, or as an investigative matter. I mean, does that make a difference?",
  "You're arguing something that the State's conceded, right?",
  "You ­­ you said that the ­­ that the stop was made for the purpose of running for the arrest warrants. I just don't know the basis for that, other than your statistics that in certain areas there are a high number of arrest warrants. In many areas there aren't. I mean, how ­­ is it entirely empirical? Do we have to accept and generalize from your empirical evidence which ­­ that the purpose must be to execute or to check for arrest warrants?",
  "But he immediately runs the arrest ­­ warrants check when he makes the stop because he wants to know who he's dealing with. It would be ­­ it would be, I think, bad police work to not run the warrant check until after you've had an interaction with the person when the danger that you could have found out about might have been when it's too late to ­­ to act on it.",
  "No, I understand that.",
  "You're implying ­­ I'm still trying to get at how you decide what the purpose was. In your brief you say several times, oh, the purpose is to ­­ to run the warrants check. And I just want to know why that's ­­ why that's the case.",
  "Let's say that the warrant check is something he does when he arrests people. I don't doubt that, but it doesn't prove that that was his purpose in ­­ in the stop.",
  "How often are ­­ are cars ­­ people stopped driving, an officer walks up to the car and they're shot? Has that happened a fair amount of times?",
  "It does happen. So is there no other reason for checking to see if there are warrants out for that person before you walk up to the car? Or before you conduct an inquiry with a ticket?",
  "It seems to me not wanting to get shot's a pretty good reason.",
  "Would your rule apply in that situation?",
  "Would your rule apply in a situation where the officer approaches the car for a purpose that is later found to be insufficient under Terry? You would suppress whatever evidence is find ­­ found in that situation too, right?",
  "Okay. So it would apply in the stopping of the automobile situation.",
  "Okay.",
  "You ­­ you disagree with Judge Friendly's analysis in the Friedman case?",
  "Well, with ­­ with his analysis. As ­­ as I understand, it took the position opposite to what you're arguing, and I just want to know if you have a basis for distinguishing that precedent.",
  "So it doesn't create an incentive of the kind you were arguing, you were worried about before.",
  "The warrants ­­ the warrants are automatic. You were suggesting that, oh, one thing that will happen is they'll be issuing all these warrants if they know they can get evidence from illegal stops. And because the warrants are automatic, they're not going to be issuing all these warrants, are they?",

  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 14­916, Kingdomware Technologies v. United States. Mr. Saunders.",
  "Well, but that strikes me as a ­­ a very thin protection. Are ­­ these terms imply a lot of discretion: What's fair? What's reasonable? What's best value? The idea that that's going to operate as a significant restraint on the requirement that the VA locate veteran businesses seems a real stretch to me.",
  "Counsel, could you get back to your answer to my question?",
  "Well, the sort of thing that there will be an awful lot of litigation about, don't you think?",
  "Well, you're putting a lot more weight on that ­­ excuse me ­­ on that provision if you prevail on your statutory interpretation argument. And it seems to me that that provision is inevitably going to lead to litigation. How do you tell what's best? It's a combination of price and quality. It's not any absolute that you can identify, and you know, what's fair, what's reasonable. I ­­ I think the businesses that you represent would be litigating those terms ­­ it's hard to say ­­ almost in every case.",
  "You ­­ you mentioned that the ­­ you've mentioned several times, I think, that there has to be a veterans ­­ veteran­owned business that's eligible as ­­ as ­­ but don't you think there will be a lot more veteran­owned businesses if you prevail? In other words, if everything is open to the preference, as long as there is, you know, two that get the preference, don't you think a lot more veterans ­­ won't it make a lot more sense for them to go into business rather than some other line of work?",
  "Well, you shouldn't be telling us that the limitation is that there's only so many veteran­owned businesses, because if you prevail, there will be many times that.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Tripp.",
  "Well, in every case there has to be ­­ we're dealing with small ­­ veteran­owned small businesses. The examples you gave, stents, wheelchairs, ultrasound machines, are there many small businesses that provide ultrasound machines?",
  "There are expensive, big things that you expect you have to be a big company to provide, like an ultrasound machine, or you mentioned stents. Now maybe if they're commodities, then to provide fair price and best value, it also would help to be a big business as opposed to a small business. Let me ­­ I ­­ I can't imagine the small business is going to make a stent that is going to be at the same price and same quality as some ­­",

  "When ­­ I'm sorry. When you say you're crushing the goals, that means you're meeting them?",

  "Why is the ­­",
  "Why is the nature of the infringement so determinative under your view? Yes, they copied it, but perhaps they had a, you know, good­faith belief that this wasn't patented. So the fact that they copied it doesn't seem to me to automatically make it something which is suitable for sanctions.",
  "Or they could have had, you know, a good­faith belief that the patent wasn't valid.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Martinez.",
  "As I read your brief and the Petitioner's brief, I got the sense that there was quite a bit of difference between the two. The government seems to be taking a much higher standard before these punitive damages, or however you want to describe them, would be allowed. You use terms like \"egregious\" a lot. Your friend uses terms like, you know, \"intentional,\" more than mere negligence. Is that perception ­­ do you think that perception is an accurate one?",
  "Just a ­­ for one just brief moment. By \"intentional,\" you mean intentional infringement, not intentional ­­",
  "Okay.",

  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Well, I thought you said ­­",
  "I thought you said the product was marked.",
  "Well, you are ­­",
  "We are, after all, dealing with statutory language. And I'm not sure it's been quoted yet. It says, \"The Court may increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed.\" Period.",
  "And yet the Federal Circuit standard, you've got ­­ you know, you've got heightened burdens of proof, particularly articulated. I mean, the way we ­­ the ­­ courts have been used to dealing with discretionary standards for a long time. And the way it works is, historically, you know, the exercise of discretion in a lot of cases that, you know, wears a channel which kind of confines the exercise of discretion. And I think the other side's argument is based on that history.",
  "Over time, this is what discretion has ­­ has given us in this area, and therefore, you get beyond that, it's an abuse. But to erect this fairly elaborate standard on the basis of that language I think is surprising.",
  "But the ­­ the ­­ the choice is reflected in the statute, which leaves a lot of discretion to the district courts. And I think ­­ and a lot of the arguments we've heard today are the sort of arguments that can be made to the district court's discretion in a particular case. Saying, you know, this ­­ this is one of those pirates or, you know, trolls, and it is a serious one or it's less serious one. And you have these standards to apply, and ­­ and the district court will exercise the discretion. And if it's out of the channel of discretion, then the Court can review it on that basis.",

  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14­6166, Taylor v. United States. Mr. Jones.",
  "What ­­ what is the ­­ the standard of proof that you hold Congress to when it exercises jurisdiction over intrastate businesses with an effect on interstate commerce or interstate commerce? Somebody challenges Congress's exercise of jurisdiction because it doesn't fit within the interstate commerce or effect on interstate commerce, and the statute's evaluated according to what standard?",
  "Well, somebody says ­­ you know, challenges ­­ as we've had challenges, in cases like Lopez and others ­­ that, Congress, you don't have authority to regulate this matter, because it doesn't involve interstate commerce, doesn't have an effect on interstate commerce, and so on. But how do we ­­ how do we evaluate that? Does ­­ well, does Congress have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the ­­ there is an effect on interstate commerce?",
  "Certainly, Mr. Jones. Mr. Yang.",
  "So if it weren't commercial aspect, then you wouldn't ­­ you wouldn't ­­ you would have to demonstrate jurisdiction beyond a reasonable doubt?",
  "Well, except that Congress doesn't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt before exercising its jurisdiction that there's an affect on interstate commerce.",
  "But if you're prosecuting somebody, you do have to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the elements of the crime have been satisfied.",
  "Beyond a reasonable doubt.",
  "Yes, I ­­ I suppose it's a ­­ maybe an academic question, but your conclusion that Congress has jurisdiction over the marijuana trade is based on a different standard of proof than the criminal one. So yes, you can say of course Congress has jurisdiction here, but that has been established only under, I guess, a rational­basis standard. But now you have to show Congress has jurisdiction pursuant to a much more daunting standard of proof.",
  "Is ­­",
  "Is the defendant allowed to present any evidence to the contrary?",
  "It would be kind of silly to say they've got to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt. All the United States has to do is this, and then ­­ and the judge instructs the jury that they've satisfied that burden?",
  "What ­­",
  "­­ in any ­­ in a marijuana case, what evidence could a defendant put on that would prevent the establishment of the jurisdictional element?",
  "No. That goes to the first question of whether there was a robbery: Was there a robbery? Did it have an affect on ­­ on commerce within the jurisdiction of the United States?",
  "Is there any evidence that a defendant could be allowed to introduce going to the second element?",
  "Yes, but those are two very different things. Robbing a house and stumbled upon is one thing, but if you have somebody who is robbing marijuana that's grown for home consumption or whatever, can the defendant say the jurisdictional element is not satisfied because of that?",
  "Well, it may ­­ that may be familiar in the law, but I'm not aware of any case where the burden is on the government to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt, an element of the crime, and you're saying there's no way that the defendant ­­ no evidence that defendant could introduce ­­ could rebut the government's showing, in any case.",
  "What ­­ what's your best authority for that proposition?",
  "The tagalong, he got 20 years.",

  "We'll hear argument next in Case 15­5040, Williams v. Pennsylvania. Mr. Lev.",
  "Does that make a difference, the nature of his decision? Let's say he had a policy. He says, I think every case in which a defendant is convicted of first degree murder, that we ought to seek the death penalty and leave it to the jury. Maybe the jury will agree or not, but I'm going to seek the death penalty in every case where there's a conviction of first degree murder. Would you have the same recusal problem?",
  "Oh, no, I know that, but it's a categorical decision. In other words, he doesn't look at the particulars of that case. He has a policy that he's adopted ­­ you know, whether you think it's a good policy or not ­­ that doesn't depend upon the particular facts, simply on the facts of what the conviction is.",
  "What if you had a situation where he was directly involved in a matter that had nothing to do with the issue that came up later?

  "Can you give me ­­ can you give me ­­ much weaker? Can you give me a yes­or­no on my hypothetical?",
  "There is a concern about sandbagging, though. I mean, if you do have a case where somebody has that information, I think the best thing to do would be to, you know, put it in a ­­ the back drawer, take your chances on ­­ on getting an acquittal. And if you don't, then you say, aha, the judge could have recused him or herself, and our ­­ our remedy is we get to go back and do it all again.",
  "Well, Strickland's very different. I mean, you may think it's pretty unlikely that attorneys are going to deliberately commit error so that they have a later problem. But it's another thing if you're talking about a fact about the judge's prior involvement.",
  "Not against you.",
  "Well, I guess it's not a case of sandbagging, but it's somehow related in that the information you're talking about would have been information that seriously undermined the defense your client was presenting. In other words, the information goes to the nature of a prior relationship. And his whole argument and defense was, I didn't know, you know, who this person was. I had no contact with him at all. So, you know, in what sense does that ­­ the material that you're complaining about now is the last thing he would want to have come ­­ come out at his trial.",
  "Is that ­­ well, just so I understand, you're saying the evidence might have been sufficient to persuade him not to lie?",
  "The independent evidence you're complaining about involved the defendant himself, correct?",
  "Counsel, I ­­ I understand your ­­ the first two of your three points, but I don't understand how the third works. This is ­­ you're concerned that the ­­ the Chief Justice cited his record with respect to capital cases in campaigning for office. I ­­ that certainly wouldn't be a ­­ a recusal issue without the other two points, right?",
  "Okay. So how does that have anything to do with the argument in this case?",
  "It's an evidentiary point for you. It's not an independent ground for recusal.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Eisenberg.",
  "What would be ­­",
  "What would be your standard? I mean, I assume you would agree that in certain circumstances, a failure to recuse would raise a constitutional problem.",
  "So how would you articulate the appropriate test?",
  "I ­­ just so I understand the scope of your argument, you would be arguing the same thing if there were three judges? One should have recused, that leaves two?",
  "But there could be ­­",
  "The main circumstance is ­­ would seem to me to be is a ­­ a real fact matter is what the deliberations of the judges were like. I mean, if the individual who should have been recused occupied a dominant role in the discussion and was successful in persuading colleagues and all that ­­ and of course, that's the sort of evidence you certainly can't have access to.",

  "So how does that work in the bankruptcy case? We say this debt can't be discharged, but maybe it will turn out that it could have been, depending on how ­­ how the State law claim goes?",
  "So the bankruptcy court will decide the question under State law?",
  "Okay.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Murphy.",
  "Can you give me an example in common parlance, not ­­ not in the U.S. Code, where someone would speak along the lines you're saying the statute is written?",
  "That's not great ­­",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dvorestzky, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15­5238, Nichols v. United States. Mr. Hansmeier.",
  "What sense does it make if you have Federal law that says we're going to add this ­­ these ­­ these sanctions when you violate the ­­ the State law? And in the one case, if you don't register, you're triggered and State law says, well, you've got to unregister too. But if you unregister ­­ if you don't unregister, that's not included under the Federal law? Why would ­­ why would Congress draft a law like that?",
  "Well, but there's no problem to require him to register, but all of a sudden there is a problem to require him to unregister?",
  "They left the unregistering to the States but not the registering?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon.",
  "Well, all right. How is that the case since subsection (a) refers to each jurisdiction where the offender resides, is an employee or a student? When he's in the Philippines, there's no such jurisdiction covered by SORNA where he resides, is an employee, or is a student.",
  "But how is that ­­",
  "Where is under (a) something that says it's the jurisdiction where you used to be required to register?",
  "But where ­­",
  "Well, but he only has to keep the registration current if there is a jurisdiction where he ­­ covered jurisdiction where he resides, is an employee or is a student.",
  "Otherwise that obligation is inoperative because there's no registration place in the Philippines.",
  "Well ­­",
  "Well, right.",
  "But he doesn't have to comply with it until later than three business days after there's a change.",
  "So he ­­",
  "Shall not later than three business days after each change? That's not true?",
  "Well, maybe he should have. Maybe he should have. But he may also have thought, when it says at least one jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a), and subsection (a) says where he resides, then maybe there's no jurisdiction involved under ­­",
  "­­ under the ­­",
  "Right.",
  "I understand ­­ I understand your argument about 16914(a)(3), but how many ­­ what's the ­­ the penalty for ­­ the maximum penalty for violating this provision?",
  "Yeah. I think it's ­­",
  "­­ ten years. So you think somebody is supposed to look at this and say, should I register? Obviously he doesn't want to register or unregister, whatever it is. And he says, okay, it says \"involved,\" but that's different than described in. And (a) says \"jurisdiction where the offender resides,\" and there's no place to register where I currently resides. And then he's supposed to say, ah, but 16914(a)(3) says \"resides or will reside.\"",
  "That's an awful lot to ask a ­­ a layperson to parse at the penalty of ten years for being wrong.",
  "For a registration violation.",
  "I understood ­­ I ­­ if I understood you correctly, there is still a category of people under your interpretation today that would not be covered under the new law, because you have to file an itinerary, right?",
  "Okay. Well, okay. This person files an itinerary saying I'm flying to the ­­ the Philippines. And if he takes up residence there, then he's still violating the law, under your interpretation?",
  "So if his purpose is I'm going to visit the Philippines, and while there, he decides I'm going to set up permanent residence here, then you would be able to prosecute him under this provision, even though the new law doesn't cover it.",
  "His purpose is to visit the Philippines. And while in the Philippines, he decides to set up residence there.",
  "So you ­­ you read 16913(a) as saying, where the offender resides or resided, is an employee or was an employee, is a student or was a student.",
  "This ­­ this is not an administrative law provision. It's a criminal statute. The Attorney General's guidelines can't expand a fair reading of what Congress made illegal under Federal law.",
  "And it's still given ­­ given what I just said, my ­­ my answer is, so what? So what if the Attorney General has been construing this since, you know, 1875?",
  "You cannot do anything to expand the words that Congress used.",
  "What you're saying is the Attorney General thinks it's a fair reading of the statute.",
  "So ­­ so I should think it's a fair reading of the statute.",
  "Just to ­­ I probably should know this, but Kansas requires him to list any change, right? He has to unregister?",
  "Right. What ­­ what sort of language did they use?",
  "But it says \"where last registered.\"",
  "How ­­ how do we ­­ how do we know ­­ I'm sorry. Go ahead, please.",
  "I knew we should have paid that bill.",
  "Briefly.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hansmeier, you have 11 minutes remaining.",
  "Okay.",
  "Oh.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument this morning in Case 15­274, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstadt. Ms. Toti.",
  "But you're asking ­­ you made allegations concerning those same claims. I mean, is your argument that when you have allegations on a facial challenge and a facial challenge is resolved against you, that all you have to do is come up with new evidence and then you can start over again?",
  "What ­­ what evidence is that?",
  "What?",
  "I'm sorry. Yeah. What is the evidence in the record that the closures are related to the legislation?",
  "So you think you can separately challenge the admitting­privilege provision and the ASC provision?",
  "So if you can separately challenge them, if you challenge just the admitting­privileges provision, how would you factor in ­­ presumably, you would have to assume that the ASC provision was not under challenge. So in assessing the burden, you would look at just the admission privilege. And vice versa, if you're challenging just the ASC separately, you'd have to assume you'd assess the burden solely caused by that provision. It seems to me the separation of the two provisions makes ­­ would make your case much harder.",
  "Where ­­ I'm sorry to interrupt you. Where in the record is that evidence?",
  "Why don't ­­ why don't you take an extra five minutes, and we'll be sure to afford you rebuttal time after that?",
  "Do you think there's a rational basis for the law based on the benefits that the legislature saw?",
  "Well, I thought you expressly did not challenge the law as lacking a rational basis.",
  "Well, we have to assume it ­­ we have to assume it does since you're not raising that challenge, don't we?",
  "I don't ­­ how is that logical? I mean, the question is whether there's an undue burden or a substantial obstacle. What ­­ what difference does it make what the purpose behind the law is in assessing whether the burden is substantial or ­­ or undue? It seems once you get past the ­­ the assumption that the law has a rational basis and you haven't challenged that, then you look at the burden or the obstacle. And the purpose that the law is directed to, I would think, doesn't make a difference. It's either a substantial obstacle or an undue burden or it's not.",
  "I thought the undue burden and substantial obstacle went to whether it was undue in light of the woman's right to exercise her right to an abortion, not with respect to the State interest that's asserted.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli.",
  "I would have thought ­­ Casey and Gonzales also said substantial obstacle. And I would have thought that's something you could look at in an objective manner. Why ­­ and ­­ actually, I don't understand why you're arguing the opposite. I think whether it's an obstacle or a burden would exist without regard to the strength of the State interest. The strength of the State interest, it would seem to me, is evaluated on whatever test there is with respect to that legislation, and then you'd look at what the impact was.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Keller.",
  "I suppose I should ­­ before you get started, we'll afford you an additional eight minutes. I think that's roughly ­­",
  "What ­­ what evidence would you have put in on the capacity issue if you had been afforded that opportunity?",
  "Evidence that would rebut the statistically significant showing on the other side about capacity, and also the circumstantial evidence about the timing of the ­­ of the closures.",
  "Justice Alito.",
  "Sure.",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "Ms. Toti, you have five minutes remaining.",
  "And that ­­ that's the ­­ the last evidence was from Dr. Grossman?",
  "At page 232, he said, \"I am not here offering any opinion on the cause of the decline in the number of abortion facilities.\"",
  "Thank you, counsel.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case No. 14­1504, Wittman v. Personhuballah. Mr. Carvin.",
  "How did you ­­",
  "How do you show what the motive of the legislature was? Let's say you have 10 percent of the legislators say this is because of race ­­ that's their motive ­­ 10 percent say it's because of partisanship, and 80 percent say nothing at all. What ­­ what is the motive of that legislature?",
  "What about Brat? What about Brat?",
  "All right. Justice Sotomayor.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Raphael.",
  "You ­­ it didn't commit clear error, but you thought it committed error, right, given your ­­",
  "­­ prior position in this case?",
  "No, I understand. But your position, if you were taking a considered position at trial, is that the ­­ the district court was wrong, because that was ­­ you presented the facts and you defended those facts, under your view. And then on appeal, they overturned it, and you say, okay, they were wrong, but not clearly wrong.",
  "I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. I just want to make ­­",
  "One ­­ it was also one of your experts that said that if every person involved in these swaps were white, the results would still be the same, right?",
  "That's at 649. Is that ­­",
  "McDonald, right.",
  "Would there ­­ would there be a violation here if the district that were drawn could be explained on the basis of partisanship rather than race?",
  "It's a ­­ a question I asked Mr. Carvin. You're talking about the motive of the legislature, right? What do you do when it's 10 percent race, 10 percent partisanship, and, as is often the case, I suspect, 80 percent of them don't say anything at all?",
  "But if you're a legislature and you say, okay, I understand now what you said. But I suspect most of them looked at the map and said, you know, how a.m. I doing here? What's percentage of Republican? What's percentage of Democrat? What's the change? They may not have cared what the sponsor thought about it.",
  "Do ­­ do you think it's fair to characterize Forbes as an officious intermeddler?",
  "The future of his political career that he's had for 16 years.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Elias.",
  "Race ­­ you say race is a proxy. If ­­ and this is why, easily, I think it's so important. The way you check is to come up with a district that would achieve the same partisan objectives without respect to race, and you weren't put to that test in this case.",
  "No. I mean, it makes it ­­ I guess you have a greater degree of confidence if you have an alternative that said, look, if they wanted partisanship, which is usually a pretty high priority for politicians, if they wanted partisanship, they would have done this, but instead they did this. But if you're not ­­ if you're not forced to show that, then you have reliance on, you know, however many quotes you can find, and ­­ and I get back to the question I asked before. What do you ­­ how do you analyze it if it's 10 percent race, 10 percent partisanship and 80 percent who say nothing at all?",
  "Is that Janis?",
  "He wasn't in the legislature when this took ­­ was approved, was he?",
  "Well, I thought the ­­ the person who drafted the plan ­­ maybe I've got that mixed up. It wasn't Janis ­­ was ­­ was not in the legislature.",
  "So you could have ­­ you think you could have drawn a map under Cromartie that would show if you wanted to protect incumbency or ­­ and Republican or Democratic advantage, you would have done this, and instead you did this?",
  "Well, but if you moved those districts, then you'd have to move other districts to make up for ­­ for it. And again, I think that's what Cromartie does. It says we don't have to speculate about 10 percent, 10 percent, 80 percent. What you have to show is that partisanship could not have been a factor, because you couldn't have drawn it any differently without affecting partisanship.",
  "If ­­ if race and partisanship are co­extensive, which one predominates?",
  "No, no. If race and partisanship are co­extensive, then which one ­­ it's ­­ you may say it's an abstract question that isn't that the same but doesn't fit these facts ­­ but if that's the case, which one predominates?",
  "And who loses if it's a tie?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gershengorn.",
  "But, I mean, people have objected to some extent that Cromartie cut back on Shaw and Miller as well, and again, I just ­­ I, at least, would feel on much more solid ground if the plaintiffs had been put to the test of saying, show us. They say this isn't about partisanship; this is about race. Okay. Show us. You draw the district that would protect the partisanship interest that's going to be different. And yet the ­­ the lower court did not subject them to that inquiry.",
  "Well, okay, if there is evidence that race is at issue. I will give you a chance to answer the question I asked each of the others. I wouldn't want to deprive you of that opportunity.",
  "But you're looking to see whether race was the motive. What do you do if, as I said, you know, 10 say yes, 10 say something else, and 80 don't say anything? How can you say that the motive of the legislature was ­­ was this or that?",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Carvin, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case 15­138, RJR Nabisco v. The European Community. Mr. Katsas.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Ms. Goldenberg.",
  "But RICO imposes, it seems to me, as we've even observed in the domestic context, far more significant ­­ the impact internationally could be far more significant than prosecution simply of the underlying offenses. It obviously provides the government with extremely strong prosecutorial reach and penalties, far beyond what the substantive elements do. And I'm wondering why that shouldn't cause us to be more concerned with respect to the comity interests that are at stake when you're talking about extraterritorial applicability.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick.",
  "I thought the victim here was the European Community.",
  "I'm sorry. I just thought earlier you were citing it. You said the victim is the ­­",
  "Oh, it's just one.",
  "You ­­ you can easily ­­ you can easily envision situations where private parties prosecuting RICO actions for ­­ against European entities might implicate serious comity concerns whether the racketeering enterprise is a State­owned actor or an ­­ an entity that's strongly supported by the ­­ the government. And in those situations, how would comity concerns of the foreign government be taken into account in the private treble damages action?",
  "So here we have racketeering ­­",
  "Yeah.",
  "Here the ­­ you have racketeering activity that goes to the illegal trafficking and cigarettes, right?",
  "So, I mean, what if ­­ what if ­­ and you have a ­­ domestic crime predicates, what ­­ what if the cigarettes were marketed through, you know, I don't know, an enterprise very important to the government of ­­ you know, some government that sells cigarettes, the ­­ you can imagine other products. In other words, it's ­­ it's ­­ here you have sort of an organized crime enterprise. But the way the racketeering statute works, and we have a lot of experience with this domestically, it reaches far beyond what you would have thought Congress had in mind when it used the word \"racketeering\" and certainly involves otherwise legitimate enterprise.",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katsas, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15­109, Simmons v. Himmelreich. Mr. Martinez.",
  "You ­­ you mentioned ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "You mentioned a moment ago that you extensively briefed this question. Did you mean in Smith?",
  "So you briefed it extensively in Smith, and the Court said nothing about it.",
  "Oh, no. I know the Court's holding. But in terms of the analysis of it, the ­­ the Court did nothing along those lines.",
  "That's the one on 16a of your ­­",
  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Vergonis.",
  "What if you look at the definitional provisions? Okay, 2680 has a lot of terms that would be subject to some litigation or confusing ­­ who's ­­ who's ­­ confusion. Who's an employee of the government? Is the provision construed to include a contractor? Those are all spelled out in the definitional provision. Now, under your argument, those definitions are off the table and you can litigate for days on end about, does this cover a contractor of the United States? And you're saying, well, normally, you'd say let's look at the definition, and it says ­­ well, yeah, it says that right there. But under your argument, no, the definitions are not included.",
  "Well, it's a ­­",
  "It's a provision of the chapter ­­",
  "­­ under your reading, which is a strict literal one, that it shall not apply. Those provisions shall not apply to any claims. Okay. Well, somebody brings a claim against a contractor of the United States, and again, you're saying, well, we don't look to the definitions in the Act to determine who's a contractor of the United States, because that provision doesn't apply.",
  "What about the review provisions? Those seem to be a particular ­­ particularly problematic aspect. The review provisions, I take it, don't apply either.",

  "Why would Congress preclude Puerto Rico from Chapter 9? In other words, what ­­ what is the background of this provision?",
  "Well, that's ­­ I mean, that's your basic policy argument, and I'm not sure it carries much weight. Why ­­ why would it be irrational for Congress to say, all right, this is the system we're going to apply to all the States, but when it comes to Puerto Rico, if they want changes, we want them to come to us, partly because Congress has a different sort of relationship with Puerto Rico than it has to all the other States?",
  "And that's a very ­­ you came up with a very good answer, Mr. Landau, to my question. But I wonder why it's absurd to treat the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico different from Guam and the ­­ the Virgin Islands. I mean, why would you lump those two ­­ those four together?",

  "Thank you, counsel. Mr. Francisco.",
  "Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli.",
  "That's ­­ in other words, your compelling interest is not that women obtain the contraceptive services. Your compelling interest is that women obtain the contraceptive services through the insurance plan or the third­party administrator hired by the Petitioners, hired by the Little Sisters. In other words, it seems to me you can't say that what you're trying to do is make sure everybody has this coverage. You want to make sure they have it through the program set up by the Little Sisters, and that's what they object to.",
  "The point is that it's the form in which the services are provided that you object to, not the fact that they be provided or not, because that's not the question. In other words, the Petitioner has used the phrase \"hijacking,\" and it seems to me that that's an accurate description of what the government wants to do. They want to use the mechanism that the Little Sisters and the other Petitioners have set up to provide services because they want the coverage to be seamless. Now, maybe that's a sufficiently compelling government interest, the form in which the services are provided, but the interest is not whether or not women receive contraceptive services. The Petitioners do not object to the fact that the people who work for them will have these services provided. They object to having them provided through the mechanism that they have set up because they think, you know, whether you or I or anybody else thinks, they think that that complicity is sinful.",
  "This is ­­ this is not just a case of the government dealing with a third party based on the Petitioners' objection. The objection is that the government is hijacking their process, their insurance company, their third­party administrator that they have hired and set up to provide these services. I understand the distinction between yes, you can do what you want, but you can't compel other people to take actions that are consistent with your religious beliefs. But that's not what's going on here. It is the relationship between the insurer that the Little Sisters have hired or the third­party administrator with respect to other ­­ other entities that is being used by the government to provide these services. It's not just a third party that's being compelled. They want ­­ it's not just that they want third parties to take certain action.",
  "They are ­­ they are not third parties. They are the insurance company that the Petitioners have hired. It's the third­party administrator that they have hired.",
  "It seems to me that the balance is pretty clear. You want the coverage for contraceptive services to be provided, I think as you ­­ as it said, seamlessly. You want it to be in the one insurance package. That's done. That is the compelling government interest. And on the other side, the question is whether or not people who have sincere religious objections to being complicit in that through the hiring of the insurance company, the third­party administrator on terms where they provided, whether the government's compelling interest outweighs those sincere religious objections. Is that a fair understanding of the case?",
  "Is there a fairer one?",
  "What ­­ what is the ­­ the government's interest in requiring ­­ requiring compliance by Catholic Charities of Pittsburgh, but totally exempting Catholic Charities of Erie?",
  "The difference, of course, is, as you ­­ it's properly phrased in the briefing, is the accommodation is the way in which the organizations comply with the mandate. With respect to Catholic Charities of Erie, though, they don't have to comply to the accommodation or any other way.",
  "They are exempt.",
  "You have to draw the line? Is it ­­ could you apply the same requirements you apply to the Little Sisters to the church entity itself?",
  "No. But you understand the argument. It's ­­ and we've said this in cases like O Centro and others, that if you have a lot of exemptions, it undermines your argument that this is such a compelling interest.",
  "So it comes down to a question of who has to do the paperwork? If it's the employee that has to do it, that's ­­ that's no good. If it's the religious organization that has to do it, that's okay?",
  "They're on the Exchanges, right?",
  "Is that true with respect to ­­",
  "Is that true with respect to every policy sold on the Exchanges?",
  "What about pediatric dentistry?",
  "Oh, except for pediatric dentistry.",
  "So you could have a separate health coverage product sold on the Exchanges. You, in fact, do it already.",
  "Well, the way constitutional objections work is you might have to change current law.",
  "No, no, no. But I guess that substantiates the point I was trying to make, that it's a question of who does the paperwork.",
  "You said, yes, it is a hassle to go to the Exchange, although it's ­ you know, I've heard about how easy it is. You get an Exchange, you get it, or you allow your infrastructure, as Petitioners have said, to be used as the vehicle for ­­ for providing it. I'm not saying it comes out one way or another from your perspective. I'm just trying to focus on exactly what is at issue.",
  "It's a question whether you want the employee to sign a paper or you want the Little Sisters to sign a paper. In the one case, it's an administrative burden as you've said. In the other case, it's ­­ it's a violation of a basic principle of faith.",
  "I'm sorry. What ­­ the difference ­­ you were asked what the difference is?",
  "All right. That's the interest on one side of the equation. What do you understand to be the interest on the other side of the equation?",
  "Which way ­­ which way does RFRA cut in ­­ in analyzing that balance?",
  "Maybe if I could follow up on your answer before you do. The contraceptive services would be provided pursuant to what plan?",

  "Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-552, Sprint Communications Company v. APCC Services, Inc. Mr. Phillips.",
  "So that if these contracts provided that the aggregators will turn over all of the proceeds of the litigation except for one penny, then you'd be satisfied?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Englert.",
  "We're not under any body of law. I didn't see any cases cited after we had more carefully explicated our understanding of Article III. What's the latest case from this Court that you've got?",
  "Counsel, you say in your brief that there is no reason for concern about the absence of concrete adverseness. But I would have thought there was a great deal of reason for concern and that your client doesn't care if he wins or loses.",
  "It's all the same to him. If he wins, he doesn't get to keep the money; if he loses, he loses.",
  "I thought the question came to us on the assumption that he doesn't retain any of the money.",
  "But I thought our cases made clear that that kind of -- -- I forget what we call it -- it's a separate interest from the injury that you're alleging in the lawsuit. You don't allege in the lawsuit that the basis for Article III injury is that you're in this line of work and if the work dries up you're in big trouble. That wouldn't be enough to support Article III standing.",
  "Well, but then why is the assignee bringing the lawsuit?",
  "He had no independent injury.",
  "I'm sorry, we got off the track here.",
  "I'm trying to find out what the assignee's injury is.",
  "And how it's redressed by the receipt of the money.",
  "No. But you know, Vermont Agency, obviously, the assignee recovers something himself, that he gets to keep the bounty. Here that's not the case.",
  "The Sierra Club protect -- undertakes activities to protect the environment, but that doesn't give it standing in every environmental case to sue. It needs to show members what the concrete interest and so on. The fact that your client is in the business of suing on behalf of payphone operators --",
  "Speaking -- speaking -- MR. ENGLERT -- but this case is not of that nature.",
  "Speaking of one cent for tribute, it's easy to get rid of this problem, isn't it?",
  "Why don't your agreements just say you get to keep $10 out of every sum that your recover? Then we wouldn't have this problem.",
  "So why --",
  "Why doesn't the tie go to Article III? I mean if it makes no difference either way I'd like to preserve significance of Article III as a limit on court jurisdiction.",
  "Well, but --",
  "Well, Article III does trump tradition. I mean, if it doesn't meet Article III, no amount of tradition can save it. And you several times refer, when asked one of these questions, to the tradition and the old cases, but I haven't heard an answer yet to the concrete injury that is suffered by the aggregators.",
  "In all of those cases, the class action, the trustee, you know, the named plaintiff, the named trustee has concrete injury and redressability to themselves?",
  "Very much more than your clients. The trustee has legal obligations that he has to discharge. If it's a suit that he has to bring on behalf of the beneficiaries and doesn't do it, he is sued for breach of trust. In a class action case, the representative has to have standing, has to show concrete injury and redressability. Here we don't have any of that.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Englert. Three minutes, Mr. Phillips. You might start by the point your friend just made. What is the protection that Rule 23 provides that you don't have?",
