  "Didn't -- didn't the Michigan Supreme Court already rule on this issue and said that the statute was constitutional, that there was no right to counsel, therefore no possibility of appointing counsel, paid counsel?",
  "So going through the State system, there's no possibility that these lawyers or the defendants could successfully assert a right to paid counsel --",
  "-- because that's already been decided by the Michigan Supreme Court.",
  "And it was denied.",
  "That's the position you've taken in -- in the Halbert case, that the Court should take the case?",
  "That wasn't true -- that wasn't true in the Pierce v. Society of Sisters case and it wasn't true in the Singleton case. Both of those cases recognized third party standing, although the prohibition was not on the plaintiff who was seeking to raise the rights of another person.",
  "Is that different from Caplin & Drysdale where the lawyers didn't raise the interest of the client and --",

  "How could an indigent bring a 1983 case? I thought you said that that would be barred by Younger.",

  "Well, if that -- that -­ that's -- you're saying that the defendants themselves could not sue now under 1983?",

  "Do we -- do we know whether any of those were cases that didn't fall under the four categories where you a -- a right to?",
  "But one of the problems, I thought, for the indigent is the rulings -- am I correct -- in Michigan, that they're not required -- say, there's an objection. There's no written record that the indigent could look to, even assuming he could understand it, to -­ to determine what issues might be raised on -- on appeal.",

  "May I ask you a practical question about what is currently before the Court? Mr. Casey I think told us that the Halbert case is on for the October 8th conference. If we should grant cert in either of those direct from the Michigan Supreme Court -­ Michigan Supreme Court following Bulger, so you always leave before then. If we should grant in either of those cases, wouldn't the wise thing be to simply hold this case till those are decided?",
  "But he said now he's not taking that position in the Halbert case.",
  "Are you familiar with the Halbert case? You mentioned that there might be a finality problem in Harris.",
  "Did you file a brief in opposition in Halbert?",

  "Can we just go back to the point you just made, it's a little different when the judge has discretion and there's no -­ the judge has discretion to take a whole bunch of things into account, but they're not quantified. And I think that was dramatically illustrated, the difference, by the decision of Judge Lynch when he said, \"Well, I'll go back to the old ways of doing it, I'll look at the Guidelines for some advice,\" he comes out with twenty-four months instead of thirty-three months. So I think there is a huge difference between a judge taking account of many, many factors, not giving them a specific quantity as the Guidelines require.",
  "Suppose the determination, as is occasionally true of the Guidelines, is made not by the Commission, but by Congress itself? Or made by the Commission at the direction of Congress? Then the distinction that you're making between the maximum set by the legislature and the guidance provided, or the guidance to discretion under the Guidelines, really doesn't stand up. So at least to the extent that Congress directly enacts Guidelines, would you concede that then, the critical finding has to be made by the jury?",
  "Is that complexity, is the key or, suppose these Guidelines were proposed by the Commission, just as they are, with all their complexity, but they were proposed as legislation, and then Congress enacted these Guidelines, would you be able to make the argument that you're making, still? The Federal system, now legislative guidelines is viable after Blakely?",
  "But that's not so clear anymore, it just happens that there are three members, but they don't have to be any judicial members, under the current legislation.",
  "May I ask",
  "- about practical experience in that regard. I understand the Department of Justice has told prosecutors that now you allege these sentencing enhancers -- like drug quantity, like amount of property stolen -­ you allege them in the indictment, you prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. Has that proved intractably difficult in cases where it has been attempted?",
  "And if it were done that way, why would it be that you would try to change the word \"shall\" to \"may\" in (b)? Why not just have Section 3553(a), which does list the judges may take into account in sentencing, one of -- among three or four others?",
  "Which has the guidelines -­",
  "-- as one of other factors.",
  "I hope you will go over to the -- to the severability problem, because, as I understood it, you and the Government were very much at odds about what should be severed and what shouldn't, and we didn't get to ask Mr. Clement about his severance, which was going to be that to the extent no plus factors are involved, no sentence-enhancing factors are involved, the guidelines remain binding. He didn't get a chance to say that in his argument, and I hope he'll address it. And you say, \"Whatever you do, don't make it half binding and half advisory.\"",
  "And why would it be so terrible to say, \"Well, to the extent that there are no sentencing enhancing factors, let's preserve what Congress did, let's make them binding when the jury doesn't have to find anything\"?",
  "But then what about all the factors -- Justice Breyer outlined four categories of, of guideline factors that are not easily, if at all, presented to the jury. The Chief Justice mentioned the one of perjury at the trial itself. Could never give that to a jury because it hasn't happened until the trial. And some of the others that become very complicated, like he mentioned, other -- other relevant conduct, relevant conduct, yeah.",
  "So that would just be out.",
  "It would have to be prosecuted as a separate -­",
  "But a special verdict wouldn't do from the point of view of the defendant, I think would resist it very heavily, if what the findings have to be are, say, a much larger drug quantity, the relevant conduct. These are things that could be damning for a defendant. So a defendant surely would not want that, all of this to be tried to the jury that's going to try the basic case. The defendant would much prefer to have the jury not know about that it wasn't five ounces, that it was 500 grams, or that, at the same time, the defendant did a lot of other bad things.",
  "So you would have to have, then, essentially two trials.",
  "Do you know what the Kansas system is? I mean, right after Apprendi, they transformed their guideline system into one where the jury makes the findings, but are all of their trials bifurcated?",
  "Judge Hornby had some distress in doing that, didn't he, because the difference was quite large? Based on what the judge found, it would have been fifteen or sixteen years as opposed to five or six years?",
  "He didn't say it, that that was his discretionary choice. He said that -­ -",
  "He made, he made those findings of fact, that -- leadership role and the quantity of drugs.",
  "And on the basis of those two he said the guidelines would require me to come up with this higher sentence, not that using the guidelines as advisory he would have gotten -­",
  "And then the other, that's the high range, and the low range is, I'll just stick with the crime that he was indicted for, and that's five or six years.",
  "That's quite a windfall for Mr. Fanfan, isn't it?",
  "But your method -- your method will over-emphasize the dry years. So either way you have a -- a imperfect situation. In your case, year by year, and in a dry year, Colorado perhaps must over­ compensate, and if you have, say, 3 dry years in a row, then it's going to be -- work out to Colorado's disadvantage.",
  "That's the method that you're attacking, but if you were to do it year by year, wouldn't it be just the reverse?",
  "But aren't you bypassing what Congress set up? You have this interstate compact and this commission, which you're saying, well, it's ineffective because it has to -- there are three from each State and it has to do everything unanimously.

And as I understand both Delaware and the Pecos River case, the special master recommended the appointment of a river master.",
  "What did the special -­",

  "But the district court -- the district court -- this way --",
  "-- seemed to focus on the use of the word \"micro color,\" just the word. It didn't bring up what was new in 1999. That is, a brochure appears where \"micro color\" is not simply a word, but it appears in a logo-like fashion. And as I understand it, the district court said you could use \"micro color\" as you had been using it since 1991. It didn't refer to the stylized 1999 new brochure. So -­",
  "And it might not have been confusion just by using the word. But when you're using it in the logo-like appearance, maybe that's different.",
  "The Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit, as I understand it, did put an initial burden on the trademark-holder to prove confusion. If you look at the petition for cert, 6a, in its opinion, it seems to recognize that the trademark-holder must show that the alleged infringer's use of the mark is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive. So this opinion starts out by saying, \"Yes, we know that under the Lanham Act the trademark-holder is obliged to show likelihood of confusion.\"",
  "They do have one authority for that proposition. They cite McCarthy, and I think they're right about that.",
  "But there is a treatise writer who does take the position that if there's confusion, there's no fair-use defense.",
  "So does the -- what is it -­ the unfair competition restatement?",
  "But I thought we're dealing with an incontestable mark here, and the secondary meaning would be assumed.",
  "Wasn't there -- wasn't there something to the effect that \"micro pigmentation\" is a synonym in the trade for permanent make-up? It's another name for permanent make-up, and it's -- it has \"micro\" in it, \"micro pigmentation.\"",
  "\"Micro pigmentation\" sounds awfully close to \"micro color.\"",
  "How do you tell whether it's used as a mark? I mean, is that -- that certainly seems to be central. Is it used as a mark? And if it's used as a mark, then there is a violation.",
  "Right.",
  "So let's go back to the use on the brochure of a logo-like -- I mean, as long as they're using just the word \"micro color,\" I see your position entirely, it's used descriptively, not as a mark. But what about when they use something that looks like a mark?",

  "But, what about the word, is it -- am I wrong in what I suggested before, that the word, \"micro pigmentation\" is used in the trade as a synonym for permanent makeup?",
  "Ms. Brinkmann, may I stop you there, because I thought you have conceded, as I think you must, I thought you conceded quite clearly, I wrote down that you said, it is the plaintiff's burden to show likelihood of confusion. So, if it's the plaintiff's burden to show likelihood of confusion, how can it be the defendant's burden to show unlikelihood of confusion?",
  "I thought they did when they outlined to us what it means is you're using it descriptively, and not as a mark.",
  "Ms. Brinkmann, am I right that several cases say, the key here is, are you using it as a mark. Because that suggests you're trying to pawn off your goods as another's. Are you using it as a mark? Or, are you using it, merely descriptively? I thought use as a mark was the key, you're using it as a mark, you're not using it in good faith.",
  "How about if the ruling were a defendant who uses a descriptive term fairly and in good faith to describe its goods or services is not liable for infringement, even if some residual confusion is likely. That's what the Restatement that you've just been applauding says.",
  "Well, you would win -",
  "Ms. Brinkmann, am I right that they were, \"they\" being KP, they were in fact using the word \"micro color\" before you registered your trademark?",
  "But that would be -- that would be a disputed issue of fact.",

  "But the age 18 is set even for such things as buying tobacco. The -- the dividing line between people who are members of the community, the adult community, is pervasively 18, to vote, to sit on juries, to serve in the military. Why should it be that someone is death-eligible under the age of 18 but not eligible to be an adult member of the community?",

That's one of the pieces of this that's incomprehensible, that you are suggesting someone can be detained indefinitely who we allowed in temporarily, but such treatment could not occur with respect to somebody that had no permission at any time to be here.",
  "Which can be revoked. Which can be revoked, and that's the -- the distinction that seems to me strange. When somebody commits a deportable offense, they are stripped of whatever right they had to be here. They are, it seems to me, in the same boat as someone who is excludable. They -- they do -- do not have any right to remain no more than a parolee has. We have taken away their right to remain. So it seems to me that they have no status anymore based on a prior admission that we have removed from them.",

It may satisfy the 1 U.S.C. definition of vessel, but it has to be in navigation to be covered by the Jones Act.

  "Well, why don't you just say the scow was a vessel? End of case. The scow was a vessel. It was moving. That's where he was injured.",
  "But as Mr. Kaplan pointed out, all -- the fact that something is a vessel doesn't mean there's Jones Act coverage, and I think Mr. Kaplan was getting to the perils of the sea. Someone who's working on a boat that is not in the water day in and day out is never exposed to the perils of the sea.",
  "One peril was a collision with another vessel, and that's exactly what happened here.",
  "But how do you -- how can you possibly describe as a bright line test anything that says you have to identify the primary function? Plus, even if it's not its primary function, if it happens to be moving at the time of the accident, then there's coverage. That doesn't seem to me very bright line.",
  "Even though the identical accident happens to his buddy 10 minutes before when the vessel isn't moving.",
  "There's a difference to this extent, would you agree, that something that's just tied up to the dock and never moves is different from something that is actually in the water and whether you call it transportation, it is moving? It has to move to engage in the construction of this tunnel.",
  "Well, I'm just -- let's focus on what is a vessel because someone -- it may be a vessel but the injured person may not be a seaman. Those are two different things. This is only the first step. So when you're bringing in what the worker does, whether it's a croupier or whatever, the only question that we are considering is, is this dredge a vessel? We're not involved with the question of whether the worker is a seaman unless we pass that basic threshold.",
  "The -- the word vessel does appear in the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act.",

  "On the individualized, there was something that I didn't grasp. You say we don't know anything about these people, so we have to have that 60­ day period to find out about them. The presentence report we're told accompanies the conviction, the prisoner's conviction. So the presentence report will have a fair amount of information about the offender, will it not?",

Why should we count at all in the defendant's favor that he was -- he absented himself from trial any more than we would give a fugitive credit for not being there?",
  "Not entirely because both in the opening and in closing, the lawyer said to the jury, he did it, but I want you to know from my very opening that this case is about life or death, and that's the ultimate decision you will have to make. He said that in his opening and he said it in his closing. It wasn't simply a case of saying, my client did and now the prosecutor is going to go through the motions. He told the jury, what I want you to focus on is the decision you're going to have to make whether, in the counsel's words, to spare his life.",
  "Well, you say without consent. At least as -- the record that we have suggests that the client was told this is what the lawyer planned to do and said nothing. Justice Scalia asked a question when the prior argument was ongoing. When a client doesn't say yes and he doesn't say no, to take the words of a familiar song, mustn't the lawyer then do what he thinks is best to do? Because if he says, okay, I'm going to -- I'm going to require a full-stop trial, I'm going to cross examine every witness, he may be damaging his client. The client didn't tell him not to do that any more than he told him to do it. So mustn't the lawyer in that situation exercise his best judgment?",
  "Why? When -- when his object is to spare this person's life. He knows the evidence is very strong. He wants, to the extent that he can, insulate the penalty phase from all that damning evidence that's coming out at the trial. So he wants the evidence to come out at the trial, but he doesn't want to be in a situation where the jury has heard the defendant resist the determination that he did it and then have to plead for his life after.",
  "Well, my problem -- and I -­ I'm not sure I understand your answer to it. In this case, in fact the client didn't say yes and he didn't say no. So if the -- if the lawyer is to assume, well, then since I don't have a positive, explicit yes, I will assume the answer is no, even though that is against the lawyer's best interest -- the -- the lawyer's best judgment, why is he an effective counsel if he assumes the answer is no?",
  "May I ask you a question that I asked the other side? And that is, if we don't accept your argument, if we think when the client is silent, the lawyer must exercise his best judgment and not assume that the client would give an answer that would jeopardize the client's position, if that's the position that this Court adopts, what would you say is left over for remand? Is it simply that the Florida Supreme Court then takes the record as it is and determines under Strickland whether there was effective -- ineffective performance?",
  "That would be -- that would be all. So what do we do with, in the brief, all this information about things that the lawyer should have done by way of cross examination? That wasn't put in the record earlier -­",
  "Why was it denied in the trial court? Why was the introduction of what the lawyer might have done -­",
  "Mr. Goldstein, before you do that, before you deal with the EEOC regulation, this statute doesn't -- at least on -- on the page 1 part you called our attention to, doesn't refer to business necessity. That's in the EEOC regulation. If I were just reading this statute cold, I'd say, yes, that looks like an affirmative defense to me, but reasonable factor seems like something quite different than necessity. It isn't necessary for the business to do this, but it's reasonable. And if that's -- then the business necessity -- it seems to me, at least arguably, an improper construction of this act, that the EEOC got it wrong when it referred to business necessity. They were thinking of Griggs and -- and title VII, but this statute says reasonable factors.",
  "Well, I'm not sure you're right about that, Mr. Goldstein, because if you think of what it was, it was a pen and paper test and it was a high school diploma. Now, an employer might well think I want to upgrade my work force. I want this to be a real classy work force. So I'm going to require a high school diploma. It isn't necessary, but why is it unreasonable for me to do that? So I -- I don't -- I think Griggs spoke about rules that were built in headwinds because a large part of the population didn't have the opportunity to get high school diplomas. That doesn't exist in the age discrimination area. So I -- I don't think that Griggs is an example of something that was a loose business necessity rule.",
  "There haven't been a whole lot of cases under the impact theory as applied to age, and you just said you're not talking about the cost category but that -- you mentioned physical fitness. And there was a case. Smith against Des Moines involved that, but it was found the -- the physical fitness test was job- related. Have there been mutual rules with a disparate impact that you can give us as examples? When you're talking about race and sex, the examples come to mind much more readily than in the age category.",
  "Verdi wrote Falstaff when he was 70 -- late -- in his late 70's. It was his greatest creation. Something.",
  "No. 34.",
  "Yes, but not whole texts, not -- I don't remember whether it was (1)-(1) and (2) or (a) and (b), but this is not a word, age. It's -- it's lines and lines, and to -- and to say, oh, in Griggs we held that the title VII language -- this language means you can have a disparate impact theory, but in age, we're going to read those very same words to prohibit. In one sense -- one you read to say, these words permit disparate impact, and then you read the same words to say these words prohibit -­",
  "-- disparate impact.",
  "But he gave the very same example that was Griggs. He gave the example of the high school diploma because he thought that people of a certain age, when there wasn't such general education as there is today, might not have a high school diploma to a much higher extent than the people who came -- the generation who came after.",
  "Well, it's a little, and you said his solution was we're going to have training and manuals and all. But that's not altogether clear.",
  "But it doesn't say there that that is to implement the first -- that -- that only the second one, to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination.",
  "On your reading, I just don't see that there's any function. I mean, if disparate impact is out of it, then -- then what work is there for the reasonable factor other than age to do?",
  "Would -- would you concede that -- that this is at least sloppy drafting? Because they said any in one place, they said State or Federal in other places. Shouldn't they be -- be consistent in their terminology?",
  "Well, the -- the court of appeals here said what it would -- it read in a check. It said it wouldn't read it to really mean any conviction. It had to be in a system that was fundamentally fair. Wasn't that what the court of appeals said?",
  "May -- may we go back to the -- the choice that you were given by Justice Scalia first and then Justice Breyer? I thought that someone who comes in here illegally and possesses a gun commits an offense.",
  "So -- so there's not -- Congress would say to that hypothetical, we've got a third choice, much more sensible. Anybody who sneaks in here without permission and has a gun -­",
  "-- commits a crime.",
  "Mr. Boas, when they combined these two -­",
  "-- and ones -- the 1202 did say Federal or State -- they made other changes, harmonizations. In the explanation of their consolidation of the two sections, to what extent did they discuss changes and the reasons for them?",
  "But they did -- they did explain other things -­",
  "-- other changes, but this one -- there's silence -­",
  "-- as far as I understand.",
  "How -- how about -­",
  "And this is one I'm -- I'm surprised that you didn't cite, but it -- I don't think you did -- EEOC against Arabian American Oil Company, where the wording of the statute was anyplace outside the United States, title VII coverage, and this Court held that anyplace outside the United States did not mean that a U.S. employer operating abroad had to abide by the anti­ discrimination norms with respect to hiring in some place abroad because Congress was thinking in terms of the inter-State sitting -- setting and not international.",
  "That -- that was a decision by the Chief. So -­",
  "There is -- there's an overarching concern and I'll -- I'd like to put it to you right from the beginning. When a legislature legislates, be it the State or Federal Government, it is generally thinking in terms of its own domain, its own bailiwick. When Congress legislates, it's thinking about the United States. Sometimes it's thinking about abroad, but most of the time when it is, it says so. And we have a number of cases, not just the Arabian American Oil Company. I mean, that -- the language of title VII was between a State and anyplace outside thereof, anyplace outside thereof. And in that very case, the Chief made the point that I'm putting to you now, that Congress thinks about the United States, our country, and if it means to say something that will take in other places in the world, it says so clearly. And we don't make the assumption that Congress was intending to have any extraterritorial flip to its law unless it tells us that. That's my overall concern about the Government's position in this case.",
  "Which was it? Just -- what was the case you just mentioned?",
  "Well, that -- that example, which you gave in your brief, gave me this concern. The problem that you've just been describing, the State convictions that may be invalid but is being used under 922, I regard that as a kind of a venue question because you can go back to the State that rendered the conviction and say, State, I was convicted in violation of the Constitution, give me my good habeas writ that I get -­ can get from the State. Then I wipe out that conviction and I don't have it anymore. But the person who's been convicted, say, in whatever examples -- take -- Zimbabwe would be another example. Libya. To go back to that system and get a conviction expunged. That's why you can't use a case within the U.S. system where it's a question of where do you go to wipe out your prior conviction. And for someone abroad, there isn't that option.",
  "But that's -- that's a question of waiver or forfeiture. Those are the ordinary rules that apply.",
  "But -- but there's a basic rule in civil as well as criminal procedure, that if you want to attack a judgment, you go where that judgment was rendered. And of course, you should abide by the timing rules of that, but that's just a very sensible thing within a federal union. If you're -- if you're attacking what State A does, go to State A, don't tell State C.",
  "But that -- that doesn't operate internationally.",
  "Yes, but you're not building that into your interpretation of the statute at all because you have said in your brief -- and correct me if I've got you wrong -- you don't like what the Third Circuit did. You say just the fact of the conviction counts. Don't investigate, court, whether it was a fair system that comports with fundamental notions of due process. Just see if there's a conviction anyplace in the world. And so what -- what you're telling me is that it doesn't matter that you didn't appeal because even if he were precluded from appealing for some reason that we would consider totally unfair, it doesn't matter on your view of this statute.",
  "But that's -- that's standard for judgments anyway. When the judgment is final, it means you've gotten through the first -- it has preclusive effect. Almost always, when a judgment is overturned on appeal, then you go back to State 2 and say, look, it's been overturned on appeal, and at least in the civil side, almost always State 2 will say, okay, we'll give you post- judgment relief because what we were relying on as our sister State judgment is no longer on the books. I can't imagine that in our criminal system it doesn't work the same way.",
  "I'm asking if it's alien in our criminal justice system, not in deportation, not in -­ extradition is somebody who did somebody -- something abroad, and we don't send people just to anyplace. Don't we have to have a treaty?",
  "Because the person is going to be tried in that other system, and we have bound -­ within our international system, we say we're part of a world community and we want Japan to extradite people who have done bad things here to the United States, and so similarly, we will extradite to Japan. We don't want them to look at our system and judge it. We're sending somebody to be tried there. So extradition is -- is something entirely different than -­",
  "Well, we have the check already that these are -- these are places with whom we want to do criminal justice business together. So -­",
  "And then we have the -- we have the document where it's very clear we want to have extradition with the UK, with Japan. Here, you're relying on the word court, and you don't have it all spelled out like you do in an extradition treaty. And that's the problem here. Sure, if Congress had said we mean foreign court, then that would be it, but it hasn't said that and we have to determine does it mean the same thing as it means in the extradition context or the deportation context where you have a clear statement that Congress means a tribunal abroad.",
  "But if somebody is coming into the country, somebody is asking to come in, any conviction that you're talking about, of course, refers to someplace abroad.",
  "Ms. -­",
  "Ms. Millett.",
  "Ms. Millett, there are many lawyers in Congress and at least the law students of my generation -- some of them are of that elder age. We learned in law school one country doesn't enforce the penal judgments of another. This is a kind of enforcement of a penal judgment of another, not exactly, but something like it. Another reason why I would expect a Congress, knowing that background norm, would say, when it meant foreign, foreign. Unlike the context of the immigration, yes, there are some people who left and came back, but many -- and -- and we have all this whole line of cases. Is adultery a crime of moral turpitude, and you know, those go back to the '20's. But this, which came about only because of the merger of two statutes, one saying Federal and State, the other not, and no explanation at all, in light of all these anomalies that have been brought out. Shouldn't we say to Congress maybe that's what you meant, but if you did, you have an opportunity to say so before we read in foreign?",
  "Do you know why?",
  "Do you know why they stopped funding it? Why did -- because I think that's been reenacted every year. No money for this. Why -- why did Congress stop funding it?",
  "That's --",
  "That was LaFave. You cited LaFave in your brief for that proposition.",
  "You -- you made the point, in answer to Justice O'Connor, that a police officer in Washington is not required to divulge on the spot the reason for the arrest. What is the point at which the arrestee under Washington law is entitled to know the cause of the arrest?",
  "Is it -- is it at the arraignment or the -- at the earlier booking in the police station?",
  "Is it -- is it -- is the time when the arrestee must told you are being arrested for X reason, is that when the arrestee appears before the magistrate or is it earlier when he's brought into the police station and he's booked? The arrest is booked. At which point?",
  "You also said that you thought this case is distinguishable on the legitimacy of taping the conversation with the police officer on the highway. Why -- why do you think this is distinguishable from the Washington Intermediate Appellate Court decision that the -- that the -- that Alford wanted to show to the police officer?",
  "Do you know if there's been any instruction in the State of Washington to police following that Flora decision about taping -- about arresting people for taping conversations with police officers?",
  "The flashing headlights which was -- there was a citation. There was an arrest for the tape recording and a citation for the flashing headlights. Could there have been a -- an arrest for the flashing headlights, or is that a lesser category of offense that's not an arrestable offense?",
  "But he was never -- never charged with the impersonating an officer, only with the flashing headlights. Is that right?",
  "Why is it subjective? I mean, in -- in Whren, the question was finding a hidden motive as distinguished from the motive that was written out. Here, there's nothing subjective about what the officer charged this person with on the spot. He told him. There wasn't anything hidden in his mind. He said, I'm arresting you for X reason, for tape recording. And then they had a whole colloquy. So what the -- what the arrest was for is as objective as it can be.",
  "You -- you predicted that this would be in practice very bad. There are some jurisdictions that have the closely related test, are there not?",
  "But the -- outside the Ninth Circuit.",
  "Do we know whether these horribles have occurred there, that the police are booking for everything?",
  "But if they're told in this case that they're subject to 1983 liability out of their own pockets if they get it wrong, then it seems to me they would pursue the safe course and say nothing. I mean, you did say at one point in your brief that when a warrantless arrest is effected, the officer must inform the arrestee of the officer's authority and cause of arrest. But that's not true on the spot as a matter of Washington law or constitutional law, is it?",
  "Well, you're not urging that the Constitution requires the officer on the spot to state the cause of the arrest, or are you?",
  "But I thought that the reason that the police went after your client after he left the vehicle that was disabled was because the officers at that point suspected that he might be impersonating a police officer. That's what the people in the -- the disabled vehicle told the officer. They said he had flashing headlights. We thought he was a police officer. And -­ and wasn't the original following of your client triggered by the suspicion that he might be impersonating a police officer?",
  "Well, then you have a very narrow view of closely related. It comes down to misnomer cases. It's one thing to say -- what the officers told the DA, although after they arrested him -- didn't they describe the whole episode from when they saw Alford pull up behind the disabled vehicle? They described that and they mentioned the flashing lights. They described the whole episode up till the point where they -- the officers apprehended him and saw the equipment and then noticed -­ they told the DA everything, and he said, yes, you have probable cause.",
  "So why couldn't it be related in time and space rather than legally related?",
  "But you've already conceded that it -- Washington law doesn't require the officer on the spot to say why he's making the arrest and that there's no decision of this Court or any court that I know that said the Constitution requires the officer on the spot to give a reason.",
  "Well, why -- why are you resisting that the -- that the police report gave an identified building? I mean, you're -- you're saying that one mustn't look behind, in the case of a guilty plea, to find the police report or even the police application for complaint. But there isn't any question, is there, that the police reports in fact gave addresses of particular buildings?",
  "So what -- what you're saying is the conviction itself didn't show that, and so the question is whether you can look to documents that in fact showed it.",
  "But if the defendant at the plea colloquy had said, yes, I entered X building or even in the plea bargain had said that, even though the charge just read the boiler plate, the whole statute, buildings, vessels, et cetera, if he had admitted it either in the plea colloquy or in the plea bargain, wouldn't that be enough?",
  "-- let us look to and what kinds of things not? All we're interested in is what was he charged with, which of these three things.",
  "I thought Judge Gertner said she didn't know whether anybody had seen this police report. It wasn't attached to the charge. I thought that was her position, that these are untested documents. We don't know one way or another whether the judge that accepted the plea had seen them.",
  "But we don't have any colloquy. We don't know what happened at the -- you're saying it's -- it's altogether likely that that happened, but we don't know.",
  "So if the defendant says, yes, I plead guilty to this crime and the crime is described as ship, vessel, car, building, and that's -- if that's all that happened is the boiler plate charge that just repeats the statute and the defendant says, yes, I did that, but nothing tells us did what, other than violate the statute.",
  "Mr. Elwood, we had a case last term involving a search warrant, Groh against Ramirez, and it -- it was very clear that the application for the warrant identified specifically what the police were to search for, but the warrant itself didn't. And this Court held you couldn't look behind that blank warrant for the particulars that were revealed in the warrant application. And I suppose this is similar in the sense that we have the conviction and you're saying, but you can look behind that conviction to something that, we don't know, may or may not have been before the court.",
  "Well, Taylor -- Taylor doesn't quite have this full for example because there's another paragraph following the for example paragraph which says we hold an offense constitutes burglary for purposes of 924(e) if either the statutory definition corresponds to generic burglary, which it doesn't here, or the charging paper, which it doesn't here, and jury instructions, which the judge tells the jury you must find this in order to convict. Those are not for examples. That paragraph says you've got three things you can look to. You can look to the statutory definition. You can look to the charging paper, and you can look to the jury instruction. And that's it.",
  "Mr. Miller, do --",
  "-- on -- on the interpretation you've just explained to us, does that mean that the Secretary has no authority under this statute or generally to reserve some portion of this for what you call Federal functions, that it -- every penny of the appropriation could go to the costs of this contract and nothing left in the till for the so-called Federal functions?",
  "But your -- your answer is, yes, if it came to that, they -­",
  "Well, let me ask you another question related. Suppose -- this is an individual action. These are individual actions. They're not class actions.",
  "Do the ones who come to court to sue get paid in full even though there may be many other self-determination contracts out there, and that if you gave them all their fair share, none of them would be paid in full? Does it just depend on first come to court, first served, and the less litigious are just out of luck?",
  "Well, you can't say that the Government agrees to that. You certainly agree to it.",
  "But how do you -- how do you square that with the -- on page 14a -- reductions and, as Mr. Miller read to us, shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract managing -- monitoring or administration by the Secretary, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions, including but not limited to, and then a string of what I assume falls under the heading Federal functions.",
  "So are these noninherent Federal functions shall not be reduced to pay for Federal functions? So there's inherent Federal functions and noninherent?",
  "On -- on that point -- on that point, in the Federal Circuit Judge Dyke expressed considerable displeasure with the Government because he said three times I said, tell me what existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced if these contract support costs are paid in full. And he said, I asked them again and again and again, and they were unresponsive. So since the Government declined to tell the court what programs -- existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced, mustn't we assume, as I think the Federal Circuit did, that the proof is unavailable and no existing program with other tribes would have been diminished?",
  "Now, what does that mean?",
  "I mean, one thing is existing contracts, things that are already ongoing, and then another thing is, well, we think that there's a new program that could be good for some tribe. So we're going to put that new program in and say that that steps in front of these contract support costs. Are we talking just about existing programs that -- that the Government has made a commitment to, or are we saying the Government is at liberty to benefit tribes? And so what if the contract support costs are, as a result, diminished? We're still doing good for tribes.",
  "Was that a new program or an existing program?",
  "Why was there that difference between the BIA that got the statutory caps earlier and not till, was it, 4 years later for the IHS?",
  "But it's also limited to vessels. It's smuggling by water, not smuggling by - -",
  "-- vehicles, as was done here, so that we don't have any statute that covers smuggling on land.",
  "But if we did -- if we did enforce even a tax judgment of another country, there would be no U.S. law that would be violated. You're talking about a common law, no country enforces the taxes of another. But, at least in the Restatement of Foreign Relations now, that's put in terms of -- there's no requirement that any country enforce the tax claims or judgments of another; but neither is there any prohibition.",
  "May I - -",
  "May I ask you, Ms. Brill, something that puzzled me about this case? It is a rather peculiar use of our wire fraud statute. Are there any proceedings going on in Canada? Has there been any attempt to extradite these people?",
  "May I ask you, when -- now that we're getting into money, one of the things that the sentencing court had to do was to find out how much of a loss there was, and that involved determining what taxes would be due under Canadian law. And did that increase the sentence? Did the -- did the sentence vary with the amount of taxes that they -- we found due?",
  "A judge making that assessment.",
  "Where? Using a gun where?",
  "Well, if we're concerned about offending the foreign country, then isn't the way to go, in fact, the way Congress has gone in this area, we negotiate treaties? I mean, one of the reasons why we go the treaty route are the kind of problems that Justice Breyer brought up, we want to have reciprocal treaties. We want two things. We want to make sure that it's a basically fair system that we're dealing with. On the other hand, we want to say, \"If we do anything with respect to your taxes, we want to make sure that we get the same benefit from you with respect to ours.\" So never mind the revenue rule, isn't it pervasive that -- when it comes to enforcing tax claims, that the route that Congress has chosen to go, and the Executive, as well, has been the treaty route?",
  "One of - -",
  "-- one of -- one of the last interests that you mentioned, about offending foreign governments, well, on the face of this, it would seem, the one that -- the country that's been done out of taxes is Canada, not the United States. So, we should help Canada, if it's interested in collecting revenue from these people or trying them for a criminal offense, to do that. It - - I asked Ms. Brill, Have they been indicted in Canada? She said yes, but she said it's -- they had not -- there has not been a request for extradition. Is that -- is that - -",
  "To go to one more aspect of the statute which I don't think you've addressed, Congress said that -- with respect to the wire fraud and mail fraud and, I think, other things -- that restitution to the victim is mandatory, that it's not left up to the government to decide restitution or not. Except here restitution sounds very much like enforcing Canada's taxes, so you have conceded no restitution. But it seems to me that Congress thought of the wire/mail fraud statutes as cases in which there would be restitution, and that suggests that they didn't envision foreign taxes to be the object of the scheme to defraud.",
  "Now, how could that be, because restitution is to the victim? The victim is Canada. You collect Congress -- or Canada's tax, and you give it to Canada. Is there any other kind of restitution?",
  "Well, that view is in - - somewhat in tension with your view that the common law revenue rule doesn't stand in the way of this prosecution. If you have to interpret the statute in light of the general rule that one country doesn't mess with another country's taxes, absent a treaty.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you - - this is such a curious case. You were very candid in telling us that when Canada put these astronomical taxes on tobacco and alcohol, that was almost an invitation to smugglers. Did we have any discussions with Canada -- I mean, they do have that border, which is rather easy to cross -- about what we were going to do when they put the taxes on liquor sky-high?",
  "What do we make of the Chief Justice's clear statement, not once but twice, in Boyde? The prosecutor never suggested that background and character evidence could not be considered. So mustn't we take Boyde with that qualification when we have a case where the prosecutor, indeed, suggested that this information could not be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor?",
  "Not that -- that the jury misunderstood the judge's instruction, that there was no instruction. I mean, the -- the picture that's given here is the defense attorney says, I can use this to mitigate. The prosecutor says this is not legitimate mitigating evidence, and he said that several times. And the judge said, well, you can both argue it, and the judge never instructed the jury. He left it to the prosecutors to argue the law to the jury and for the jury to make that legal determination. It -- it seems to me that that - - that is surely an error. Now, you could still say, well, even so, it was harmless. But -- but I don't think -- can there be any doubt when the judge tells the attorneys, you argue the law to the jury and let the jury decide what the law is?",
  "Suppose -- suppose I were to take the view that it is a violation of clearly established law for a court to allow a prosecutor repeatedly to misstate the law, misinform the jury about what the law is on a life or death question without correcting that misstatement, without saying to the jury, jury, it's not for the prosecutor to argue what the law is. I tell you what the law. If the judge doesn't do that, then that meets any standard of violating clearly established law about which there should be no doubt that when the prosecutor makes a misstatement on a life or death question, it is the judge's obligation to say, jury, he is wrong. You take your instruction from me and here's my instruction. Suppose that's my view of this case. I don't -- Boyde and all these other cases -- it just strikes me that that's clearly wrong. What do I do with that?",
  "Well, now you're getting to the question I think that Justice O'Connor raised a few minutes ago about are you urging, yes, this is error, but it was harmless?",
  "What -- what admonition was sufficient? The court said something about evidence and everybody -- I mean, there's no question what the prosecutor said isn't evidence. But he didn't tell them he has misstated the law. We're not talking about - - evidence is not at issue at all. Neither side suggests that it is. It's a question is what is the law that governs this controversy, what is the law that the jury must apply to make a life or death decision.",
  "And -- and you --",
  "-- you said the judge corrected it, and I read this joint appendix. I could not find any correction.",
  "Then -- then it -- then it has another problem with it because then the judge is saying that's an argument. Jury, you've heard arguments on both sides. You decide. But it isn't for the jury to decide what the law is.",
  "Well, why wouldn't the jury conclude -- why isn't it the most logical conclusion that, gee, the judge had us sit here through eight witnesses and listen to all that and he didn't exclude any part of it, so of course we must consider it because otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to all of it?",
  "The -- the prosecutor, at the very end of his closing to the jury, did seem, even if grudgingly with it, to recognize that -- that this evidence was mitigating. I'm looking at page 76 of the joint appendix at the top of the page. He makes the statement, the law is simple. It says aggravating factors outweigh mitigating, and then how do those factors line up? Well, the facts of the case showing the violence, et cetera -- that's on the aggravating side. And then against that, defendant really has nothing except newborn Christianity and the fact that he's 28 years old. So that -- in that final word to the jury, the prosecutor seems to be saying, yes, they have mitigating factors, but they're insubstantial, 28 years old and the claim that he's a newborn Christian.",
  "Does that imply that your answer is yes to the question? If we say, as you urge, a dog sniff is not a search, then the police are free to parade up and down every street in the country with dogs sniffing car trunks.",
  "One could characterize those episodes under the, quote, special needs doctrine. I mean, we are exposed to searches at airports that we would not put up with walking up and down an ordinary street. So the dogs at the terminals one expects nowadays.",
  "I think there was a reference to my lady's bath in the opinion.",
  "You said there's no disturbance of one's privacy and so that distinguishes the dog sniff from some other governmental intrusions. But dogs can be frightening, humiliating. It seems to me that there is some association with the idea that I have a right to be let alone by my government and having a large dog circle my car.",
  "Are there -- are there any manuals for law enforcement officers with respect to the time and place of using dogs, or it's just open season?",
  "I don't mean the training to make the dog alert properly. How the police will use them, when, under what circumstances.",
  "Well, they said it's to find out if there's any contraband.",
  "The answer was they are at liberty -- the police are at liberty to use dogs to find contraband. And your -- Illinois I think was very candid with the Court in saying we have taken from your decisions that a dog sniff is not a search. So anything else is a matter of police policy. It had nothing to do with the Fourth Amendment.",
  "There was something you said in -- in your brief that I thought was unclear. So may I ask you - -",
  "-- if Officer Gillette, the one who did the arrest for speeding, had a dog in the back of his car, instead of having the second officer come with the dog, would it have been permissible? I thought you had conceded that it would be a different situation if the dog was already there when the car stopped.",
  "No, he didn't, but I'm asking you to imagine that he did.",
  "No. I would like to take this scenario as it is except that when the officer gets out of the car, his dog comes with him.",
  "This is very -- make no other changes except that Gillette has the dog and Gillette with the dog go to Mr. Caballes' car.",
  "But you -- I'm --",
  "But I'm -- I'm trying to understand what you meant in your brief when you said if the dog had been in Gillette's car when Gillette stopped Caballes, the situation would have been different.",
  "So then it really makes no difference whether it was Gillette who had the dog in his car or whether the dispatcher called another officer who had the dog.",
  "It doesn't -- so you're retracting that. You, I think, were asked but I'm -- I'm not sure you fully answered. Suppose the police, as Atwater would allow, arrested, made a full arrest of Caballes, and then they impound his car. In the place where they put it, couldn't they have a dog go around the car there?",
  "But he could have. He could have. I mean - -",
  "-- is -- is - -",
  "Could the officer change his mind? I mean, he -- he did say I'm just going to give you a citation, and then he said, mind if I search your car. This is before the -- the dog showed up. And suppose the person who had been speeding said, yes, I mind. Don't search my car. And then the police said, well, in that case I'm going to arrest you.",
  "But you had already drawn the line at a different place than Justice Breyer suggested because in response to Justice Scalia, you said if it - - if it were going into the bus terminal just to sniff for narcotics, unlike explosives, it would be an impermissible search.",
  "That would be - -",
  "But, as Justice O'Connor brought out earlier, all those cases -- Wickard, Perez - - they all involve a commercial enterprise. And, here, we're told this is different, because nobody is buying anything, nobody is selling anything.",
  "But there's - -",
  "-- but there is, in this record, a showing that, for at least one of the two plaintiffs, there were some 30-odd drugs taken, none of them worked. This was the only one that would. And it - - Justice Souter asked you about these two plaintiffs. The law can't be made on the basis of those two plaintiffs. But let's suppose that you're right, generally. If there were to be a prosecution of any of the plaintiffs in this case, would there be any defense, if there were to be a federal prosecution?",
  "Have there - -",
  "-- have there been any applications to change the schedule for marijuana to the FDA?",
  "If one - -",
  "-- if one takes your view, that this is non-economic activity, so it's outside Congress' commerce power, then explain to me why, if you have someone similarly situated in a neighboring state, somebody whose doctor says, \"This person needs marijuana to live,\" but that state doesn't have a Compassionate-Use Act -- it's just as isolated -- no purchase, no sale, grown at home, good friend grows it -- and yet you say Congress could regulate that, if I understand your brief properly.",
  "But if you -- if you buy that -- so your first answer is, yes, on your first argument, it would be equally impermissible for the feds to regulate medical use anywhere.",
  "All right. Now you're going to have some limiting - -",
  "Yeah, but it doesn't right now, and that doesn't make the scheme less valid, in your view.",
  "Some of the illnesses - -",
  "In one -- in one plaintiff's case, I think, there isn't a life-threatening - -",
  "May I just ask you one procedural question?",
  "And this is -- this is a suit for an injunction. And it -- basically an injunction against a criminal prosecution.",
  "And --",
  "-- and there's an old saying, in equity, that courts don't enjoin criminal prosecutions. So how is your injunction suit appropriate, given that old saying meant that you have to make your defense in the criminal proceeding and not enjoin this operation?",
  "Where --",
  "-- where was that -- where was that maintained? Because I thought that below, all there were was this was a -- was it a lesser-included offense under State law, and I didn't see below any reference to the Federal Constitution.",
  "Mr. Mitchell, what gives me pause is that there are Mississippi cases -- you no doubt know them -- where the court has seemed to think that the Federal issue under Beck was discrete from the State issue. So I forgot the name of them, but one of them was striking because it says this doesn't run afoul of Beck, and then it says, now we turn to Mississippi law on lesser-included offense. And it -- the -- the State supreme court treated those two as discrete. So when you just say lesser-included offense, why should the Court assume that you're talking about one rather than the other when the Mississippi Supreme Court itself has made it clear that it thinks they are discrete inquiries?",
  "But then what would be a lesser-included offense? Because if it's not simple murder and it's not manslaughter, you haven't suggested a third that it might be. I thought your whole position was that this simple murder was right and the - -",
  "-- and the judge was obliged to give it. So why -- in view of what Justice Souter just said about simple murder requiring a deliberate design, where was the deliberate design here?",
  "But what would be if it were not? What would be the lesser-included offense?",
  "Let's make it -- if we make it concrete, let's take all that we have in this case is the testimony that Rice gave. Rice was the one who observed this murder, and he didn't have any statements about the defendant needing money to pay off his debt. You have only that snapshot scene of what the witness saw from the window, which doesn't establish any robbery at all because Rice said he didn't observe any robbery going on. All he observed was the killing. Now, if that's all you have in this case, a person was killed, an eyewitness to the shooting, the eyewitness testifies exactly as Mr. Rice did in this case, what crime would you indict for?",
  "Yes, but I'm giving you a hypothetical where --",
  "Yes. All you have - -",
  "Do they have any other sanction? Because the notion of an administrative remedy ordinarily would be a remedy for the individual who's complaining. But as I understand it, this administrative process, this detailed administrative process, leads only to one sanction, the one you have described as draconian.",
  "Have funds --",
  "-- have funds -- Mr. Dellinger, have funds ever been withdrawn from any school because of a violation of - -",
  "-- title IX?",
  "And I can't imagine anyone who would want such a sanction. Which doesn't help - -",
  "-- the girls on the team.",
  "Mr. - -",
  "Mr. Gornstein, what implication would there be, if we took the view of the circuit here, for Federal employment? Title VII does have a discrete retaliation provision, but it doesn't with respect to Federal employees, if I understand.",
  "How often has OCR come to the school district in question under title IX? There are many statutes that - -",
  "-- OCR administers.",
  "How does he differ -- how does he differ from the renter in Sullivan who was complaining about the refusal to sell or lease property to African Americans? He wanted to lease his property, and as a result, he was thrown out of the club. And this Court said he could maintain that suit.",
  "May I ask you with respect to that, is OCR so different from other agencies that have to pick and choose because they simply don't have the resources to enforce? Now, how often does OCR, in fact, go in and investigate? How many times do they say, well, that's low priority for us, girls' soccer or girls' basketball, and we have bigger fish to fry?",
  "But that wasn't my question. My question is of the universe of complaints that are made under title IX, how many does OCR actually follow up, or isn't it strapped for resources so that it can't, however much it may want to, come in the way you described?",
  "And that was the very reason for recognizing a private right of action because the - - the requirement, the anti-discrimination requirement, would be a dead letter if you didn't have people who could enforce it.",
  "Well, that's -- to say trust me is -- is not an answer. Cannon is one thing, a woman in her 30's. A sixth-grader who is told she can't play on a team because there's none for girls is hardly similarly situated and the law won't be enforced as to her unless you have someone who is best positioned to know what is going on, who is the coach.",
  "The -- the point is if you say to the school, you cannot retaliate against someone because a complaint has been made, that's a powerful incentive for the school not to retaliate against someone and to do something about the discrimination.",
  "Why wasn't it in the regulations of the agency spelled out rather clearly - - the -- the agency that says, Congress has told us to implement this statute, here are our regulations and our regulations are you don't retaliate?",
  "But it's the - -",
  "It said in this statute we do, having in mind that title VI would be interpreted in the identical way - -",
  "-- title VII -- VI proscribing race discrimination in all Federal programs. So it said these statutes aimed at race discrimination, sex discrimination do have a -- a private right of action, and that was the holding of this Court.",
  "Well, it seems to me that if you're talking about the sixth grade soccer team, realistically the only one who is going to know anything -- enough and be brave enough to complain will be the teacher. And if you cut the teacher out, then forget it. You have nice words on paper and they'll never be enforced.",
  "And OCR says, as it usually does, we're too busy. Sorry.",
  "Congress didn't give us enough money to do the job.",
  "This is your personal testimony.",
  "There is -- there is much testimony on the other side that says we call and call and they don't come.",
  "How many title IX complaints in your -- in your experience? You mentioned one. Is there any other?",
  "Two? In how many years?",
  "Two in 20-something years.",
  "Like the choice it made in 1982, very spare statute. When Congress got to title IX, it knew about Sullivan and so it -- this -- this statute in its breadth and its simplicity bears a striking resemblance to the old pattern in 1981 and 1982 and 1983. So if you say to me, look at the closest model, it would be that and not the more detailed civil rights legislation that came in '64 and '65.",
  "It says if you're thrown out of the club because you champion the rights of a black man, you have a right to sue under this statute.",
  "On account of race is in it. Right?",
  "It seems to me they would get it when Congress says, and here's the statute, very spare, and agency, you get up guidelines, that any responsible school board would say, well, we've got only one sentence in the statute. We better look at the regulations to find out what's required.",
  "But it's -- we're not talking about the procedure, I mean, what procedural moves. What must you do to comply? And it has in there you don't retaliate. So you mean that a board could responsibly take the position, well, the -- the regulations tell us we don't retaliate, but when we're not faced with any agency breathing down our neck, all we have is a teacher in front of us, then we can retaliate? I mean, they must have known the statute meant don't retaliate.",
  "I -- I really don't get that. If the rule is don't retaliate and if we investigate, that's one of the things we're going -- that's going to be on our checklist. But the substantive rule is don't retaliate.",
  "But that doesn't respond to the venue question. Venue, as written in this statute and in most statutes, is permissive. It gives you a choice of forum. It doesn't limit. In -- in the times when venue is exclusive, Congress is explicit in telling you that, but ordinarily a venue provision, as this one, either/or, is permissive. It would be extraordinary to make a venue provision exclusive.",
  "Well, this Court has no authority to make a venue provision either exclusive or permissive. Congress decides that.",
  "What about the rule provision for venue, which has not been excluded by the statute? The ordinary provision for venue.",
  "Yes.",
  "I thought the crime is the conspiracy. The overt act may be an additional requirement.",
  "But you will -- you will concede that there are many Federal crimes, conspiracy crimes, in which an overt act is not required. The Shabani case requires you to recognize that.",
  "So you're saying that it doesn't mean very much because an overt act wouldn't be hard to prove.",
  "But there are -- I mean, the difference between statutes that say overt act is required and those that just say conspiracy -- there are many, many such statutes, and we dealt with one in Shabani. But of all the statutes that include no express overt act requirement, have any of them been read to implicitly include one, which is the argument you're making that we should adopt here?",
  "Then you would expect at least a cross reference to 371 for defining the conspiracy, but there's nothing here.",
  "You have given a few examples of a word may mean different things in different contexts, but you haven't given any example -- and I don't know that there is one -- where the entire string of words is identical in two statutes, both dealing with conspiracies, and you read an overt act requirement into one and not the other. I mean, you have a much harder argument to make when you're talking about an entire provision where the wording is almost identical than when you're talking about one word used in different contexts.",
  "There are about -- there are over 50, I think, in title 18 alone conspiracy provisions with no overt act requirement, no explicit overt act requirement. The -- the argument you're making, I suppose, would require this Court to go by -- one by one through those 50-odd statutes, and there would be contests of every one because the absence of those words is not dispositive, as you see it. So you would be generating a controversy about 50-odd statutes that would be gone, that just wouldn't be there if you agreed with Justice Souter's approach.",
  "Have you looked at all 59, I think - -",
  "-- and assured yourself on that?",
  "Well, we've already dealt with venue where I think your argument is exceedingly weak since the statute phrases it as a permissive not a requirement.",
  "It gave -- it gave the prosecutor more choices of where to bring suit.",
  "I -- I do have one and it's not on the money laundering conspiracy issue, but in this particular case, would it be consistent with the position that the Solicitor General has been taking for us to hold the final disposition of this case pending Booker and Fanfan? Wasn't there a sentencing question?",
  "And that's consistent with the position that the Government has been taking routinely in cases where Booker -- where the sentencing guidelines are an issue?",
  "The Government has said that -- that you have essentially waived their sentencing guidelines issue that you asked us in footnote 6 of your brief to consider.",
  "Ms. Karlan, the -- as long as this money was in the plan, it was shielded from bankruptcy, and there are -- there was not unlimited access even with the penalty when it was in the plan. One thing that I don't know and may be of some significance, did the Rouseys have a chance, even though they lost their employment, to keep their money in the plan where it would be shielded from bankruptcy or did they have to roll it over?",
  "Another employer's plan.",
  "But they could not have kept it in this employer's plan?",
  "That was a term of the plan that it -- you can remain in it only so long as you're employed?",
  "Can we take this concrete case? Hers was something over $12,000; his, something over $42,000.",
  "What was the claim here as to -- was part or all of that -- it would be some $54,000.",
  "Why didn't Congress just put in IRA's along with the other things?",
  "Yes, but that's sort of an oblique way to get it there. I mean, why didn't they put it together with the other string of plans?",
  "And some don't. And the -- and the State systems vary.",
  "As opposed to how many who do?",
  "Well, that's what -- with the purpose that we're talking about now --",
  "-- if it's only 6 that, faced with a bankruptcy, would shelter the IRA.",
  "But here there was no choice of picking up on the State?",
  "And one train that we didn't finish before. You were explaining that in this case the entire $55,000 -- that entire sum would be needed -- would be necessary for the support of the debtors.",
  "But you -- that was your claim, and I - -",
  "How did you come to that conclusion, that the entire amount?",
  "Well. Oh, yes.",
  "Well, are they? Because there was one statement -- I think it was in Ms. Karlan's brief -- that the Fifth Circuit said profit-sharing plans permit participants to withdraw up to the entire amount on payment of the penalty. So a profit-sharing plan, which was one of the ones on the list, seems to be substantially identical if you can also take out, whenever you like, as long as you're willing to pay the penalty.",
  "But there -- there is no penalty attached to withdrawing from a savings account, and there's also no limit on the annual contribution.",
  "Do -- do you disagree with Ms. Karlan that this is -- this is a standardized product so the people, the Rouseys of this world, really couldn't get a tailor-made IRA? They would have to take the standard product.",
  "You don't dispute that - - that it's a very small percentage of people who have IRA's, in fact, exercise the right to withdraw, given the penalty.",
  "Does your argument draw a ring around IRA's? It was suggested that if your argument prevails, then these other plans would be affected as well.",
  "No. Just to say that this - - what happened here was not a final determination. Take an analog -- an analogy to rule 54(b). The judge can say, yes, I've made this ruling and it sticks. You see, I'm going to give you a separate piece of paper that says judgment, but if I don't give you that separate piece of paper, even though I said judgment granted, it doesn't count until the very end of the case. I can always change my mind. Why shouldn't it operate the same way on the criminal side?",
  "Yes, but I looked at Martin Linen, and there, there was something labeled judgment of acquittal entered. Here we have an endorsement on a motion, and then we have an entry by the clerk saying - - what does the entry say? Motion granted or something like that.",
  "Yes. But is there -- this might be significant. Is there in Massachusetts, when a motion for acquittal is granted and there are other charges still going on, is there a piece of paper that says, judgment, acquitted on count whatever it was?",
  "But a very plain error - -",
  "But that was a terribly risky defense because his main defense is I wasn't there, I didn't do it, somebody else did it. How could he then turn around and say I missed the opportunity to tell the jury I really was there, but it was okay for me to have the gun? I mean, what -- what defense counsel would do that after having spent his whole effort to say it was the other guy, it wasn't this defendant? And then to make this defense that he had a right to possess this gun because he belonged in the house, that would be extraordinary.",
  "Nobody charged her with possessing a gun.",
  "That's -- look, there were a lot of charges in this case, and we're dealing with what is a relatively lesser offense of this whole string of events so that Brown being acquitted of other offenses doesn't say anything about this offense, which relates to the possession of a gun. That's -- that's all that it is.",
  "But he would be -- the defendant -- you know, he hasn't gone to the jury yet, and the jury would say, my goodness, this is like a common law pleader. I didn't borrow the kettle. It was broken when I got it. Or, I returned it unbroken. To -- to do that, to say I wasn't there, that's my main defense, but then, jury, I'd like you also to consider that if you think that I was there, then -- it -- it really doesn't fly as a criminal defense.",
  "That is when the case is not ongoing. I mean, here we had a case that was continuing and -- and the judge said, oops, I made a mistake, which is common at the trial level. I mean, these decisions - - she made this decision in a split second. Maybe she was too hasty, and then a trial judge will say, my law clerk went to the library at lunch, there was a Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts case going just the other way, so of course, I confess error, but the defendant isn't prejudice. The defendant hadn't put on a -- well, the -- it came up at closing. Right? So if the defendant was prejudice, anyway he could have said, wait a minute, judge, I want to put on that defense that I really was there but I had a right to have the gun.",
  "But he could have. So he - - so I don't see that you have a realistic claim of prejudice.",
  "Yes, but you have to set a - - a point in time, and your point is -- well, it's not exactly clear, but there's one point that says when the jury is discharged. Then there may be other reasons why there's unfairness to the defendant so that you wouldn't permit it, other than double jeopardy. But if -- why isn't that a sensible place to draw the line?",
  "The question -- we're talking about a Federal constitutional rule, and suppose -- you pointed out this went only to an intermediate appellate court. Suppose the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court interpreted its rule at 25(a) and it says, that rule allows some leeway for the judge to say I got it wrong as long as there's no prejudice to the defense. That's what our rule means.",
  "Isn't it ordinarily true - -",
  "Then why did the Massachusetts Supreme Court say -- and I thought it did say this in its rules -- trial judge, you rule on the spot when a motion to acquit is made? We will not allow you to reserve judgment. Because the normal thing would be a trial judge would say, why should I decide this definitively now? I'll wait till the end of the case. But as I understand the Massachusetts rules, it says, judge, you can't reserve on a motion to acquit. You must rule immediately.",
  "So -- so part of Justice Breyer's question needs editing because it would not be possible under Massachusetts law for the judge to say - -",
  "-- I reserve.",
  "What would happen -- I think one of the briefs suggested that suppose you have a multi- defendant case and the judge says, after the prosecution case is done, defendant A, I'm going to grant a motion to acquit. He's out of it, but there was enough evidence to require the -- the defense to go on for B and C. And then after hearing B and C's defense, the judge said, I think I was wrong about acquitting A, so I'm -- I'm going to withdraw it. Would there be -- could that be done without any -- any double jeopardy bar? The jury hasn't been discharged.",
  "Well, the -- the -- he's sitting there. Defendant A is sitting there throughout the whole trial.",
  "The duration of -- of the sentence. And here, there's no implication at all that this sentence is in any way invalid, that the sentence itself or any portion of it is invalid because the parole would be a matter of administrative grace, but it doesn't -- the determination of parole eligibility or parole suitability does not go to the validity of the sentence in any way, shape, or manner. Does it?",
  "Well, couldn't one say the same thing of prison conditions that you can bring in as a 1983 action? The States know better about how their prisons are operating and what changes would have to be made. So I -- I think that you -- you may be right that the State knows more about how its parole system operates, but so does it know more about how its prison system operates. And that doesn't -- that's not what determines whether you have 1983 or habeas.",
  "But aren't -- aren't those claims moot or academic now? Because, as I understand it, he has had another parole hearing. So he's -- with the hearing that he was seeking, he's already had another. So he's not complaining about the absence of a hearing or - - or flaws in the procedure at the hearing. I thought that this case now reduces to a clean question about the retroactive application of the new guidelines.",
  "Was there -- maybe I'm wrong about this, but I thought there no challenge being made to the 2002 hearing.",
  "Why can't it simply be that prospectively for this class of prisoner, the old guidelines will apply, prospectively without undoing anything that's happened in the past?",
  "I think twice you started something and our questions impeded you. But I think you were equating the parole board's decision to a criminal sentence, and so you -- you were saying just as the -- the Federal authority can't come in and nullify the State criminal sentence, neither can it nullify the parole board determination. And -- and I thought that the comparison between a -- a sentence -- a criminal conviction and sentence and a parole board's discretionary determination -- you seemed to be putting those on the same plane.",
  "Is there any significant difference between this case and Wolff? I mean, Wolff was a case of procedural fault supposedly, and if those faults were cured, someone would have a better chance at getting good-time credit. Wasn't that what - -",
  "So it seems to me it's very -- very close to your situation.",
  "But -- but you raise deprivation of the benefit they would get from the Ohio courts. If they wanted that benefit, they could have brought a 1983 action in State courts. State courts have jurisdiction. So it's a little odd for you to say, oh, they're being deprived of a benefit when they're telling you by this very lawsuit they don't want it.",
  "And the -- and the Fifth Circuit's answer to the jury shuffle was, well, the defense shuffled more times, as I - -",
  "-- as I recall.",
  "Well, that's the question.",
  "Mr. Waxman, you were dealing with Fields, and the answer in Fields' case that the prosecution gives is he had a strong feeling about rehabilitation, and so he was -- he thought that everyone could be rehabilitated -- rehabilitated. So that shows he - - he wasn't like others who didn't entertain those doubts about rehabilitation.",
  "Ms. Bunn, before you finish, there -- there are two pieces of this I hope you can give me an answer to. The race-coding. Is there any neutral reason for that? And when was that stopped, if it was?",
  "I had asked you if they were still race- and gender-coded. You hadn't gotten to that part of the question. These cards were race-coded and for other things too. Right now in the State, do the prosecutors code cards -- cards for race and gender?",
  "The other question I had, are these two prosecutors the same ones who were involved in other cases where it was determined that they had used tactics that violated Batson? Were those cases contemporaneous with Miller-El's or were they earlier in time?",
  "What about the Fifth Circuit said that comparing Rand's testimony -- that that was in line with Mazza's. The Fifth Circuit seems to recognize that those two were closely comparable.",
  "But why wasn't that broad view appropriate, given the difference between the language of the Wilson Act, which has had the words \"to the same extent and in the same manner,\" and the Webb­ Kenyon Act, which became the second section of the Twenty­ First Amendment, leaves out \"to the same extent and the same manner.\" It just says that \"alcoholic beverage so that the state can bar importation for delivery of, or use therein, in violation of laws thereof.\" It doesn't say \"nondiscriminatory laws.\"",
  "Well, maybe that's the Act, but when they put it in the Constitution, why didn't they adopt the language, \"to the same extent and in the same manner\"?",
  "I have just one further question. Justice Kennedy asked you, \"What about the wholesaler? What about the retailer?\" What about alcoholic beverages other than wine?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Your answer to Justice Kennedy, I glean from what you said, that if New York took away the direct-sale privilege that in-state wineries get, then out-of-state wineries wouldn't be any better off, but they'd have nothing to complain about.",
  "But that's a decision for the state to make. I mean, the -- what -­",
  "Not for this Court.",
  "Well, why don't we focus on the Court's rationale, which was stated very concisely by Justice White. He said, \"Hawaii's discriminatory tax cannot stand.\" And then he said, \"Whatever you can say about the Twenty-First Amendment, one thing is certain, the central purpose was not to empower the states to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition.\" That was this Court's explanation for ruling the way it did, even though there was this infant industry of pineapple whatever.",
  "Well, then you are asking us, I guess, not only to reject Bacchus, but who was the first one that said that the Commerce Clause remains alive and well? Was it Justice Stewart? And I forgot which case it was. It was -­",
  "In the context of alcoholic beverages.",
  "But that's a different argument than the one you made before, which seems to be saying the Twenty-First Amendment trumps, not that the two have to be harmonized.",
  "But if that's -­",
  "-- if that's really what New York's concern is, then why does New York say, \"Ah, but out-of-staters, if only you establish an office here -­ not a winery; an office -- you can operate, and you can make the direct sales from that office, and even in\" -- I think your brief told us that, well, these small wineries, out-of-state wineries, haven't got all that much to worry about, because, after all, they could join together -- a group of them could open an office. Now, that office, owned by a group of out-of-state vintners is not going to have bottles on the shelf, is it?",
  "Well, isn't the -­",
  "How do you envision this combination of small wineries? You said that in-state establishments might be jointly maintained by out-of-state wineries.",
  "Well, to what -­",
  "-- to what extent does New York take account of, say, the rigorous regulation in the states from which this wine is coming? You say we must do this to police for all kinds of things. But don't other states -- California, Virginia -- don't they have laws that their local wineries must meet?",
  "And is New York just saying, \"We're going to treat this thing as though it's totally unregulated, anyway\"?",
  "And according to the District Court, in this very case, the State Attorney General conceded that New York's measure allowing direct sales by in-state wineries was designed to benefit local farmers.",
  "At least - -",
  "Mr. Shapiro, why don't you simply read the text of 183(b) - -",
  "-- which is in the Government's brief at 4a? It says, special trial judge's report. It is the only report to which the Tax Court rules refer.",
  "No, not the Government's brief. The Tax Court rules.",
  "4a of the Government's brief.",
  "Would -- would that problem be overcome if the special trial judge simply -- if his - - the proceedings before him were simply videotaped and then the reviewing judge, Judge Dawson in this case, could look at the trial proceedings and would have as much of a notion of the credibility of the witnesses as the special tax judge?",
  "Mr. Shapiro, on credibility, which you have been emphasizing, are you overstating the case for it? Because credibility is more than just observing the witnesses' demeanor. I mean, Judge Dawson could have said, yes, they -- these witnesses might have looked honest to the special trial judge, but considering this documentary evidence in the record, it's clear to me that what the witness said on the stand was a lie.",
  "Do -- do I understand that you would be satisfied if the Court simply looked to - - what is it -- 7482(a)(1), the appellate review section, which says that the Tax Court decisions shall be reviewed in the same manner and to the same extent as district court decisions? And that - -",
  "And where is it? It's -- it is specified someplace, but when you review a district court decision in -- in a court of appeals, the - - certainly the magistrate's report would be included, but there's someplace where it lists the contents, some rule that lists - -",
  "Would the -- the Tax Court rule -- now, this 183(c) -- says -- it describes the special trial judge's report, which is submitted to the chief judge, and then the chief judge assigns a Tax Court judge, and then it says that -- that the Tax Court judge may modify it, modify the special trial judge's report, or may reject it in whole or in part. Does the Tax Court ever modify a special trial judge's report? Does it ever reject it in whole or in part?",
  "But that's one thing that they can do. They can adopt it, but my question is, do they always adopt and never use -- never use the term modify or reject?",
  "These -- these - -",
  "The -- the special trial judge has no tenure, does she?",
  "Mr. Hungar, before you proceed to your legal argument, I was very curious why the Government is defending this practice because the Government, after all, is on the other side of every case. And aren't there situations where it might be that the special trial judge would call a credibility question in the Government's favor and then the Government loses the case before the Tax Court judge and might like to know, before it goes to the court of appeals, how solid the credibility findings were? I mean, I -- I -- the Government being a party to all these proceedings, why is it satisfied with not knowing what the report of the special tax judge -- special trial judge was?",
  "No, it is not the report. It is called an opinion. It isn't even called the report, and if you will read 183(b), that describes the report. Does anything else describe the report? And what is this report? There is a report. It is submitted to the chief judge. What would you call that?",
  "Now, what is the 183(b) report?",
  "There - -",
  "So that report, the special trial judge's report, is a document prepared by the special trial judge which he gives to the chief judge.",
  "Mr. Hungar, do you - -",
  "Do you see somewhat of a problem, that we are not dealing here with the relationship between peers? Judge Dawson is appointed, what, for a 15-year term. The special trial judge is appointed by the Tax Court and his job is at the Tax Court's grace. And if you have compared in your brief that relationship to, say, a discussion among colleagues, I think it's worlds different.",
  "He has had a special -- a - - a long term and he is well-known and respected as a Tax Court judge who was appointed, as all other members of the court were appointed.",
  "It seems to me - -",
  "It seems to me that it's very much like, if you have to compare it with something, the relationship between a magistrate and a Federal district court judge. The magistrate also hears testimony, makes a report, findings, and a recommendation. What's the difference between those two?",
  "Why isn't that explained in the rules, if that's the process?",
  "Do they -- do they ever? I mean, this -- this says, this decision -- it's labeled - - the -- the court agrees with and adopts the opinion of the special trial judge. Are there Tax Court cases where the Tax Court says, instead of that, the court modifies the decision of the special trial judge or the court rejects, in whole or in part, the report of the special trial judge?",
  "Do Tax Court opinions come out that way?",
  "Because if one were just to rule this -- read this rule straight: first, the report that goes to the chief judge, and then it says that the Tax Court judge may modify it, reject it in whole - - adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part. You would expect, if we were having truth in labeling, that whenever, with consultation, without, there's a difference between the two documents, the Tax Court judge, in combination with the special trial judge or without, would say, action on the report -- action on the report, which is the special trial judge's report, is it is modified or it is rejected or it is rejected in part. I mean - -",
  "The rule -- the rule doesn't say anything about this consultation that you've described. And if that's the Tax Court's procedure, why isn't it laid out in the rules so everyone can see it instead of being deceived by reading here is the special trial judge's report, and now what the Tax Court will do is either adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part?",
  "Misleading. Because when I just read this rule cold, that's what I assumed, that we have the initial report and then it goes to the Tax Court judge, and that judge does something with it, and that something may be adopt, it may be modify, it may be reject in whole or in part.",
  "It's like an en banc. I -- I have written decisions for a panel in my years on the court of appeals, and there's been an en banc and my opinion gets vacated. It's no longer counts for anything. And isn't that exactly what the Tax Court is? They have the - -",
  "Oh, no. No, no, no. How often, when there is a decision reviewed by the court, so that the initial judge's decision is changed, does that judge dissent, so all the world knows what that judge's initial position was?",
  "Then he -- then he can publish his -- he can publish his dissent, just as a Tax Court judge can?",
  "But then we still won't know what his report is. Yes, he can say, I won't sign this. Tax Court says, fine. This rule says I can reject your findings in whole or in part. I don't need your name on this decision of the Tax Court.",
  "I'm asking you just as the - - the judge who disagrees with the -- the full court can publish his dissent, can the special trial judge who disagrees with the Tax Court judge publish his dissent?",
  "Has there ever been? Has there ever been?",
  "And how -- how often does the -- is there a dissent when there's -- when there's a full court review decision?",
  "But we -- we don't have to get into any of that if we accept your argument about 7482(a)(1), that is, the record will be in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district court.",
  "But, Mr. Kneedler -­",

  "-- with respect to this case? I thought this case was such a good illustration of the problem. If claims came into the Federal court neatly labeled, exhausted, unexhausted, then I think that you would have a very strong argument. But as this case illustrates, the question of whether it's been exhausted or not is something on which people can disagree. And I suppose why the district court took well over a year to decide this case is the petitioner says, I've exhausted everything, and the prosecutor says, you have not exhausted 12. And the district court is going by the -­ going over these one by one and says in the end, you're both wrong. My list is eight. And it's that problem of has this claim been exhausted. Now, if it was a case of deliberately withholding a case from State court and bringing it up fresh in -- in the Federal court, that would be a case where the Federal court should say, go away, you didn't even try. But what do you do with these cases where it's really hard to tell whether the claim has been exhausted?",
  "Then why did the -- the district judge says four on the State's list have been exhausted?",
  "So that -- that would take care of the four claims. How about the other four?",
  "Well, they -­",
  "But those could be -- those could be dropped out of the Federal complaint. There you're saying, district judge, you would be abusing your discretion because admitting that he hadn't exhausted these, he should have gone immediately to do that. But what about the other four?",
  "If that's so, then why isn't a system like the one that the Second Circuit described the most reasonable thing to do, that is, to put very tight deadlines both on the petitioner and on the Federal court, that is, to deny -- deny the stay and abey when the prisoner has not been diligent, to put a tight time line on when that prisoner has to go to State court, and a similarly tight line on returning to the Federal court after the State court is done? And you could check against repeatedly abusing this by saying, and you get only one opportunity to do it.",
  "See, you could -- there are two things in Rose v. Lundy, and everybody agrees with the one, you must exhaust in State court. You cannot have the Federal court take a first view of that question. You -­ you must exhaust. And -- but then Rose v. Lundy also said without prejudice, and your reading strikes out without prejudice not based on the defendant's conduct, not based on the petitioner's conduct, but because it took the district court more than the limitation period just to sort out which claims were exhausted and which weren't.",
  "Well, the -- the troublesome thing is some petitioners will be able to do just what you said in South Dakota, go back to the State court a second time, because they had a swift district judge, and some won't because the district judge was slow. So to treat identically situated petitioners differently not because of any lapse on the petitioner's part but solely because one had the luck to get before a swift district judge and the other, the bad luck to get before a procrastinator, that seems arbitrary and not anything that Congress built into the statute.",
  "No, did go. Did. Every one of these cases, I say if they came rushing to the Federal court first, no Federal judge would even consider giving them a stay so they can go to the first -- first time. But these -- these come up where someone has gone to the State court and then they come to the Federal court with a new petition and there's arguments about what they exhausted and what they didn't. I'm -- I'm leaving out the person who never went to the Federal -- State court at all. That person is -- is not the category that this case represents.

  "And both would be all right because what's the difference between not getting as much appreciation as you would have gotten if the correct information had been out there and getting less than you would have gotten. I mean, in both cases the shareholder is affected the same way. They didn't get as much in one case. So you're not distinguishing between those. I think you're agreeing that in both cases the -- the discovery of platinum is the shares go up, but they would have gone up much higher if there had been gold as well. That shareholder has a claim under your theory, doesn't she?",
  "Yes, but I'm assuming that -­ that there is, and so the stock goes up but not as much as it would have. But on the point of disclosure, there is a difference between your position and the Government's, and I really would like you to tell me if that's genuine or it's my misperception. Your view is there's the disclosure of the bad news, the lie, and the price drops. In the Government's presentation -- and I'm reading from page 19 -- the fraud can be revealed by means other than a corrective disclosure and a drop in the stock price may not be a necessary condition for establishing loss causation in every fraud on the marketplace.",
  "But, Mr. Hungar, if you look at the forms of what's proper pleading under the Federal rules on causation, the sample pleadings say, for example, for money lent, the defendant owes the plaintiff for money lent. Period. Or for goods sold and delivered. Nothing more. Just alleged causation. Defendant -- plaintiff alleges I lost X amount and it was caused by defendant. I thought you pointed to the 9(b) rule because fraud must be pleaded with particularity, but causation does not, not under the rules and not under the statute.",
  "But that -- that's to the -­ to the allegation of fraud, but not causation.",
  "It says -- but the fraud must be pleaded with particularity, not all the elements of a fraud claim.",
  "But there's a -- but there -­ there is a basic difference between, as was pointed out in the colloquy with Mr. Hungar -- one thing is the particularity of pleadings. Yes, you have to tell the details of the fraud. No, you don't have to tell the details of the loss. But you do have to have a theory on which you can recover, and if your theory is simply I bought at an inflated price and the law doesn't give you a claim for relief on that theory, then you're out the window. There's no discovery. There's nothing. You have to have, as Justice Souter pointed out, a viable theory of relief, and that's the difference between -- you say it's enough that the stock was selling for much more than it should have, and the other side said, no, that's not enough. You have to show that when the misrepresentation was corrected, the price dropped.",
  "I thought your theory was, at least as I read your brief, that your loss occurs at the moment of purchase, not at some later time, that when you bought the stock, the price was inflated and that's when you suffered your loss, on the day of the purchase, not at a later time.",
  "But there's a problem. Take the concrete facts of this case. The bad news about -­ what is it? Albuterol?",
  "Yes. That bad news didn't come out until 9 months after the end of the period that you identify for your class. You say the class is April 15th, '97 until February 24th, '98 purchases. The bad news doesn't come out until November of '98. So how could you possibly hook up your loss to the news that comes out later?",
  "I -- I thought that you were trying to pick up on the drop that seemed to be attributable to the other -­",
  "Yes, and that's what -- well, there -- there are two frauds going on. The first one is discovered and the price drops substantially. And I thought you were trying to attribute that drop to the other product.",
  "Well, one of the problems for me is the Ninth Circuit seems to think that it has a theory -- and it is the theory of your complaint -- that's different from, say, the Third Circuit. The Ninth Circuit says we recognize that the loss is you bought it at an inflated price, and the Ninth Circuit thinks that's different from a circuit that says you don't have any loss until somehow the bad news comes out and there's a drop in price as a result.",
  "I thought that that's what the Government was getting at in the passage I read earlier where they don't make it -- there must be a statement by the issuer of the correction. They have more leeway. But you -- the Ninth Circuit -- the litany that it's using, the -- the set of cases -- for example, plaintiffs were harmed when they paid more for the stock than it was worth. The -- the notion that's repeated, that your loss is established on the day you purchase the price, that's just wrong, and I think we would have to at a minimum say that.",
  "You -- you seem -­",
  "Well, as I understood Justice Souter's question, it is the alternate that the Government said. The Government puts forward two arguments, and its alternate argument sounds to me just like what Justice Souter put to you, that is, he has to move diligently to challenge those underlying convictions, that he cannot challenge in Federal court because of -- was it -- Curtis and Daniels. Why isn't that an -- an accommodation of what we know was the concern of the Federal court -- of the -- of the Congress that people act diligently? It happens that 2255 wasn't framed with Curtis and Daniels in mind. There isn't any indication that the drafters of 2255 were aware of this peculiar situation where you can't make the challenge in Federal court, you must go back to the State forum. But we do know they were concerned with diligence.",
  "But then you -- you have to concede that you are watering down almost to nothing any due diligence requirement because on your reading of the statute, there isn't -- there isn't any such requirement.",
  "I know -- I know -­",
  "Even -- that was the question I was going to ask. With respect to -- he came into Federal court and he said -- a little -- like 3 days too late to move to extend the time to file the 2255. That motion was denied. That motion was made in April of '97, and then he doesn't file for State habeas to get rid of those prior convictions until February of '98. Is -- is there any indication of why, when the Federal court says we're not going to extend your time, he waits so long to go to the State court?",
  "From your answer, I take it then you would agree with Judge Black in the Eleventh Circuit that equitable tolling would apply. He goes to State court within the year after his Federal conviction becomes final. The State court is sitting on it for 2 years. The limitation, I take it from what you said, would be tolled during that time.",
  "But you're not -- you're not insisting on that super diligence because you say, well, in every case he has at least a year to begin to try to undo the State conviction.",
  "Why would you need the placeholder if the rule were, as Judge Black said it should be, that if you go to the State court within the 1 year after your Federal conviction becomes final, then the time that you are in the State court the statute will be tolled? If that's the rule, then you don't need any placeholder filings.",
  "Mr. Nolas?",
  "Wasn't it the case that those experts were hired not primarily or even secondarily for mitigation purposes? They were hired in connection with the possibility of a defense at the guilt stage, number one, that he was insane at the time he committed the crime, in which case what he was when he was a child would be irrelevant, and number two, that he was presently incompetent to stand trial. So they were asked specifically to inquire into his present mental situation, and their testimony was relevant to the guilt phase of the trial. So that's the instruction. Naturally they -- what -- why are we engaging you? We're engaging you to tell us do we have a basis for an insanity plea, do we have a basis for an incompetent to stand trial plea.",
  "Mr. Nolas, there were some records that the prosecution sought and used. Was it -­ the records that were in the very courthouse.",

  "This -- this prosecutor also said, before he got into isn't it frightening, I'm not asking you for vengeance. So if he's not putting it on for vengeance or the bad acts that he did, then what else could it be?",
  "I thought that there was no problem in any State but Pennsylvania because now all of them -- when the jury wants to know does life mean life, the judge says yes.",
  "Ah, but what immediately follows -- first he said it's absolutely frightening twice. But there is one difference, one major difference, and the difference is that he has learned to leave no witnesses. That is tightly connected. He says this is an absolutely frightening crime, but there's something more. He's learned not to leave any witnesses.",
  "They thought they had -- it was reasonable when they, on their own, suspected that this man might not even be competent at the moment to stand trial, that he -- that they might have a -- a basis for an insanity plea, that it was reasonable for them to rely just on what he told them without looking at the record that was in the prosecutor's hands?",
  "Experts that were hired primarily to say what is his present mental condition, not what happened in the past.",
  "What was the primary reason that those experts were engaged?",
  "The primary reason.",
  "Where -- where is this?",
  "I thought it was not contested that in fact the primary reason why these doctors were engaged was that the defense attorney wanted to see if there was a basis for a plea of insanity. He wanted to see if there was a basis to claim that his client was incompetent to stand trial.",
  "What is the it? What is the it?",
  "But not everything that was in that file.",
  "There was a lot more than just the transcript of the proceedings in that file.",
  "But Strickland was about a strategic decision to pursue one kind of defense rather than another. The Government's brief, I must say, was candid and, I think, useful. I'm talking about footnote 5 on page 22 where you say the Federal public defenders in Federal death penalty cases -- they get a mitigation specialist and the mitigation specialist, of course, gets records. What records? Exactly what we're talking about in this case. Gets records, birth, schools, social welfare, employment, jail, medical, and other records. And here, not one of those -- not one -- was sought.",
  "About what records to go to, and here they went to none.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Lamken, the argument has been made that 4 years before the telecommunications act we're talking about was adopted, Congress adopted the Cable TV Consumer Protection Act. And in that act, it specifically limited the remedies to declaratory and injunctive relief. Here we face silence. Isn't that an indication that when Congress wants to limit relief to declaratory and injunctive, it will say so in the -- in the measure?",
  "And what, Mr. Lamken, would be the normal procedure in the State? You make an application for a permit to a zoning board. What is the standard operating procedure under State law? Suppose we don't have any telecommunications act in the picture.",
  "And the remedies being injunctive and declaratory.",
  "Are you saying that it's parallel to what APA review of an agency decision would be?",
  "Mr. Feldman -­",
  "Then how would you ever have a statute that -- 1983 provides for relief when there's a violation of Federal law, statutory or constitutional. One of the briefs in this very case says that your broad reading means that you were doing away with statute as a basis for 1983.",
  "I thought that was just to decide in -- in the -- in the court of first instance -­ that tail end was not to decide whether in this specific case damages or attorney's fees were due. But the district court was deciding a question of law, that is, whether in this kind of review proceeding anyone could have damages, anyone could have attorney's fees.",
  "But was not making a rule for this case only. He was making a ruling of law.",
  "Mr. Waxman -- Mr. Waxman, one of these provisions gives you an option to go to the FCC, the one having to do with emissions. Now, if you sought review from the local decision to the FCC, you petition for FCC relief, would the FCC have authority to give you attorney's fees?",
  "Well, isn't that an incongruity that Congress would say you have your choice? Complainant, you can go to the Federal agency, the FCC, or you can go to court.",
  "So if -- if you have that choice, when you're dealing with the radio emissions, to go the -- why would any litigant ever do that? Why would any attorney ever do that if you don't get fees at the FCC and you do get fees in court? Wouldn't the presumption be that it would work the same way whether you go to the agency, Federal agency, or Federal or State court, that you're in the same situation as respect to fees?",
  "Well, let's take the one, that -- that one. Are you saying no attorney's fees there because you couldn't get them at the FCC, therefore you shouldn't get them in court?",
  "But with respect to -­",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Waxman.",
  "There is in this legislative record a concern expressed by a Senator from California when there was a proposal on the table to make the FCC the Federal review forum. And that was rejected, if I understand correctly, because there was a concern that municipalities would have to travel all the way to Washington, D.C. to defend in the FCC's forum. And Congress did not want to saddle municipalities with the cost of transporting their representative to D.C. Well, that cost would pale compared to attorney's fees that would be awarded.",
  "Mr. Poe, the -- the district court in this case rejected all grounds except one. It rejected the raiding and swamping. It said that's what the Libertarians want to expose themselves to. It's not for a State to be paternalistic to protect them against their own bad choices. But it said this request is damaging to the majority parties, to the major parties, because it poaches on their members. But there is not in this litigation any major party that's complaining about that. So if that is the rationale that the district court went on, can this Court possibly uphold it when there is nobody, as far as we know -- they haven't even come into this case at this level, filing a friend of the Court brief.",
  "Well, when you -- would you say that the rationale on which the district court rejected the Libertarian Party's claim was unsatisfactory?",
  "Was there a basis in the record for making that finding?",
  "Do I understand your brief to say that this constitutional rule that you are seeking would be just for the minority party? I think you said in your brief it doesn't follow like the night the day that because the Libertarians must be allowed to do this by the Constitution, therefore the Democrats and Republicans must also have the option to invite anyone into their primaries.",
  "I thought your case was you want to appeal to people who don't want to register as Libertarians and don't even want to be independent. You want to appeal to people who are and want to be members of the Republican or Democratic Party but have Libertarian leanings, but they don't want to give up their party affiliation.",
  "Yes, but that you could do right now, and you say that's not enough. We want people who are members of other parties and don't want to change their party affiliation.",
  "But how does that square with Timmons where this Court turned away a party that says, we've got this candidate and she's running on a major party ticket and she's happy to be on ours too? And the Court there said the State can legitimately eliminate -­ limit the candidate to one party affiliation. So if it can limit the candidate to one party affiliation, why not the voter?",
  "Mr. Bullock, you are leaving out that New London was in a depressed economic condition, so this is distinguished from the case where the State has no particular reason for wanting this, but the critical fact on the city side, at least, is that this was a depressed community and they wanted to build it up, get more jobs.",
  "But you concede that on the facts, more than tax revenue was at stake. The community had gone down and down and the town wanted to build it up.",
  "The line you draw is between blight, which Berman says was in the public use, lighted conditions okay, but depressed conditions, not the best in line with the - -",
  "Even though in Berman, there was a department store that was not blighted, and it was permissible because the whole area was to be improved to raze that department store, even though it wasn't contributing in any way to blight.",
  "But do you do that area by area? I mean, one of the points you made, this is divided into what, seven areas?",
  "And there's some -- to be developed first, you say that your clients lived in parcels that are not likely to be developed soon, if at all. So when making this determination, is development reasonably likely, do you have to do it parcel by parcel or can it be with the whole - -",
  "So it's not the area development but this house, will there be -- is it reasonably likely that there will be development in that particular plot.",
  "Is that what the Connecticut Supreme Court that we are reviewing said, you -- you are arguing, it seems to me, for something that goes beyond what was adjudicated in this case. I mean - -",
  "It was a finding, a finding before to be a fact in the trial court that this development was going to be primarily for the benefit of the citizens of New London, and not for the benefit of Pfizer or the private developer.",
  "How much, how much of this was voluntarily sold, is that correct?",
  "Well, I think you'd have to take some substantial chunks of language out of Berman as well, because Justice Douglas spoke very expansively in that case.",
  "Mr. Kneedler --",
  "What about substantially advances a legitimate State interest, which does sound like it's a higher standard? And it has been said, as was pointed out, in several cases of this Court -- not that it made any difference to the bottom line, but that language is -- sounds -- sounds like it's a more toothful standard than rational basis.",
  "Well, they don't sound like synonyms. So I'm asking you what you would recommend that this Court do. If you say that the standard is the same as rational basis, perhaps this confusing phrase should be eliminated.",
  "Mr. Stewart, I'm trying to understand not your theory but its concrete applications. Here we're dealing with the rent to be paid by a lessee of a gas station, but what you're saying, I take it, would go for any kind of rent control. You could make the same argument. So you're -- so you are saying that rent control is a taking and the State could do it with compensation?",
  "And -- and the measure of compensation would be? How would the State -- let's take a -- an ordinary rental property, and the city puts a rent control ordinance into effect. You say that's a taking, and how would one measure the compensation?",
  "I'm asking for not the State's position but your position.",
  "And let's -- let's assume that there's no better reason for the rent control for the building, residential building, than there is for the rent control on the lease for the gas station.",
  "But isn't the effect of what you're arguing that you can't do it? Because you -- the government would have to pay the same amount that -- by the -- that the rent is being reduced. We'd have to figure out how much higher the rent would have been, and -- so it -- it would be a -- a nonsensical thing for the government to engage in.",
  "Well, why wouldn't it make sense then for the government to say, Chevron, you charge what you want and, station owner, we, the government, gives you -- Hawaii gives you this money so you'll be able to pay the excess rent?",
  "But there are so many things that you could dress up as being a taking. And -- and so it seems to me that it's up to the artful pleader to say whether this is a due process excessive regulation or this is intrusive to the point where it amounts to a taking. I mean, the -- the -- would you -- rent control is one. What about -- suppose Hawaii had said, we're going to cap the price of gas so it will make it easier for these stations to survive.",
  "Do we have a case involving price control where we have analyzed that as a taking?",
  "I didn't know that those were treated as taking cases.",
  "If you -- if the lower courts were of this view, why did the district court in this case give you three opportunities to have your contract claim transferred to the Claims Court?",
  "But it does suggest that the district court had at least some concern whether the case -- your claim had been lodged in the right court.",
  "Perhaps you can explain. This was not your suit originally. You intervened. Right? This was started out by the water district.",
  "And then after some, I think, 2 years -­",
  "-- the water district bows out. It has settled its case. It's a mystery what it settled for. At least, I didn't see it in any of the briefs. Why did the water district, having brought this case, then say, we're satisfied, we're out?",
  "May -- may we just back up to the question -- your answer to Justice Stevens? I thought that this wasn't a suit initially on the part of the water district for money damages. I thought they were seeking declaratory relief against the United States.",
  "Because one could -- one could read the words, suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights, as a suit for declaratory relief but not encompassing damages.",
  "Mr. Minear, when you say -­ when you say not money damages, do you read the words that I read to Mr. Smiland restrictively or do you think they accommodate money damages, that is, suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights of a contracting entity?",
  "Well, you say under the contract. I thought there was a provision in the contract that said that the United States will not be responsible for under-deliveries, and I think it listed the drought and the last thing was any other cause.",
  "But you were saying there's -- there's a right under this contract to recover from the United States for an under-delivery.",
  "But do you have a continuing case or controversy? That was -- that -- that's a bedrock Article III requirement, and if you've got all the relief that you were seeking -- let's put it this way. Suppose your opponent SABIC says, here's the check for the $417 million and we undertake that we're not going to pursue any further relief. Would you have a case or controversy left?",
  "But if you've got all the relief to which you are entitled, that does make a case moot.",
  "You -- you would be stuck anyway because you made a counterclaim and -- and it would be -- on which you prevailed. And in that counterclaim you would be precluded if you didn't ask for everything that you could get. But -- but at this stage at least, the -- the door -- there -- there is still conceivably an avenue of further litigation because, SABIC hasn't yet said that it's not going to do anything more, that it isn't going to petition for cert, for example.",
  "So it has -­",
  "Mr. Coleman, would you clarify, I think, in response to Justice Breyer's inquiry? Rooker-Feldman both involved State court litigation that was over and done with. Then you come to the Federal court. You have two parallel cases would be -- brought within a month of each other?",
  "And isn't the standard defense of the person who has started the other suit first, well, Your Honor, prior action pending, please hold the case that started second in abeyance till we get done? And if we win in the first case, then it will be precluded. Then the second case -- the parallel case will be precluded. That's not Rooker-Feldman territory.",
  "Rooker-Feldman, if I understand it correctly, is a subject matter jurisdiction bar. Is that --",
  "Yes. And -­",
  "Well, to -- so if the two lawsuits, the State court suit and the Federal suit -­ they're proceeding concurrently or one is held in abeyance waiting the other, there is certainly subject matter jurisdiction in the Federal court of the Federal action.",
  "To apply Rooker-Feldman in that context would say you had subject matter jurisdiction at the outset, but then you lost it somewhere down the line.",
  "There were only the two cases, Rooker and Feldman, that established this.",
  "Has this Court ever said anything to suggest that Rooker-Feldman, as apart from preclusion doctrine, applies to parallel litigation instead of you go into Federal court after the State court is over and you're trying to undo what the State court did?",
  "But there's no preclusion unless they're also decided.",
  "Mr. Castanias, was there a proper case in the district court when the complaint was initially filed there some 2 months after you filed in Delaware?",
  "All right. So you can bring two cases, identical cases, in two different courts, and that's an everyday thing, and the defense is prior action pending.",
  "Now, you are urging that Rooker-Feldman which this Court never applied when you had parallel litigation be extended into a domain which is ordinarily taken care of by preclusion doctrine. Why would you want to mix those two things up that now seem to me rather clear, that if you have Rooker-Feldman, when you rush into a Federal court and say, Federal court, undo that State court judgment, I don't like it? Rooker was just a paradigm case of that. Why would you want to spread that doctrine? What is -- what is there that preclusion doctrine doesn't accomplish?",
  "Well, I'm not talking about anything fancy like Colorado River. Prior action pending is a familiar defense. You've got two actions. They could even be in different districts of the same State and one says, Your Honor, this case started second, the other one is going forward, hold it abeyance because there's a prior action pending. That's not Colorado River abstention or anything like that.",
  "Well, sometimes district judges rule incorrectly, but -- but what happened here is the district court case did not go on because the two of you, both sides, said, okay, the district court -- they're all bollixed up with this Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act, so we're going to agree. You agreed that the case would go forward in Delaware, the trial in Delaware. Is that not so?",
  "Well, when you say they pushed in Delaware, you brought them into Delaware and a -- in a reverse suit. You wanted a declaration of non­ liability.",
  "They brought their case for liability in the Federal forum. They were forced by you into the Delaware forum, and now you're saying you were pushed, that Exxon pushed. You brought the case in Delaware. They didn't.",
  "But it was your preferred forum, not theirs. When they filed their complaint, they filed it in New Jersey where they had a related case pending. So you chose the forum.",
  "So perhaps the Court, if it had been more cautious, would have spoken not in terms of Rooker-Feldman or review, but in terms of this matter has been decided. It is claim-precluded. That's what preclusion doctrine is supposed to do. So in that context, maybe this Court used the wrong word. Maybe it should have said, you litigated it, it's over and done with, now it's precluded. Why do you need to interject the word review? Isn't that -- unless you're going to say every time court A decides a case and then you're in court B and someone is raising the same claim, that is a review of court number one rather than you're precluded in court two because of what is -- has been litigated and decided in court one.",
  "It is sometimes.",
  "That's why one has preclusion because you are giving respect, full faith and credit, to a decision elsewhere. That's what preclusion doctrine is all about. We respect the judgment of the court that rendered it. We, therefore, give it full faith and credit. That's what preclusion doctrine is about, is about respect and credit. Isn't that so?",
  "But you -­",
  "Well, you're asking us to extend Rooker-Feldman beyond where this Court has taken it, and if I recall correctly, you really didn't ask for this. The Third Circuit injected Rooker-Feldman into the case. Is that not true?",
  "No, no, because it's where you walk in the door. And you started out by saying this case, I think as you must, was a proper Federal case. It was properly filed in -- and it was properly filed in Delaware. So you can't talk about a case that says, if you've got this kind of case, you go in this door. If that kind of case, you go in that door. You have a case here that could go in either door, the Federal, the State. The usual rule is, is it not, that if Federal jurisdiction attaches, it doesn't get lost because of subsequent events. For example, if a defendant moves into the plaintiff's State and the only basis for Federal jurisdiction is diversity, subject matter jurisdiction isn't lost, is it?",
  "Maybe. It's not -- it's not maybe -­",
  "A case can become moot, but we've already expressed considerable doubt whether that is the fate of this case. The notion -- you used it derisively -- the insurance policy. Lawyers bring protective actions all the time, don't they? There's nothing wrong with doing that.",
  "Mr. Goldstein, may -- may I take it from your answer that it doesn't make any difference in your view, your answer to the question about the -- the ship leaving from a port in England and going many places and touching base in New York, that kind of a voyage, or what this case seems to be where the vast majority of the passengers are from the United States, the port of departure is in the United States, the port of return is in the United States. You don't seem to distinguish those cases because you say in the New York port, it doesn't matter if it's really a U.S.-centered cruise or a cruise centered in Italy or any place else. Is that correct?",
  "But if we go back to what is the more usual situation - -",
  "Then you are, in effect, saying that the U.S. rules the world. Even if the home port, the place where this vessel is usually berthed, says we -- we don't require our ships to take care of the handicapped, you are, in effect, saying no matter what the other ports say, what the U.S. law is is going to govern because practically if you're going to design the ship to meet the U.S. requirements, you're not going to rip those out when the ship goes elsewhere.",
  "But you told me -- and I want to make sure this is your answer -- that it doesn't matter, that as long as the ship comes to a U.S. port as part of this overall journey, you -- you answered that question and I thought that was your candid answer, that it doesn't matter that these -- these particular cruise ships ply mostly U.S. waters and U.S. trade and are centered, even have their principal place of business in the United States. You're not concentrating on that category. You are saying that the ADA applies so long as the ship puts in at -- at a U.S. port, picks up passengers. It applies not only while it's in the port, but practically for every other place the ship goes. That's why I asked isn't this the United States rules the world on what -- your argument you made.",
  "Do you - -",
  "Do you - -",
  "But do you - -",
  "Do you agree with Mr. Goldstein that nothing turns on -- one might characterize this kind of cruise as U.S.-centered, but his answer was as long as they put in, a regular cruise stop, they pick up, they unload passengers, they take them back again on the ship, so long as they touch base at a U.S. port, letting off and picking up passengers, the ADA applies? Do you agree with that interpretation?",
  "This is my - -",
  "Let -- let me ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Goldstein. Even in the Cunard case, the prohibition case, they couldn't have liquor in the U.S. port, but when they leave and they go to Jamaica, they could pick up rum there. They could have liquor all the rest of the time so long as, when they enter and leave the U.S. port, they didn't have the liquor aboard. Here what you're saying is what goes in the - - for the New York port goes for every other place where this ship puts in.",
  "Suppose it doesn't begin in the United States in that it -- it starts in, say, The Bahamas, and stops at - -",
  "How does it compare to title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?",
  "So that would be the same for title II, which is the public accommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So I take it that you are saying that on these foreign-flagged vessels, just as the ADA would be inapplicable, so title II, the public accommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, would be inapplicable.",
  "So your -- but your answer is, there being no such indication, that a ship putting in at a U.S. port was free to discriminate among its passengers on the basis of race.",
  "I'm asking about the U.S. law and policy which says no segregation, no discrimination in places of public accommodation.",
  "And the same answer for 1981?",
  "Mr. Frederick, this is - - this is what concerns me about your answer. I know that Mr. Goldstein took the position that it doesn't matter what kind of operation this is, but the operation that we're dealing with, it sells tickets mainly to -- what percentage of its passengers are from the USA?",
  "And does it normally start the voyage and end it in U.S. ports?",
  "And how much of its advertising budget is pitched at U.S. customers?",
  "Well, this is the anomaly. You're asking us to buy an interpretation. An enterprise is U.S.-centered in terms of where it gets its business and that enterprise, nonetheless, is not bound by what is our bedrock anti-discrimination law both with regard to customers, passengers, and employment.",
  "But it doesn't matter what you want to do as a matter of good will. The question is what the law requires you to do, and you're saying it's up to us, we govern. You're not governed by U.S. anti - discrimination law.",
  "With its principal place of business in the United States.",
  "But --",
  "The crew members were Honduran in that case.",
  "This -- if you just look at it, suppose you were not a lawyer and you look at this operation. You'd say that's got USA written all over it. The passengers are from the USA. The company is centered in Florida. And then you have this flag of convenience that it flies which can legitimately govern the relationship with its crew. But to say that it governs the relationship with passengers, it seems to me very strange. And also the ticket says, passenger, if you're going to sue us, it's got to be in the United States and under U.S. law to boot.",
  "Just -- it's just one other indicia that one looks at this operation and says this belongs to the USA. A practical judgment, I think, would come down there.",
  "Do you agree with Mr. Frederick's answer about title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? I mean, a lot of countries don't prohibit discrimination.",
  "I'm asking about the application of U.S. law.",
  "So before you go on to that, I want to be clear on your answer to title II of the Civil Rights Act of '64. There's -- you say, well, that's easier to comply with. But that's not the principle under which you're operating.",
  "-- of both claims was, however he dressed it up in -- in due process, that I wasn't told at the time of my sentencing that life meant life without parole. That was the essence, the core of his complaint the first time around, wasn't it?",
  "But the -- but the essence of it was I wasn't told that life meant I would never get out of prison.",
  "Both times.",
  "Mr. Wycoff, are you taking the position that this -- that Artuz -- I thought, frankly, that Artuz had classified within properly filed timely filed and then had a footnote, and it says that there might be some exceptions to a timely filing rule - -",
  "-- rule. And they're not taking a position about that. But you quickly said this time limitation falls under the procedural bar label.",
  "But AEDPA -- it doesn't say 1 year and that's it. AEDPA has exceptions.",
  "But that's, in -- in effect, saying that there is no -- that the properly filed, given the Pennsylvania procedure, does not include timely filed.",
  "But -- but you have just said that the -- the court will look on its own to see if there are these exceptions.",
  "So that there would be no case of an untimely filing in this period when the court was -- even if you raised no exception, was going through them.",
  "There would be no case in which an untimely filing would be included in properly filed because the very fact that the court itself would go through the petition to look for exceptions would take it out of the category.",
  "But the -- the difference was that Artuz ranked timely filing as an ingredient of properly filed, and you say but not in Pennsylvania the way it's set up. Timely filing is not an ingredient of properly filed.",
  "Did the -- did counsel suggest less intrusive restraints?",
  "In the prison setting, does he wear such restraints? Justice Scalia suggested the jury might say, wow, that's the way he has to go around the rest of his life with the -- all chained up. But in -- do we know whether in the prison he would be routinely wearing these restraints?",
  "What do you make of the judge -- well, the jury, already having been polled, and every one of them said this would not affect our judgment?",
  "But he does have to stand up when the judge comes in -­",
  "-- and presumably when the jury files in.",
  "But this -- this is given -­ I mean, this is legirons. It's not leg braces. Belly chain. You don't need to make a record to -- to know that those things are visible. Is there any serious doubt that they were visible?",
  "But there's no for example here because the court said, in answer to the lawyer's objection -- the -- the lawyer says, it prejudiced him -­ prejudices him toward the jury and it makes him look dangerous. The court's answer: the objection you're making will be overruled. He has been convicted and will remain in legirons and belly chain. The only thing that was relevant, according to the trial judge was he has been convicted.",
  "Why? He went through the entire guilt phase with the more moderate restraints, just the leg brace, and there was no incident. There was no disturbance in that trial. He didn't try to lash out at anyone. Why wasn't that the best example of what one could anticipate in the penalty phase?",
  "Do we know why the judge apparently changed his mind? Because if I remember correctly, at the pretrial hearing, the court said that the defendant would be allowed to, A, wear his own clothes and, B, to have leg braces underneath for security. And then sometime after that pretrial hearing, the judge apparently changed his mind. Do we know what triggered that?",
  "So we already know that -­ that that effort was made before he was tried in the guilt phase.",
  "And whatever inference you might draw, it didn't prove out. So it seems to me the -­ the closest in time is the -- and -- and in fact is the episode he's just been through, the trial episode. So why wouldn't that be -- the -- the judge would start with that in mind. Well, I tried this man and he didn't give me any problems, so I have no reason to anticipate problems now.",
  "With a -- with a blank record -- the -- the State is going to restrain someone and it may be necessary, it may be not, and if the State has the burden, then why shouldn't a reviewing court speculate on what might have been when the only thing that was -­ appears of record is he's been convicted and will remain in legirons? The only reason the court gave is that now things have changed. He's no longer in the guilt phase where he enjoys the presumption of innocence. He has been convicted and, therefore, we can keep him in chains. There's nothing situation-specific about it. The judge seems to be saying once a person is convicted, at least of murder, it's fair game. It's -- it's permissible to keep him in legirons and shackles.",
  "I thought the question here was, was he dangerous in the courtroom? Was he going to lash out at a witness or try to -­",
  "If he -- if he were kept under these restraints, legirons and the -- what do they call it -- belly chain, day in and day out in prison, would that constitute cruel or unusual punishment?",
  "Mr. Phillips, before you proceed to going on to (b), the -- you have set up a dichotomy between a Federal question case where, as long as you have a Federal question claim in the case, you qualify within those words, of which the district courts have original jurisdiction. But you say that in a diversity case, that's not so if you have people not of the same citizenship -- of the same citizenship on both sides of the party line, so that you have to have a totally qualifying action on the diversity side to come within -- to -- to be within 1367(a). But we have had at least two cases where the starting lineup did not satisfy the complete diversity rule. One was Caterpillar and the other was Newman-Green, and the Court said, yes, on the day one there wasn't complete diversity, but that's curable later on, in the one case before the case was tried, in the other in the court of appeals. So don't at least those two cases suggest that you can have a diversity case legitimately in the Federal court even though at the outset you don't have -- fill all the requirements?",
  "I thought the Court said that -­",
  "I thought the Court didn't say they were ignoring it. I thought they said it was curable.",
  "They didn't start over in Caterpillar.",
  "The Caterpillar didn't start over and Newman-Green wasn't detected till appeal, but the appeals court didn't say start over.",
  "I don't -- I don't follow that entirely, Mr. Phillips, because the -- Exxon lost at -- at this trial, and preclusion doctrines -- that means that Exxon had one full and fair opportunity to defend. So Exxon is going to be bound by that -- by the determination. Somebody who was not in the litigation and might say, well, I want more, say, somebody who had opted out -­",
  "What you're saying, Mr. Phillips, I think is that 1367 does nothing with regard to what was in the old days at least 1367(a), what was called ancillary jurisdiction. It changed pendent jurisdiction to overrule the Finley case.",
  "So -- so you could have appendant parties, but what was once known as ancillary jurisdiction, applicable in diversity case, was not changed at all by 1367(a). I think that's what you're saying.",
  "But whether you -- whether you call it codify or anything else, there would be no change. 1367, as you read it, made no change. 1367(a) on the Federal question side certainly did. It overruled Finley. Before, you could have pendent party jurisdiction. Now you can. But Kroger was unchanged. I think what you're -- you're telling us is that except for some difference in (b), 1367(a) leaves ancillary jurisdiction as it found it. It doesn't make any change.",
  "So what -- what is the language in 1367(a) that effects any -- any change in diversity jurisdiction, what was once called ancillary jurisdiction? I don't see that there's any change.",
  "You may -- you may say that there's a confirmation of what was, but there's no change.",
  "I thought that's what Kroger was about. It said, yes, that you could do it -- that the plaintiff then couldn't turn around and sue the third party defendant.",
  "But that you did not need diversity between the defendant and the third party defendant.",
  "Then what you're saying is that this statute, as far as class actions go, changed nothing.",
  "Or party joinder, which is your case.",
  "Class Action Fairness Act.",
  "But not all. You couldn't have a -- if I remember right, a permissive counterclaim.",
  "The defendant -­",
  "-- can have a -­",
  "If we descend from the level of parsing the -- the statute to what's going on in these cases, in your cases I take it there was an injury to a child.",
  "And that qualifies under the amount-in-controversy.",
  "And her mother or sister and, I think, father wanted to come in and -- and bring claims that were entirely derivative of the injured child's claim.",
  "And on your reading of 1367, there's the -- the -- there's no accommodation for that. So you'd either have to have the whole lawsuit in the courts of Puerto Rico or you'd have -- let the child sue in the Federal court and the parents would have to bring a separate suit?",
  "Well, what a legislature might think, well, now this Finley has -- we've been -­ taken care of that. And your case looks very much the same in terms of breaking up a lawsuit into two when it makes sense to try it all together. So we think that -­ that old case should go just the way Finley went. And the same thing with Zahn because, after all, Zahn doesn't fit very well with Ben Hur. If you're saying that the Strawbridge rule -- I mean, what really counts is diversity, and -- and Ben Hur says the only named representative citizenship counts and yet the amount-in- controversy, the lesser thing in your view -- every single member of the class has to meet that amount, but only the named representatives have to be of diverse citizenship.",
  "But if you -- does it make sense to have a rule that says we're going to ignore the citizenship of the members of the class for diversity purposes, for diversity of citizenship? Only the named representative counts. Well, then why shouldn't only the named representative count for amount-in-controversy? That would have been a rational thing for Congress if they wanted to fix that.",
  "Are you talking about a claim mover? I'm not -­",
  "Mr. Stearns, there's a difference. It's not just style. There's a difference between a claim and a civil action. A civil action can bundle several claims.",
  "I think they -- what -- the argument that I heard was not that all the claims have to be aggregated, but that they can't get in the door.",
  "The Federal -- the Federal Study Committee was divided on Zahn issues.",
  "Yes, and the whole committee said we do not want to take a position on Zahn.",
  "He was the chair of the -­",
  "Mr. Stearns, one of the things that we do know was that Congress intended to make a modest change. They had their eye on Finley. They wanted to overrule that. And if there's an ambiguity, isn't a court well advised to make the least change?",
  "Well, if -- if you have a statute with a clear meaning, I agree with you, but this statute seems to be a bit of a muddle. And if you could read it in two different ways, then why don't you say, well, I'll pick -- if they're both plausible, I'll pick the one that doesn't introduce any radical change, that just makes a minor change?",
  "It -- it does -- to the extent that Strawbridge is involved, it -- it is -­",
  "As -- as indeed they were in the Class Action Fairness -­",
  "They haven't overruled Snyder. They said in this class action context if you meet the standards that they set, you can aggregate.",
  "But I don't understand the distinction that you're making between diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy since 1332 includes both. To qualify for diversity from the very beginning, you have to be of the opposite -- you have to be from a different State than your opponent and the matter in controversy must be X. And that's always been part of the diversity -- diversity jurisdiction. There were two components. One was the citizenship of the parties. Two was the amount in controversy.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Ayer, may I ask you a question on your interpretation? I think you were -- your position is that Clark against Paul Gray has been overruled, and whatever one may say about the attention that was focused on Zahn, Clark against Paul Gray has been on the books since 1939. And it seems unlikely that Congress would have overruled that without even making a peep to that effect.",
  "Yes. It's about an amount­ in-controversy rule.",
  "This didn't make a whole lot of sense.",
  "That -- this point was not -­ would be you're asking us to decide it in the first instance. You, I would expect, make argument to the district judge when you go back.",
  "Well, that's because the Court conceived of there -- there being one entity, so you couldn't -- you couldn't change -- split that one entity into two fictitious persons.",
  "Mr. Chemerinsky, too, doesn't the venue count? After all, we have had the question of prayer in schools, and the Court has said that that was not all right. Prayer in the legislature was distinguished. So it's not just prayer anywhere that the government wants to have it is okay.",
  "Isn't the display on the tablets on the top before you get to the text, before you get to, I am the Lord, thy God. I thought that those were replicas of what was in the film. Honor. I've tried to find out what that text is. It is not in Hebrew. It is not in a script that anyone was able to recognize. But it is important to notice that if you look at the entire monument, in addition to the Ten Commandments, there is also a Latin symbol of Christ, there is also Jewish Stars of David. And as I was saying in response to Justice Kennedy's question, imagine the Muslim or the Buddhist who walks into the State Supreme Court to have his or her case heard. That person will see this monument and realize it's not his or her government.",
  "Mr. Chemerinsky, on that point, how much of the Ten Commandments -- I mean, once we get to thou shalt not kill or murder, much are strictly about the obligation that man owes to God?",
  "Well, suppose, Mr. Chemerinsky, it was like Moses on that frieze where the sixth through tenth commandment. Would that be all right?",
  "But if we just had the Moses with the tablet that has the instructions for how people will conduct themselves in a civilized society versus worshiping the Lord.",
  "They see blank tablets. They don't see any writing. This is the only one that has script on it. It has numbers and in fact that's confusing because one of them, the people think is the Ten Commandments is the Bill of Rights. the Ten Commandments that are reflected on the doorway into and out of this courtroom don't have words on them like the tablets do in the State of Texas.",
  "Is it like how many other monuments? This is not peculiar to Texas. The Order of the Eagles have given how many monuments just like this one, identical to this one?",
  "When you said that every court that has considered this case has said it's compatible with the Establishment Clause, did you mean just this Texas case or other cases",
  "So you didn't mean this particular depiction of the Ten Commandments?",
  "General Clement, there is a question I have about the government's position. And does place matter at all? I mean, here we're talking about the grounds surrounding a State Capitol. What about every school room, if that's the choice of the school board? Is it the same or do you make -- or every courtroom up to the court to decide for itself?",
  "It looks just like this monument. Let's take this monument and put it in the rotunda of the court because the judges of that court choose to have it there. Is that all right?",
  "Mr. Staver, what about all the distinctions that have been made between messages that are brief or I think the expression has been minimal or minimum in some of our cases, like in God we Trust, like God save the United States and this Honorable Court, like under God, and a document that is about worshipping the Lord, at least as many words devoted to that topic. So it's not a brief reference. It's a powerful statement of the covenants that the Lord is making with his people.",
  "Have you read the first four commandments and could you say that?",
  "Mr. Clement, you placed heavy reliance on Marsh, which was prayer and it was undisguised and it was permitted to have since the beginning of our nation. Would it be equally compatible with the establishment clause if this Court opened its daily sessions with prayer?",
  "The kind of prayer that is used to open the legislative sessions which this Court has distinguished from in God we trust, God save the United States and this Honorable Court.",
  "I'm asking you what your view is of the compatibility of every federal Court in the country having over the bench a replica of the Ten Commandments and opening each session with prayer.",
  "Within reason outline an approach that would say a religious display is presumptively for -- is a presumptive endorsement. I think with the Baptist brief. Would you endorse that test?",
  "Is that -- what you're saying is academic because the statute doesn't require a Federal spending hook. It says it has the other commerce peg. I take it you -- you gave a pragmatic answer to that, that every State in fact gets Federal funds for their prison systems.",
  "What about garb that is said to be associated with the religion but also is used as a cue for gang membership? Let's say a beard. This religion requires me to wear a beard.",
  "What -- what about a religion that it's a genuine tenet of the religion that the races are to be separated and the person says, the accommodation I want is never to be celled with someone who is not of my race?",
  "To what extent? And I asked the -- the racist -- the religion that says God wanted the races to be separated and the accommodation is do not cell me with someone of another race.",
  "How about racist literature but it's under the aegis of a religious organization? And that -- suppose the prison does not permit, say, a member of the Aryan Nation to get that racist literature -- to get racist literature but -­",
  "Well, the content discrimination, I take it, would be raised by someone who wants to get this for political or psychological reasons -­",
  "-- you would say, I'm not challenging the right of the -- as a member of this religious sect. I just say, me too.",
  "Yes, but now that some of that has gotten sorted out through the experience of the Bureau of Prisons on the Federal side, one would expect there would be less of those far-out claims. The -- you would expect when a statute is new, that there might be some claims that we would recognize as frivolous after there's been experience under it.",
  "There was one question brought up about Ohio's own practice. But you -- you say we have no obligation to relieve burdens. If we did, we would violate the Establishment Clause. The point was made that Ohio pays for chaplains, but it doesn't pay for, say, psychologists to come in for agnostics. So aren't you right there violating the Establishment Clause on your own theory?",
  "Can you -- can you give me an example? Because most of the things I think of is either you can have kosher food or you cannot. Either you can wear a yarmulke or you're not. There's not other -­ another alternative. Most of these things are yes and no. What is the case where, well, you can't have this but we'll give you something lesser?",
  "Well, maybe if the warden says that, the court would say, fine, you don't have to accommodate.",
  "Did you suggest to the federal court that it certify the question of the meaning of Colorado law to this Colorado Supreme Court?",
  "But if you compare it to -- this is a court order and it's enforceable. There is no question about that, is there? This is a court order that enforcement officials carry out. How does it differ from, say, a money judgment and executing -- levying execution on property? Judgment creditor says, here is my judgment, marshal, sheriff, go out and find some of the defendant's property.",
  "But isn't that true of all injunctive orders, they're not issued to the police. And yet the police -- don't the police have an obligation to enforce that?",
  "But is discretion -­ does discretion on the means to use include discretion to do nothing?",
  "But were any of those determinations made here?",
  "So are you requesting that there are insufficient fact findings here, so it should be returned -­",
  "May I stop you? You cited that Linda R.S., whatever, I thought that was a standing case saying it's not going to do you any good to have him locked up in jail if what you want to do is get money from him.",
  "What good is -- what does the restraining order do, then, other than give her a right to sue the person who is restrained for contempt?",
  "But only to ask the police and the police are not obliged to respond.",
  "Could you be precise about what is the due process? You're saying it's not a hearing that you're seeking. Not just that she could be listened to and no action taken. But what precisely is the process to which she is due?",
  "But on any timetable?",
  "But where do you get that? I know that the Tenth Circuit tried to stick to the language of the statute. But where do you get the requirement, A, that police inform her and, B, that it give reasons for nonenforcement? Those were not within what the Tenth Circuit said.",
  "So the notice -- yeah, did it say with a statement of reasons?",
  "Where does that come from?",
  "I know that it would be a fair process that you're describing.",
  "But is it an essential one, that is, that nothing spells out -- in most of the cases that involve property and a procedural due process right, it's a hearing that the person is seeking. Are they entitled to benefit or are they not? But here, this is not what you want. You want the police to enforce. And if they don't enforce, to give you a reason.",
  "But if the police -- let's say, focusing on this case, suppose they had looked at this order and said, wow, it gives him weekends with the girls, it gives him summertime with the girls and, subject to his ex-wife's agreement, dinner time with the girls, this can't be all that urgent because if he would harm the girls then why is the judge allowing him so much sole time with them? So wouldn't -- looking at this particular order, wouldn't there be reasons why the police would say, the judge is allowing the father to spend time with the girls, this can't be that urgent?",
  "If there had been a question certified to the Colorado Supreme Court, and the Colorado Supreme Court said we weren't intending to create any entitlement here, evidence that we don't even have a tort action that's willful or wanton conduct, no liability at all in the municipality. So suppose the State Supreme Court has said, we didn't mean to create any entitlement, then where would you be?",
  "Mr. Chemerinsky, you speak about the injunction, and the injunction has three parts. I thought that you were not challenging -- at least the question presented doesn't suggest you're challenging -­ the first one that concerns distance, the 300 yard from Cochran or his place of business, and the third one, which is an anti-harassment provision. Do I understand correctly that it is only the second one that you're challenging?",
  "But your question is preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, and the first and third provisions of this injunction do not prohibit all future speech.",
  "Now that's another one that is in your brief. You say that these were statements of opinion not fact. But that surely is not presented in your question. You -- you don't -- there were findings made that these statements were defamatory, and your question presented does not seem to me to encompass at all the question whether these statements were defamatory.",
  "Well, if -- if this under -­ the underlying claim seems to be that Mr. Cochran is essentially being blackmailed; that is, this -- this -­ your client wants tribute to go away. And you say, yes, but it's defamation. It's a defamation action. Therefore, damages is the only remedy. Is there nothing that one can do to stop another from engaging in blackmail?",
  "Mr. Chemerinsky, the district -- I mean, the trial court made certain findings and I'm looking at page 42 of the joint appendix. The first is that these statements were actually made for the purpose of inducing Cochran to pay Tory amounts of money which Tory was not entitled. That's one finding. And then finding 24, despite repeated requests, Tory has refused to cease picketing unless he was paid money -- a monetary settlement by Cochran. And then 27 that says this is simply use of false and privacy-invading communications to coerce or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for desisting from that type of activity. And those sound like findings. It's true that the label of extortion has been put on it, but it certainly does sound like the -- that the purpose of the speech was to extract money not owed.",
  "Let's take specifically the words of the injunction. It's against orally uttering statements about Cochran, just orally uttering statements about Cochran.",
  "You say that someone can be enjoined -­",
  "You -- you did draft this injunction. It wasn't the -- an inspiration from the judge unaided by your advocacy. Is that so?",
  "This -- the terms of this injunction.",
  "But you've just said something that I think that's inconsistent with your earlier presentation. You said you could enjoin that posting. Here you said it wouldn't be effective just to enjoin the particular placards that were used, the particular words because then there would be other words. So the same question could come up with an Internet posting if you had an injunction not simply on what was posted but anything about this particular individual that might be posted in the future.",
  "Now, you -- you -- to the extent that you're complaining about extortion-like conduct, something else that you drafted -- I'm looking at the complaint on page 7 of the joint appendix. You have identified all defamatory, including with the false light invasion of privacy, but you don't have any claim that looks like blackmail.",
  "But what -- what I mean is could you have -- without using the label defamation, have stated a claim for extortion or blackmail? I'm not looking at your particular allegations but how you described on page 1 of the complaint what you were suing for: libel, libel per se, slander, slander per se, and invasion of privacy.",
  "Yes, but you're asking us now to -- the -- the trial court found there was defamation, and now you want to argue, no, it wasn't defamation. It was mere opinion. I really don't see how that's included in the question presented.",
  "There have been -- there have been injunctions against harassing conduct, threatening, stalking.",
  "Why -- why is that important, given what this petitioner did himself? He didn't wait for there to be a retroactivity decision to file the 2255 motion. He filed the 2255 motion before the Ross case was decided. Isn't that right?",
  "So perfectly -- the -- the prisoner is perfectly able to file the 2255 motion after the first clause is satisfied, the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized. This movant was too late, if you measured the year from that right but he wasn't -- he wasn't waiting for any retroactivity decision. He filed before the retroactivity case.",
  "So on your view of it, his complaint, when it was filed, should have been dismissed as not ripe because he didn't have the final element -­",
  "-- that is, the retroactivity?",
  "Can -- do you understand the -- the difference between what is a right initially recognized and then what is a right newly recognized? The statute is supposed to have three requirements: initially recognized, newly recognized, and made retroactive.",
  "But on your theory, there wouldn't be much in the way of resources because you say there's no ripe claim until the retroactivity decision comes down. Why wouldn't a district judge, faced with this dilemma, simply say, well, I'll just hold this complaint until the -- the court of appeals or the Supreme Court rules on retroactivity?",
  "If it's not that -- if it isn't the district court in that case, then you -- the district court has to take this complaint and just freeze it until some other -- a higher court rules on it.",
  "But what about -- I think the principal argument that Ms. Bergmann made was your reading means people -- you're encouraging filings that inevitably will be thrown out because the right will be made retroactive?",
  "But the other -- the other way avoids loading the district court with filings that are futile.",
  "You see, you're -- you're saying -­",
  "-- that the district court should take these filings, should not hold them. It should itself make the retroactivity determination.",
  "Is it your position that issue preclusion doesn't apply at all, or that there was no issue decided in the State court proceeding that carries over into the Federal proceeding? Which one is it? What -- you suggested -- you said, number one, no facts were found. The question was whether there was sufficient statements to survive a 12(b)(6) or its counterpart dismissal motion.",
  "And if it did -- if it did apply, what issues would be precluded?",
  "Mr. Utrecht, if I understand the respondents' brief correctly, there is on pages 10 and 11 a whole list of issues that they say were determined -­ raised, litigated, and determined in the State court. So, for example, that the HCO's housing replacement fees bear a reasonable relationship to loss of housing, the use of a defined historical measure -- measurement point reasonably related to the HCO's -- and it goes on for a paragraph, citing issues that respondents say -- says were raised, litigated, and decided in the California Supreme Court.",
  "But -- but isn't there an essential step to find out that there were issues? Because I think the way you're phrasing the question, it says, if there were issues decided, they weren't precluded. But if there are no issues, that's -- that's not what's involved in this case. The simplest ground on which you could knock out issue preclusion is that no issues were decided.",
  "What -- what were the issues that the Ninth Circuit thought were decided?",
  "Well, issue preclusion does extend to questions of law, as well as fact.",
  "But they said there was no litigation because it was just decided. They didn't plead enough to state a claim for relief.",
  "But is it right -- I mean, you couldn't -- you could not -- unless the ICJ decision gave a right to an individual, and you had no claim under the federal habeas statute -- and it is unusual, is it not, for a judgement of the International Court of Justice to recognize the right of an individual, as opposed to being just a judgement between nations?",
  "How many -- how many times has the ICJ held that, that a treaty, apart from being contract between the signers, confers individual rights?",
  "But there was no individual in that case. That was a case of one nation against another. There was no individual, like the Plaintiff here.",
  "Well, that's what I asked, if this -- I know that, certainly in the context of the Vienna Convention, there have been the series of decisions you mentioned; but I was wondering whether, outside the Vienna Convention, there has been any similar judgement of the ICJ that operates directly on individuals.",
  "How do you answer -­",
  "-- the related -- the related question that -- well, assuming the Vienna Convention is certainly law, and treaty stands on the same footing as law, but I believe that the -- Texas and the Government have said the AEDPA statute is the later-in-time provision, and when you have two provisions with a statute treaty, the later-in-time prevails. So why did -- why isn't the AEDPA controlling, and not the Vienna Convention?",
  "You said -- you said that something has started in the Texas courts. We have the motion to stay this case, and your response that it shouldn't be stayed, that we should decide this case. But what is going on, at this moment, in the Texas courts?",
  "And after the Texas court stays its hand, then what action is asked?",
  "Did the Breard case speak to that issue?",
  "But isn't what the President's memorandum says exactly what the Avena judgement said? That is, the President said, \"Well, the ICJ said that these people are entitled to review and reconsideration of their guilt and of their punishment. And so, I think that's what should happen. I agree with the judgement, or at least I think it should be enforced, and the only place it can be enforced is in the state court that rendered the judgement, because the ICJ said what the United States has to implement is, they have to give a review and reconsideration.\" Now, I suppose, as far as the ICJ is concerned, they don't care if it's done by some federal tribunal, or state, but within our system, it must be the state, mustn't it?",
  "But that can't be, in light of the United States' most recent action. I mean, we have a judgement. The judgement concerns how many people? Fifty-one? Forty-nine?",
  "Okay. There is no judgement concerning anybody else.",
  "But this -- but if there's a claim here based on the Avena judgement, it is that the United States agreed to the ICJ's jurisdiction in Vienna Convention cases. And so, pursuant to that agreement, there was an adjudication. The United States is no longer agreeing, so there will never be another adjudication. This adjudication concerns 51 people or -- and there are no others.",
  "Well, you have to -- you have to recognize that there is a distinction between this case, which is, in large part, based on a judgement of the ICJ, and other cases that would not have the benefit of that judgement.",
  "Why isn't this -- the United States did consent to the jurisdiction of the ICJ in these Vienna Convention cases, and that tribunal issued a judgement. Why doesn't it get the same recognition and enforcement of any judgement of any court with jurisdiction?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, could this question of the effect of the Avena Treaty be brought before the Court? Mr. Donovan raised, I think, the All Writs Act, and he also raised original writs in this court. If the COA doesn't work, then treat this -- I think that's what he's saying -- treat it as though it were an application under the All Writs Act or an original writ.",
  "Did you say -- you say that the FCC is changing its view. It has tentatively changed its view. So it will bracket the telephone companies with the cable companies.",
  "What would be left in the common-carrier category?",
  "But there could be. There could be, both with respect to material in the public domain and with respect to people who authorize the transmission.",
  "But you couldn't get summary judgment. Your reply brief said, \"This case is so clear that we should get summary judgment.\" If inducement is the theory -- you have just said, you have to show intent --",
  "-- so you could not - -",
  "-- you'd have to go to trial.",
  "Sony itself had a trial - -",
  "-- a full trial.",
  "If there's more, they could bring it out at trial, could they not? The difference between your position and Mr. Verrilli, I take it, is that you think there should be not summary judgment for the Petitioners, but a trial.",
  "That, Mr. Taranto, is something I find very puzzling. There is a statement - - one could take it as clear -- \"capable of substantial noninfringing use.\" That would be very clear, I agree. But Sony goes on for 13 more pages. If the standard were all that clear, it would have stopped there. And usually when you're interpreting a document, one rule is, you read on, and if you read on, you find we need not give precise content to the question of how much use is commercially significant. That doesn't sound very clear to me. Or if you then read back, as a careful reader would, then you find this statement that the primary use of the Sony machine for most owners was time-shifting, a use that the Court found either authorized or fair, and, hence, noninfringing. So I don't think you can take from what is a rather long opinion, and isolate one sentence, and say, \"Aha, we have a clear rule.\"",
  "Then perhaps there should be a trial so it would all come out.",
  "Well, they weren't concentrating on the damage to them, they were concentrating on the facilitation of copying that was provided. And you don't question that this service does facilitate copying.",
  "Well, you said -- I think you were saying -- this is something for Congress to solve; it's not for the Court. But the Court is now faced with two apparently conflicting decisions: Aimster, in the Seventh Circuit, the Ninth Circuit decision. And if you're just looking at this in the abstract, you might say, \"Well, it's -- isn't it odd that Napster goes one way in the Ninth Circuit, and this case goes another way?\"",
  "I thought - -",
  "Mr. Taranto, before you go back to that, I wanted to be clear on what you were saying would be left over for trial.",
  "Because, as I read your briefing, it was, \"Well, they can argue about some bad things that Grokster was doing in the past, but this decision says: henceforth, what we're doing is okay. The case zeroed in on now and the future, and the only thing that was left open was something that is over and gone could get damages for it.\" But I thought that this judgment gave you an okay, a green light, from now on.",
  "Where does one find that?",
  "But the motion itself is not there to take it through the opinion of the Court?",
  "That -- but that's what -- that's what you wanted to talk about, but we're on, first, the preliminary question.",
  "And is -- I think you started to say that you regarded atypical and significant as a fact-finding which was made against you -­",
  "-- based on the extreme conditions of this kind of confinement where you don't see another human.",
  "For how long?",
  "Perhaps we can be concrete. If he -- suppose the charge is he is a gang leader. Will he get notice that says you are being considered for reclassification because you are a gang leader?",
  "Not that he's been reclassified, but is the reason -- the reason that you are being reclassified is that you are a gang leader. Those -- those words, you are a gang leader. Will he get those?",
  "Why is it a predictive judgment that a person is a gang leader? The ultimate decision, given the facts and circumstances, we predict that this person is among the worst of the worst, but the findings that have to be made along the way are not necessarily predictive. I mean, it -- it would be nice if the -- if the issues came simply divided what happened in the past, what might happen in the future, but the judgment that's made to classify someone as 5 inevitably involves some, well, what happened in the past on the basis of which we can project what might happen in the future.",
  "But that would be -- that would be a what happened question, not what might happen. What happened, the determination might be made on the basis of rumor or innuendo. My only point is that questions don't come labeled so simply, predictive versus what happened in the past.",
  "And suppose neither of those are -- are so.",
  "Did you ask for -- did the Government move for modification of a decree? I -- I assume that it was not a decision of this Court. You said this -- what you do in the supermax at the Federal level has been imposed by a court. Which court?",
  "Well, you talked about something being imposed.",
  "And so I want to know what was imposed, first, by whom, by which court, and what -­ what the order was.",
  "But even so, I mean, you were saying this was forced on -- on the -- effectively on the Government. Well, it seems to me if that were the case, you would, after this Court rendered the decisions it did in Hewitt and Sandin, say, Seventh Circuit, please reconsider. It sounds to me as though you haven't done that so you probably think it's okay.",
  "Well, there is -- isn't there the problem -- at least Ohio suggested that there is -­ that if this person is indeed a gang leader and the form says so-and-so and so-and-so effectively ratted on you, those persons who came forward might not live to see another day?",
  "Which was never -- never in effect, right? The new policy -­",
  "So all -- the evidence relates to the old policy which I think Ohio recognizes was not adequate. And then there's -- Ohio has this new policy, and you, just on the basis of the written statement of the policy, made the judgment that it's not good enough.",
  "But as Justice Souter pointed out, the State law incorporated the Federal standard and made it its own. Here you have the Federal tax sale and a very strong Federal interest, which was lacking in Merrell Dow. Justice Stevens said that. But here I think there can be no doubt that the Government has a very strong interest in seeing that tax sales convey a secure title.",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor had asked you about the -- the quiet title cases, but Kansas City Title & Trust is still good law. It wasn't overruled.",
  "Yes, but the Court didn't make it -- the Court's proposition in Kansas City Title & Trust was if it appears from the complaint that the right to relief depends on the construction or application of the Constitution or laws of the United States. So are you asking us to take out or laws as dictum, or what is your position?",
  "Well, when does -- when does the -- when do the words, or laws, in Kansas City Title & Trust have operative effect?",
  "You mean that the -- are you saying then in the context of this case that the Federal law would have to create a quiet title action, which is traditionally State law?",
  "But it wasn't necessary.",
  "It was -- that's the difference. The State in Merrell Dow chose to adopt those Federal standards. It was a choice. I don't think a State has the prerogative to ignore the effect of a Federal tax sale. This is not a matter of State choice, and that, it seems to me, is the large difference between the two cases: one, where the State chooses to recognize Federal standards when it doesn't have to, and here, there's no question that the Federal law governs the security of this title. It's not an option for the State to ignore it.",
  "But you -- so you are -- you are proposing one way to reconcile Kansas City. You say, well, that's the constitutional claim. But why isn't it at least as good a reconciliation to say once you go through -- there's -- there's a Federal claim -- there's a Federal question that's dispositive of this case, and you agree that that's so here. The whole thing turns on the meaning and effect of that notice provision. So the Federal question is what determines this case, and you satisfy the well-pleaded complaint standard. Then at that point, when you satisfy the basic Kansas City Title & Trust provisions, then to see which way to swing, why isn't it appropriate to say is this a case where the State has a large interest and the Federal interest is not significant? Or, on the other hand, is it a case where there is a large Federal interest in seeing how this comes out?",
  "So you're saying that Merrell Dow did take out those words, or laws, from the Kansas City Title & Trust.",
  "Wasn't that in the -- in the pleading?",
  "Wasn't that in the complaint?",
  "But the -- but the well- pleaded complaint doesn't say it has to be a disputed allegation. It says it must be -- you couldn't state the claim without having the Federal law in the complaint.",
  "Suppose - -",
  "Suppose the -- there was an issue in this case about the plaintiff in the quiet title action having waited too long. I think here it was 6 years after. So -- so suppose there was a defense of laches under State law. That could be an issue in an action in this format, quiet title action, which would be governed by State law. Isn't that so?",
  "So that case wouldn't be removable then if the -- if the defense is laches? The plaintiff - -",
  "Yes?",
  "But you might never get to the Federal law if the determination of 6 years is too long to wait to bring a suit like this. Then you would remove and you could have an outcome based solely on State law in the Federal court. You'd have a State claim. The issue that divides the parties is how long was too long, and the court decides the case on that basis and never gets to the Federal question.",
  "So if laches is pleaded as a defense, then it's not removable? But don't you - - well - -",
  "Well, at what point do you remove the case?",
  "A complaint is filed in State court, and you are the defendant and you want to remove that case to Federal court.",
  "How much time do you have to remove? Would it be in advance of your answer?",
  "So that in my case, you would remove on the basis of the complaint before you put in your answer, and I think you're - -",
  "And then you could get into the Federal court, and the answer could be laches and you're in the Federal court and the only question that's decided is the State law question.",
  "Mr. Zagrans, there is language in Merrell Dow that makes it sound like it's not as clear and certain as you are urging. I think that the opinion author said that 1331's domain is shaped by the demands of reason and coherence, dictates of sound judicial policy, and common sense. And if you just take that last question when the only question is, is mail notice good enough to satisfy the Federal statute, or do you have to have in-hand service? Doesn't common sense say what that section means should be a Federal question, appropriate for a Federal court to decide?",
  "I'm simply making the point that you are reading Merrill Lynch -- Merrell Dow in a rather rigid way. And yet, there is this language in it that says in -- in -- what was before the Court in Merrell Dow made perfectly good sense in that tort action to have it going on in State court. This is quite a different picture.",
  "I thought that there was no State law issue in this case, that the whole thing turned on what kind of notion -- notice was sufficient to convey title.",
  "Mr. Bedrick, in your brief you were very, it seemed, uncomfortable about addressing this question. You said it's just like you go through the same litany as title VII, that is, the plaintiff meets a burden which is in title VII very easy to meet - -",
  "-- stage one. Then the defendant has to come up with a nondiscriminatory reason, and then you find out if that was pretext. You kept saying in your brief what you said a moment ago that you have never seen a case. You said it never happens. It never happens that the prosecutor stands silent. So this is a hypothetical, academic question. But I think you're being pressed to say, well, suppose it does happen, and I take it that your answer is in that case the person who's raising the Batson challenge wins. But you're -- you're not willing to say certainly. I mean, you seem to say -- well, why are you uncertain?",
  "But suppose you had in a title VII case the employer says, I'm not going to give you a nondiscriminatory reason. You -- you've gone through the McDonnell Douglas. The plaintiff has shown those four things. The employer says, I'm not going to give you any reason. Then what happens?",
  "Isn't it sometimes even when you're not involved with a constitutional question, if you have a Federal claim in a State court -- Byrd against Blue Ridge is one example -- the Federal procedure -- that the State procedure needs to be modified so it's in sync with the Federal?",
  "That was a question of what kind of questions go to juries.",
  "The State said ordinarily we don't give this kind of question to the jury, but we're dealing with a Federal claim, and the Federal procedure trumps.",
  "But that's in -- in the title VII context, certainly you don't have to show more likely than not to get past the initial threshold. All you have to do is to make four showings that -- that Federal courts have recognized are rather easily made. So the real show doesn't come until the pretext stage. But it's not that you have to show anything by a preponderance of the evidence, that -- you don't have to show discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence under title VII. You just have to show four things from which someone may but not must infer discrimination.",
  "I thought all it did was shift the burden of production to the defendant. It doesn't -- the showing at stage one doesn't involve the burden of persuasion.",
  "And here there was no reason given.",
  "So why shouldn't this operate as so many things do in -- in an unfolding proceeding? If someone stands silent -- and we're not involved with a Fifth Amendment privilege -- there's an inference -- an adverse inference. Worse, take a -- a discovery and one plaintiff asks for discovery from -- from the -- the defendant, and the defendant says, sorry, I'm not going to give you what you want. What is the consequence of that if the defendant, being presented with a opportunity or a requirement to give a reason or to produce something, says, I won't?",
  "But one of the -- if we're going to continue with that analogy to someone who says I won't make discovery, is not just an inference but that you take what the opposing party says to be true on that issue.",
  "This is not -- not issue preclusion. I mean, this is -- that is -- the defendant who stands silent is going to lose.",
  "May -- may I just - -",
  "-- ask you to clarify one thing? I -- I take it from what you've said, although I didn't understand it from your brief, that California doesn't have any different standard, that they are following the same standard that would be applicable in Federal court on a Batson challenge. Or did I misunderstand you?",
  "So you're not arguing that States have flexibility to apply Batson according to different procedural rules. You're arguing that the Ninth Circuit is wrong about what the Federal standard is.",
  "But it still could be -- I mean, you're not taking away the peremptory. You're saying the -- the prosecutor can give a reason and the judge says, okay, that passes. It wouldn't pass for a challenge for cause, but as a peremptory, it's okay.",
  "The discretion - -",
  "The discretion under 15(a), at least in the general run of civil proceedings, that is to be liberally exercised in favor of the pleaders that are so -- so it's a different -- the 15(c) relation-back test is quite different from the general attitude to pleading amendments, \"Well, we'll let the Plaintiff,\" or, here, the Petitioner, \"make the pleading alteration, and then it will be there, and the Court will make a determination of whether the pleading is good or not.\" But, at the 15(a) threshold, it's not much -- it's not much of a screening device, is it?",
  "What is your definition of the test under 15(c)(2)? I mean, on the one side, the argument is -- Felix's argument is, it's the entire trial episode, right?",
  "And is yours that every single objection that might be made in this entire trial record, every one, is a separate transaction or occurrence, for purposes of 15(c)?",
  "Are you, Ms. Blatt, taking the position that that is a tighter test than would apply ordinarily to the mine run of civil cases under 15(c)?",
  "And here, it was five months.",
  "Here.",
  "Are you relying, Ms. Blatt, at all on the difference between the pleading rules for civil cases, generally, and habeas, where you do have a whole set of pleading rules, separate the habeas rules?",
  "But, Mr. Porter - -",
  "-- all that would be required to allege, to take the four-line complaint -- all that the Plaintiff would have to say in that tort case is, \"The train was negligently operated,\" with nothing more specific than that. And then the particulars could come out later. Under habeas, you can't do that. You must set out your grounds, and the -- Rule 2 is very specific about that. So, it's a very different approach to what you have to allege, going in.",
  "Mr. Porter, if I understand you right, you are saying that, in the habeas context, the counterpart to an injury in a tort case is the unlawful detention, itself. Am - -",
  "-- I right?",
  "Okay. So if that's the injury, could the habeas Petitioner come in with a complaint that says, \"I am being detained in violation of the Constitution,\" period, \"and I need a lawyer to spell out the details\"?",
  "But I think that, first of all, the amendment may be made before there is a defensive plea. As Mr. Chan pointed out, that the Warden doesn't even get the petition until it's been screened by the Court. The other is the understanding, on the civil side, of Rule 15(a). It's a very liberal pleading rule. The threshold for granting permission to amend a pleading under 15(a) is very easy to pass.",
  "Well, the -- the evidence was Stumpf -- Stumpf himself who said Wesley was the triggerman with respect to Mrs. Stout. But I wanted to ask you a question about -- that -- it relates to the sentencing part and it follows up Justice O'Connor's question. The -- the -- you -- as - - if I understood you right, you said, well, there was a motion that came before two of the three judges that were part of the guilty plea and the sentencing. This was a plea, so no jury trial. It was three judges. One of them had died. The -- the two who remained -- one of them said, but if we had not been satisfied that Stumpf was, in fact, the triggerman, and we were satisfied that he was, in fact, an aider or abetter, that may very well have had an effect on the court's determination whether the death penalty should follow. I'm not saying it would, but it's possible. And then you said, but then he went ahead and voted to deny the motion.",
  "Yes. But there's no explanation at all. The only expression that we have from that judge is -- he said, well, it's conceivable, although it wouldn't affect guilt, we would have come out with a different sentence, and then going from that statement to nothing, just a denial without explanation. You -- you want us to infer from that silent denial that the judge must have resolved his own difficulty and decided it wouldn't make any difference on the sentence.",
  "But it would be appropriate because the statute permits it. But the decision-maker has three choices. And if the evidence had come in that Wesley was the triggerman, maybe the -- this panel of judges would have done what the jury did in Wesley's case, that is, it's the same crime, but not give the death penalty for it.",
  "But the panel -- the panel that didn't reopen -- there was no reopening because they denied the motion. But they didn't say one way or another.",
  "Mr. Freedman, it wasn't a trial. It was a -- it was a plea hearing.",
  "I -- I thought the prosecutor in closing in the Wesley trial said, it could have been Stumpf, but it doesn't make any difference.",
  "I thought they argued both?",
  "That was introduced by Wesley, not by the prosecution.",
  "Mr. Freedman, you're trying to read back now into what apparently you recognize is - - is not a flawed initial sentencing hearing.",
  "And it might be more persuasive if the trier were a jury when the motion to vacate is made, but these are judges whose business it is to preside over these kinds of cases. They presided over that first hearing and now the same prosecutor -- was the same prosecutor in both?",
  "Comes back to them and says, judges, don't vacate the sentence that you yourself entered. It's -- given that we're dealing with sophisticated judges, the same panel in both episodes, it's a little hard to -- to see where the due process violation is.",
  "What should -- what -- was Wesley then denied due process? Because at the time of Stumpf's initial plea hearing, Eastman hadn't appeared and there was only Stumpf's testimony that he was not the triggerman and the prosecutor's evidence that he was. Then we get to Wesley, and Eastman shows up. The prosecutors have already taken the position that Stumpf was the triggerman. Is Wesley denied due process because they're taking inconsistent positions at his trial?",
  "But now your -- your part about the guilt, the Sixth Circuit agreed with you because it vacated not only the sentence, but the conviction. And what is your argument that the conviction is infirm?",
  "I thought the State argued that knowledge -- that there's this plan, and they had a common design to rob. Is that right? And then the State said that common design plus knowledge that an inherently dangerous instrument would be employed to perpetuate the felony or that the felony and its manner of accomplishment would be reasonably likely to produce death. That's what the State argued was the law of Ohio.",
  "Did -- did any judge say that, any judge on the Sixth Circuit say that that was the Ohio law?",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, just one piece of information. Because the IND is so important at this point, is it in the record -- do we have a copy of the IND?",
  "For your first answer, are you relying what the Federal Circuit said in its opinion - - and it's in 10a of our cert petition appendix -- that is, the Federal Circuit's statement of the question presented, whether the preclinical research conducted under Scripps- Merck agreement is exempt from liability for infringement of Integra's patents.",
  "Your time is short, so could you tell us how far back you think, under the statute, you can go and not -- and be within the safe harbor?",
  "Where is this? Page 14a - -",
  "What are you quoting from?",
  "Why should we say that's the question, when the Federal Circuit, itself, said what I read before from 10a?",
  "Mr. Flores, when I asked you about the sentence on page 10, I intended, not the one that you read, but an earlier one that precedes it, and that is, \"The questioning arising in this case is whether the preclinical research\" -- that is, the research on animals, as distinguished from humans -- \"conducted under the Scripps-Merck agreement is exempt from liability for infringement of Integra's patents.\" Now, if you just took that as the question, then you would say it -- this Circuit is drawing the line between clinical and preclinical. It's not a crystal-clear opinion, by any means, but that is one question presented that they've identified. And how do they answer that question?",
  "Is this text that you're referring to, is it someplace -- is the text someplace where we can look at it while you're explaining this to us?",
  "But why wouldn't it have information about effectiveness on animals? I mean, if the -- you show that the -- all the FDA's interested in is that it didn't kill the animal, never mind whether it was effective to cure the tumor?",
  "The dissenting judge did not -- the dissenting judge, Judge Newman, did not read the Court's opinion the way you do. Is that correct?",
  "Maybe we should take that into account, to some extent, that someone who participated on the bench had a different take on what her colleagues were saying?",
  "Mr. Browning, this argument that you're making, where you seem to be having great solicitude for the -- for the whistleblowers, for the people who might be retaliated against -- the respondent and the Solicitor General answer your argument by saying in all the years that 3730(h) retaliation claims have been available, there has been no instance of qui tam plaintiff barred because the retaliation occurred outside the 6 - year limitation. Yes, one could hypothesize these cases, but are there any actual cases where the retaliation in fact fell outside the 6-year, dated from the submission of the false claim?",
  "Maybe they don't get retaliated against if they testify at trial.",
  "And if the question is whether there is a problem out there in the real world on -- for people whose interest is certainly not identical to yours.",
  "It seems -- it seems if you read a provision like this, it says what the United States would be required to prove. Implicit in -- in that is in any action brought by the United States under 3730. I think -- think (c) is clearly talking about cases in which the United States is bringing the action.",
  "Well, I don't think that's at all as clear as that (c) is directed to cases brought by the United States for the reason that Justice Breyer just explained. Congress might want to have one 6-year limitation and say, well, maybe there would be this hypothetical case that you're worried about, but for the most part, 6 years will take care of everybody.",
  "In connection with what's included and what isn't included, the -- in that same 3731 provision in (d), (d) is limited to (a) and (b) and so excludes (h). And if Congress had meant that with respect to the 6-year period, they could have said the same thing, that it relates to (a) and (b) and not (h).",
  "Mr. Browning, is it proper to consider in the calculus that if you use 6 years from the date the -- that the false claim was made or was alleged to be made, then you don't have to get into the question which State's statute of limitations, the choice of law question, and then when you identify that State, which limitation period within that State? I mean, those are two inquiries which can sometimes be rather complicated. They are obviated entirely if we take the 6 years from the Federal statute.",
  "When there is no statute of limitations.",
  "The question is Federal statute. Is there one? And my question is deciding is there one -- this is not something drawn from thin air. There is a 6-year period right in the statute.",
  "Mr. Hurt, can you -- can you go back a few steps? Because there was a difference between an answer that you gave and one that Mr. Browning gave. He said it's a mixed bag, the litigation of whether it's brought in one action and the whistleblower is making both claims or whether the retaliation claim is saved out and brought in a separate action. You said the vast majority of the cases involve the whistleblower asserting both claims in a single action. Which characterization is right? Mixed bag or vast majority?",
  "All right.",
  "Mr. Hurt, what -- what about the argument that unlike most retaliation situations, here if you take that 6-year period, which is much longer than the general run of retaliation statutes take it, then you would have a qui tam plaintiff who waits while the back pay is mounting, and so you can have an exorbitant application both with respect to the amount of back pay and the claim for reinstatement. 5 years down the road - - I haven't worked with this company now -- I'm going to insist they take me back, be reinstated. That -- that concern, that on your reading there is the potential for much larger damages and much more disruptive reinstatement than is usually the case.",
  "And that was the point that the Seventh Circuit made clear in -- in its --",
  "-- statute of repose.",
  "Just go back to what you said. In -- in the Major -- whatever it is -- is there any limitation at all, or just the limitation on the qui tam and as here, as you contend is so here?",
  "Oh, that's -- that's a criminal proceeding.",
  "In any event, you pointed out that on the face there is the distinction on the face of it - -",
  "-- it is not a disparate impact case at all - -",
  "-- because it affects only indigents.",
  "You're saying this is case like Douglas which was equal protection, like a free transcript, like a filing fee for an appeal.",
  "You're bracketing - -",
  "That's just -- but that's just boiler plate, isn't it? That's what they say in all these cases.",
  "And I think Michigan cites a Michigan Supreme Court decision that says it's not on the merits.",
  "It's People v. Berry?",
  "Well, why wouldn't it be the same if the -- if it's a discretionary appeal at the intermediate appellate level?",
  "Is that something the intermediate appellate court has said? Have they said that, that -- we have a -- a discretionary appeal, but every -- in every case it's a merits decision? We don't have any decisions that say we are exercising our discretion not to review.",
  "Mr. Moran.",
  "Mr. Moran, before your - - your time is up, I did want to know what is your position on -- let's say that there is -- you prevail and there is a right to counsel for these applications to appeal. And if counsel looks at the case and determines that there is no tenable ground for an appeal, could counsel file the equivalent of an Anders brief?",
  "Mr. Restuccia, the -- we are dealing here, as is not uncommon, with someone who is learning disabled, mentally impaired, and the trial court did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal. It said only when - - if this exists, I must, and if that exists, I must, but did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal. And I was curious as a matter of what is going on in Michigan trial courts now. Do judges routinely tell defendants who plead guilty -- tell them not only when the court must give them counsel, but if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal? Because that --",
  "-- that was never imparted in this case.",
  "Well, apparently the people who -- who redid the model instructions thought that this would be a clearer one, to tell him up front you don't get counsel if you don't fit under these exceptions.",
  "Then why -- if it's just denying -- or not granting appeal, why does it use the boiler plate, for lack of merit in the grounds presented?",
  "What of Mr. -- Mr. Moran's point that this -- whatever the merits are, it counts as law of the case and it's -- it conclusively determines the issues presented?",
  "But it's not that -- it's not that sharp because it was -- in Ross, it was the second appeal. So here we have one factor that is like Douglas, Griffin, and one factor that's like Ross. You can't say that it falls in one camp more than the other. This is the first-tier appeal.",
  "Why -- why did Florida deny relief in -- in the post-conviction? I mean, one reason that looks like it might apply is that Florida had a 2 - year statute of limitations and this was brought up 14 years later.",
  "Are you saying that counsel -- what -- what he alleges counsel told him was, in fact, accurate at the time counsel said it, that somebody who got a 99-year sentence wouldn't have to serve more than 13 years?",
  "Can you go back to the district court before the Eleventh Circuit? You've now told me that the ground on which the Florida court denied relief was not based on the statute of limitations. Right?",
  "In the Federal court, what is the ground on which relief was denied and how would Artuz affect that decision?",
  "What about the -- you -- you said 60(b) fits this like a glove because it's the district court correcting its own errors. But it isn't usually -- 60(b) was framed with the idea of the district court being the very first instance court. And here you will have the district court as the third going up the ladder. So -- and -- and given that the habeas rules say that -- that civil rules are applicable but have to be modified to be compatible with habeas jurisdiction.",
  "Isn't that an exaggeration of how 60(b) works in practice? It isn't that every civil judgment can come back and back again with 60(b) motions. The district courts have been rather disciplined in handling 60(b) motions. So I think you have exaggerated what 60(b) does in the ordinary civil rules context.",
  "Mr. Kise, this may be important. Do you agree with Mr. Rashkind that in the Florida court the dismissal or the denial of relief was not on the Florida statute of limitations - -",
  "But it's not -- not clear from --",
  "That's not what the -- this is -- the -- the form of dismissal in the Florida Supreme Court doesn't tell us that. It just says something about allegations contained therein do not constitute legal grounds for granting the new trial.",
  "The first one was on the statute of limitations?",
  "Do we have that anyplace at -- in the papers before us, the first -- the first dismissal in the Florida -- in the Florida trial court?",
  "But you said --",
  "-- that it was based on the Florida 2-year statute of limitations.",
  "Didn't Congress rule -- rule out 60(b) in -- in death cases?",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. I may be wrong about having - -",
  "I thought there was a special provision for capital cases.",
  "Did the Federal court make a mistake of -- of law if the -- if the Florida court dismissed under the Florida 2-year statute of limitations?",
  "No, no. Did the Federal court. And suppose that the - -",
  "It's sub judice, before us now.",
  "But do you agree with Mr. Kise that the first dismissal in the Florida court, the first denial was on the Florida 2-year statute of limitations?",
  "Mr. Digges, this -- the - - the -- there was a question about the ramifications of the position that you're presenting. That is, there are many situations in which there is some kind of licensing fee that is imposed on everyone, the same dollar amount, although some people who are licensed will be doing business in other States and have to get licenses there as well. The example that was featured in the -- in the briefs on the other side of the lawyer who is licensed, say, in Massachusetts and also in D.C. does not get any break on his D.C. Bar admission because he is also admitted in Massachusetts, and in fact, does most of his practice out-of-state, out of the District.",
  "The Scheiner case didn't make a distinction based on in-state activity. I thought that that -- that flat fee was applicable to every motor carrier that went on the roads in Pennsylvania.",
  "Who -- who sets the fee for the plating?",
  "So - -",
  "-- you could have -- unlike the -- the fee, the $10 fee, that - -",
  "-- the Federal cap, this would -- for plating it could be anything each individual State chooses it to be?",
  "Yes.",
  "How -- how does that work in -- in practice? Is it easily accessible? Suppose the company - -",
  "-- wants to fill up its truck and -- and it said, well, this is going to be -- the only haul this season for me, so I want the 3-day permit.",
  "This -- this applies only to operations that are both licensed and registered in Michigan. Is that so?",
  "Right, right, yes.",
  "Do you place any reliance in this scheme on the fact that the only people subject to it are people who have their principal place of business in Michigan?",
  "But -- but you accepted the petition for rehearing in this Court would also count, although the rule doesn't say that.",
  "The rule speaks about the mandate should issue when cert is denied, but in this case, there was a further extension while this Court was considering a petition for rehearing. Do you say that that was also outside the rules so that the mandate would have to issue when cert is denied even if there is a petition for rehearing and a request to continue the stay during the pendency of that rehearing petition?",
  "So you say that that was wrong in this case too.",
  "Did the prosecutor -- did the prosecutor object when there was a further extension given for the pendency of the petition for rehearing?",
  "Ms. Smith, this -- unlike the Calderon, which is a -- was a -- a court has authority to recall a mandate that has already issued, this seemed to be a really idiosyncratic case. I mean, this was an extraordinary situation where a judge said, my goodness, I wrote an opinion that assumed this person was mentally okay, and now I discovered in the file things I never saw before. This is a death case. I have reason to suspect that this person may not have been competent when he committed the crime, may not have been competent when he -- when he stood trial, may not be competent at this very moment. A judge in that situation -- he finds something that looks like it's the -- it's -- it's the key piece of evidence in favor of the defendant. Somehow it never got submitted. A judge, knowing that he has written an opinion saying this man, as far as the Federal courts are concerned, goes to the State and they can set their date of execution and all that -- that was an -- this case is so idiosyncratic that I'm concerned about dealing with 41(b) and mandates for this really unusual situation.",
  "At two different points in time, wasn't it?",
  "How would it have been presented? Because it wasn't -- it wasn't even in the record in the district court. I mean, that was what Suhrheinrich was so bewildered about, that here was what seemed to be the strongest evidence for the defendant, and at the end of the proceeding in the district court, it's not even made formally a part of the record. It was a deposition. Right?",
  "So it wasn't -- it wasn't in the district court record. It wasn't in the record that went from the district court to the court of appeals. It wasn't in the record on appeal.",
  "What you're saying is - - essentially is we should regard this as though what wasn't done had been done because it was supposed to have been done. In other words, you're saying treat this just as if the mandate issued and was being recalled. That's what I get to be the gist of your argument.",
  "Do you know any precedent, any case, in which rule 41(b) has been invoked after there has been a petition for cert and petition for cert has been denied? In practice, is there any other case in the world like this? I don't know of any.",
  "Is that -- is that really true? Is -- you have a judgment, and it doesn't have preclusive effect from the time it issues? It -- it's just sort of suspended there with no effect until the mandate issues?",
  "How does --",
  "-- how does -- how does David Duncan's guilty plea -- he entered a plea of guilty to a charge of obstruction, and he confessed the intent to impede the SEC investigation by shredding documents. So, what were the elements of that offense that are absent in this one?",
  "So, it was proper, then, for Michael Odom to tell the Andersen personnel when he's encouraging them to follow the policy -- he said, \"If it's destroyed in the course of normal policy and litigation, and litigation is filed the next day, that's great. We followed our policy, and whatever there was that might have been of interest to somebody, it's gone and irretrievable.\"",
  "That's fine for him to make that linkage between, \"Destroy it. Maybe there's going to be litigation filed tomorrow.\" \"That's great. It will be gone\"?",

  "But, Mr. Phillips, it says it -- either something is before, preliminary; or after, postliminary. And if it's neither of those, then, it seems to me, it fits -- it's not before the principal activity, and it's not after the principal activity, so what else is it, other than the -­",

  "-- IBP case? As I understand it, whatever we do here is irrelevant to what the bottom line is going to be in that case, because the determination is going to be made only under State law. The court below said that's what it was going to do. And the employees are not objecting. So, it seems that that case, as distinguished from Tum, is really not anything that this Court should decide, because it would be academic.",
  "Mr. Goldstein, I just wanted to have a clear answer to the question Justice Scalia asked you. Is it so that collective bargaining could not trade off the compensation for the walking and the donning and doffing for some other benefit that the employees might prefer?",
  "So, you say it's an open question.",
  "What -­",
  "-- about what gear qualifies? That is, here we have no dispute that this is protective gear. But it's not any changing that counts. So, how do we know whether this is the kind of donning and doffing that's compensated in -- or the kind that isn't?",
  "That wasn't decided below, was it? It was just a question of walking and waiting, and they weren't specific about whether that included waiting or walking, predonning.",
  "So, perhaps we shouldn't reach a question that hasn't been aired and decided below.",
  "I wasn't questioning that, so much as it is -- it is extraordinary for this Court to take a case when the bottom line is going to be the same. And, since we have the identical issues, with no such preliminary question in Tum, if we decide in your favor in the Tum case, then the other case is taken care of.",
  "Mr. Goldstein acknowledged that that issue, the predonning wait, was not decided below.",
  "But it wasn't, obviously, decided in the first circuit, because they ruled against the employee's position.",
  "But the -- but the question of when -- what waiting are we talking about? Before the principal activity or only after? That specific issue, as I understand it, was not aired below.",

  "-- why, in all these years, hasn't the Department of Labor gotten rid of it?",
  "They decided -­",
  "-- no waiting time. They didn't decide \"if\" waiting time -- \"which\" waiting time. But they said no -- it's irrelevant whether it's before or after, because waiting time isn't covered. So, I don't see how they specifically decided, yes, waiting time is covered, but not --.",

  "And out-of-State or abroad -­",
  "Well, that -- that has been what's discussed in the brief, and I think that the court, in Chickasaw, was saying, If the State puts the incidence on the tribe itself, we don't have to look any further. That's what it said. When the State levies a tax directly on the tribe or members inside the reservation, no balancing. But then it also said that if the incidence rests on non-Indians, as here, with the distributor here, then there is no categorical bar, than balancing kicks in. So, all Chickasaw dealt with, with the categorical rule, is when the State says the incidence of the tax is on the tribe.",
  "Mr. Olson, in terms of the text of the statute that is -- the incidence is on the distributor of the first receipt, but then there's this language -- and it appears in a few places -- \"the tax is hereby imposed on the use, sale, or delivery.\" What does -- what does that mean, that the tax is imposed on the use, sale, or delivery?\"",
  "Mr. Olson -­",
  "-- could we go back -­",
  "-- to the question that Justice Souter raised at the outset? Because I'm really puzzled. This is the picture I have of the case. And please tell me where it's wrong. Two jurisdictions, both with authority to impose a tax, the State and the tribe. So, if the other weren't taxing, there wouldn't be any question, that the tribe can tax and the State can tax. But the two can't coexist, because the consumer's not going to pay the price. So, only one can. And the issue is, which one dominates, and which is one is subordinate? But you have unquestionable authority to tax in both. And I thought it was clear that the two taxes did -- this is not a case where the tribe can impose a tax, the State can im- -- oppose. I read the briefs to accept that the tribe tax -- couldn't put its tax on top of the State tax.",
  "But not tax-free. I mean, the -- a big thing that was made in this case was that, unlike the cigarette sales in the smoke shops, the tribe is not trying to market a tax exemption. It is putting on its own tax, which will cost the customer, in the end, the same as if there had been a State tax.",
  "Chickasaw said when the tax was imposed on the tribe, we would take the State at its word. It said it's taxing the tribe. If the State put the tax on a non-Indian, then there would be balancing. And that's what Chickasaw -­",

There is every reason to believe that State legislatures will address the urgent issues involved in this case in a fair and impartial way.\" And then the Government added that, \"There is no indication that the political processes are malfunctioning in this area.\" That was a position presented to this Court in the Glucksberg case by the Government.

In other words, I -- are you speaking just of the ultimate persuasion burden?

  "So, now, as a result of the Fourth Circuit's decision, do the parents always go first --",

  "So, you think the ALJ -- or the administrative hearing officer in this case told the State to go first -- the school district to go first because he thought that maybe they had burden of proof, and would not have asked them to go first if he didn't?",

This child was in private school for years, and the parents weren't asking anybody to do anything, because -- and it's only when the private school said, \"We have to -- we can no longer put up with your child. Your child has all these problems\" -- at that time, the parents then came to the school district and asked for an IEP.",

  "Now we go back to the -- an answer you gave before, when we were going through what, in fact, happened, the suggestion that maybe the parents were just trying to get the private-school tuition reimbursed, the -- there was a finding, wasn't there, in the District Court, in the -- this is in the Petitioner's appendix, at 46 and 47 -- the district court said, \"The parents in no way prevented the IEP from being formulated or otherwise failed, in good faith, to consider it.\"",
  "It's not hypothetical. Isn't it -- it isn't hypothetical. States -- isn't it true that some States have said that, in these hearings, the school district will have the burden of proof?",
  "Mr. Garre, if you -- if you had a situation, say, under Title 7 -- and you pointed out in your brief that, in most benefit cases, most -- the person -- whether it's Social Security -- the person who is making the claim has the burden of proof. But there is something different about this setup, because the statute does obligate the school district to come up with a plan. And so, I was thinking, if you have a Title 7 case, and the plaintiff prevails on the merits, and then there's a question of remedy, and the employer said, \"I propose this -- these changes to remedy the violation,\" wouldn't the employer in that case have the burden of establishing the adequacy of the plan that it has come up with to remedy the problem?",
  "No, you made -­",

  "-- do you have any information in -- to the question I asked earlier -- in the States that have said, \"School district, you bear the burden,\" do we know whether there's more litigation?

  "Mr. Frederick, what about cases where a plaintiff sues two defendants -- one is diverse, and the other is not diverse -- and there is a motion by the defendants to dismiss for want of diversity? The plaintiff then says, \"Oh, but only one of those defendants is the 'real-party whatever,' and I can drop the other one, because the other one is not the 'real party in interest'\"? Now, that's a situation where courts, even if this court has never had that problem, have said, \"If the second defendant, the non-diverse defendant, is a 'real party,' you can't get rid of the case that way, but if it's not -- if it's not, you can keep the -- just drop it and keep the case going against the 'real party in interest.'\" There are such cases.",
  "Ah, but the plaintiff said, \"This is a complicated real estate business, and I want to discover whether there is -- whether the 'true defendant' is a Virginia citizen, as I am.\" So, on the face of it, it looks like there's complete diversity, but, in fact, the diverse defendant is hiding the \"real party.\" I think that's the position that the plaintiff was taking.",
  "The plaintiff --",
  "-- the plaintiff points to two offices of the defendant, who's -- the defendant is described by defendant as a Texas corporation -- but there was one witness -- Chaney, was it? -- who said that Lincoln is not a corporation. It is a partnership. No corporate board.",
  "Well, they thought they got closer with a witness named Franzen, who was a Virginia resident, and who also described Lincoln as a partnership, and himself as a partner.",
  "Well, plaintiff certainly wouldn't want to say there's an indispensable party missing, I take it, because then that would put the plaintiff out of court. The plaintiff is arguing that there's another defendant who should be in here.",
  "And because you represent the removing defendant, it is true, is it not, that the removing defendant has the burden of showing that proper diversity exists?",
  "Mr. Frederick, would you clarify one thing for me? I don't know how we even get to the second question, about partnership. If you're right that Lincoln is a corporation -- it's a Texas corporation, with its principal place of business in Texas, end of case; it's the only named defendant -- so, how do we get to something about a partnership?",
  "Well, I don't understand it. We wouldn't vacate the judgment in part. If we reversed, --",
  "-- that's the end of it.",
  "Yes, but, Mr. Frederick, before that -- you know, read back -- the court -- the Fourth Circuit has said, \"It appears that the real and substantial party in interest is this Virginia subsidiary, be it a partnership, be it a corporation.\" So, it's -- the thing about nexus is not self-standing. The court is positing that there is a Virginia corporation or a Virginia partnership in the picture, and then says, \"And given that, not only is it -- is it a Virginia entity, but it's got this close nexus because of -- it's operating substantially there, as well.\"",
  "Then why did you name it, in the complaint, as the defendant?",
  "Then you'll be left without -- if you've named the wrong defendant, then you have a suit against no defendant. It seems to me you are automatically dismissed. You didn't substitute another defendant.",
  "And how about joint appendix 239 and 275, both of which say that Franzen was not a partner in any entity responsible for managing the apartments in question?",
  "Then there's no defendant.",
  "But you named Lincoln as the defendant. And I'm looking at your second amended complaint, which says, \"Lincoln,\" on information and belief, \"is a corporation with its headquarters in Dallas, and it is the developer and manager of the property.\" That's what you alleged in your complaint. You allege that Lincoln was the manager -- Lincoln, whose Texas corporation was the manager of the property in question. Now, would you -- you're saying that that was wrong, and you should have sued somebody else, and the Court should cure that for you? That's -- it's really bizarre.",
  "But they -- let me stop you on that \"real party,\" because, as has been pointed out, the \"real party in interest\" concept, as a procedural matter, comes out of rule 17, and it's talking about plaintiffs, that suits have to be brought in the name of the real party so that the defendant isn't in a situation where he's sued one day by plaintiff A, and is not home free when plaintiff B comes in with the identical complaint. So, it was originally designed with, Who is the proper party, the assignee or the assignor? That's what real party -- that's what the concept is familiarly about. Who is the proper plaintiff, not defendant?",
  "Rule 17 is about joinder of parties; it's not about jurisdiction.",
  "So, that's -- it's something different. It's a -- it's a whole other animal, because \"real party in interest,\" as used in the Federal rules, is a device -- is a joinder device, is in the joinder rules. Now you're saying, \"Ah, but there's some other real-party concept out there that has to do with jurisdiction.\"",
  "I thought Carden was about: In a partnership, does every partner's citizenship count?",
  "There wasn't any question that -- that it was the right or the -- that the defendant was a wrong defendant or that --",
  "But we don't know --",
  "-- who that party is. Let's go back to your -- when you started this case, you said that you would, on discovery -- this is what you said in -- at the time of your initial complaint -- determine if there is an additional defendant, or defendants, who should be named as parties. What discovery did you pursue to find out if there was an additional defendant, or defendants, who should be named as parties?",
  "Mr. Joseph, do I take it that the essence of your position is that a removing defendant, if that removing party is a corporation, must disclose all affiliates that may have been involved in the -- in the occurrence that the plaintiff might have, but failed, to name as a defendant, that a defendant -- although, on the surface, there's complete diversity, a defendant corporation must, in order to remove, identify all subsidiaries and affiliates who might have been sued, as well?",
  "But defendant never took the position, \"Not me.\"",
  "Defendant said --",
  "-- \"Yes, we are the responsible party.\"",
  "Yes, but I also --",
  "-- pointed out it's --",
  "So, you would say Clemons should come out the other way, given the current state of the Mississippi statute?",
  "They're not totally different, because one of them is special circumstances.",
  "And it distinguishes those from circumstances of the crime, and then it -- then it says, \"and special circumstances.\" So, it seems to me that \"special circumstances\" is a discrete factor, different from \"circumstances of the crime.\"",
  "In other words, you said that the error was harmless under Chapman, the higher standard --",
  "-- and that the California court so ruled. And if that ruling is correct, then you would never get to any Brecht standard; the Federal court would have to say California applied the proper harmless- error analysis, and that's the end of the case.",
  "So the -- so the second question, once we get past weighing, is whether California, in fact, did do what Chapman said. Is that right?",
  "Well, the problem --",
  "-- here is that the California Supreme Court decision is rather skimpy once you get to harmless error.",
  "What was -- the argument was that, in California, the burden of proof is on --",
  "-- the defendant, instead of on the prosecutor for the harmless-error inquiry?",
  "Are you saying -- because this can get pretty complex -- simply, that because special circumstances are a discreet category, that, in effect, what went -- what the court is instructing is double counting that factor? It's a factor in all the circumstances how the -- how the crime was committed is a factor of all circumstances; and then, in addition, it is a special circumstance. So it is, in effect, counted twice. Is that the essence of your argument?",
  "But isn't it the California Supreme Court that has to do the harmless error, in the first instance? And here, this is puzzling about this case. Defendant said, at trial, to his lawyer, \"Don't argue any mitigators. I'd just as soon die as spend my life in prison.\" So, no mitigators were argued. So then, even if you have a wrong aggravator, you have other aggravators that are right, and there's nothing to weigh against those correct aggregators. So, what mitigation is there to weigh against the valid aggravators?",
  "Well, what were those? I see that sentence. The jury --",
  "Yes, but what were the mitigating factors from the evidence presented at the guilt phase?",
  "But now you're getting into what has sometimes been called \"residual doubt.\" You point out that a juror asked, \"What if it were not unanimous?\" And you also pointed out that there was an earlier hung jury in this case. But you didn't argue, below, that residual doubt counts. It's one thing to say, \"If defendant argues it, the court should take it into account.\" But there was no such argument made in this case.",
  "At any time.",
  "But in the trial court, it wasn't, because that's when it would count.",
  "Didn't -- wasn't there a statement that he was indifferent between death and life imprisonment?",
  "You mean aggravating --",
  "Do you agree that such residual-doubt factors are appropriately considered if the defendant didn't raise them? I mean, the question of -- that, yes, the jury found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but maybe there's something that makes that determination doubtful.",

I have to bring it here. I can't bring it separately. Or at least a setoff.\" I mean, that was understood, that a party over whom the court would not have jurisdiction otherwise, is amendable to the court's jurisdiction to the extent of a counterclaim or a setoff. So, I don't see why (b) and (c) are not discrete from (a). (b) and (c) are implementing the idea of a setoff.

So, we don't have a picture of what you call \"mix and match,\" but two dealers, one consistently getting higher concessions, and one consistently getting lower, and, therefore, missing out on sales or making sales at a very low profit.

We have to take what was a later statute, RFRA, to which the Controlled Substances Act is made subject by Congress.

How can there be, given the situation with peyote and, \"We're just like the Native American Church in that regard\"?",

And the trial court also said there is an additional factor, and that is this charge, that was intimidating even if it didn't have death on it, wasn't presented to Blake immediately. It could have been presented when he was put in the cell, initially. So, there were those factors. Those are relevant, are they not, to the character of what Blake said?",

And there was also no explanation, after they left Blake in his cell, Reese just having said, \"I bet you want to talk to us now, huh?\" -- there was nothing said to assure Blake that that was not a \"You'd better talk to us, or you're going to be in trouble\" kind of thing. There was just the statement by Blake and another Miranda warning. All of those things, the judge said, weighed on his mind, and he reached the conclusion that the Government hadn't sustained its burden on the basis of those factors. So, is that clearly erroneous?

I mean, there's -- none of this is in doubt, where this language in 50 comes from. It comes from a need to adjust to the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment. Isn't that so?",

Now, that's what you're -- that's the rule you're asking for?",
  "But there's such a different in the context. The Title VII plaintiff gets fees after a defendant has been found a law- violator. And, here, a defendant has a right to access to a Federal court. And the statute -- you are emphasizing text. If one looks at the Omnibus Act out of which this provision came, we see two removal-friendly pieces in it, right? Because, no longer do you have to verify a removal petition; you just do a simple notice. And that's one. And there was another. Oh, yes. Yes, you don't have to put up a bond anymore if you want to remove.",
  "-- think we do have three, if you count Fogerty, because you have the Christianson, which is the most defendant-friendly. And then you have Piggie Park, which is the most plaintiff-friendly. And then you have Fogerty, which is been -- has been called the multifactor --",
  "-- test.",
  "Well, as it was just mentioned, \"multifactor,\" in a footnote, it said it would be neutral. I think the big point in Fogerty was that it was going to apply in both directions, be neutral as between plaintiff and defendant.",
  "You've given us, in your multifactor test, you said, \"objectively reasonable basis to remove.\" And another factor might be that the plaintiff delayed in moving to remand. What other factors, besides the \"objectively reasonable basis to remove\" and the plaintiff's delay?",
  "Why --",
  "-- not, then, just say \"objectively reasonable basis to remove\"? That's a one -- one standard.",
  "If the law was so anti- removal, then one would expect there would be some kind of threshold check once you get to district court. But the removal process is: you file your notice that you're removing. That's it. There it goes. And the district court doesn't do any kind of initial screening to let it in. It just gets there --",
  "-- by rapid transit.",
  "General Clement, in two respects, it -- I think you have addressed the cost concern by comparing, in your brief, the Federal experience, which is subject to these controls, and you said it wasn't an inordinate expense, but you also pointed out that every State prison system is subject to the Rehabilitation Act, because they get Federal funds. Is there a difference between the obligation that State systems would have under the Rehabilitation Act and under the ADA?",
  "And the --",
  "-- damage remedies available under the Rehabilitation Act is --",
  "Damages are available?",
  "It applies -- it applies to State prisons, as well, because of its Spending --",
  "-- Clause legislation.",
  "Have Courts of Appeals approved those determinations?",
  "And how many has it -- in the District Courts, how many have been rejected when it's something like television or recreation?",
  "Well, before you do --",
  "-- as I understand it, and as the Solicitor General confirmed, you are subject to the Rehabilitation Act, where the substantive scope is the same. So, what -- you are saying, in the prison context, this is undue, but you all -- you are already subject to it under one Act. And how has that been working out?",
  "But maybe in the prison setting, the lower courts would pay some attention to the Court's recent decision in Cutter against Wilkinson, where the Court made it very clear that a high level of deference -- even dealing with a strict- scrutiny standard for religious freedom -- that a high level of deference would be paid to prison administrators' judgment of what safety and discipline requires inside a prison. Wouldn't that -- wouldn't that carry over to the ADA, were it to apply?",
  "Do you think that the --",
  "-- that if the prison explained what their practices were, in terms of the needs of security, that a lower court will then say, \"Well, never mind that. The Supreme Court just said it. We don't have to enforce it\"? I don't think there would be that kind of lawlessness.",
  "It's interesting --",
  "-- that you cite that case, in terms of Justice Scalia's remark, \"Watch what we do, not what we say.\" Cleburne was a remarkable case in that respect. It purported to apply rational- basis review, but the plaintiffs won.",
  "But if you think --",
  "-- if you think of the -- any conceivable basis -- doesn't even have to be offered if the -- if it's, indeed, the rational-basis test. It has been suggested that something more is going on in Cleburne, and, I think, in all candor, one would have to say so. Because if you looked at the rational-basis test that had gone before, this one looked no better, no worse.",
  "Can we go back, Mr. Castanias, to Justice Scalia's question about the core concerns? And we have been told by Respondents that their core concerns are sanitation, mobility, protection from physical injury. Now, that sounds to me like constitutional Eighth Amendment heartland.",
  "But that's something -- where would we -- we would just pick that number, that --",
  "Yes. Because that's a normal appeal period?",
  "In -- even if, as he alleged, he was unable to do anything in --",
  "This is a layperson. He said, \"I tripped in the intermediate appellate court, because I didn't do any research. And so, I wanted to do better, but they gave me a job where, during the hours that the library was open\" --",
  "-- \"I had to be at work. And that's why it took me all this time.\"",
  "Now, is that -- suppose the prison locks down someone and says, \"You can't go to the library.\"",
  "Amend just for California, when the system is working fine, all the other States that do have the timelines?",
  "To do what? What would it say?",
  "Mr. Frey, in practice, is there, as there often is for a corporation, a divergence between those two places? You have many corporations incorporated in Delaware with their principal place of business, say, in Michigan. In the case of a national bank, is there that similar difference that what you call its main office or where it's chartered is different from where it has its principal place of business?",
  "Mr. Frey, remind me of the State bank. A State bank is, for Federal diversity purposes, a citizen of two -- two places or only one?",
  "So it would be the --",
  "-- its place of incorporation and --",
  "-- principal place of business if it's different.",
  "In a venue statute, as opposed to a subject matter jurisdiction statute, the venue means where, where -- what particular court. Subject matter jurisdiction is which court system. They're entirely geared to entirely different things.",
  "What about its principal place of business if it's different from its main office?",
  "Principal place of business.",
  "So the main office is it, like 1332 before the '58 amendment.",
  "But you did say 1332(c) does not apply to the national bank. It's only one location.",
  "No. The question is why would Congress -- let's assume we have a choice between two readings. Why would Congress want to give the State courts -- the State banks -- State banks -- greater access to Federal courts than it gives national banks? What earthly reason would there be for Congress wanting to do that?",
  "But not with every State with which it has a close nexus.",
  "So, in other words, the partnership -- we have a corporation where it's incorporated and Congress said a principal place of business. We have a partnership where each partner is located. I don't know of any instance where for subject matter jurisdiction, that is, which court system you go to, as distinguished from personal jurisdiction or venue, you have a notion that someone is a citizen of every place where it does the business. Is there -- is there any other example? It's certainly not true of a partnership. It isn't true of -- of a corporation. Is there any other entity that would, for subject matter jurisdiction purposes --",
  "Its members.",
  "Yes, but the question that I asked you is, in the realm of subject matter jurisdiction, that is, which court system, Federal or State, as distinguished from where can I grab this person for personal jurisdiction purposes, what are my venue choices, is there any other example in all of title 28 where, for subject matter jurisdiction purposes, this -- every place where it's located counts?",
  "In South Carolina. It's not -- it's not as though you're being sent to some other place. The only question is whether they would have access to the Federal court. But as far as personal jurisdiction is concerned, you have it in South Carolina.",
  "But it would still be in South Carolina.",
  "And there is -- in fact, there's no immunity. That's what makes this different. Suppose the Bivens action had been brought first. The officers would not have been immune from suit. It's not like an officer who has qualified immunity and doesn't depend upon the suit order. Here, there would have been no immunity at all if you'd sued the officers directly and not brought that Federal Tort Claims Act suit first.",
  "It's hard to accept that argument given that if the lawyer had sued in the reverse order, there would be the same morale. All the rest would follow. So here it's -- it's a question of the lawyer brought the wrong lawsuit first, and the attack on the morale -- there's no difference if a Bivens action had been brought and no other action. Is there any -- why is this morale changed by the Government having gotten the first case dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction with no consideration of the merits at all?",
  "What was the harassment that this employee experienced in the -- in the FTCA claim that was dismissed?",
  "Did that -- did that involve the employee or it was just legal argument involving lawyers representing the United States?",
  "Could the two claims have been brought together? This is -- if an employee is in an uncertain situation, doesn't know if the FTCA act applies, it certainly doesn't want to be without any defendant for conduct of the kind that -- that this complaint charges. Could such an employee say I want to bring my Tort Claims Act against the United States, but I'd like to have in that same lawsuit, in case the court says it comes under an exception, my Bivens claim? Would it be possible to bring those suits together?",
  "I'm -- I'm asking --",
  "-- does the Government have a position on that, whether you can combine a suit against the United States under the Tort Claims Act with a suit against the individual officers under Bivens.",
  "But I want you to go back before we get to a judgment. Can such a suit be brought?",
  "Could this lawyer have brought the FTCA act complaint and pled in the alternative the Bivens claim?",
  "Your theory would cover the case where the FTCA claim drops out because the employee didn't file the administrative claim within the -- what is it? 6 months?",
  "But don't they have a short span where they have to bring that administrative claim?",
  "And the suit is tossed out because one of those deadlines was met. It would follow, I think, under your reasoning that there could be no subsequent Bivens claim.",
  "Well, not -- there -- there are exceptions to the statute of limitations. You could have tolling, and there are exceptions to a preclusion doctrine. So those doctrines aren't complete in the sense that they are without exceptions.",
  "Well, you would at the end of the road. If -- if you go to the Bivens claim and if the plaintiffs prevail, you could still appeal from that and say that that suit was barred. It should never have gone forward.",
  "There's no question that it would be -- it doesn't die if you don't have an interlocutory review. It's there but you've wasted a lot of time going through the whole trial to find out the answer.",
  "The district judge said I'm not going to give you 1292(b) certification, but -- but there's Cohen against Beneficial out there. Why don't you try that route? It was the district judge who -- who mentioned that possibility, wasn't it?",
  "But I think the district -- the district judge was aware of Cohen against Beneficial, and I think referred to it. Maybe I'm -- I don't remember correctly.",
  "No, but he mentioned that there was -- he mentioned Cohen.",
  "Perhaps you should go on now to the question, assuming that it is immediately appealable.",
  "But we -- this case is about the interpretation of 2676, as we took it. And before your time runs out, if we can get to the nub of your difference, your reading and the Government's, you say judgment in 2676 means judgment on the merits, and the Government says it means any judgment. So to buy your interpretation, we would have to put a caret mark after judgment and put on the merits. But the statute doesn't say on the merits.",
  "A Bivens suit is pretty hard to prove, a lot harder than proving a case of negligence.",
  "What about 2679(b)(2) of the Westfall Act which says the Government doesn't get substituted for the employee in a Bivens claim? Westfall -- the Congress was -- was quite concerned, it seems, with preserving an action brought for violation of the Constitution of the United States.",
  "Mr. Landau --",
  "Mr. Landau, maybe this -- this is a point your -- the respondent makes. Prima Paint talks about section 4 and it says, with respect to matters within the jurisdiction of the Federal courts. So the answer to everything you said could be, fine, if this were proceeding in, say, the Southern District of Florida, but it’s in a State court. And Prima Paint just spoke about procedure in Federal court.",
  "You also run into a problem with the -- some States classify a contract as voidable and other States for that same ground make it void. So at least you would have -- you would lose the uniformity if you’ve made the distinction between those two.",
  "What would be the issues for the arbitrator in this case? Is there anything other than was it -- was this interest usurious? The dispute between the parties -- we’re not told what the issues are that would be subject to arbitration.",
  "Mr. Bland.",
  "Mr. Bland, some State may say fraud in the inducement is void. These -- these are classifications that States make. These are labels that the State puts on them. And you are introducing vast disuniformity if you say that the line to draw is between void and voidable. You are forced into that because the Prima Paint case dealt with voidable. So you -- that you -- you are drawing a line between void and voidable which shifts from State to State.",
  "But if you open the door -- if you open the door -- public policy has been called an unruly horse. All you have to do is open the door and you will have litigation in court, and then the court will decide what the arbitrator would other -- otherwise decide.",
  "You’re giving the end result. How many cases have the lawyers gone into court and said, court, strike down this contract because it’s against public policy? Courts may reject many of those, but --",
  "If we take --",
  "-- if we take, Mr. Bland, what you said so -- the words transaction involving commerce, but a contract -- okay. So you spoke about void contracts. Well, what about there’s not enough consideration, things that go to the formation? So this contract was never formed. So --",
  "So we’re going far -- far beyond a void subject matter like usury. But you could say there -- there wasn’t sufficient consideration. There was no mutuality or things that go to the formation of a contract.",
  "Are you saying then if this case, the case that was brought in Florida, had been brought or removed in -- more likely removed because there was diversity, removed to the Federal court, the Federal court should do just what the Florida Supreme Court did? Or would the Federal court say, well, we’ve got our instructions from Prima Paint? It says excise the arbitration clause. If that’s okay, we decide the other questions.",
  "You said this was an issue for the court. Was there an alternate forum in that case? Was it an arbitration case?",
  "It's not a --",
  "As I understand the respondent's position, it's not the component. They're not arguing that. So you're answering a hypothetical case that isn't presented here. And also, respondent says that we are talking only about patents where there is a successful tie. So leave out all those cases where I have a patent and it's never produced a penny, and somehow I can make mileage out of that.",
  "There was a -- a point that you were in the process of answering. The -- the argument is made that this tying product had such clout that you were able to extract not twice but three times the price for the tied product. And you were saying no to even double the price.",
  "But why can Congress --",
  "May I just ask your point on that? You are giving -- your main argument is there are good reasons to retain this presumption. But then you said even if there aren't, leave it to Congress. The Court created this rule, the market power rule, not Congress. Why, when we're dealing with a Court-created rule, should we say, well, the Court has had it in play for 60 years, so it's the legislature's job to fix it up, instead of the Court correcting its own erroneous way?",
  "But, your opinion -- that's the real problem here for the doctor who is on the line. And you said the lawyer would say, oh, you've got this defense of -- what do you call it harm -­",
  "Competing harms, a defense -­ I think that a lawyer who cares about his client would say, defense is not what we want. What we want is there is no claim, not that you have to put up a defense and maybe the attorney general will give us a letter saying that we come under that defense. Wouldn't a careful lawyer say, what you need to be protected is that there is no claim for doing what you're doing?",
  "How would it be as-applied? Look at your reply brief at page 3. And you've made it very clear, and I think that it is helpful that you did, that there could be this pre-enforcement action by doctors who would not have to wait until faced with an actual medical emergency to bring the suit. You've talking about this small category of cases, but I take it from what you have read -- what the lines I've just read, that you envision a doctor who says, sooner or later, I'm going to have such a case. Right now, I don't know and I can't know until it's too late to come to any court, so I'm going to bring this pre-enforcement which you characterized as-applied. But I don't see how its as-applied, if if the physician just says, as you put it, I don't have to wait until faced with an actual medical emergency to bring this suit. So what is the relief, what is the lawsuit that you envision would be proper?",
  "Could you do that as a class action?",
  "What is the circumstance? All you said here is there coule be a pre-enforcement challenge by doctors who would not have to wait until faced with an actual medical emergency.",
  "Yes, exactly.",
  "Then I think what you're saying essentially is that the First Circuit was concerned with this category, wanted to give pre-enforcement relief to the physician, so what they did was write except that they should have said this statute is not enforceable where there is a risk to the woman's health and it cannot be applied in any such cases. Where there is a risk to the health, then the statute is okay.",
  "You've used this word severance now twice. Severance is I excised a clause from the statute, but you're not asking for that. It's not severance. There is no provision to be severed here. It's putting a caret mark and adding something to it. Not taking out any provision, but putting in an additional provision.",
  "The end of the statute doesn't say that. The end of that provision says sever a provision.",
  "General Clement, there is usually great caution on the part of the Court from tampering with the statute. So excision is one thing. You just drop a provision. That's not possible here. The Court has been extremely reluctant about caret marks, which is what -- there is no problem with what the legislature did. It just didn't do enough. So the court would have to add a provision. Not subtract. There is nothing to subtract. There's an addition and courts have been reluctant to do that. They feel much more comfortable cutting something out than putting something in.",
  "Nobody asked them to do anything other than that.",
  "So why wouldn't it be entirely adequate to protect what you're concerned about to say this New Hampshire statute is unconstitutional to the extent that it fails to provide an exception for situations where there is imminent danger to health, and then all those immediate dangers to health situations would be left unregulated. The statute doesn't reach them. But nonemergency cases would continue to be governed by the statute. Why couldn't -- in other words, why wasn't that the appropriate judgment for the First Circuit to have entered in this case, to say statutes fine for nonemergency cases, but for emergency cases, there is effectively no law?",
  "But you wouldn't have -- it would be that the emergency is not regulated. The private doctors can act in a medical emergency. They are not controlled by any legislation.",
  "If the model of this case, is doctors come to court, doesn't have to have an actual patient class action and the court says the statute cannot be applied to a medical necessity, period. No fancy frills of adding another things which courts generally don't do. But then there would be no regulation of medical emergencies. Why isn't that what -- doesn't that fit the pattern of the case you've brought and couldn't the First Circuit have done that and then you would have no complaint about the rest of the statute?",
  "Yes, I know that.",
  "Yes, but there was a theory that was put to the jury -- and it's right there on the special interrogatories -- one category was violent acts that obstruct commerce with no connection at all to extortion. That was there. And I have a question about your characterization of what the Seventh Circuit did. It was puzzled. It says, \"Extortion, they all go.\" But here are these four that don't involve extortion, and there's no ruling from the Court on those. Was the Court supposed to assume that the Court made a question -- decided a question of statutory interpretation by silence?",
  "The question is whether the Court should rule on it, as in a matter of first decision. We are a Court of review. There was no determination of whether the Hobbs Act included such a category in the Seventh Circuit. So, the difficulty, the impediment to addressing your position is that however strong it may be, it wasn't resolved below, so why shouldn't we follow the natural order that first the District Court speaks, and then the Court of Appeals, and then it comes here?",
  "Why?",
  "Were you --",
  "I'm concerned about your characterization, not only of suggesting that there was some attempt to force a particular decision, but I'm reading the Seventh Circuit's remand to the District Court. It went through your argument, which it said was a substantial one, that no change was intended in the codification. And it said, \"While these revisions were intended to be formal stylistic changes, it is not beyond the realm of the possible that the revisers may have made certain substantive changes.\" That doesn't sound like they were ruling on it definitively, but they were tipping their hand. \"Not beyond the realm of the possible.\" That was --",
  "They asked the District Court to resolve it. They said the District Court should resolve it in the first instance, and then they would review it, presumably.",
  "Even though two U.S. attorneys, years back, did predicate cases on there being a discrete crime of obstructing commerce through violent means.",
  "Ms. Blatt, your time is almost over, so, on the injunction part, what remedies are available to the United States under your reading of the provision? Injunctive relief, yes. What about -- is there any monetary relief that the United States can seek under RICO?",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Chemerinsky, if we turn from what this Court did, or did not, think about last time around to what those four counts were, would I look to find out what were those four acts of violence that remain in the case? I could not find, in any of the papers before us, any specific definition of what those acts of violence were. I mean, the jury was given -- I don't know what -- was it a dozen possibilities? And they found four. But which four, we have no idea.",
  "But he -- but wasn't this tried to a jury? That was a jury that made those findings.",
  "And the jury is no longer sitting.",
  "He knows that there were four acts. He knows that he -- under his instructions, the jury could pick 12. How could he know which four the jury homed in on?",
  "But does it -- when what turns on that finding is injunctive relief, the judge might very well be influenced by what those particular acts were. He might say one set of four was not adequate to issue this injunction, but another set of four would be. And we just don't know -- we don't know what those acts were. The jury is not to be called back. The Seventh Circuit said \"no more evidence.\" So, if we get down to those four acts, how can we say those are sufficient to uphold an injunction, when we don't even know what the acts were?",
  "But the Seventh Circuit in its most recent expression said, \"It may well be that the judge will decide that those 4 predicate acts\" -- as opposed to 121 going in, 4 -- \"were not sufficient to support certainly a nationwide injunction, but perhaps not any injunction.\"",
  "Mr. Chemerinsky, the problem that I have, and Justice Breyer expressed, is, we have the reviser's notes that suggest, \"I was just getting rid of extra words. I was making this a tighter provision.\" And there's not anything to indicate that Congress considered any change in the substance of the Act.",
  "But here's a -- the reviser telling us, \"I did this, and I did this to clean up the Act, to make it less wordy.\"",
  "As you read it, can a private party get a preliminary injunction?",
  "So, a private party could get an -- not only permanent, but preliminary --",
  "-- injunction.",
  "They made the assumption that this Court has an obligation to reason why, and there was no reason why given as to those four counts.",
  "I thought your position, union. Justice Breyer is presenting a scenario where he asks the union and the union says we’ve got better things to do with our money.",
  "But I think your position is he doesn’t have to ask at all. He can go directly into Federal court under 1331.",
  "So your difference -- what’s separating you and Whitman, it seems, is a question of timing. The action that you’re describing that would come at the end, after he’s used the administrative process, is the same one that he is seeking to bring at the front end. That is, it’s a 1331 action --",
  "I thought your position on action, that it was just an instruction to the Secretary. Maybe I misread your position on the",
  "I thought that the Government’s position was there’s no right of action under that statute.",
  "But that was on the view that it was an exclusive remedy. The -- the statute is not written in -- in any way as an exhaustion requirement. It says you’ve got a minor grievance -- issue. You go through the grievance procedure. There is no judicial review at the end of the line. So you would be converting something that Congress wrote to be an exclusive remedy into an exhaustion requirement.",
  "So you -- you have picked one way to do that. You say go through the grievance procedure. If there’s a constitutional question remaining, if you haven’t been satisfied, then you bring the action in court. Another way to say is, well, as long as we’re making this up, why not allow the -- the action to proceed at once in court, but then the court to say, I’m going to abstain while you go through the grievance procedure.",
  "Yes, I --",
  "But -- but here, that’s not this case because he said, and when I complained, they did it again.",
  "Am I right that the statute as written says you don’t have any judicial review for these kinds of actions? You go through the grievance procedure, win or lose. That’s it. There is no judicial review.",
  "The statute does not provide for judicial review --",
  "But there is no such -- that -- that’s very far from this case, General Lockyer.",
  "I did -- I did have one --",
  "Can we -- can we go back --",
  "She was certainly -- she was certainly wrong on the law. When she -- when the gender question came up, she said, well, that's not a suspect category, and she seemed to be -- her notion was that it was okay to aim for a jury that had an equal number of men and women. And it was -- she seemed to be thinking the same thing with regard to age too. I agree with you she didn’t withdraw it, but was -- the reasonable explanation was we don’t want too many young people here. So I’m going to allow some, but I want older people to dominate. But the gender -- she had to be told by the judge Batson applies to gender. That -- that seemed -- that seemed strange to me that -- that 2 years after, she would not know.",
  "Why?",
  "What was the -- on the -- on the eye-roll, which I thought also the -- the prosecutor said that she turned her head. So it may be that she was out of the vision of the -- the judge even if he had been looking. I don’t see that you have any evidence to rebut it. You said, well, it was rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. There was no evidence. There was no evidentiary hearing.",
  "I thought there was another -- another. Wasn’t there another minority woman on the -- in the jury panel?",
  "Well, she might in the future, if she’s got a job as a prosecutor in this court. So she’s certainly going to be concerned with her reputation, her integrity before the court.",
  "What’s wrong with the explanation, as far as youth is concerned, is that she didn’t want to across-the-board strike young people, but she just wanted to come up with a jury that had dominantly older people. So that wouldn’t mean that she’s withdrawing youth. It’s just that she’s saying it isn’t an absolute with me.",
  "Well, what’s -- one -- one point could be I don’t want too many young people, so I’m going to exercise some peremptories to make sure that the jury is dominantly older people. What’s wrong with that?",
  "Well, she did. Number 6 was white. Right?",
  "And youth was a factor there. There may have been other factors, but youth was certainly a factor in that case.",
  "But that -- that was so obviously a slip, and Judge Hall pointed that out in her dissent. Defense counsel too confused -- was confused on the numbers. Obviously, it -- the -- the prosecutor wasn’t trying to say a grandmother is going to be excused -- is going to be struck because she’s young.",
  "General --",
  "General --",
  "-- Clement, do I understand, with respect to that brief that offered a statutory interpretation to avoid a constitutional question, your answer is, that would be an unreasonable interpretation of the statute that we now have? And if we're talking about a predecessor statute in 1968, from the Vietnam days, that -- this would have been a highly academic question, because there weren't any such policies in any law schools with respect to recruiting.",
  "That would --",
  "-- be rather farfetched. The pitch that's being made is an equality pitch, that we are teaching our students equality, the equal stature of all people. So, I think that your example does not fit --",
  "General Clement, can you be affirmative now? Because we have an example, from Justice Stevens, which is the Yale example. The -- it was the main campus, instead of the law school. What ­ - the recruiter is there. He's in the same room that other recruiters use. What can the law faculty do to disassociate itself from -- to say that, \"We don't tolerate discrimination of any kind\"? What can the law school do, concretely, while the recruiter is in the room?",
  "And you would take, Mr. Rosenkranz, that same position. If this was not special to law faculties -- I mean, we're told that the recruiters could go to the main campus; most of these places, the restriction is limited to the law faculties. Suppose it was universitywide policy that we do not give equal access to military recruiters. I think your argument says it doesn't matter if it's special to the law school or the whole university. Do I understand it correctly?",
  "Does it compel the speech of a private actor when the Government says, \"Colleges and Universities, you are not going to get Federal money if you discriminate on grounds of race or gender. And we don't care what your private attitude may be, we will refuse to contract, we will debar you from future contracts, if you don't -- not only say, 'We won't discriminate,' but have an affirmative action plan.\" You know that is not hypothetical. This was the U.S. policy in the early '70s.",
  "Would you require any accommodation -- I mean, you have said, \"It's up to the faculty to choose which causes to assist\" -- I think you put it that way, or one of the amici did -- \"and which to resist.\" And you've already told me that this happens to be the law school, could be the whole university. Could the law faculty, or the university, take the position, \"We're not going to -- we don't like your message, and we are not going to let you have any of our facilities. We're not going give you the room on the main campus. Just a total bar\"?",
  "No, but a school --",
  "-- a school, as a matter of its own policy says, \"We don't like discrimination, and we're not going to give discriminators access to any of our facilities, period.\"",
  "I'm asking --",
  "-- you, Is there any obligation, since you've said there is a compelling State interest -- compelling Government interest in recruiting, is there some obligation to accommodate, or could the faculty just say, \"We choose the causes that we assist and the ones we resist\"?",

  "Did you say there is or --",
  "Do corporations have a color?",
  "Are you saying this is a matter of Federal contract law, common law, Federal common law, are -- or are you saying you go State by State, in which case 1981 is some places it will be third party beneficiary, some it won't?",
  "It wouldn't just be an argument. You'd have to amend your complaint because it wasn't set out in the complaint.",
  "Was there any overlap? The -- what damages could the corporation JWM have collected under -- had it brought a 1981 suit?",
  "But those contracts --",
  "But you'd have to concede at a minimum that now that the corporation has settled the breach of contract claim, that to the extent that the corporation could have recovered under 1981, that's gone too because those two claims were intimately related, and you would be precluded from bringing such a claim. So to the extent that there's an overlap, you face a res judicata bar.",
  "So they -- the Ninth Circuit's view is there are two potential plaintiffs in this situation. Both can sue and one gets -- the damages are not identical. That's --",
  "The shareholder can sue. The sole shareholder can sue. The corporation can sue. Both have 1981 claims. It's not either/or.",
  "They both have 1981 claims, but the damages are different in the case of the individual than in the case of the corporation.",
  "If it fits, it's because of some cases. So -- because this whole area, 1981, didn't take off until Runyon against McCrary. So we're starting with what? 1976. So to -- to flesh out what that claim is, you must be relying on some decisions of this Court when you talk about dignitary damages.",
  "But I thought that didn't go into anything. That was a two-page per curiam, and it was just was there a claim. And it didn't --",
  "I thought that that was about does the -- does the act cover religion or -- or does it cover that situation, or is it limited to race, or does anti-semitism count as race. I thought that's what was all that was decided.",
  "Well, I don't see anything in the opinion about -- I just see the issue before the Court was does this come under the heading race.",
  "If I -- if I understand what the situation is, there is no death penalty in Kansas as a result of this decision.",
  "Has there been any movement in the legislature to change the law so you won't be in this situation where there is no death penalty?",

  "There is a brief from the Kansas law professors, and this is the instruction from the Kleypas case?",
  "If the aggravators are not outweighed by the mitigators, you shall impose the death penalty, not that you may, not that you can, but that you shall impose the death penalty. This is the duty you were sworn to uphold. Shows command. It means must. That's -- is that the type of instruction --",
  "-- the type of argument?",
  "Without any clue --",
  "-- without any clue whether there's a relevance test? I mean, here we're talking about alibi evidence. If the determination of guilt is final, then alibi is irrelevant at the penalty stage. That's why I found that statute so puzzling, that the jury doesn't have a clue. They're told, \"Everything from the guilt phase comes in, you can consider,\" but it doesn't sort out, doesn't even tell them, relevance.",
  "No, I wasn't suggesting anything other than what Justice Scalia said, but I was just curious about this statute that tells the jury, \"You can consider everything,\" and gives them no guidance, because some of it might be quite inappropriate for them to consider.",
  "But there's -- used on the other side and as a policy model, the model penal code, I think, says it's okay. It -- not really that it's okay. It should be considered.",

  "-- that it's up to the States, I take it, but it's not compelled by the eighth amendment.",
  "And your --",
  "-- response is that he wasn't there. It's one thing to say, \"It was intentional, but you didn't prove deliberate.\" The other thing is to say, \"He wasn't there. He didn't commit the crime in the first place.\" Those are two quite different things.",
  "Can you put it -- make it concrete for this case? Because I don't see that there would be -- I mean, if the action is intentional, and the question was whether it was deliberate, what planning here would have gone on in some different timeframe?",
  "I still don't -- I still don't understand. You say that there was -- there had to be proof for conviction and guilt -- of guilt of intentional conduct. And this is a simple story that's told: they wanted to go to one house, too many lights on in that house; they were frustrated, they wanted to go someplace else, so they came upon the aunt and uncle of the defendant's former girlfriend.",

  "But it does seem that this court was operating on the assumption that the eighth amendment required it to let in this alibi and other evidence.",

  "Mr. Moran, would you clarify an answer you gave to Justice O'Connor at the outset of the argument? You said there is no statutory right to get a no-knock warrant. But did you say, as a matter of case law and practice, that can be done in Michigan?",

  "In the courts that have allowed this action to go forward, has the rationale been that there is no other effective deterrent to ignoring or violating the knock-and-announce rule?",

  "Then your --",
  "-- position is that you never -- if you have a warrant, then you can seize what the warrant lists. So, if you have a warrant, then there is never a reason that the police would have to knock and announce, because the warrant gives them independent authority to enter. That seems to be what you're saying, that as long as you have a warrant, there -- the knock-and-announce does not have to be complied with.",
  "Mr. --",
  "Mr. Kneedler, may -- would you clarify just one point about this probable cause? There was a grand jury that indicted this man, and then there was a trial judge who said, I'm throwing this out at the close of the Government's case. There is not enough evidence here to convict this man. Are you saying that as long as the grand jury indicts, there can be no Bivens claim because in order to indict, the grand jury would have had to find probable cause?",
  "Well, tell me about now, not at the common law.",
  "But the grand jury did find probable cause. So what would the plaintiff have to show to overcome -- to -- to negate that finding of probable cause?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, the D.C. Circuit, looking at this case, looking at the record closely, typed it one in which the evidence of retaliation was strong and probable cause weak. This is on 28a of the appendix to the petition for cert. That was the appraisal of the D.C. Circuit panel. And I think you've been arguing that that is not the case, but at least for our purposes at this posture, don't we -- shouldn't we accept that that is the picture here, weak evidence of probable cause, strong indications of retaliation?",
  "But we're not talking about prosecutors there --",
  "How about the judge granting a motion to quit at the close of the Government's evidence? Why isn't that objective?",
  "I wasn't --",
  "Your opponent says -- says there is no probable cause requirement. You are now on there's no objective test. It's all subjective. I suggest that there could be an objective test. This is not going to the probable cause question. Objective test? Was this case thrown out at the close of the Government's evidence?",
  "Then what did it mean -- I think you said it in your brief -- that there -- both brands were sold exclusively by Equilon after the joint venture created -- was created. Each venturer maintains its own marketing strategy. What was the marketing strategy that each venturer, Shell and Texaco, separately maintained?",
  "Citizens -- Citizens Publishing did not have a joint venture that had advance approval from the FTC. It had --",
  "And I think that makes a big difference. I mean, the FTC blessed this and said it was okay. They asked for certain adjustments. Those were made. One of them was not, that you had to maintain a differential in the price between Texaco and Shell.",
  "But the FTC, which is the expert agency, said we don't think this joint venture is an antitrust violation. Don't we owe some respect to that determination, which was absent in Citizens Publishing?",
  "May I ask a very naive question? Is -- this is basically the same commodity, gasoline. They have different attitude -- additives, but basically costs the same. Facilities to produce it are the same. Why should they -- should there be from -- now that they're marketing this under one joint venture, why should they make a difference in the price of what is basically the same commodity?",
  "Well, what difference physically is there other than they have different additive -- additives?",
  "One of the briefs said that the reason for that price hike was that there was an explosion in a refinery in California and outages in others and that there was a market-wide price increase. That was in --",
  "So is the answer -- in -- in case the Court does not agree with you, can you then say, I would like to resurrect rule of reason or do you agree with your adversary that -- that that's out of the case because you forfeited it?",
  "The ordinary, routine rule of reason you have waived. Is that so?",
  "At one point- -",
  "Justice Scalia said blood of the victim. You don't contest that this was the blood of the victim. The question is at what point did it get transferred to the jeans.",
  "There's no question about it being someone else's blood.",
  "Will you also cover, because your time is short, if you get through the gateway on your actual innocence contention, what are your constitutional claims that lie behind it? Because I don't think much was said about that in the briefing. What is it that you would -- you would say if you got through the gate?",
  "Ms. Smith, would -- could you focusing on this, what's called a finding, although the district judge himself puts it under conclusions of law, just -- the court concludes that the spillage occurred after the FBI crime laboratory received and tested the evidence. What is the basis, the specific basis, for that conclusion, that it occurred after the FBI tested the evidence?",
  "Yes, but then there was also the evidence that was not disputed, that it was a dry day and that there was no mud at all at the scene of the crime.",
  "I thought that was --",
  "-- that it was agreed that there -- that the site where the body was found, that that was dry, that that was dry ground. I thought there was no dispute about that.",
  "Well, as far as that's concerned, she did testify that there was a car out there.",
  "And the rest of the story doesn't -- doesn't put the defendant House at the time of the crime in a car. He's walking.",
  "But they happened at the same time, didn't they? The --",
  "-- the child testified to what she heard, and I thought she heard a car and someone in a low voice, and then her mother left with that someone.",
  "Isn't it --",
  "What about at the sentencing stage? Justice Kennedy brought it up. The -- the prosecutor didn't emphasize unduly the semen at the -- at the guilt stage but, boy, made a big deal out of it at the sentencing stage.",
  "Where was it in the -- in the joint appendix? I thought it was more than kidnapping.",
  "Said nothing about the semen --",
  "-- at the -- at the sentencing stage?",
  "So you say -- so now it's essentially redundant. Now that 1331 has no jurisdictional amount, no amount in controversy, the jurisdictional provision in title VII is just going over the same territory. It doesn't add or detract. Is that so?",
  "Which is not subject matter jurisdiction, which is what we're concerned with here.",
  "What would you call this? Would you call 15 or more employees an element of your claim that you must prove?",
  "Or there could be an affirmative defense and you're not claiming the latter.",
  "But you're -- you're accepting that it is your burden rather than the employer's to show that the employer had fewer than 15 employees.",
  "How does it -- you -- you told us of your extensive experience. How does the numerosity requirement usually come up? You've accepted that it's an element of your claim rather than an affirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove. So how does it ordinarily come up? Does it -- because defendant answers and asserts that it has fewer than 15 employees?",
  "Mr. Joseffer, maybe you can raise the podium a bit so the microphone works better. The other way.",
  "What -- what about the EEOC having typed the question jurisdictional for administrative processing purposes?",
  "The -- the question was whether the truck drivers counted as employees because if they did, they'd have enough?",
  "There was no -- there was no allegation that the plaintiff was employed by your client?",
  "Do we have the complaint in --",
  "Did it, in fact, come up in that posture in the case? It has already been mentioned that the word jurisdiction has many, too many uses. Did it -- did the question come up in the Indian tribe cases as it did here after the case was fully tried and after there was a jury verdict for the plaintiff?",
  "When -- if -- if it's brought up promptly, it really doesn't matter, does it, whether you label it 12(b)(1) jurisdiction or 12(b)(6), failure to state a claim? It goes out either way. When it is consequential is when you bring it up, as you did here, after you lose on -- at the trial.",
  "May I go back to Zipes? In Zipes, the Court was faced with the -- the word jurisdictional had been appended to the statute of limitations. I think that was true of the way the EEOC spoke of the rigid time limit, that it was mandatory and jurisdictional. And then the Court explained in Zipes that a strict time line doesn't mean that it's jurisdictional. You can have a rule that's rigid, but it doesn't determine subject matter jurisdiction. And that's what Zipes tried to explain. The Court in Zipes was faced with a number of cases that had used that term to describe the time in which you must bring the action, mandatory and jurisdictional.",
  "Yes, but now we know it's -- EEOC has changed.",
  "But why -- now that we do have Zipes, why should the number of employees be treated any differently than that rigid time line in -- in Zipes?",
  "But that was a pendant jurisdiction case. Wasn't Aldinger --",
  "Well, you just used an interesting word because there are litigants who can claim complete immunity from liability, but that immunity, whether it's absolute or qualified, doesn't go to the court's subject matter jurisdiction. It has to be raised in those cases as a defense.",
  "Or leave it to the States that often do cover smaller shops.",
  "It certainly matters for plaintiffs in this situation.",
  "It certainly matters from the defendant's point of view too. In many of these cases, it's not clear whether the number 15 has been -- as in this case, you have delivery drivers. You have owners whose wives are employed in the business.",
  "From the -- from the point of view of a defendant who thinks I'm going to fight this case on the merits, but if I lose, I still have this ace up my sleeve.",
  "That sounds like a good reason why a court should think long and hard about categorizing this as a question of subject matter jurisdiction.",
  "Well, it would be simultaneous. The jury -- the jury would have that question. Didn't I understand the attorney for the United States to say this is typical of what juries decide, was this person an independent contractor or an employee?",
  "Why?",
  "In Mullane, it was regular mail. It wasn't certified mail. Right?",
  "And isn't it 100 percent clear that there were a number of those addressees who didn't get the letter?",
  "And yet, their interests were cut out by the decision, and the Court said that was okay.",
  "But you have another factor here that wasn't present in Mullane; that is, the person who received notice has a statutory obligation to advise government of the current address. The people involved in Mullane had no such obligation to notify anybody of their current address.",
  "It wasn't the government in -- in Mullane it wasn't the government.",
  "And he also had a continuing obligation to inform the government of his address. One fact about this case that -- perhaps it was in the record and I missed it. At the time the property was sold, how much did Mr. Jones owe, taking account of the back taxes, the interest, the penalties, all that?",
  "How many people --",
  "Mr. Kirkpatrick, you distinguish Mullane. You recognize that a lot of the people never got that notice, and you said there were many people involved there, that you could rely on others. It's also how much of a burden are you going to put on the notice-giver when you have a large class involved. There was a figure -- and I forgot what the number it was -- of how many notices are -- don't succeed in delivery.",
  "Including -- including Arkansas. Didn't Arkansas change its law so now it requires if you -- if it's unclaimed, they have to do personal service?",
  "This taxpayer, though --",
  "This taxpayer -- even though he failed to give notice of his current address, this taxpayer would be entitled under the current statute to personal service.",
  "I thought he still lived in --",
  "I thought he still lived in Arkansas.",
  "Homestead.",
  "I see.",
  "Right.",
  "Suppose -- suppose we had a case where the homeowner has kept the Lands Commissioner informed of her current address, does everything she was supposed to do except at the time this notice, certified mail notice -- at the time of the delivery attempt, she's hospitalized having a quadruple bypass, so she never gets it. And then what -- what are the consequences of that?",
  "But Mullane, as Mr. Kirkpatrick pointed out, involved masses of people. This was a common trust fund, and the reliance was on that a goodly number of them would get notice and they were kind of stand-ins for the ones who didn't. But here, we're dealing with a single individual.",
  "Mr. Bopp, to what extent can we take into account the surrounding circumstances? One thing that you advocate is to look at this ad in isolation. But if you add to it that your organization made it clear that it opposed the candidacy of Senator Feingold and that it supported his opponents, that your organization also connected, as Justice Breyer just brought out, Senator Feingold with this filibuster, and then if the filibuster was such an important thing for grassroots lobbying, why was it that when the election was over, this ad was not repeated?",
  "Can we return to --",
  "Mr. Bopp, then can we return to my question? Do we view the ad in isolation, and do we discount the connection by your organization of this Senator with the filibuster that you said was a very bad thing?",
  "But the electorate will know that this issue is presented to them in connection with this Senator and that your organization has linked the two very clearly.",
  "General --",
  "General Clement, if you could clarify for me some -- a response that Mr. Bopp gave. Did this ad run, was it broadcast or televised before the blackout period?",
  "May I ask you one other thing about the setting? When you went to the Web site to get further information, what was conveyed about Senator Feingold when you went to get that further information?",
  "Mr. Kasner, may I just interrupt those references to ask you -- one could agree that, for SEC-enforcement purposes, for prosecutorial purposes, the \"in connection with\" is as broad as you suggest. But for purposes of private actions, it isn't that broad; it is limited, as this Court said in Blue Chip Stamps. It is possible for the same words, even in the same statute, in difference contexts, to mean different things.",
  "Would you explain the rule of lenity? Because, on criminal, it is as broad as can be. I didn't know that there was a rule of lenity that applied strictly to civil liability.",
  "What about the - -",
  "-- the claim that's made here, the second claim, where the broker said, \"We lost clients, so -- as a result of this deception -- and we want to be compensated for that,\" nothing about the inflated price of the security - -",
  "-- just that \"our clients don't trust us anymore, because we gave them such bad advice.\"",
  "I know, but I - -",
  "-- wanted to know what the Government's position was on that claim. Could that be brought in a State court - -",
  "-- even as a class action?",
  "How do you deal with the Court's -- the footnote in the Blue Chip Stamp -- that the court says -- in the Federal court -- \"these 10(b) actions have to be limited to actual purchasers and sellers,\" but that limitation is attenuated, because deserving claims by nontraders would lie under State law, including the very suit that was involved in Blue Chip Stamps and in the Second Circuit case that paved the way for Blue Chip?",
  "Before - -",
  "-- you get to that, just -- Mr. Frederick, the logic of it -- but -- here, Congress is tightening the requirements for class actions, but then there is this class, which -- Blue Chip did say there's a lot -- room for a lot of abuse in holder classes -- would be left to the State courts for whatever strict or lenient rules. So, why would Congress, with respect to this category, want there to be a more plaintiff-friendly rule than the rule that Congress has just put in place for the purchaser/seller 10(b) actions?",
  "Well, at least in some States.",
  "But you -- you're admitting that an -- that anomaly could be part of the scene, that you'd have a State that allows you to sue for negligence, and doesn't have heightened pleading requirements for holder claims; and so, those claims would be treated more -- in a more plaintiff-friendly way than Federal claims.",
  "Before you finish -- there's two questions I would like to ask him. One is -- we know about the holder claims. They are saved for State actions. They're not preempted. What else would fall in this category that is not -- that SLUSA doesn't affect, that can be brought as class actions in State court?",
  "You - -",
  "The affidavit -- wasn't the affidavit available to the executing officer?",
  "Well, what -- what -- take this variable. The -- the warrant can be executed when the item is taken into the house, if I remember what it said. Suppose the defendant is sitting on a porch, sees the postal carrier, gets up, takes the package, and proceeds to walk down the street, and never enters the house. Could the warrant be executed?",
  "Mr. Reichel, one of the concerns about the position you're taking, the alternative would be that the police officer, expecting that this package is going to be delivered at a certain time, is on the lookout for it. He sees the post officer approaching, calls on his cell phone to get an emergency warrant, let's say. The magistrate will not be nearly as well informed as he was when he was presented with -- was it a 64-paragraph affidavit? So the magistrate knows that the whole deal -- he can't possibly know it if he's got -- got a telephone call on an urgent basis. So if you want the magistrate's judgment rather than the police officers' on the spot, then it makes much more sense to have the magistrate get a detailed picture of what's going on and decide whether or not he'll issue the warrant.",
  "But I just -- I made the opposite argument, that a telephone warrant has to be done on the basis of minimum information. The officer -- the magistrate will have a detailed affidavit when it isn't on an emergency basis. He -- he will have, as he did in this case, an affidavit with 64 paragraphs explaining the whole deal, how it was set up. So isn't -- isn't there greater security if you could have a magistrate with time to think, well, is there really probable cause than to have the magistrate make that judgment on a -- such a quick basis?",
  "So there has to be -- when does he get the -- when does the magistrate get the affidavit?",
  "Where -- where is time? I know that the Fourth Amendment says persons and places. Where does it say time is one of the particulars?",
  "I think time -- time is certainly relevant to probable cause, but the -- the Fourth Amendment says what you have to identify with particularity are places and the items and the person. Person, things, and place. It doesn't say time, but you say that's inherent. Have we -- are there decisions of this Court that say time goes to the particularity requirement?",
  "They have first the outer limit of the 10 days in the warrant itself. And in fact, this warrant was executed within 2 days of its issuance. Is that not --",
  "And could it be if the officer knows that this package -- let's say it's loaded with dynamite or guns or drugs -- is going to be delivered at a certain time and it -- the delivery occurs, and then the officer busts in and says, there's exigent circumstances. They're going to take those drugs and they'll be off the premises. That might happen.",
  "Well, my -- my question is, isn't it better to have the police go to the magistrate when there's time for the magistrate to reflect, than to have this scenario where the police will say this was really dangerous stuff, exigent circumstances? Wouldn't you want the officer to apply in advance for the warrant?",
  "Even -- wasn't this man -- magistrate told we've set this whole thing up? We've put this package in the mail. It's going to be delivered at such and such a time. Wasn't the magistrate told that?",
  "So why was there a need for a second call when exactly that happened?",
  "Didn't -- was -- he was on the premises?",
  "And he said, I know why they're here.",
  "So where would you -- where would -- where would you put the line?",
  "But then -- but you were -- you are including at least wetlands that abut --",
  "-- navigable water.",
  "What about major tributaries?",
  "Which ones?",
  "Well, is your position no tributaries or some tributaries?",
  "From everything -- from everything you said, it sounds like you're -- you're taking issue with Riverside Bayview because if a wetland adjacent to the river counts, then why not a stream that goes right into it? What sense does that distinction make?",
  "You think that's correct about what the Court said in Bayview when it phrased the question as before discharging fill material into wetlands adjacent to navigable bodies of water and their tributaries. That's what the Court thought it was deciding in Riverside Bayview.",
  "At any rate, they could not have been making the distinction Justice Scalia suggested if, at least in the Court's thinking, the tributaries rolled right into the navigable body.",
  "Then what was the reason they gave for rejecting the permit?",
  "Suppose --",
  "May I ask one question about your -- your not -- no hydrological connection? If this berm were next to a wetland that would otherwise be adjacent to a river, the situation that was presented in Riverside Bayview, is it the berm that prevents there being a hydrological connection?",
  "So it could -- there could be a situation where the wetlands would be right next to the river, but there's a berm in between, and that would break the hydrological connection?",
  "We're told that one of them was much closer.",
  "What about the Pine River? Are you -- that's not 20 miles away, is it?",
  "Do you know? The -- the Solicitor General represented to us that it was very close. Are you disputing that as a matter of fact?",
  "I don't --",
  "I don't --",
  "Miccosukee assumed that -- the soup ladle example from the Second Circuit; you took out the ladle, you held it up, and you put the same thing back. But if I understand what happens as a result of the impoundment of the water and then its release, what comes out is quite different from what was put in. It's kind of like you had a pot boiling with vegetables, and then you put it through a food processor, and then what you got out would be quite different from what went into the food processor.",
  "I thought the descriptions that we had was, it is a result of the impoundment and the subsequent release that the water emerges in this unnatural state, in this striated state that Justice Kennedy was referring to.",
  "What about -- what about the DNA -- the exclusion of the alleged perpetrator, of White? There -- there was no trace of White's DNA. And that was a FBI officer who testified to that.",
  "That's a question on which we didn't grant cert.",
  "Could you use --",
  "Could -- could you use the same rule with respect to alibi evidence? The trial judge would say this evidence for the prosecution is so strong, I'm not going to let any alibi evidence in. Is there -- is there anything special about third party guilt? Couldn't -- couldn't you use -- use it for other defenses?",
  "Can we -- can we just back up to Cabrera? The D.C. Circuit did not publish that and --",
  "-- and unless the rule has changed, it didn't have -- it didn't have any precedential effect -- those opinions that they did not put in the Federal Reports.",
  "On that, could a prosecutor have gotten this case -- gotten an indictment against White on the basis that he had four witnesses who put him in the proximity of the crime, four who said that they heard him confess? On the basis of that evidence, could White have been indicted for this?",
  "And -- and also throw in one more thing, the victim's description of the assailant. So if -- if White could have been indicted for this crime and -- and yet the jury is not allowed to hear that evidence, that sounds passing strange to me.",
  "I don't --",
  "You said it was enough to indict and that very same evidence is put before the jury, but it wouldn't be enough to convict?",
  "Mr. Long --",
  "-- with respect to liberty, as it -- it's not disputed, is it, that your client could have had his parole revoked even though the search was suspicionless? So, what we're talking about the difference between revocation of parole, on the one hand, and a separate criminal offense. Is that right?",
  "But I thought that evidence seized could be introduced, could be a basis to revoke parole.",
  "So, the -- what the -- the consequence here is whether --",
  "-- he will have his parole revoked --",
  "-- or he will have a separate criminal offense.",
  "Are you relying --",
  "-- on the difference between -- you said \"officer in the field.\" Would this be okay if it had been his parole officer?",
  "The parole officer was walking along the street, saw this guy, and said, \"I'm going to search you.\"",
  "Why?",
  "Why? If it -- if it -- if it -- it doesn't go to the suspicionless character of the search, but it does say it has to be reasonable in time, place, or manner.",
  "And maybe the --",
  "-- officers are reasonable in time, place --",
  "-- or manner.",
  "How many times has it been challenged --",
  "-- on the --",
  "What about drug offenders, given the high rate of recidivism?",
  "Suppose you were in a halfway house, and the State says, \"We're creating a status. One is, you're a prisoner. Another is, you're a halfway house. Another is, on your -- parole. But we want to subject you to suspicionless searches at -- in all three stages -- prison, halfway house, parole.\" Could they do it for the halfway house?",

  "Yes, while the --",
  "-- while the --",
  "The person who is in this semi-custody state, he's going to work, and, while he's at his workplace, the police officer shows up and says, \"I'm going to pat you down, and then I'm going to\" --",
  "-- \"see if you have drugs.\"",
  "Mr. Niver --",
  "Well, are there manuals -- are there any -- here is the cop on the beat.",
  "He sees someone that he knows is a parolee. Is there any instruction that he's been given so that his discretion can be guided instead of rudderless? In practice in California, are all --",
  "Yes. What is the practice?",
  "I'm asking you about what instruction, what training, if you know, are officers given? Or are they given no training, just the law that says, \"You can search any parolee\"?",
  "What would be arbitrary and capricious? You told us harassing would be the repeated searches by the same officer.",
  "But all this is on a case -- would be on a case-by-case basis. There are no going-in guides for the officer on the street.",
  "Mr. Long seemed to have -- tell us something different about that. It's -- they had -- they must go out. He seemed to say they didn't have the choice of staying in.",
  "But it really --",
  "-- it really isn't.",
  "It's -- this is not like you sign an agreement and you're -- you can do it or you can not do it. I mean, this is a real Hobson's choice, isn't it?",
  "You can't --",
  "-- negotiate, \"I don't\" --",
  "-- \"want this part.\"",
  "Has --",
  "-- the recidivism rate gone down in the years since the Reyes decision, since this is suspicionless search, as opposed to reasonable suspicion?",
  "It was a computation error. This is not a -- this is not a case where the State chose to waive the statute of limitations. It miscalculated. Isn't that the case?",
  "But we're not -- and we didn't take cert to decide if this claim was timely. We are on the assumption that it was untimely. But -- and what are the consequences of the State's failing to raise that?",
  "But the --",
  "-- the whole basis was the number of days that they calculated, and the magistrate said, \"Oh, they miscalculated. There were more days involved.\"",
  "Yes.",
  "Suppose --",
  "Suppose the magistrate judge had said, \"I notice this error in accordance with Eleventh Circuit law, so I am going to suggest to the State that they amend their answer.\" The State certainly could -- under Rule 15, if the Federal rules apply, the State could have amended its answer and done just what the magistrate judge did.",
  "Did it say \"an obligation,\" or that the court \"could\"? It didn't -- I didn't think it said the court \"must.\"",
  "Where is -- I see -- you're referring to page 4(a) and --",
  "Yes. Which -- where is the sentence that says it -- that --",
  "I thought that that duty is in connection with Rule 4.",
  "Well, we could --",
  "-- we could -- we could agree with you that there is isn't an obligation on the Federal judge to raise it, but the question is, you know, the -- it could be a \"must,\" it can be \"may not,\" or it could be \"may.\"",
  "And why shouldn't we treat this as a \"may\"? The judge noticed the clerical error and called it to the party's attention by an order to show cause.",
  "We're past Rule 4, because an answer has been ordered.",
  "So -- and it's only when the answer comes in that this issue is spotted.",
  "There are very what standards?",
  "Yes, \"leave shall be freely given.\"",
  "Well, what would be the prejudice that could be claimed by the habeas petitioner?",
  "But you couldn't do this under Rule 4, because, as you, I think, recognized, that, just from the petition, from the habeas petition, you couldn't tell.",
  "There wasn't --",
  "Yes, but the civil rules allow for amendment.",
  "There's 8(c), and there's 12(b), but there's also 15.",
  "It seems the height of technicality to say that the judge could suggest, \"Now, State, I will entertain a motion to amend the answer, under Rule 15,\" instead of saying, \"I'm issuing an order to show cause why this action is not out of time.\"",
  "Were those --",
  "-- cases -- were those cases of a miscalculation on the part of the State? The judge's view was that the State had miscalculated under eleventh-amendment -- under Eleventh Circuit precedent.",
  "But here, nothing --",
  "-- happened. Nothing happened. There was --",
  "The answer was put in, and then there were no further proceedings. Nothing else went on in the court.",
  "It's quite different -- I don't know any judge that would allow a defendant, after the trial is over, to raise the statute of limitations. But, up front, it's a different situation.",
  "Yes, but, Mr. Kise, the ­ - Mr. Busby told us that the reference was in the following paragraph, and it is the sentence, \"A Federal Court that sits in collateral review of a criminal judgment of a State Court has an obligation to enforce the Federal statute of limitations.\" That's the sentence that suggests that the Court of Appeals thought that there was an obligation, the District Court, to raise the statute of limitations on its own motion.",
  "Would you say it's --",
  "-- means it's \"hardly ever\"? I mean, we do follow the principle of party presentation. And judges are not supposed to be intruding issues on their own, they are supposed to follow the party's presentation. So, would this be -- if it's not \"never,\" would it be at least \"hardly ever,\" that it's appropriate for a judge to interject an affirmative defense on his own motion?",
  "I thought in Granberry the Court gave the Court of Appeals that discretion, since it hadn't -- the point had been missed in the District Court, been missed by everybody, until the Court of Appeals.",
  "But why would --",
  "-- why would you deal with that hypothetical when the Eleventh Circuit, in all fairness, said, \"We join the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Circuit, and rule that, even though the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, the District Court may review the timeliness of the 2254.\" That's what -- the question that the court thought it was deciding.",
  "Not generally. Statute of limitations, like res judicata, they are 8(c) affirmative defenses, and preclusion doctrine is for the party to waive or not, just like the statute of limitations. I don't think there's any rule that says a judge in the run-of-the-mine case acts properly by interjecting preclusion into a case where no party has raised it.",
  "You're -- you're talking without reference to the statute, and as I read the statute, the phrase that keeps reappearing is payments made by a third party for health care items or services. So she has to turn over from her recovery what she got for health care, but we know that her tort claim consisted of a lot more. So if the Federal statute says she has to turn over what she received from the third party for health care services, well, she did that, and you agreed that that would be a fair allocation. So I don't see how you get from her the -- a much larger share than what she got for health care.",
  "But the State -- the State could sue in the first instance. In fact, if you just read the text of the statute, it seems like the State is the one envisioned to be suing for reimbursement of the medical expenses.",
  "But the State was in this case. The State intervened. So it was party to the case.",
  "And when it -- it found out about the dismissal, why didn't it go right into the Arkansas court and say, you forgot about us? We were a party to this lawsuit.",
  "Why would they be fighting the same anti-lien provision? They would be -- wouldn't they be saying we have a claim for all of the medical expenses? And no other party -- the injury victim didn't have authority from us to compromise our claim. It's for us to compromise it.",
  "Did -- did they have notice of the settlement proceeding?",
  "But they were -- and they were intervened in this lawsuit. Weren't they entitled to have notice that there was a settlement and that the case was going to be dismissed?",
  "The plaintiff had -- had no obligation to notify the State? There was some mention of a -- of a obligation to cooperate. Is there any statutory obligation under -- I don't see it in the Medicaid statute, but under Arkansas law for -- for the Medicaid recipient to cooperate with the State?",
  "Do you still have a declaration that the Arkansas statute was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the Federal statute?",
  "Mr. Bopp, would you clarify a procedural point? As I understand it, on the expenditure issue, there is no final decision that has gone back to the district court for further proceedings.",
  "And it may -- the district court might -- may well find that nothing passes constitutional muster in the end.",
  "Are you arguing now then that there may be no limits on expenditures?",
  "But there were lower limits, Mr. Bopp, and I think that's what Justice Souter was asking about.",
  "There were the thousand dollars, but I think it went down as low as $250 in --",
  "There -- there was a court that subsequently considered the rest and upheld the contribution --",
  "Mr. Bopp, may I ask you? You keep -- the way you're discussing this case, one would think that the trial court found there was an evidentiary insufficiency, but I thought, at least on the contributions part, the trial court found that the evidence sufficed to justify those limits.",
  "Can you -- can you point to the place in the district court opinion that you're referring to?",
  "Was there any testimony or evidence on the other side of the point that Judge Winter makes? That is, you have someone running in a primary and then faces an incumbent in the general election, but there's nothing left in the till because it was a hard-fought primary. That -- the advantage to the incumbent in that situation was a large concern to at least some of the judges on the Second Circuit.",
  "Not on the contributions, is it?",
  "What if the rem --",
  "-- what if the rem is in another court before the bankruptcy begins? What if the res is within -- is in another court?",
  "So even -- even if property is in the custody of another court in the probate proceeding and the bankruptcy proceeding comes later, the bankruptcy proceeding would sweep whatever assets are before the probate court into the bankruptcy.",
  "Mr. Richland --",
  "-- what seems to me to be involved here is what is not uncommon in our Federal system, that is, two proceedings, both dealing with the same or closely related subject matter. It is not infrequent that you have parallel proceedings in Federal court and State court, and then the one that gets finished first -- that judgment is binding on the other. And as I understand it, the probate proceeding concluded first before the district judge reviewed the bankruptcy judge's opinion.",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm assuming -- and correct me if I'm wrong about this -- that the bankruptcy court makes a proposed opinion. It doesn't become a binding opinion until it's affirmed by the district court.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, if it isn't a core matter. I think you lost on that in the district court.",
  "But that was not reviewed by the Ninth Circuit.",
  "That would -- that would be the -- if you -- if you're correct about the limits of the probate exception, that issue would be open for review by the Ninth Circuit.",
  "Ms. Maynard, you said at one point it's not necessary for you to decide this, but there is vast confusion in the lower courts about the extent of the probate exception. And so I take it that your -- what you began -- what you began with is -- I wrote them down. That's it?",
  "And in addition to Markham, what other case of this Court do you think spells out the proper bounds?",
  "Why should it? The probate exception is court-created. Congress passed no law that said it. Congress gave the Federal courts jurisdiction in certain categories of cases and expected them to exercise that jurisdiction. Since our jurisdiction is statutory and the probate exception was made up by the courts, shouldn't we interpret it as narrowly as possible, perhaps even do away with it because it lacks any statutory basis?",
  "You're arguing a preclusion question, and if the Ninth Circuit thought it had jurisdiction, it could have tested what you say about Texas law. There's no finding in this record of what Texas law is other than what you have just told us, and perhaps you're right and perhaps you're not. But the Ninth Circuit said the Federal door is closed to this probate exception, and that's what we're here to decide.",
  "I think it -- it may be that there's another side to that story. For example, I think the bankruptcy court was heard from first. Arguably, that's binding on the Texas court. Whether the bankruptcy court was right or wrong, it would get full faith and credit. That's one argument. Another is perhaps you can explain to me how this all started because I thought that it was a claim made against her in the bankruptcy court for defamation. Then the claim that she asserts is a compulsory counterclaim. She has to make it there or she'll lose it.",
  "I -- I didn't understand the pleading to say if I have a claim, it would be nondischargeable. I thought he made a claim. He made -- filed a claim for defamation in the bankruptcy proceeding.",
  "He would have to say I have a claim because the bankruptcy court is not going to decide a hypothetical if he has a claim. He has to at least assert I have a claim.",
  "It has to be a real claim. It can't be if I have a claim.",
  "You -- you are suggesting an extraordinary setup with a State court being able to preclude other courts from dealing with related, not identical matters, and that's just not the way our system works. You can bring duplicative proceedings in different courts. One will finish first and that will bind the others. But I -- I never heard of a State court being able to say, because we are a probate court, that you -- you couldn't bring a tort case someplace else.",
  "That's the definition of an in rem judgment, but she's suing for an in personam judgment an individual, not an estate, just for a plain old money judgment.",
  "Can a county be an arm of the State for some things?",
  "Who pays judgments? Who pays judgments against the county?",
  "I thought that was one of the main indicia of whether an entity had been set up as an arm of the State, that is, the State would be directly liable.",
  "To what -- what other area would this apply? If the county has sovereign immunity, how about the county school board?",
  "And education would not --",
  "How about the sanitation department?",
  "What about the South Carolina Supreme Court's opinion in the Hines case which seems to run counter to your argument?",
  "The -- the Eleventh Circuit had a prior decision, didn't they?",
  "Mr. Olson, who would have -- who would have standing? I understand your argument that Ohio taxpayers don't, but are there people who would have standing?",
  "Mr. Olson, I had asked you the question, because I wanted to know whether this case was distinguishable from Flast in that regard, although I recognize your quotation from Valley Forge. That -- Flast seemed to be a case that fit that description, that there was no one who would have a better claim for injury, in fact.",
  "Mr. Olson, I don't mean to deflect you from getting on to the merits, but there was one point in your brief that was of concern to me. That is, you said that you questioned whether, assuming we accept your argument on standing, it would be appropriate to return this case to the court of appeals with instructions that it be remanded to the State court and with the counsel fees that 1447 entitle one to. And you said that would not be right.",
  "And that's because it's a local -- it's a Toledo city property tax, is that the distinction you're making?",
  "So, that's --",
  "You would be challenging the local action --",
  "-- rather than the State --",
  "-- action, and that's how you distinguish the municipal taxpayer.",
  "There are some -- at least it's arguable that there's Federal municipal taxpayer standing. And certainly some States have said that there is. And that -- and whatever Ohio might or might not do is not relevant to this proceeding. We don't know that. I'm -- you've given your opinion on what it would be.",
  "Well, that's a --",
  "-- that's the piggybacking question. That's quite different. And --",
  "There isn't -- the tax credit doesn't give them -- require them to buy, in State. I mean, the purchase -- whatever they equip the plant with can come from vendors and manufacturers, out of State?",
  "Is there any --",
  "Is there any authority at all for saying you can piggyback the basic case or controversy requirement? I mean, it's one thing to say you can hook a nondiverse claim, but it's a claim; it's a case or controversy. I'm -- I don't know of any authority that says that you can -- you can take a matter that is not a constitutional case or controversy and latch it onto something that does qualify.",
  "I think it was pointed out that, in Flast, at least, you were dealing with the same spending on the part of the Federal Government. Here, you have apples and oranges. The property tax is quite discrete from the investment tax credit.",
  "The problem in Craig, with the name plaintiff, is, it wasn't a class action, an 18-year-old sent to turn 21 in the fullness of time. But I didn't understand your answer about the beer seller whose standing saved the case, at least in the view of the majority of this Court. She had a real pocketbook injury. She was not able to sell her beer to the thirsty boys. So --",
  "-- I don't understand why that's an example of a loose standing connection. I mean, she surely had an -- a pocketbook injury. True, she was complaining about a denial of equal protection to the fraternity brothers, but that she had an injury, in fact, there was no doubt.",
  "There was no lack of standing below. The problem was that the -- Craig turned 21 while the case was pending in this Court. There was standing below. He was 18 when the litigation started.",
  "In any event, they were attacking the same thing. So, your case is different, at least to that extent, that you have two discrete taxes.",
  "What about having a --",
  "What about having a -- a plan that was put in place by the legislature instead of a temporary plan put in effect by a court?",
  "Isn't there -- isn't it -- you -- you seem to treat this as a redone redistricting instead of as the very first redistricting done by a legislature.",
  "I thought there was --",
  "-- I thought there -- the houses were divided. One party, one -- had one house; the other, the other. And so they were at loggerheads and they --",
  "But the court -- even from the court's perspective, was it the same three judges that did the -- that did the plan, the court-ordered plan? And I thought that the -- the judge who presided told us in his latest opinion that they never anticipated that as being a permanent plan, and indeed, they tried to stay as close as they could to the then- existing plan.",
  "Counsel, when you say --",
  "But you did use the word inquisitorial, and there's one large difference, it seems. This is not a magistrate judge or a police officer coming to a person for an interview. This is initiated by the caller, by the victim, and it's initially a cry for help.",
  "No, I didn't say that.",
  "I said that the call was initiated by the victim. It wasn't a -- a police officer coming to interview her.",
  "You're splitting up two things that I think go together. That is, this is not just a call. This is a cry for help.",
  "You said -- you said we don't know, but you -- that's slightly in conflict with what you said earlier. They asked 26 questions. How long was this telephone conversation between the 911 operator and the victim?",
  "But a simple cry for help that doesn't say I'm being battered may not elicit an immediate response on the part of the police. This kind of call, I need help now, and the information that comes with it is likely to be given priority attention as this very call was.",
  "Is there -- is there -- suppose the defendant procured the witness' absence by a threat.",
  "Then the 911 statement could come in. Right?",
  "But those are -- those are three neat legal categories. The practical reality, is it not so, is that many women in these situations are scared to death of what will happen to them or they're so insecure financially that they think they have to put up with the battering? So your neat legal categories really don't conform to what happens in people's lives who are in this situation.",
  "Why don't you incorporate what the Solicitor General has suggested, that is, you draw the line at urgent emergency statements that are calling for -- for immediate help?",
  "And those -- those --",
  "Such as in Crawford, but in Crawford, it was the kind of formal statement, the Court said, materials such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross examine, or similar pretrial statements. Similar pretrial statement is not an agitated woman calling 911 or telling a police officer who -- as in your case, who comes in response to a call, there's a disturbance going on in that house, get there.",
  "Did the legislatures that have passed laws of the kind you describe have before them information that there is a rather high incidence of the victim being intimidated and therefore not showing up in court to testify?",
  "I don't know why the or would necessarily follow. I mean, if you prevail, there's nothing that compels the State to put money in what has been suggested, a training program, shelters, counselors for these people.",
  "Nothing at all compels the State to do that.",
  "Mr. Friedman, can I go back to your answer that the police will then -- in response to the position that you're urging, will then protect the victim and all these fine things? It wasn't so long ago that the police wouldn't bother with these prosecutions at all. They didn't care about them. And if you say you're going to have to drag in the victim, you're going to have to jail her for contempt if she's so scared that she won't testify, they'll say, who needs it. We've got a lot of other crimes to prosecute.",
  "That's very powerfully hard to prove, isn't it?",
  "Do you accept the Government's --",
  "Why isn't the -- the bright line that the Government asserts that this is a crime made in an urgent situation, when one doesn't -- the declarant doesn't think rationally will this be used eventually in a trial, where the declarant wants to stop an imminent threat?",
  "But that's a different test than the resemblance test that you're proposing.",
  "Was there -- was there any showing at all of whether they made the police -- or the prosecutor made any effort to enforce the subpoena?",
  "How do we know when that line is crossed? You said reasonably necessary to protect safety. That's okay. Interrogation is not good. But how -- how does one tell when one stops and the other starts?",
  "What is the --",
  "What is the California remedy? Let's say his boss says, \"Don't turn over Brady materials.\"",
  "Yes.",
  "But would have a 1983 case if he were disciplined or disadvantaged in the workplace because of the talk that he gave to the Mexican-American Bar Association in which he criticized DA office policies?",
  "But if she was the vice principal, that would be -- then it would come --",
  "-- within your --",
  "What about California, which was the State where this episode occurred? Was - - I think you mentioned that he did not make a claim under the State statute.",
  "But wasn't the issue there what is patentable? I mean this case in the district court was under this definiteness idea, 112. 101 deals with what's patentable. And it seems to me that you -- this case was presented as a definiteness case.",
  "Is the Abbott test -- that's patented and you're paying royalties for that?",
  "You set off the district court and the court of appeals but you don't think the district court got it right, either. You said the district court required something more.",
  "What was the something more and why wasn't that adequate?",
  "What the district court did is it got, it tried this case and it got a rather large jury verdict.",
  "And I don't understand how you're setting off the district court from the court of appeals when the court of appeals, whatever it said, it affirmed the judgment of the district court.",
  "Would it -- would it if the employer were self-insured? Can you be self- insured for workers' comp?",
  "Would that be a plan then?",
  "So it would be an employee benefit program, but not a plan.",
  "And why did --",
  "-- why did you answer Justice Scalia's question as you did? That is also an employee benefit, that is, vacation, sickness.",
  "I thought there's also, isn't there, the Pension Benefit -- even if there's no money in the till for the plan, isn't there a Government fund so that the worker would receive the benefit in any event if -- I don't see the distinction that you're making based on whether the worker would get a benefit whether or not the employer made the contribution.",
  "Mr. Strain --",
  "-- in -- in your brief, you seem to put considerable stress on something that I haven't heard you say one word about so far, and that is that these -- workers' compensation is State- mandated. They're not negotiated or even employer- determined benefits. They are whatever the law prescribes. And you haven't -- haven't mentioned that, so I'm wondering where that fits into your picture.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, there's no employer or employee, for that matter, who's doing the planning. The planning is all done by the Government --",
  "-- because what's covered is prescribed by law.",
  "But the it is not negotiable. We think of a health plan, a retirement plan. That doesn't have to be any set coverage. It's negotiated or the employer, if it's not a collective bargaining situation, determines what the benefits will be. Here, the law determines what the benefits will be.",
  "But there's one feature of this that is -- does make it different, at least one, and that is this is a benefit to the employer in the way that the others are not. The employer -- there's a tradeoff in workers' compensation. It's not just I'm going to pay benefits when the person is injured, but I'm going to get off the hook for the tort liability that I might otherwise have. And in the other cases of the other benefits, there is no -- no such tradeoff.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, before --",
  "May I detract you just for a moment? On -- on a question of the statutory history, correct me if I'm wrong, but originally, 1934, the kind of claim that you have would be a seventh priority claim. And then in '38, Congress said no priority at all covering workers' compensation. And then when Congress restored a priority, it ratcheted it up to four or five, depending upon which version of the statute we use. Is there any explanation why, when Congress originally assigned first a very low priority and then no priority, suddenly it gets up to be on a par with the fringe benefits?",
  "What is -- what is unemployment compensation? Those two I think of as those are law-mandated coverage that every employer must have: workers' comp and unemployment. So what's unemployment, is that a plan too?",
  "Has any -- a number of courts have considered this question -- have any of them accepted your first -- your argument that the statute is clear that it is nonretroactive?",
  "I'd -- I'll have to look at those decisions. It was my impression that they did, indeed, hold that it was retroactive, but not on the ground that Congress had clearly spoken to the point, so that you didn't need any further inquiry.",
  "Am I wrong in thinking that readjustment based on his marriage was not one of the modes of relief that he could have had in '82 or -- that that didn't come in until much later, is that so?",
  "So, any -- so, that was a consequence that certainly wasn't taken away from him, because it wasn't there in '82.",
  "Even though what --",
  "Well, in St. Cyr --",
  "-- was -- in St. Cyr, I think it was he pled guilty under one set of expectations, and that's what the Court fastened on. Isn't that so?",
  "Well, he --",
  "-- might not have pled guilty if there was a different set of rules. I thought that was what drove the Court's opinion.",
  "In the instance --",
  "-- of a child --",
  "-- who had -- he had a relationship to a child in the United States. And couldn't that have counted for suspension of deportation or removal, whatever terms I use now? Did --",
  "-- for a hardship claim, a parent-child relationship?",
  "He was here -- he was here for 20 --",
  "-- 20 years, though.",
  "Is it --",
  "Is it farfetched, in view of the history of now I- -- before INS, weren't there a great many people who got here and -- just as this Petitioner -- who just lived here for years and years, and were never disturbed?",
  "But that's the -- a function of -- you want the first-line decisionmaker -- you need that decision, because, at the second rung, in -- at the court level, deference is owed to it. But in the prison setting, there's no deference owed to it. So, I would think that this kind of requirement, that you must file someplace else first, a place that won't get deference, is more like the EEOC example and the Age Discrimination Act.",
  "Invoke what?",
  "Are you -- are you saying, then, that those two go together, they're inextricably tied together? If you've got an exhaustion rule, then embedded in it is always a procedural default rule?",
  "But that was a comment made when the decision itself held that there was no exhaustion. The -- wasn't that so? I mean, the holding in Madigan was in favor of the Petitioner.",
  "I mean McCarthy.",
  "Well, there was -- in McCarthy, itself, the wording was something that -- of the kind proposed. And so, it's not clear whether it's referring to -- what was proposed was a rule that would incorporate a procedural default motion. It's not clear, just from the -- reading that opinion.",
  "In thinking --",
  "-- of what Congress might have meant, one part of the picture is, we're not dealing with statutes of limitations enacted by legislatures. We're dealing with grievance procedures that vary from State to State, and maybe even from prison to prison. And some of them have a very short span. I think the brief said some of them are 2, 3, 5 days.",
  "May I --",
  "May I ask you just one thing --",
  "-- about how this operates and who reviews what? One of the claims that was made -- this prisoner filed twice. And, the second time, as I recall, he said, \"Every day that I'm here, the clock starts running again, because this is a continuing violation. I'm restricted today, and I'll be restricted tomorrow.\" And there was no -- is that something that would be reviewable in court?",
  "Well, what --",

  "And what is the law of the prison grievance proceeding on that point?",
  "Well, he -- that -- his point is that the event at issue happens every day.",
  "But your -- but your point -- your -- whatever the internal grievance procedure is, there's no judge that would decide that, which you said, this is all for the internal procedure.",
  "Mr. Feder --",
  "Mr. Feder, there is one anomaly that the Government points out. And I -- before you sit down, I'd like to know what your answer is. They said, \"Imagine one prisoner who begins the grievance process on time, he goes to step two, goes to step three, then he stops. And then another prisoner who waits til the time has come and gone, she files. The prison says, 'We don't take late filings.' The second prisoner gets to court, and the first, who did go through three steps, but stopped short of the fourth, doesn't have any access to Federal Court.\"",
  "What is the reason that -- that the State or the regulations allow paperbacks from the library and not current events? I'm just -- that -- the rationality of -- of that line escapes me.",
  "But you --",
  "But if the concern is the safety concern, then you would have an equal concern with the Jewish Daily Forward, which is a newspaper format, or -- and I don't know what the Watchtower comes out in these days.",
  "What does the -- what does the inmate have to show in order to go to the law library? That is, suppose the inmate's position is I want to go there and I want to read Law Week and Legal Times and other -- I want to see what's new, what's breaking in the law so that maybe I'll have something I can put in a petition, and that's why I want to go every -- every chance I get to the law library. Could such an inmate go to the library?",
  "Well, that would mean that the inmate could go and look at the legal newspapers, but not -- not the Christian Science Monitor.",
  "So he could get Law Week, Legal Times, and --",
  "-- the National Law Journal. All of those he could get.",
  "But I thought there, there was a genuine security concern, which I think you pretty much said doesn't exist here when you consider what they can have in -- in the cell.",
  "Apart from those two, access to the courts and cruel and unusual punishment, then anything goes for this set of incorrigible prisoners? They can take away -- the First Amendment, in other words, is out the window. They have no First Amendment rights that the State needs to respect. Is that --",
  "But -- but for this -- for this group, while they're in that situation, essentially there's no First Amendment rights. I think that's what your -- your argument. They can regain them, but that's the purpose of the behavioral modification program. But the -- the only thing that these prisoners get is the Eighth Amendment.",
  "So let's say if -- if the flaw is it doesn't deter other people because they don't know about it, then if they -- if they broadcast it all over so everyone knows about it, then it's okay?",
  "I thought you were using that to say that the security concern doesn't hold up because of the papers that they're allowed to have in their cells can be used similarly for fires, similarly to do other bad things.",
  "So I thought that's why you were using that, just to say that the -- the security concern is dubious because the materials that they are allowed to have in their cells can -- could achieve exactly the same end.",
  "What -- this --",
  "What other than the periodical, newspaper access differentiates this custody from the next higher --",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Frederick, you -- you started by saying how difficult this would be to prove, but could the plaintiff piggyback on New York? If New York was the defrauded party and taxes are owed to the State, has the State had no proceeding in this?",
  "Do I understand correctly Federal income tax shortfalls?",
  "Is there any impediment to New York suing him? This would be -- it's kind of strange. New York has its tax scheme. It has penalties for failure to pay tax. And then it could go into the Federal court and say RICO is better than our penalties. RICO has treble damages.",
  "Are you for relaying -- relating the position of the United States -- are you relying on that brief in the Bank of China case that",
  "Being -- is there any other case where the defendant is charged with not paying tax either to the Federal Government or the State? Now you have it both because you --",
  "-- you said they haven't paid tax for this -- their income -- Federal income tax know of another where failure to pay tax owed to a State or the Federal Government is the basis for a RICO",
  "You're getting away from -- intimidation was -- was not directed to your customers. I mean, it seems to me that's a -- that's a totally defrauded, that would be a -- your customers, but you -- there -- there was nothing directed specifically at the customers of your store.",
  "Can we go back to the question that I was trying to ask you before with relation to the novelty of this because it involves fraud on the -- a government that's a tax assessor and collector? It seems to me that the taxing authorities, both State and Federal, might have some genuine concern with a potential plaintiff's examining to see, gee, has my -- has my rival, my competitor cheated on his or her State or the Federal Government's administering their tax systems. that. That's certainly not true in this case. What I believe is true in this case is that but for my client's proactive litigation, this never would have come to the taxing authorities' attention. The taxing authorities are free to bring their own case. In our brief on the merits, in fact, we -- we cited one case where the City of New York suing a different set of defendants over unpaid cigarette taxes. The point I want to make is that let us assume that the State of New York intervened in this case, which is always a possibility -- perhaps it's a bit late now -- or brought its own case. My clients and the State of New York are chasing two different piles of money, two separate measures of damages. In our brief on the merits, we set forth a hypothetical, a $100 cash transaction, to illustrate that. My clients cannot recover the lost taxes that were taken from the State of New York. The State of New York cannot recover the lost profits that my client suffered. So in -- in the Holmes sense, we're not dealing here with an apportionment problem because -- about that problem. I was concerned about people setting themselves up as private enforcers of tax there detecting who's violated the tax laws.",
  "How about your client's supplier? If your client -- if Ideal is selling less, then it's going to buy less from its supplier. So would the supplier also have a RICO claim?",
  "What -- what is New York relying? I mean, they -- somebody -- does -- does the State or the Federal taxpayer rely on everybody who files a return that they -- they filed it honestly? Is that -- that -- I don't understand the sense in which a taxing authority relies on the return that's been filed. law is it's either actual reliance or presumptive reliance. The taxing authorities actually rely or they tax returns. The fact of the matter is that's what's alleged in our amended complaint and that is what the facts are in this case. It is -- and -- and if you look at the Solicitor General's brief in Bank of China, the Government cited this case with approval as an example of an appropriate use of third party reliance. And -- and I -- I submit to you that, while I disagree with the Solicitor General that reliance is an element whenever mail or wire -- I mean, for example, if the predicate acts here involved extortion, a Hobbs Act violation, violence in some form, we wouldn't be here talking about reliance. If it involved the payment of a bribe, we wouldn't be here talking about reliance. What is it about mail fraud and wire fraud that springs from the ground this concept of reliance? My point is I don't believe it has any basis in law, and I think this Court should say so. That's -- that's why we're here on the question presented. I think that this notion should be swept away because it has no basis in law. It's not in the statute. And this Court has found on several occasions that where crime requirement, the prior conviction requirement, this Court has said it's not in the statute. We can't",
  "What, in addition to this case -- I mean, this case is pending in the U.S. Supreme Court. There are many cases pending in the district court when this law comes into effect. What about those cases?",
  "You've mentioned -- you've mentioned that the defendant has no right to appear before the tribunal. What are the other rights recognized by all civilized people that these tribunals do not guarantee?",
  "Would you --",
  "Would you --",
  "General Clement, if you can straighten me out on the piece that you read about \"consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,\" I thought that it was the Government's position that these enemy combatants do not have any rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States.",
  "But what --",
  "But how will the question, whether the laws in the United -- and Constitution -- of the United States, whether these petitioners have any claim to state under the laws and Constitution of the United States? Because as I read -- the review that's provided doesn't open up that question. It's a very narrow review that's given to the D.C. Circuit.",
  "Is there --",
  "Is there -- is there any review in this Court, following the D.C. Circuit, either the original classification or the conviction -- is there -- does this Court have any part in the scheme?",
  "May I ask you another question about the clarity with which Congress spoke? This law was proposed and enacted some weeks after this Court granted cert in this very case. It is an extraordinary act, I think, to withdraw jurisdiction from this Court in a pending case. Congress didn't say, explicitly, it was doing that. It hasn't done it, as far as I know, since McArdle. But there Congress said, \"We are withdrawing jurisdiction in this very case.\" They didn't say that here. So, why should we assume that Congress withdraw our jurisdiction to hear this case once the case was already lodged here?",
  "Well, what about --",
  "-- what about if you're -- if you're using Great-West, it seemed to me the most relevant point made in Great-West was that the plan could seek restitution in equity where money identified as belonging in good conscience to the plan could clearly be traced to particular funds in -- in the defendant's possession. The problem in Great-West was the money had already been dissipated. It had been set aside.",
  "Do you -- do you not think that Congress had in mind no compensatory damages, no punitive damages? Do you really think that Congress had in mind the distinction that you are now drawing in the ring case based on 15th and 16th century English precedent? they had 15th and 16th century cases in mind. Certainly not. I was relying on those cases because believe that --",
  "Yes, but Great-West also said money. It said money, identified as belonging in good conscience to the plan. And why doesn't it belong in good conscience to the plan when the beneficiary has promised that, if it gets a tort recovery, it will reimburse the plan?",
  "What -- what is the double recovery that you're talking about? The plan has paid out to the care providers the benefits in full.",
  "And now it wants to get",
  "But the plaintiff could so -- in the tort litigation, if that's what it is, the plaintiff could say, I don't want any medical damages. Give me everything for pain and suffering.",
  "Well, but they look at the medical expenses were something like $75,000 and the",
  "How does the -- how does the insurer show that if the parties could just say -- the plaintiff can say, I am the master of my complaint. I am not seeking damages for medical expenses. I just want damages for lost earnings, pain and suffering.",
  "Well -- well, why should you be if -- if an -- if this -- if you prevail in this case and then every other personal injury lawyer will make sure that that recovery goes into a trust for the care of the accident victims, never goes into their own investment account.",
  "But -- but if the recovery is set up in such a way that it never goes into the just what happened in Great-West, isn't that what every personal injury lawyer will do if you prevail in this",
  "So even if you had an early neutral evaluator who said this entire claim with pain and suffering and the medical, it's -- all together it's $100,000. But there was some contributory negligence. So I think $80,000 would be right. So there would still be no prorating --",
  "And at least you have the authority of the International Court of Justice that says this is a right. This is not just a matter between the states.",
  "How many times now has the ICJ said that this convention confers rights on the individual?",
  "And what is the view of our treaty partners on that issue?",
  "Not at the time this treaty came into force.",
  "Not at the time the Vienna Convention came into force.",
  "We were almost alone in having suppression as the remedy.",
  "You don't think that the -- that the remedy that the ICJ imposed in the case where the United States was before it as a party, that that would be the appropriate remedy? It was not suppression. It was reconsider this, taking account of the failure to notify and what might have happened if notice had been provided.",
  "But there wasn't any word in either of the ICJ judgments, if I recall them correctly, that said, United States, you have a suppression remedy, so you should suppress.",
  "But we do know, don't we, Mr. Gartlan, that if the treaty had been followed, it still would have been permissible for the police, having given Miranda warnings, to commence interrogation? The treaty does not require that the enforcing officials in this country immediately call the foreign consulate. Isn't that so?",
  "Promptness. And I think that the United States has told us it's generally done here somewhere between 24 and 72 hours. A suspect who has been given Miranda warnings as here -- the conversation with the police, the interrogation, could begin before that 24 hours or 72 hours expires.",
  "Yes.",
  "But in this case, wasn't it true that the trial counsel knew about the Vienna Convention right and, for whatever reason, thought his client would not be aided by talking to the Honduran counsel -- consul.",
  "Well, the problem at the trial level, I think, is you would be -- you couldn't make it at that stage because it's the very lawyer who's ineffective. Here, it was raised by a new counsel on appeal, and that's really the first opportunity it could come up because the -- the lawyer who didn't give this advice certainly isn't going to say, in -- in the course of the trial, I was ineffective. So -- and that's I think the point that the ICJ was trying to make when it said you couldn't use the procedural default rule.",
  "Is there any other relief sought by the Petitioner? There was the suppression request. Was there any other? Was there a request of the kind that the ICJ thought would be appropriate, which was, court, reconsider this and determine whether the defendant was prejudiced by the absence of Vienna Convention notice?",
  "There's a question I would like to ask you about the State. Now, if everything worked ideally, it would be the police officer, along with the Miranda warnings, says, would you like to call your consulate. You could do that if you wish. If it -- if the State has an obligation to give this information under the treaty, but many police officers don't know anything about any Vienna Convention, do judges, Federal judges, State judges, have an obligation, when they see that an alien defendant is before them, to, on the judge's own motion, ask the prosecutor has he been told about the Vienna Convention, and if not, the judge would have an obligation to do so?",
  "I thought the first time it was raised was on direct appeal by appellate counsel.",
  "And the reason for the denial?",
  "I think that counsel said that the -- the people at the consulate -- they tend to talk a lot?",
  "Has it worked the other way around when a young American citizen is detained in -- in a jail someplace abroad, and has the United States ever then -- what efforts have been made?",
  "Has it worked anyplace? Take Mexico, Turkey, any country you'd like.",
  "Is that all in Judge Bryson's decision? I certainly didn't see it there.",
  "I didn't see anything about irrebuttable presumption.",
  "Well, isn't it a concern that Congress didn't provide for compulsory licensing which this seems to have a very strong resemblance to? It says eBay wants to do this, so they're going to have to pay for it, but the patentee can't stop them. It just has -- in effect, has to license them to do it.",
  "Why is it your bottom line then, send it back with your four-factor test, because there seems to be some uncertainty whether that was applied?",
  "They say one lunch, but not if there's a weekly lunch, and the only person who gets left out is the person who filed a charge under title VII. That's -- a one-at-a-time curiosity the EEOC guidelines leave out, but if it's a routine lunch with all the preferred employees and they leave out the one who filed a title VII charge, that would fit within the EEOC's definition.",
  "But it wouldn't fit under your --",
  "Under your definition, lunch is lunch, and so there would never be -- there couldn't be --",
  "Well, does it or doesn't it? The -- the facts are simply that the manager takes out all the employees, except this one that filed the title VII charge, once a week. Is that --",
  "Does it once a week, and I'm not using any adjective to characterize it. It just happens once a week.",
  "But let's get the --",
  "What about the --",
  "-- what about the Seventh Circuit case that posed the question of same job, same character of work, except that the employee had flex time, which enabled her to take care of her disabled child when she could leave at 3:00, and she's just changed to -- same job except it's got to be 9:00 to 5:00. Would that fit within your definition?",
  "Even though the jury has made a finding that the only reason that was done was in retaliation for her having filed a complaint.",
  "Right.",
  "But you would say that's outside --",
  "-- that would be outside 704 if this is done deliberately in retaliation for filing a complaint. Just switch her from a work routine that she could easily manage and still take care of her family and to one that is impossible for her to manage.",
  "Not -- not --",
  "-- not every --",
  "Not everyone, but only the ones that would, in fact, deter a reasonable person from filing a charge. And that would not be every trivial --",
  "But that -- this is a peculiar effect on one person, but for most people --",
  "-- most people it wouldn't matter. But --",
  "So you're changing your answer. You originally told me that, no, that that wouldn't fit because it's the same job.",
  "But it didn't --",
  "-- it didn't cure. I mean, it was 37 days, right, that she went without pay?",
  "Not just 2 weeks. And she understandably experienced much stress in that time. She worried about how she would be able to feed her children, could she get them Christmas presents. That was -- there was nothing that she got, when it was determined that she hadn't been insubordinate, that compensated her for that stress and, indeed, for the medical expense that she incurred because she had that stress.",
  "But when -- when somebody is suspended, it seems to me that is as tangible as it can get. It gets registered officially. This person is suspended, and if she doesn't do something about it, she's out.",
  "But --",
  "-- official action is -- is different from -- the problem with Ellerth was that if there's nothing formally that had been done, the employer -- this -- Ellerth was concerned with vicarious liability, nothing official. There had been none -- the boss wouldn't know about it. But somebody who is suspended, that is an official -- that's a tangible action.",
  "That would have been impossible here because there was no one in that entire unit who could operate a forklift except this one employee.",
  "Is it -- is it -- was it in this category, this track category? Because it was something new for the employer. There hadn't been a forklift operator. I gather there had only been one before.",
  "Does your test cover the person who's a former employee who complained under title VII, wants a recommendation letter, and isn't given one for retaliation -- as retaliation for having complained under title VII?",
  "You won on the basis of the standard that the Sixth Circuit used, which was not your standard and not the EEOC standard. Why should this Court deal with anything other than that the petitioner's standard is unsatisfactory, that at least the Sixth Circuit standard -- why should the Court deal with the universe of cases when it has this case before it, two actions, and a unanimous Sixth Circuit judgment that says these two actions fall within 704?",
  "Don't you want us to exclude this ultimate employment decision? I think that's one thing. In order to win, you have to say what counts is the suspension and not the ultimate decision.",
  "So for you to win to preserve your Sixth Circuit victory, that would have to be ruled out.",
  "I thought the deadly weapon -- the definition of deadly weapon -- that that could include a revolver or a pistol. You -- you seem to be describing now deadly weapon. That's one thing, and that excludes guns. And then firearm, a discrete category. But I thought that deadly weapon includes at least pistols and revolvers.",
  "But -- but didn't the deadly weapon -- definition of deadly weapon include firearms?",
  "But with a 1 -- 1-year enhancement or -- I thought that that could apply in a case where the deadly weapon was a gun.",
  "Would you explain again why it was irrelevant whether the gun was operable or not?",
  "But to be a real gun, it has to be operable.",
  "But all that the jury found was deadly weapon because that's all they were asked to find.",
  "Why was deadly weapon put in by the prosecutor at all? If -- if you're right that this is not a deadly weapon case, this is strictly a firearm case, it's not a lesser included, here the prosecutor charged deadly weapon --",
  "-- to wit, a handgun. And then the special verdict form doesn't say one word about firearm. So couldn't the defendant expect, well, they charged the main thing? They charged me with deadly weapon, and they asked the jury to find deadly weapon.",
  "But in this -- in this case, Mr. Dreeben, we have a defendant ready, willing, and able to pay for an experienced lawyer in whom he has great trust. He's instead stuck with a younger, rather inexperienced lawyer, and he says, that doesn't fit within my Sixth Amendment right. I have a right to choose the counsel that I want and not the one that the court forces on me.",
  "But it was a junior counsel. As I understand it, the counsel that represented him finally, when the judge wrongfully refused to allow his chosen counsel to proceed, was one chosen as a junior by the more senior counsel, the one that defendant wanted.",
  "May I, Mr. Dreeben --",
  "But compared to what? You haven't fully stated what you would replace the automatic new trial with. And you said -- you started to say something about if the defendant could show that his preferred counsel would have pursued a different strategy. Is that it? Or would he have to go beyond that and show that that different strategy would have a greater chance of success than the strategy that was in fact pursued?",
  "Does different outcome mean --",
  "-- if the defendant is found guilty, he would have been acquitted?",
  "You said you had -- you said you had -- your first preference would be --",
  "-- different strategy and would have been acquitted with that strategy. What's your other --",
  "Are you saying that this -- trial is -- is one thing. Appeal -- but you say he would do the appeal over? He'd do the appellate argument over? Do the petition for cert over with counsel of choice? There's a different stage involved.",
  "Are you -- are you relying at all on the effect that you want the Court's decision to have on trial judges and prosecutors, that is, a judge who knows if he disqualifies a lawyer who shouldn't be disqualified, that there will be an automatic new trial? And the prosecutor who's standing by -- by the way, what did the prosecutor -- did the prosecutor take the position in this case when the judge says, I don't want that lawyer to be in my courtroom?",
  "Mr. Fisher, remind me in bringing up the plea question. I thought one of the reasons why this defendant wanted this particular lawyer is that this lawyer made good bargains with the prosecutor. Was that not so?",
  "I thought they said there isn't if the question is remedied.",
  "What about, Mr. Zas, that the court thought it was home free on the Speedy Trial Act? After all, it had gotten a waiver for all time. Isn't that why the 165 days?",
  "Who -- who could complain? Because in -- in all of these instances, it was the defendant who sought the enlarged time. In fact, even though the judge had given -- gotten this all-purpose waiver, he didn't give defense counsel as much time as defense counsel asked for to -- to investigate the genuineness of the bond.",
  "As long as they're not in jail pending trial.",
  "This -- this was a judge who apparently was doing this as a -- a matter of standard practice. He had a form that he whipped out. It must be a very old form. It looked like it was typed on a regular typewriter.",
  "How can we say it's purely procedural with respect to the first time? I mean, the reason that was given is I have to -- I need this time to find out if these really peculiar looking bonds are genuine. Now, the -- the Second Circuit said -- and I don't understand why they said this -- this is a complex case so that continuance is warranted. Was this a complex case?",
  "In this -- is there a statute of limitations problem in -- in these cases if their dismissal is without prejudice?",
  "Well, in this case, the judge told the defendant I've got a solution to this. Here's my form.",
  "Which court?",
  "The -- is that -- is there any reason to believe that the judge, of course, would clarify it and say the ends of justice, if we took your remand solution.",
  "Well --",
  "It seems to me that in this case, that -- that all-purpose waiver that the judge, and not for the first time, proposed is -- is what caused all this. And -- and my question that I had is knowing that this was the judge's practice -- and indeed, he had written about it -- did the U.S. Attorney's Office try to do something to say, look, the act doesn't permit that kind of thing?",
  "Are you -- are you relying to any extent on something that I think you brought up? He also could not have been tried because the prosecutor was having a difficult pregnancy and she was on extended leave, which was occurring in this period?",
  "Is it? Is it? I thought the -- there was a reference to hours of consultants, but not expenses.",
  "But it also found that there were dozens of statutes, I think -- didn't Justice Scalia list in his opinion for -- it went on for a couple of pages, including footnotes? I think it was over 30 that did mention experts. It mentioned attorneys' fees and expert fees.",
  "Mr. Salmons, there's one difference, a marked difference, between this statute and the others, and that is, in -- in many of these cases, it is the consultant that is the primary, perhaps exclusive, aide to the parent. There's not a case where they have these determinations, a lawyer is in the front line. Even in this very case, wasn't it true that it was the consultant who was the aide to the parent and there was no lawyer on the scene?",
  "Mr. Vladeck, why -- if that was what Congress had in mind, then how do you explain the multiple statutes that are listed in Casey that say, in the text of the statute, witness fees?",
  "Well, what -- Mr. Vladeck, may I stop you there? Because the parents are always the plaintiff. It's not the child. The parents are representing the child.",
  "So prevailing party is identical to parents. The parents are the ones who prevail.",
  "What about testing? Isn't testing --",
  "Mr. Vladeck, you have -- you referred to the section on GAO reporting --",
  "-- as an assist to help you include consultant fees in -- in costs. But how do you explain the -- the provision in this very statute that says attorneys' fees can be reduced? Congress explicitly provided that you could reduce attorneys' fees -- this is in 1415(i)(3)(F) -- and not one word about reducing the costs of testing fees or consulting fees.",
  "Then why -- then it would be unnecessary to have done that for attorneys' fees.",
  "But it's not -- if the parents make a reasonable effort, but they lose, it's not going to be free. I mean, the -- the statute gives them --",
  "-- a right to oppose the school board's choice, and if what you say about making it easier on parents of limited resources, they're told it's going to be a gamble if you lose, you don't get your fees.",
  "Well, what --",
  "What do you make of the very name that the State gave, not acquitted by reason -- not not-guilty by reason of insanity, but guilty, except insane. Guilty of what? Guilty of the charge. And the charge is first-degree murder. So, even if insanity is found, apparently that's defined to be \"guilty of the charge, except insane,\" therefore not subject to criminal punishment.",
  "Mr. Goldberg, may I ask you to clarify one thing about your argument? You say that you should have permitted -- been permitted to introduce this evidence to show that this act was not - - the \"act\" being, kill a police officer -- was not done intentionally or knowingly. But you seem to indicate that Clark could have been convicted, under the Arizona code, of some degree of murder. Am I right about that? And, if so, what degree?",
  "And what would --",
  "What --",
  "What was the second -- the definition of \"second degree\"?",
  "Well, what --",
  "May I just ask, what -- if the proof you'd like to introduce is that the defendant considered the police officer to be an alien, why would he have any intent? Why wouldn't your argument go, as well, to second degree?",
  "Mr. Howe, would you explain to me how the State has proved intentional -- not intentional killing, but of a police officer? If that's the charge, that he intended to kill a police officer, how does the State meet its burden on a police officer if the testimony on the other side is, \"I did not understand that this human that I killed was a police officer\"?",
  "I see that on the --",
  "-- the State side, so the State has introduced evidence from which a trier could conclude he intended to kill a police officer. But he wants to introduce, on the other side, \"I didn't have that intent. In fact, I had delusions. I thought I killed an alien.\" But he's not allowed to introduce that evidence --",
  "-- to counter --",
  "-- the State's proof, as I understand what the Arizona law is.",
  "Mr. Howe, one of the things that puzzled me about your position is, you said, \"Under Arizona law, while this doesn't come in under mens rea, it does affect sentencing.\" I think you said that the -- his mental state is properly taken into account in the sentencing. And, by that, did you mean just the length of the incarceration, or the place of the incarceration?",
  "But here, there --",
  "-- was a charge, \"intended to kill a police officer.\" It could have been just \"intended to kill.\" And I think Mr. Goldberg conceded that \"intended to kill\" would have been a proper conviction, but not \"intended to kill a police officer\" --",
  "-- unless he's allowed to counter that add-on.",
  "Yes, but you must take issue with the this is only a quick determination, unless you also agree with -- disagree with Justice -- Judge Easterbrook when he said, the decision for the Federal court is only two things. It's either remand or dismiss the action. That is, the Federal court under no circumstances will keep this case for trial. Either it will dismiss it outright or it will remand.",
  "Yes, but that was not -- certainly not the Seventh Circuit's understanding.",
  "Mr. Frederick, as I understand it, at least the Seventh Circuit's fix on this case was that the Federal courts have adjudicatory authority to do one thing and to do that one thing finally, that is, to decide whether this is a case that cannot be brought in any court or whether it's a case that Congress has left over for the States still to deal with. That was the whole theory of the Seventh Circuit, that this is no quick look. The -- the Federal courts are making a final determination. And I think that would exclude what Justice Souter has suggested.",
  "Mr. Frederick, will -- would you please explain something to me that you just said? You said that our complaint isn't about fraud. It isn't about deception. It's about negligence. But the Seventh Circuit reported and seemed to have no doubt about it that the complaints in this set of cases were based on allegations of deceit and manipulation, not mismanagement.",
  "The -- the Seventh Circuit said precisely, in particular, they did not argue in their briefs and did not maintain at oral argument, despite the court's invitation that their suits allege mismanagement rather than deceit or manipulation. So is that totally wrong, that you did do it -- mention it in your briefs?",
  "Then how could the Seventh Circuit have gotten it that wrong?",
  "Of course, if the Federal district court says there is preclusion, therefore, case dismissed, that would be reviewable.",
  "But they can always amend the complaint and pare it down and say now -- we -- we complained all along about negligence. Now, Judge, we are complaining about mismanagement on the defendants' part, nothing more. No manipulation. Cut out -- they could have such a complaint, and would that be precluded if -- if they started afresh in the State court and they said, we are complaining about mismanagement? We're not charging anyone with fraud or deception. Couldn't -- isn't that a viable claim?",
  "But then, Mr. Perry, there's a whole case. See, what's peculiar about this is Congress says it's not really preemption. I think Justice Stevens pointed that out in Dabit. It is preclusion. It says this action shall not exist. Period. Not as a State claim, not as a Federal claim. And it wanted the Federal courts to monitor that determination. It surely didn't want -- if -- if the State claim is outside that preclusion, didn't want the Federal courts to sit and have a whole trial on what is a non-diverse, no Federal question case. I mean, it just seems -- if you're going to imagine what Congress wouldn't want in the Federal court, that would be it.",
  "But now there you must admit that you are departing from Judge Easterbrook because Judge Easterbrook said this statute gives the Federal court adjudicatory authority to do one thing, to decide whether there's preemption or preclusion or, if not, then to remand. So they make -- they make one determination and bow out he said. And you're telling us, no, they don't bow out. They can, if they want to, keep the State law claim and adjudicate it on the merits.",
  "Yes. I'm simply asking about the Seventh Circuit's understanding of the case. It says, after making the decision that 77p(b) requires, the district court has nothing else to do. Dismissal and remand are the only options. So Judge Easterbrook or the Seventh Circuit clearly did not think that there was any adjudication on the merits of a State law claim to be made. He said it twice. One is at 14a of the joint appendix, and the other is 11a.",
  "But I don't think that any of those cases are comparable, in that the removed case is going to be tried someplace. Take a diversity case. The Federal court has to decide -- and it's removed -- whether the parties are really diverse. If it decides that they are really diverse, it keeps the case and it's adjudicated in Federal court. If it decides they're not, the case is adjudicated in the State court. But here, the determination is, is there a claim to be tried anyplace? And if there is preclusion under SLUSA, then it's not a question of, as Judge Easterbrook put a menu, where is -- it's not a where question. It's a whether question. And so that makes -- makes SLUSA quite different from other cases where the -- the case is going to be tried someplace. Here, the decision to be made is, is this going to be tried or not? Is it -- is it a claim or is not a claim?",
  "Yes, but -- but there is also exceptions to the rule of claim and issue preclusion, and when you don't have an opportunity to appeal because the system doesn't let you appeal, then you can say, Judge, don't give this preclusive effect. I did not have that full and fair opportunity because I was unable to appeal. And I think that that's a solid preclusion law.",
  "And a Nassau County court could say, we're not going to treat that as preclusive. They didn't have a fair chance to appeal. And that would be all right.",
  "But in any case, you said Easterbrook made only one mistake.",
  "But he made another one when he said, it's now or never for appellate review. That preclusion question could come to this Court if it went -- the case went back and the Nassau County said, well, I'm going to follow the Federal court, I'm not going to -- at the end of the road, the preclusion question would be open for this Court to review.",
  "Now or never. The question is not can you -- is there an appeal or does 1447(d) bar it. The question is whether an action under State law is preempted. And suppose this case had gone along in the Federal -- in the State court, and the defense of preclusion is made in the State court. The State court could certainly decide that question. Nobody removed it. So the State court has competence to decide that question, doesn't it?",
  "And in -- this Court could decide it on review.",
  "Was that a case where there was no possibility of reviewing the decision of the court of first instance?",
  "And why --",
  "You're -- you're positing a -- a State court that's going to, by golly, give that Federal decision preclusive effect even though, say, the Restatement of Judgments says -- now if a decision didn't -- if there was no opportunity for review, then that's a ground for refusing preclusive effect.",
  "I thought Munsingwear was about mootness.",
  "But not if the litigant asks to have it vacated under Munsingwear, the litigant would be entitled to have it vacated. So it was a foot fault and the -- the Court held the counsel to the mistake that had been made.",
  "How do you answer the argument, the third argument, that Mr. Frederick stressed that is, that Congress provided specifically in the Class Action Fairness Act, a couple of other acts, and 1447 itself with respect to civil rights actions removable under 1443? In all those cases, it provided specifically for review of remand decisions, and here the silence is deafening.",
  "I don't know what -- what Congress' knowledge about Thermtron was a district judge who said, they removed this case, but I'm much too busy. This court is much too busy to mess with stuff that belongs in the State court. I'm remanding it. That was just too much, and the Federal court --",
  "One thing that was left out of the succession of acts -- Utah provides for telephone warrants, and there was no attempt to do that. Once they checked to -- to determine that there was probable cause to enter, they could have called for a warrant, but they didn't. Is there a reason why they didn't?",
  "Are the police instructed -- the city police instructed about when the telephone warrant procedure is appropriate?",
  "In connection with the answer you just gave, it doesn't matter then? If it's an ongoing crime, they can go in? It doesn't matter whether it would be a misdemeanor or a felony? It doesn't matter how grave the crime is?",
  "This wasn't -- this wasn't a domestic violence case. It wasn't anybody inside calling the police and crying, danger, rescue me. It was an outsider who complained about the noise. So I am wondering why you are emphasizing the prevent somebody from being hurt instead of they're disturbing the peace and the police have a right to protect the neighborhood. It seems to me that that's an easier argument to make.",
  "I thought that probable cause was conceded, and I thought that the Utah courts didn't question that there was probable cause.",
  "You don't -- you can't attribute what you just said to the trial court, and you emphasize the trial court's findings. The trial court said about what went wrong what the police should have done, as required under the Fourth Amendment, was knock on the door. The evidence is there was a loud, tumultuous thing going on and that the occupants probably would not have heard him. But under the Fourth Amendment, he has an obligation to at least attempt before entering. Now, that's a statement that what went wrong was they didn't knock even though it was likely a futile act. Do you -- do you agree that that's a correct statement of the law, that what the police didn't do that they should have done was knock?",
  "Where did the -- where did the trial court say that in the findings of fact?",
  "I'm looking at the findings of fact. They're in the petition appendix at page 46 and 47. I don't see anything that has been specifically identified by the finder of fact as inadequate, other than the failure to knock. Where -- where did the -- where does the court say it doesn't rise to the level of exigent circumstances?",
  "Yes, but what it says right after that to explain is it would have been sufficient. What he -- what he should have done was knock, and that would have supplied all that was necessary.",
  "Well, there seemed to be agreement that they couldn't have made their presence known because the noise inside was so loud that they would not have been heard.",
  "The Utah Supreme Court seemed to be puzzled by your failure to raise the Utah protection against the -- the counterpart to the Fourth Amendment. They seemed to suggest that their own constitution afforded greater protection to the privacy of the home. Was there a reason why you argued only the U.S. Constitution and not the State constitution?",
  "My point was simply that this was not a 911 call from a distressed spouse. This was a neighbor saying they're keeping me up at night, so that the -- the police response was to the noise, not to the violence.",
  "But is it -- is it like in a -- in a -- take a civil case where the judge gives the standard charge about, \"Imagine two plates and a scale, and if they are in equipoise, then you find against the party who has the burden of proof\" -- if we make that comparison, then it's pretty clear that the burden of proof is on the defendant if the answer is -- to the equipoise question is, \"Then you must come in with a death verdict.\"",
  "Can you go back and because the -- the parties seem to have different views about it? I think you said it was required by OPM to have this reimbursement term, and the other side said that there was no requirement from the Government agency that you include the reimbursement term.",
  "But that -- all that says is that OPM looked at these terms and it thought they were okay. It's not -- it doesn't show that OPM required these -- this as a condition for Empire to serve as the insurer.",
  "But there's nothing in the statute that speaks about a Federal forum. And if you look at this entire picture, you're seeking reimbursement, and you're seeking reimbursement based on a tort recovery. And why wouldn't the most sensible, the most natural thing for a legislature, if they thought about it, be to say, well, that claim for reimbursement ought to come in on the coattails of the tort claim? You don't need to make a whole separate Federal case out -- out of it. Why would Congress want these claims to be subject to a separate Federal case?",
  "Well, it's because there's an anterior lawsuit that everything rides on that State court suit. There wouldn't be any recovery from which you could claim reimbursement were it not for that State court lawsuit.",
  "You don't have any such problem here. There's no conflict between the New York law -- you certainly could have gone into that lawsuit and --",
  "I could see if this were -- what we were talking about everything is -- the insurance of a Federal employee and questions about coverage, questions about benefits, all of that between the employee and the carrier. But this comes up because we have a third party who enters the picture in an estate law claim. So I don't think you can just say, well, everything is -- this whole thing is -- is all a Federal contract.",
  "I thought that the -- the purpose of the preemption provision in this statute was related to benefits and coverage. Some States have mandatory coverage for this or that. The case that was mentioned is the chiropractor. And the -- in the Federal scheme, the Federal administrator didn't want to be saddled with whatever the particular packages that the States had. So the coverage and the benefits -- those were to be determined on the Federal level, and you weren't supposed to be saddled with whatever the State thought would be good to have in the plan.",
  "What -- you -- you might follow along with that perfectly well if you're talking about the beneficiary, the Federal employee, saying I'm entitled to a certain coverage or I'm entitled to certain benefits. You would expect that suit to be in Federal court. But why would you expect what piece of the tort recovery the carrier will get to be in Federal court?",
  "But how do you answer the question that I think Justice Breyer was -- was getting at, that it's -- it's a -- the -- what's in it for the carrier? Nothing. As -- if -- if every penny that the carrier collects is going to go into the U.S. Treasury, then why does the carrier care?",
  "Mr. Jett, do I take it, from what you've just said, that you are recognizing this is a question of Federal common law and not due process, so that if Congress placed the burden on the defendant, there would be no constitutional infirmity? You're just arguing that this is the Federal common law?",
  "You -- you -- then you think that Congress could not say that the defendant has the burden on the question of duress.",
  "Mr. Jett, there's one piece of this picture that's different -- that distinguishes duress from, say, self-defense. If it's self-defense, you take a snapshot on the scene. You know exactly what happened. No one taking a picture of these gun purchases would have any idea of all of this. And the judge, when asked to give -- to allow the defense of duress, said, it's frankly a close call in my mind, but when it is a close call, better give it than not. Now, he thought that the defendant would have the burden of proof. Perhaps the judge would call that close question the other way if he thought he was saddling the prosecution with the ultimate burden of persuasion.",
  "But that's based on the defendant's -- the prosecution's conduct. The Government's conduct in entrapment concerns how the Government behaved.",
  "But if the Government is out there trying to achieve that result, it's quite different from the Government having nothing to do --",
  "Do --",
  "Doesn't that come from an underlying principle that your position is not entirely consistent with, that is, that the defendant is presumed innocent? So it's not as Justice Scalia may have suggested that, well, he would plead guilty, but we're going to let him -- we presume that the defendant is innocent. That's why the prosecutor has to have the burden on all issues. I thought that was the underlying principle.",
  "What about the insanity defense?",
  "What about self-defense?",
  "Do you take into account that this was not something that occurred at once? This was a long-term relationship. There were many opportunities in which she might have, when her children were with the grandmother, say, gone to the police.",
  "I think it's -- it's a little more difficult in your case because you're pursuing an interlocutory appeal, which you were allowed to do only because you've got double certification and you got certification on the questions that the district court addressed. You can't expand a 1292(b) order to include things that were not decided below.",
  "And they weren't --",
  "-- they weren't --",
  "-- they weren't -- your problem is you don't have a final judgment. The only way that you can get even to the court of appeals is on that 1292(b) order. And I thought that the function of 1292(b) was to say specify the questions that are so important that they have to be decided and appealed before there's a final judgment. And whatever there might have -- whatever one might read into a question presented, I don't think that 1292(b) orders have ever been treated that way.",
  "If -- if --",
  "-- if Mohawk were a partnership instead of a corporation --",
  "-- the partnership is an association of individuals.",
  "So if the answer is yes, if Mohawk had been a partnership, you would not have this particular objection.",
  "So it's only the corporate form.",
  "That's --",
  "Well, that's why I'm asking you about the partnership because it is an association of individuals. So I'm not clear on what your answer is. No partnership could be treated just like a corporation. They're not an individual? Or partnerships are okay because there's not a separate entity. It's a -- it's a association of individuals.",
  "No. Would the --",
  "I thought your position was it shouldn't be read at all because --",
  "-- this -- this Court is a court of review, and to take a question that was never certified, even to the court of appeals, to have this Court address it seems to me very strange. It seems to me to erode rather starkly the final judgment rule, which we don't have here.",
  "You're envisioning that one case will take care of it. That is, if the Court rules against you, that's the end of it. You can't come back with another inadequacy because you'd be barred by claim preclusion. On the other hand, if the State comes up with an acceptable alternative, you agree to it. That's one thing. The Court holds -- but there wouldn't be a second episode I think. One way or another this proceeding would end it.",
  "You said --",
  "You said there were other States. You mentioned California. There was a proposal by the State. It couldn't be executed. What was the experience -- you mentioned a couple of other cases where the particular combination of drugs was successfully challenged, but then the State did what?",
  "Well, what did they have? There was the Sims case. No -- no -- certainly not in the legislation. There's no rule that emerges. But you did know that there was a lethal injection procedure that had been prescribed for another prisoner, and yet you didn't challenge the lethal injection at that time. Why did you wait until so late?",
  "Have they, in fact, changed the procedure for the lethal injection?",
  "But there's no statute and there's no regulation that requires Florida to do that.",
  "But there is no statute, no regulation. That means the executive can do what it will. There's nothing that binds them to the way it was done in Sims' case.",
  "And I suppose that's -- that's the complaint. If there was a procedure in place, we could address it. If Florida reserves to itself the ability to change at any time, well, that's -- we want to be told what it will be in our particular case so we have a target that we can aim at.",
  "Would he have to come up --",
  "-- with, as you suggest, an alternative that would be acceptable? Suppose there had been a hearing and it was proved more probable than not that in some cases -- not in all, but in some cases -- use of this injection would cause excruciating pain. Would the Petitioner who is objecting being exposed to that have to come up with an alternative in order to avoid the risk of excruciating pain?",
  "Well, my question to you is -- I take it you're answering yes, that if they prove that some people will be subject to excruciating pain, that's not good enough unless the Petitioner proposes an alternative, that it's all right for the State to expose someone to the risk of what has -- what has been determined to be the risk of excruciating pain as long as the Petitioner himself doesn't come up with an alternative.",
  "Well, because there's been no hearing. We've never gotten past is this -- can you open the door through 1983, and I -- I still don't understand what your answer is to my question. Now, I'm supposing that we do have the 1983 hearing, and the judge says, yes, I agree with the Petitioner's experts. In some cases there will be excruciating pain. Then you say, but, Judge, they haven't come up with an alternative.",
  "And the judge says, you're both right. Some people have excruciating pain, but there's been no alternative suggested. Bottom line of that particular case would be?",
  "So the answer is yes.",
  "The court, having found that some people will be subject to excruciating pain, still no Eighth Amendment violation because the Petitioner hasn't come up with an alternative.",
  "What about the risks that the prisoner will die an excruciating death? I'm asking you the same question that I asked co-counsel. What happens then? He hasn't been able to come up with an alternative, but the judge finds it credible that he may be exposed to an excruciating death. What then?",
  "But would --",
  "Why not? Because he's saying I am not asking for this to be one day further along. I'm just asking the State to give me a death that will not require me to suffer excruciating pain.",
  "Would it have been possible for these police to get a no-knock warrant?",
  "But this is a -- this is a place -- a case in which the warrant was for drugs. Is that not so?",
  "Going back to my question, isn't it then a reasonable assumption, based on the police experience in case after case, that where there -- where narcotics are housed, there is often a gun and there is ease of disposal, couldn't the police simply say this is a narcotics search and therefore we don't need to knock and announce because those circumstances will be present in most cases?",
  "Do you think - -",
  "-- that the jury in this very case understood that, given the questions that were asked?",
  "What about the -- what actually went on? I mean, the jury first came in and said, \"What if we can't decide? Can we decide by majority?\" And then the question was asked, that seemed to indicate the jurors' understanding, that we take all those factors that you told us about, and we just take those factors into account. And there were clarifying instructions asked by the defense that were not given.",
  "Well - -",
  "-- California itself recognized that there was a problem here of jury confusion. And now they have amended the provision so that it would be clear to any juror.",
  "Where does this factor (k) come from? What was the source of it?",
  "Well, the prosecutor's closing was schizophrenic, because he said, \"But really this shouldn't matter.\"",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Johnson, when I asked you about the derivation of factor (k), you gave me a California statutory cite, but is there -- does it come from any model code? Does any other State have such a provision? How widespread is it?",
  "How many States have an instruction that talks about extenuating the circumstances of the crime?",
  "Which -- California hasn't had it since 1983, right?",
  "California hasn't used this instruction since 1983.",
  "So, is this a one-of-a-kind case? I mean, you said, in your brief, that the Ninth Circuit decision threatens many other valid California death judgments. But these would all have to be rather ancient cases.",
  "And --",
  "-- that wouldn't wash out, on the other grounds?",
  "But wouldn't a jury think all this evidence must have some purpose? The only purpose it could have is to -- is to propel us toward life rather than death. I mean, the bulk of the evidence at the sentencing phase -- wasn't it? -- was how he behaved when he was a prisoner before.",
  "Even so, there was - -",
  "-- there was extensive testimony about his prospects for doing good in a prison setting.",
  "And the jury must have thought there's some reason why the judge allowed that evidence in. And what reason could it be, other than to show that, if he is given life, he will be a good prisoner?",
  "Mr. Multhaup, one aspect of your argument I wish you would clarify, and that's in your brief at page 20, footnote 3. As I understand it, you are saying -- you are not challenging factor -- the factor (k) instruction as excluding Skipper evidence. Your challenge is limited to this particular case. Is that what you're saying in that footnote?",
  "And the - -",
  "-- the \"much more\" is the questions that the jury asked?",
  "And yours is both pre- and post- -- that is, you're referring to conduct that took place before this crime was committed -- that is, his prior incarceration -- and asking the jury to project that forward to say, \"That's how he behaved in prison, before he committed this most recent crime, and that's how he's likely to behave again.\"",
  "Is it - -",
  "Is it -- if this is an ambiguous statute, do you -- what mileage do you get from Barrett? There is certainly an argument that what was - - Congress was trying to do was to codify that practice of saying, \"If there is analogous felony -- if there is analogous crime under State law, that should be included.\" And that made good sense.",
  "What - -",
  "-- about the - -",
  "And that - -",

  "Because - -",
  "Because the length of the sentence counts heavily in the attorney general's assessment, is that --",
  "Mr. Kneedler --",
  "-- if there is room for more than one construction of this statute, it seems to me unseemly, in the immigration context, to say that two people who have committed the identical acts, one of them is barred from ever coming back, doesn't have any of the dispensations, and the other does, because of the happenstance of the State in which they were convicted. That kind of disuniformity in an area where the Constitution expressly charges Congress with authority to make uniform laws, it's -- doesn't that uniform-law specification in the Constitution tug in the direction of the interpretation that Mr. Long was --",
  "-- presenting to us?",
  "Then, in those cases, you can say the conduct would constitute a felony under the Federal statute; but here, if I recall correctly, the amount involved would not have qualified for possession with intent to distribute, under Federal law.",
  "Mr. Kneedler - -",
  "Do you - -",
  "Barrett suggests otherwise. If what Congress was trying to do was to codify that practice of looking for an analogous crime under State law, that's -- that seems to me the -- at least what Congress was trying do.",

  "If it -- if the -- if the - - if the licensee came into court and said, \"I'm not contesting this patent,\" that would be the end of it, wouldn't it?",
  "Why aren't you -- you said, \"The only question before the court is jurisdictional.\" If that's so, why isn't your position that the Federal Circuit put the wrong label on this, that license is listed in 8(c) as an affirmative defense; so, whatever the outcome should be, the wrong label should -- is -- was used. It shouldn't be a subject-matter jurisdiction, shouldn't be 12(b)(1); it should be an 8(c) affirmative defense. And then the -- you're out of the jurisdiction box, but you're left with the same underlying question.",
  "But what - -",
  "-- good would it do? Suppose we said, \"Federal Circuit, you put the wrong label on it. It should be 12(b)(6), not 12(b)(1), or perhaps even 8(c), affirmative defense\"?

  "So, you have rejected both of the Government's suggestions on what the patent holder might do to protect itself. Do you have anything concrete that you would concede the patent holder could do?",
  "Was that a case about Article III case or controversy?",
  "But the question - -",
  "The question that is presented to us -- whatever they suggested at this oral argument that wasn't in III, the question it presented to us is, Was the Federal Circuit right when they said, \"You have no access to a declaratory judgment unless there is a reasonable apprehension that you will be sued\"?",
  "Could the - -",
  "-- patent holder take the position that, \"I -- Sooner or later, I'm going to have to fight out validity with someone, and might as well do it sooner rather than later, so I am not going to raise the license as a defense\"? Would that be a \"case or controversy\"?",
  "Is it -- it's -- no, the patent -- the licensee is coming into court and wants a declaration of invalidity so it can manufacture without the fear of an infringement suit.",
  "Yes.",
  "And the patent holder chooses not to plead the license -- chooses not to plead the license. Wouldn't the patent holder have that option?",
  "I don't mean their view. I mean, they start a lawsuit. They say, \"We're -- we want\" --",
  "-- \"we want a declaration of infringement.\" And the patent holder doesn't take the position that you're taking; instead says, \"I'm prepared to fight this out now. I know that I have the license, which could be an affirmative defense, but I'm not going to raise it. I'm going to go head to head on the validity of this patent.\" Would that be a case or controversy?",
  "So, even - -",

  "But that wasn't -- the District Court, in this very case, seemed to say, \"I think this suit should go forward, but there's Gen-Probe, and I must follow Gen-Probe.\" The District Court, at least as I read it, seemed to think that Gen-Probe moved in a different direction from where the Federal Circuit was before.",
  "But what -- but jurisdiction is a question of power, Does the Court have the power to do this? A discretion question is different. It's, \"We have the power to entertain this case, but, as a matter of equity, we're not going to do so.\" The power question, I think, is a -- one that's -- it's either yes or no, either the court has the power, or doesn't.",
  "Mr. Lamken, the point has been made that there are many indications that what Congress had in mind was ordinary civil action in a court. In addition to finding this provision solely in title 28, the judiciary code, and not in title 5, there's also, if you read the following provision, 2416, time for commencing actions brought by the United States. And then it tells us the tolling periods. And, in doing that, it refers twice to the \"defendant,\" which is a term that's used in civil proceedings, not administrative proceedings.",

  "But the administrative remedy that you just conceded is a counterpart to a private right of action, or isn't it? Would you get the same thing? I complained to the agency, and say, I didn't get -- the pay phone provider wasn't paid, and X under the commission's regulations was supposed to pay it. So I complained against X. Could I get before the FCC exactly what I could get in court, so that we're only talking about which form is proper, or is there a difference in the remedy?",
  "And before the agency, you don't get counsel fees?",
  "Are you making the point that Chief Judge Ginsburg made in the D.C. Circuit that it is necessarily unjust and unreasonable to refuse to pay a charge that is fair and reasonable?",
  "Are there regulations, FCC regulations, the violation of which would not be unfair and unreasonable?",
  "Mr. Phillips, the fundamental problem, at least for me, in this case is that there was no objection at all at trial to the instruction that the judge gave on negligence. There was an instruction requested by the defendant on contributory negligence, which read, \"such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to cause his injury.\" That was the only instruction objected to, because the refusal to give that instruction. But you seem to be using that as a lever to attack the instruction on negligence to which no objection was made.",
  "Mr. Phillips, the defendant requested a charge on contributory negligence that read, \"such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to cause his injuries.\" You didn't want the direct relationship, you didn't ask for that. You asked for one that said, \"such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to his injury.\" Now you are saying that that was -- what you asked for was an incorrect charge.",
  "Perhaps my memory is faulty, but as I recall your opening brief, many pages were devoted to what instruction should have been given on railroad negligence. You were dealing not simply with what seems to be the question presented, that is, was the instruction on contributory negligence wrong, because it said -- it didn't use the in whole or in part language. Instead it said directly caused. So that's the limit of what we can deal with, whether the in whole or in part should have been in the contributory negligence. But it was your brief that spent a lot of time talking about the proper standard for the railroad's negligence.",
  "But you didn't object to the charge that was given on negligence. You didn't object to the in whole or in part. So that should be out of the case.",
  "You're not taking them up on any argument when you spent half your brief arguing about what the proper standard was for the railroad's negligence.",
  "What was wrong with the instruction, in your view of the case, that was given, instruction number 13, negligence of plaintiff directly contributed to cause his injuries?",
  "Would you have in your ideal instruction the words proximate cause given to the jury, that defendant's negligence must be the proximate cause of plaintiff's injury?",
  "Would you?",
  "But in your model instruction, in your correct instruction, would the jury be told, in order to hold the defendant liable, you must find the defendant's negligence is the proximate cause of plaintiff's injury?",
  "Even though almost universally, the term proximate cause has been criticized as totally incomprehensible to juries?",
  "But you concede that the error would always be harmless if you have a trial before a petit jury, and all of the elements are instructed to be found by the jury?",
  "Did the U.S. Attorney in this case oppose the motion to quash the indictment?",
  "Yes.",
  "But you're making the concession only for purposes of this case. That is, in another case you would be free to say the word \"attempt\" is good enough; you don't have to spell out in the indictment a particular overt act.",
  "Do we know -- do we have the grand jury transcripts, so do we know that, in fact, evidence was put before the grand jury that false identifications were presented at the border?",
  "How do you distinguish the mail -- the letter carrier case that Justice Breyer posed, because there you said even though there was no evidence at all of what this person was, if the petit jury found it, that would not be subject to review. I don't think you answered Justice Breyer and he said if you concede that, the failure to introduce any evidence that this person was a letter carrier.",
  "Were you, were you surprised at trial by the evidence that the defendant had submitted two false identifications? Was the first time you heard about that at trial?",
  "But were you, was there any element of surprise in this trial? Did you not know beforehand that the Government was going to present evidence of two false identifications?",
  "So there was no lack of notice; there was no surprise.",
  "Well, surely submitting false identification could be a overt act.",
  "Is there any doubt about that?",
  "Yes, but you knew that - - you had the file. You knew the Government was going to prove this. And you also knew it was an overt act.",
  "Does the Government have to pick one overt act and say that's it, when it introduces evidence of a whole string of them?",
  "Suppose this indictment charged not an attempt to enter, but unlawful entry. Then the indictment would be sufficient, right? There wouldn't be any problem with it?",
  "It charged, not an attempt, but an unlawful entry. Anything missing from the indictment?",
  "But substantive offense is one thing. Lesser included, I think you said earlier it couldn't be a lesser included because it's subject to the same punishment. So it is not lesser?",
  "Why is that, why is that so? Why isn't the middle sentence, just like what the guideline -- what the guideline would indicate? And if a Federal court would say, if I sentence within the guideline, that will be presumptively valid, as many courts have held. Not this Court yet. That would be presumptively valid. And if I go outside, I have to give a reason that will survive appellate review. Well, why isn't the middle sentence identical in function to the Federal sentencing guidelines advice?",
  "What would you think would be necessary, what would be the least change California would have to make to bring its system into compliance with our decisions?",
  "And they can't be a fact -- in California, it can't be a fact found by the jury, as Justice Stevens pointed out. That's a significant difference.",
  "We're concerned here with the court of -- the role, if any, that a circuit court, that opinions of courts other than this Court have in determining whether law is clearly established. Do you exclude entirely from the province of what is proper for the Federal court to consider any court of appeals, Federal court of appeals decisions?",
  "So that the only thing -- your argument is the only thing that is proper to look to are decisions of this Court, and that if you don't have a case on all fours, as we have no buttons case, then that's the end of it?",
  "So would there be any difference if this had been a post-AEDPA -- if the circuit precedent had been post-AEDPA.",
  "And that language came from one of our opinions, didn't it? The branding language?",
  "So you can't fault the court for just saying it isn't that. Mr. Ott says it isn't that.",
  "But in here it -- you agree that the California court has as much authority to say what Federal law is as the Ninth Circuit, right? They are on a par. Ninth Circuit decisions in no way binds the Supreme Court of California. Isn't that so?",
  "So that this state court of appeals chose to be respectful to the Ninth Circuit to consider what it had said, doesn't sound to me like a very strong argument.",
  "But in Williams and Flynn and all of the cases that we have had, whatever way they went, it was always the government requiring a defendant to do something, wear prison clothes, appear in court with shackles. And in the case that went for the government, the extra officers in the courtroom. We haven't had a case, have we, where it is spectator conduct as opposed to government conduct that's being attacked?",
  "That certainly goes beyond where our precedent leaves off. That is, we are dealing with direct impositions by government in a way that poses an unacceptable risk of prejudice to the defendant.",
  "But there have been -- haven't there been court decisions that have held that buttons didn't compromise a fair trial right?",
  "So in assessing the reasonableness of the California Supreme Court's decision, how could we say Federal law was clearly established when other courts considering our precedent have gone the other way?",
  "There was a time when the trial judge said stop. Was there not? He initially denied the motion.",
  "But I thought that there was a time in the course of the trial when he told the family members to stop wearing the buttons.",
  "Why is it a wholly State law claim if the principal matter is whether this Federal employee is immune from suit? That's the threshold question that has to be answered. It's determined wholly by Federal law, so you must get through that Federal law gateway before you can go any place else in the suit.",
  "But that -- it's not it never happened as though the Federal employee was off in Hong Kong. He was there on the premises. He is claiming that whatever he did was within the scope of his authority. It seems like it's a question of phraseology that you're dealing with.",
  "Well, is it? I mean, that's -- the problem that I have with your argument, Mr. Grant, is that in life things are often not, it happened or it didn't happen. There is a middle ground, which is this officer is saying, I was there at the relevant time or place and when I was there everything that I did was within the scope of my employment, I didn't do anything that was outside the scope of my employment.",
  "Suppose, Mr. Grant, that the district court had said, I'm going to deny the substitution of the United States as the defendant, but I realize that this is a debatable question, so I'm not going to order a remand until the defendant and the United States have had a chance to challenge my initial ruling that I deny the substitution of the United States. Suppose that it had happened that way? Would you have any right to get back in the State court? Wouldn't that properly go to a court of appeals?",
  "Well, suppose that happened, and then the court of appeals said the United States should have been substituted?",
  "That was the position of the district court, though, wasn't it?",
  "Well what about the, Lamagno, where the question was, was the employee working within the scope of his employment or was he off on a frolic of his own? I think that's the kind of question that the Chief Justice put to you. The certification, if it were wrong, the Attorney General said what he was doing was within the scope of employment and turned out he was on a drunken binge with his friends and they got in his car and killed someone. If that certification within the scope was wrong and instead he is on a frolic of his own, then the United States isn't substituted.",
  "I thought that that case was about, was the certification reviewable?",
  "But the Court said that that could be reviewed.",
  "Right.",
  "Then it's more than pendent jurisdiction, because pendent jurisdiction leaves it up to the Federal court to either retain the State claim or send it back. So this is -- what you're suggesting is something other than pendent jurisdiction.",
  "Is that so? If the employee is resubstituted, it's going on now, the United States is not a party, just the Federal employee, but it's staying in Federal court under this pendent jurisdiction-like theory, wouldn't either party be entitled to a jury trial?",
  "How about the defense of, I was on the job and everything I did on the job was within the scope of my employment?",
  "But then you're left with this question Justice Scalia raised. If it's ambiguous, an employee says I did everything within the scope of my employment, I did nothing improper. They allege I did something improper. I didn't. I was a faithful servant. The negligent employee will be allowed the Federal forum, but the one who was a loyal, careful employee has to be in the State court. Does that make any sense?",
  "This is an employee who said I never did one thing that was inconsistent with my Federal employment.",
  "Mr. Andre, didn't you have in one of that's cases that the exhaustion was spelled out by the defendant, there was a complaint that alleged exhaustion, generally but not in all detail. Then the answer attached every piece of paper that came up at all three levels of the grievance procedure, and then the plaintiff said oh, that's a good idea, I'm going to copy all those documents and make them my own. And nonetheless, that case was dismissed for failure to allege exhaustion in sufficient detail although the record made it plain that there had been exhaustion. The rule that you are opposing would operate that way. If you don't allege exhaustion in detail, it doesn't matter that the deficiency has been made up by the answer. You go out. Wasn't that the decision in one of these cases?",
  "If -- if we accept your first two arguments, then if there is no heightened pleading rule and you don't have to name the specific defendants in the administrative grievance that you end up naming in the complaint, if you prevail on both of those, then isn't the third question, have you, what happens when you haven't properly exhausted, is really not alive anymore in this case, because you will have properly exhausted. So why should the Court go on to answer what would happen if you hadn't properly exhausted?",
  "But the Sixth Circuit obviously would have been wrong; if he has totally exhausted; they have, gave that as a no alternative grounds, but if they are wrong on the first one and he has exhausted. That's the end of it.",
  "That was the case where the, where the defendant estate, wasn't that the case where they put in all the papers from the administrative record?",
  "Yes, but they were wrong about that. If, if there was exhaustion in the case, and if there is no rule that you must name everything the defendant that you end up suing, if those two are established, again wouldn't we be dealing with a moot question? Moot in this case?",
  "And you have in one of these cases, the person has said: I didn't know who was the person who said I couldn't have the operation until the prison identified him.",
  "Yes. So even if you had a rule, a reasonable rule, that named the people that you know, if you have it, that would not encompass someone? In two of these cases, the defendants -- the plaintiff, the prisoner, said, I didn't know who those guys were until they were identified.",
  "But that doesn't include failure to exhaust.",
  "And if you follow the normal rule, that that's an affirmative defense, then, then the burden would be on the prison to do just what it did in the Jones case. Why, why would we say, depart from the normal rule that makes exhaustion an affirmative defense when we know that the party best equipped to provide the information about exhaustion is the prison, as the Jones case showed so well? They, the prison, had all of the grievances. They had all of the responses and they presented that to the court. So the prisoner is less well equipped to attach those papers than the prison is, so why isn't it not only traditional to have exhaustion as an affirmative defense, but makes the most sense because the one most likely to have the information is the prison?",
  "If Congress meant to reverse the ordinary burden on pleading exhaustion, why didn't it put that in? It was expanding the categories and it included failure to state a claim, which had not been there before, and it included if you sue somebody who has got immunity. But it didn't include exhaustion, so why should we read that in?",
  "It's not in the screening. It doesn't say you screen out for failure to exhaust.",
  "But there are other provisions than \"no action shall be brought.\" Take a statute of limitations that reads \"No action shall be brought after two years\" or something like that. There is no action shall be brought. Does that make it no longer an affirmative defense?",
  "Well, all the criteria are there, but failure to exhaust is not.",
  "But last time -- and you said before the statute was there were only frivolous and malicious. And the court says, we can see from the face of this complaint that it fails to state a claim, too bad it's not a ground for automatic dismissal. So Congress said, yes, it should be, and put that one in.",
  "And that's not -- the statute doesn't settle that. Our decisions settle that, right? So why should we deal with that, the two, any differently? It's not as though Congress wrote the statute differently. We said you can't proceed with unexhausted claims, so you have a choice. Either you go out of the Federal court and exhaust everything -- or even you don't have to go out; you could use the stay in abeyance -- or you just lob off the unexhausted claims, stay in the Federal court on the ones that you have exhausted. That's all made up by this Court. So why should the Court react differently in the PLRA than it did? Why should it fill those gaps differently than it did in habeas?",
  "I was suggesting that in habeas it is the prisoner's option to say I don't want the whole case dismissed. I will amend my petition so that the court will have, will retain the exhausted claims. You are saying not like habeas, I don't want it to be like habeas, because if it were like habeas, the prisoner would have the option to stay in the federal court as long as he lopped off the unexhausted claims. You don't want it. You don't want it to be like habeas?",
  "What is the purpose of that requirement? As long as he has made known in the administrative proceeding what his problem it, and they have had a chance to investigate it and determine whether it has merit or not, why should he have to name the individuals who made the decision in order, before he can sue them when he later finds out who they are?",
  "How about Jones, who really did not know who was the doctor who said no surgery? He didn't know and then the prison told him. And he comes to the court, he says thanks, prison, for telling me, and so he names that person in his complaint. The Sixth Circuit said that's no good, he didn't put it in his initial complaint. He had only 15 days to find out and he didn't find out.",
  "So Jones did properly exhaust, then, if you just made that confession, then Jones properly exhausted?",
  "It's not an absolute policy, though. It isn't that if you haven't named him in the first administrative step, you can't name him in the complaint. That's not Michigan's new policy.",
  "Isn't there an exception when you couldn't find out?",
  "Is the no leeway built into the rule itself, that if you don't know - -",
  "Isn't there -- the current rule, isn't there some leeway for cases where the prisoner simply doesn't know the names?",
  "Mr. Frey, are you talking about what is numbered, is it number 34?",
  "That's the - -",
  "You don't think that would confuse the jury if they are first told that they may consider the extent of harm suffered by others, and then the next instruction seems to say they can't?",
  "Where did the Oregon Supreme Court say it was proper to punish for harm to nonparties? Your brief quotes something to that effect, but -- the sentence on page 18(a) of the appendix to the petition. It says, what the Oregon court said is, Philip Morris asserts that Campbell prohibits the State acting through a civil jury from using punitive damages to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties. The Oregon Supreme Court on its own, I think, didn't put it in terms of harming particular nonparties, but to exposing Oregon residents to the risk of a deadly disease.",
  "But Mr. Frey, we don't know what Oregon law is on that point. They do have a law that the Oregon court thought meant that they must adjust in the next case. And how would you deal - - would it be different if Oregon, as many States, said part of that punitive award goes not to the plaintiff, but to some State fund?",
  "But if the law in Oregon were, plaintiff number two, you don't get punitive damages or you can get only the difference between what the jury awarded you and what Philip Morris has already paid out in punitive damages?",
  "We don't know what it is. We haven't had the second case.",
  "But part of this award, at least according to the trial -- there's a footnote referring to an Oregon statute that provides for the distribution of punitive damages between prevailing parties and the State of Oregon. Is -- was this award shared?",
  "But would it be?",
  "But if the State law provides that part of the recovery goes to the State, then at least as to the part that goes to the State you can say, well the State has recovered and you can't - -",
  "But then you can object in the next case if you're subjected to - -",
  "No, I mean when you lose the case on the merits and there's a determination of damages, Oregon says, we adjust for having a prior award. We don't know what that adjustment will be.",
  "May I just ask you what is the division? How much of this - -",
  "It depends when you say something about duplicative recoveries, because that seems to be a major concern.",
  "But the Chief's point is that if a petition is in fact found it will end up being more than 90 days because then you would have, in addition to the 90 days you'd have to file the cert petition, the time it takes for this Court to dispose of the petition, and the statute of limitations would be tolled throughout that entire period, not just a fixed 90 days.",
  "Do you -- does your argument mean that a defendant who wanted to file within the 90 days, wanted to file in the district court, wanted to file the habeas application in the district court within the 90 days, couldn't do so because it would be premature because the, the state application is still pending?",
  "I thought your argument on brief was that it is pending here and the statute says pending. It doesn't say pending, as your statute, you compared it with says. That pending, the application is pending someplace. Where is it pending? Not in the state court anymore. They have reached their final judgment, but it's still pending in your case here because you filed a petition for cert.",
  "But that -- that - -",
  "Why do you need equitable tolling? Why can't you use, why isn't it most sensible to use the model when -- for the time clock on direct appeal, say there has been a conviction affirmed by the highest court of the state, when does the time, when does that judgment -- it's a final judgment if you seek cert, right? But the time clock, the one year doesn't begin to run until after the 90 days has elapsed; isn't that right?",
  "So why shouldn't it be the same way for collateral review as it is for direct review? Direct review, everyone agrees that you get the state final judgment. But then you have 90 days and nothing starts until that 90 days is up or, if cert is granted, until the cert process is done. Why shouldn't it be just the same for collateral review?",
  "Well that means, that means that if a petitioner who has had his state application for collateral relief denied wants to petition this Court, but doesn't want to lose out on the possibility of seeking Federal habeas, that prisoner has to do two things at the same time: One, prepare a petition for cert; and the other is to prepare, prepare a complaint to file in a Federal district court. That's a lot to put on a person, particularly the one who isn't represented.",
  "Here there were 31 days, right?",
  "They'd have to file a Federal court complaint and a cert petition within the 31 days.",
  "Wouldn't a district judge who knows that there's a cert petition pending just say: Well, I'll wait; this petition will be held pending the Supreme Court's disposition of cert.",
  "Mr. Kise, there are two applications. Your answer to the petitioner is you have to file in the Federal court within that 31 days. If a prisoner says, I can't manage a cert petition and a Federal habeas corpus, it's hard enough for me to get any assistance, so I'll have to pick one or the other, isn't the, the reading of an ambiguous statute that you're proposing going to be an incentive or a disincentive to filing both, which the prisoner has a right to do? He is going to have to pick one or the other if he is in this timeline.",
  "Could you give an example, General Chanos, of one that is other than Gideon? Is there any other one, or - -",
  "And none other occurs to you?",
  "Well, suppose the state has, which is going straight to AEDPA. Does that mean that Teague is out entirely, even the first category, that is a decision, a substantive decision that would mean that what defendant did was not a crime?",
  "That's a odd position to take, to proliferate proceedings that way. I mean, I thought your argument, AEDPA argument, was: Too bad, the Federal court is out of it, but the state court is most likely, recognizing that this Court has said what this man did wasn't a crime, to grant him relief. But if you're making this two-step and saying, but somehow we can change the substantive proceeding into a procedural proceeding, that seems to me odd, to proliferate proceedings that way.",
  "How many times have we dealt with a quote, \"new rule,\" with the argument made that it was watershed and therefore should be retroactive? This is not the first time.",
  "Ms. Forsman, what about the cases we're had so far on this second Teague category? As far as I know -- well, we haven't found anything to be retroactive on collateral review so far, so this would be the first time.",
  "What about the decision that said Ring v. Arizona was not retroactive on collateral?",
  "This is for children under ten, isn't it?",
  "As you just said.",
  "And here we had someone who was six years old and was hardly articulate, it seems from the little we have of this record. So the Nevada statute I think was very specific to children and was not - -",
  "Mr. Donahue, were there earlier enforcement actions in which EPA was taking the position that it took in this action against Duke?",
  "But were they, in fact, enforcing that standard? So that -- you said that Duke could have asked for a non-applicability ruling, but at the time Duke started up its - -",
  "And the ambiguity is the word \"increase,\" which could mean different things?",
  "The Government as I understand it now has a proposed regulation that would align the standards with the two programs. It would bring the nonproliferation -- it would bring the standard for the nonproliferation program in line with the new source performance standard.",
  "Well, since the government is now taking the position that another Duke could do just what was done here and there's an enforcement action pending, would you, if you prevailed in that enforcement action, nonetheless enforce, though it's those against the current government policy?",
  "Could it bring it up by a declaration of non-applicability? Could the new company -- how would it - -",
  "Then why were some companies asking for declarations of nonapplicability?",
  "But Mr. Donahue said that there were nonapplicability applications after those early ones that came out the other way. So there were companies - -",
  "-- who asked for a declaration of nonapplication and then EPA took the position that it is currently taking.",
  "Mr. Flaxman, one starting point. You say that this case should be just like Heck, but in Heck the core problem was the line between 1983 and habeas, right?",
  "But at least this case involves no such concern about habeas.",
  "I thought the Seventh Circuit said in -- quickly in passing that the damages would run only from the time of the allegedly unlawful arrest until the time of arraignment. That would, that would be the -- be all of your damages. If there wasn't an arraignment, whatever happens is not attributed to the seizure.",
  "You asked us to take that case and we didn't.",
  "But if that's the boundaries of the false arrest claim, then why does one happen later matter?",
  "Miss Solomon, do I gather from your response to Justice Stevens about the Fifth Amendment claim, that under Chavez it wouldn't accrue until it is used at trial, is this case therefore a pleading slip on petitioner's part? That is, if he had alleged a Fifth Amendment claim based on the coerced confession, then he wouldn't have a statute of limitations problem?",
  "That's a puzzling feature of it, too, because I thought at the end the second time around, the Court of Appeals held that the confession was no good.",
  "Does your position in this case leave any reason at all for equitable tolling?",
  "Is there any remedy that Illinois law provides for a case like this where a person spends, what was it, eight years in prison and is ultimately released because the state never had enough evidence to try him in the first place?",
  "Do you agree with Judge Wood that the limitation on damages would be from the period, from the time of the arrest until the arraignment? That would be the measure and nothing after?",
  "But if he isn't eligible -- the new case determined that he was not eligible because his debts were too high. He didn't incur additional debts between the time of the proceeding one and proceeding two?",
  "Or he didn't reduce the debt. If we have a finding from the bankruptcy court that he is ineligible, that is number one condition to convert into Chapter 13. If you don't meet that condition, that's the end of the matter.",
  "But now there has been a finding, and it's an essential finding, that there be eligibility. And wouldn't the bankruptcy court's findings in the later case have preclusive effect?",
  "But that's a question you can argue on appeal in -- from the recent decisions, but for the moment you have a bankruptcy court making that determination, which I think would be preclusive on another bankruptcy court.",
  "If the decision is affirmed on appeal to the First Circuit, do you think you could still argue that there's qualification for Chapter 13, after the court of appeals has affirmed a determination that there isn't?",
  "We have now a judgment that this debtor is ineligible for Chapter 13. If that judgment is affirmed on appeal to the court of appeals, can you nonetheless argue that somehow there is no preclusive effect?",
  "What is the status of the Chapter 7 case? I was under the impression it had been dismissed and a determination of no discharge had been made.",
  "But there's a determination that you're not entitled to a discharge? That has been made.",
  "Mr. Baker, couldn't the -- let's say the conversion goes through. The first thing that the bankruptcy court does in the Chapter 7 converted to Chapter 13 is say: I'm going to dismiss this suit, the -- the bad faith taint stays with the case, it doesn't get -- you can't erase it; and so back you go to the Chapter 7. Why couldn't the bankruptcy court now sitting as a Chapter 13 court say: We're not going to let a debtor who has conducted himself in bad faith proceed in this court?",
  "But here there was a hearing on the motion to convert, right? There was a hearing?",
  "And as I understand it, there was no objection to the character of that hearing? There was no request for an evidentiary hearing? So there was a hearing. Now, does that get wiped out too, just the way, the determination that you couldn't convert?",
  "So it wouldn't be before the First Circuit.",
  "It's hardly a summary disposition. The opinion goes on for pages and pages.",
  "Could the Chapter 7 trustee be appointed the trustee in the Chapter 13, the same trustee who has now been -- he's terminated because the Chapter 7 has been converted. Could the court in the Chapter 13 format appoint the same trustee?",
  "Mr. Fisher, there's another potential impediment in this case and I would like you to comment on it. That is the petition from the sentence, it was second in time. There was a prior petition that challenged just the conviction, and under the governing statute, to have a second petition, you've got to get permission from the court of appeals and it has to meet stringent criteria. How do you get past that? You went out concentrating on the petition addressed to the sentence which is a second petition.",
  "So did -- then you are bifurcating the judgment in a criminal case, which is not the sentence. You are saying there's an earlier judgment, and looking at it as we would as if it were a civil case, if you have a determination of liability, that doesn't give you a final judgment. The judgment will come at the end of the case when damages are determined.",
  "There were decisions going the other way.",
  "Yes.",
  "I thought the law was that the sentence shall be concurrent unless, and the unless is that the judge makes an additional finding, the very same kind of finding that he would make in determining aggravating factor.",
  "Wasn't that overturned in Ring?",
  "We're not going to be able to do that in time to decide this case.",
  "But what do we know about the dimensions of the Florida attempt crime? For example, you have said it doesn't mean that you possess burglary tools. Does it mean or does it exclude casing the house, walking up and down the street, around the block? When is a step substantial enough to constitute an attempt under Florida law?",
  "What is that concretely? It's not possessing burglar's tools, it's not casing the place. What qualifies as an overt act that would make one guilty of the crime of attempted burglary?",
  "And would you agree, Mr. Marcus, that this Court's decision in Shepard excludes that interpretation? If you look at the particular crime?",
  "Even though there's some cases in this large category that clearly wouldn't involve any risk to anybody. Say the enterprising but careful burglar who keeps watch for several days to see when no one is in the house, that that's when he chooses to make his entry.",
  "General Clement - -",
  "Because your time is running out I did want to ask you about a feature of this legislation that hasn't come up so far, and that is perhaps stimulated by Stenberg. But up until now, all regulation on access to abortion has been state regulation and this measure is saying to the states, like it or not, the Federal Government is going to ban a particular practice and we are going to take away the choice from the states, in an area where up until now it's, it's been open to the states to make those decisions. How should that weigh in this case? And it is something new.",
  "Well I know, when it is a question of funding - -",
  "General Clement, couldn't a similar record be made with respect to what is the more common procedure, the D&E, that involves dismemberment of a fetus inside the womb. So assuming you're right that it is constitutional for Congress to ban the D&X proceeding, wouldn't the same reasoning apply, couldn't Congress make similar findings with respect to what is the most common method for second trimester abortions?",
  "Even though we are told by some of the medical briefs that the procedures are basically the same, they start out in the same way and that the difference -- the differences are not large in particular cases.",
  "Mr. - -",
  "General Clement, that's not what this case is about, because I think you have recognized, quite appropriately, that we're not talking about whether any fetus will be preserved by this legislation. The only question that you are raising is whether Congress can ban a certain method of performing an abortion. So anything about infanticide, babies, all that, is just beside the point because what this bans is a method of abortion. It doesn't preserve any fetus because you just do it inside the womb instead of outside.",
  "But if this case were limited to postviability abortions it would be a different matter. But isn't it so that the vast majority of these abortions are going to be performed previability?",
  "But General -- General Clement, conditions don't show up in the abstract. Wouldn't it often be the case that it depends on the vulnerability of the particular patient and you couldn't bring a preenforcement challenge as to that. Maybe it's a question of hemorrhaging, that -- it's a combination of what the condition is and the vulnerability of the particular patient and I don't see how that could be tested in advance.",
  "Ms. Smith, was the statement of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists before Congress?",
  "If we could go back to the first question that the Chief asked you, you said yes, it will prevent abortions because of this uncertain line between the D&X and the D&E. Is there a way that Congress could have written the statute that would have insulated the physician who's performing a D&E?",
  "If there were a health exception - -",
  "The health of the woman, would that obviate the vagueness and overbreadth problems that you bring up? Because then after we say to the doctor, you put the health of your patients first and if you think that it's riskier for her health to do it one way than another way, then you pick the safer way. If you had that, then wouldn't the concerns about overbreadth fade?",
  "Mr. Russell, I thought that your argument was that yes, you know that you haven't got the promotion, you know you haven't got the transfer, but the spread in the pay is an incremental thing. You may think the first year you didn't get a raise, \"well, so be it.\" But you have, you have no reason to think that there is going to be this inequality. I mean she started out getting the same pay, right?",
  "What happened to the Equal Pay Act claim? You started out with a Title VII claim and an equal pay claim and somewhere along the way the equal pay claim dropped out.",
  "Why didn't you ask for the equal pay claim? As I understand the magistrate judge he said, yes, you had made it across the first hurdle, you had a prima facie case. You showed that you're a woman, and you're getting this and all the men are getting much higher. But the employer has come forward with any other factor other than sex and the other factor is that, your inadequate performance.",
  "Because in the Title VII case assuming you're right, that you get across the same threshold, you're faced with the same defense. Right?",
  "It didn't have the same defenses because the Bennett amendment makes the defenses under the Equal Pay Act applicable under Title VII, right?",
  "Where does it say - -",
  "I thought your answer before was that this is not -- if she's going to bring a case I got a 2 percent raise, he got a 3 percent raise, her chances are very slim, but if this builds up year by year to the point where see is saying, I'm being denied equal pay, it's a requirement of the anti-discrimination law that I get equal pay, so today I'm not getting equal pay, I thought -- I mean, the chance that she could win when she gets a salary review and she gets a little less than the other person are nil.",
  "The -- as I remember the facts of this case, wasn't it in 1995 that she got a substantial raise and the reason, according to her supervisor, was that he noticed that her pay was below the minimum of the appropriate range for her job?",
  "Why is it different if the one further statement was made. And the employer knew that every woman is being paid less than every man. Why isn't that sufficient under Title VII, and if you want evidence, your own supervisor said, oh, we saw one year that she was outside the range appropriate for this job.",
  "Evans involved a factor that simply is not present here. I mean, Evans involved a seniority system. And if this person who had been off the job were to come back two years later, and bump people who had been there every day, well, certainly that's a different case than this one, where she is saying, I should have been paid equally. I wasn't. And I know I can go back only two years. That's quite a bit different than the Evans situation.",
  "If only the 180 day period counts, and she can complain only about discrimination in that period, then how do you account for her being able to go back not 180 days, but two years for her remedy?",
  "I thought it was the lid on the amount of compensation you could get in Title VII cases. You can't go back more than two years for damages. But it would seem that doesn't fit at all whether you can go back only 180 days.",
  "Why is she claiming that in 1995, a supervisor recognized that my pay was way out of line. Isn't that what the supervisor testified?",
  "Maybe she thought that, well, they are on the right track. Next year, they are going to raise me up to the equal pay level.",
  "The question that I asked Mr. Nager that I think is really important, and that is, where do you put these pay cases? Do you put it in the box with the hostile environment that builds up over time, and as long as the environment is hostile at the time you bring your complaint, then it doesn't matter that it started 20 years ago. This notion of one year, it's 2 percent, and the other person got 3 percent, you really don't have an effective claim unless it builds up to the point where there is a noticeable disparity.",
  "Where is that agreement?",
  "I thought that the Morgan decision quotes Bazemore for saying, under Title VII, each week's paycheck that delivered less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong, actionable under Title VII.",
  "Whatever portion it's in, it says each week's paycheck that delivered less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong, actionable - -",
  "How do you describe dealing with a case like Manhart where they were complaining about a pension plan that had been instituted, oh, way longer than 180 days, years and years before?",
  "This would be a good Equal Pay Act case, wouldn't it?",
  "Why doesn't it become intentional, at least after 1995, when the supervisor recognizes that he's got an employee that is out of the appropriate range for her job, whether she does it badly or well?",
  "Why would she bring it then? They gave her a big raise that year.",
  "Didn't she have every reason to expect, well, they finally noticed it, so next year I'm going to get that same size raise, but that it doesn't happen the next year?",
  "She is not talking about a decision made 15 or 14 in this case. She starts out even, and it builds up over time.",
  "But you're talking about - -",
  "But that's a defense. And you're talking about, yes, you might draw that inference but that inference would be wrong because I have a defense. The defense is poor performance explains it, not sex discrimination.",
  "I thought at least in this area, the defenses were the same as under the Equal Pay Act.",
  "So why don't we at least hear from the EEOC? That has happened in other cases where the Department of Justice and the EEOC take different positions, at least the EEOC filed a brief even though it wasn't the Government's brief.",
  "Not under the Equal Pay Act. You can only equalize up, not down.",
  "Mr. Kellogg, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure assiduously avoid using the word fact throughout. And from 1938 on, it has been repeated that it is not necessary to plead facts. The index of forms, the appendix of forms shows how simple the plain statement of a claim is, and you're not required to plead facts. And yet that's the central -- seems to be the central thrust of your argument.",
  "But negligently drove. It doesn't say whether it went through a stop light. Doesn't say whether it was speeding. It doesn't say any one of the umpteen ways one could be negligent.",
  "Wasn't that a summary judgment case and hadn't there been discovery before? The Matsushita decision?",
  "I don't understand acting in self interest. I mean, they might just decide apart from, you know, if they go into their territory they'll come into mine, that investing in this wired business isn't the best, the best bet for them. Maybe they want to get into the wireless business and think that's a better way to spend their money.",
  "But I'm questioning you. You say you meet the plus factor because they were acting against their self- interest, that a self-interested player in this league would have gone into the other's territory, and I'm questioning that by saying that they might have seen this whole area as not the best place to invest their money.",
  "Mr. Richards, didn't the Second Circuit say you don't need a plus factor? They said if you did, we think that the plaintiffs could show it, but the second sentence is you don't need a plus factor.",
  "And that can be wrong or right, but the Second Circuit was very clear that Rule 8 wants a plain statement of the claim and no plus factor.",
  "Well, it contains a time and a place. It's quite specific that there was an accident and that defendant, defendant of a certain name at a certain time and place negligently drove. What it doesn't tell you is the details of the, of what was negligent, but it certainly is specific in time and place and person, which is one of the -- one of the concerns, I mean, if you strip away everything, it seems that you have a suspicion that there may have been a conspiracy and you want to use a discovery process to find out whether or not that's true. Isn't that essentially what this complaint is?",
  "At what point does it get characterized as a class action, before this discovery or after?",
  "May I ask, if that's the position of the PTO, why aren't they proceeding to cancel the patent?",
  "But the question is, you say the PTO has recognized that it issued this patent, that it's an invalid issuance. So why aren't they curing their own mistakes, never mind what a court is going to do?",
  "You're talking about in this case.",
  "We're talking about what the law should be. Would you make, be making the same argument if we were looking at the most recent decisions of the Federal Circuit, the ones that they issued within the year, and each as I remember they held that the patent was obvious and therefore invalid? Suppose we were dealing in what was, the cases were, what were they, Kahn, Alpha, and Diestar?",
  "You disagree with the motivation test.",
  "So perhaps you're not the - -",
  "Mr. Hungar, this is the problem that I have with your test. I think I understand you right, now, just to say teaching suggestion motivation has its place; it's okay; but it shouldn't be the exclusive test.",
  "And what I understand your brief to say is that it has to be supplemented with what you have called, you've labelled \"sufficiently innovative.\" And then I begin to think well, what's \"sufficiently innovative?\" How is a trier supposed to know if something -- in other words I think what you're suggesting as a supplement is rather vague.",
  "What about the experts? You said this was obvious and this should have, not have gotten very far. But there were two experts, were there not, who made declarations, that had all kinds of credentials, and they called it elegant, novel and nonobvious.",
  "Well these, these were declarants who gave a whole declaration. They didn't just say that bottom line.",
  "Mr. Pincus, how do you determine the price of the logs? Because we, the charges that some logs were purchased at an excessive price, and if we were dealing with only those logs to determine cost, that's one thing. But we are, also in this picture is that some of the logs came from Weyerhaeuser's own land and some came from long-term contracts that it had, and those, the price was not inflated on those. So if you take those into account you may get one figure, but if you take only the high bid logs you might get a different picture. So how, what is it? How do you determine costs? Do you look at all the logs that were purchased or only the ones that were allegedly bid out?",
  "Who proposed the instruction in this case?",
  "There was no requested charge on this point by the plaintiff?",
  "Why? Why is it easy to figure out? As Justice Breyer brought up the stockpiling, how do you know whether they are storing it, or a time when the supply is short, or they are just letting it go to rack and moon in order to put this company out of business?",
  "Do you -- do you agree that you couldn't have made it on Brooke Group because they were selling these logs at a profit?",
  "Do you agree that you could not have prevailed under the Brooke Group test because Weyerhaeuser was, was making a profit on these sales even though it had bid up the price of the logs?",
  "But whatever position holds for motor vehicles would similarly hold for power plants, and has there been any application to EPA with respect to carbon dioxide in power plants?",
  "Mr. Milkey, does it make a difference that you're not representing a group of law students, but a number of States who are claiming that they are disarmed from regulating and that the regulatory responsibility has been given to the Federal Government and the Federal Government isn't exercising it? I thought you had a discrete claim based on the sovereignty of States and their inability to regulate dependent on the law Congress passed that gives that authority to the EPA. I thought that was - -",
  "But if you are right and then it went back and the EPA then said, well, an obvious reason also is constraint on our own resources, we have the authority to say what comes first, Congress -- we couldn't possibly do everything that Congress has authorized us to do; so it's our decision, even though we have the authority to do this, we think that we should spend our resources on other things. Suppose they said that? You said they didn't say it this time around, but how far will you get if all that's going to happen is it goes back and then EPA says our resources are constrained and we're not going to spend the money?",
  "Mr. Garre, doesn't the EPA's decision on the first, \"we don't have any authority,\" doesn't that infect its subsequent decision, \"well, even if we did, we wouldn't exercise it.\" But they've already decided they don't have authority.",
  "-- I take it that on that question, is there authority, the EPA has come out one way, but at least it is debatable because as you just said, the predecessors of the current people said we do have the authority.",
  "Which is why there's a significant difference between the agency saying that for 60 years, and I think this Court stressed that in its opinion, and Congress reacting to that, what the agency's position was. And here where it's a newly minted position, because the agency's position not too long ago was that they did have the authority.",
  "That's a different question. I'm just focusing on, did it have authority to deal with this issue?",
  "If the national bank set up its mortgage operations as a division or as a department, then the sole regulator would be OCC, right?",
  "But let's -- there are two different kinds of regulations. I think Justice Kennedy was talking about regulations of a chartering State. This subsidiary was set up under the law of a State. It wasn't Michigan. Is there -- is anyone contesting that --was it North Carolina?",
  "-- that they have to meet all the requirements for setting up a corporation and having meetings and all that that North Carolina requires of corporations that are incorporated in that State?",
  "Mr. Blanchard, may I ask you a question, perhaps preliminary to what you are launching into? My understanding was that you did not question the OCC's regulatory authority over a unit that it says can do what the national bank itself could do in the real estate business, no more, no less. OCC regulation, visitation, all the rest, OCC's regulations validly applied to this subsidiary that has been set up in North Carolina and is operating in Michigan; is that right? It is one thing for you to say we have the authority to regulate. Are you saying at the same time that OCC is out of the picture because its dual regulation conflicts with the inevitable?",
  "Ah, you're saying, you started to say they can't have their cake and eat it too, but you're saying they can have the worst of all possible regulatory worlds, so that they've got two equally competent regulators, and they have to meet the requirements of both?",
  "You do have -- one thing that seems concrete and clear to me -- correct me if I get this wrong -- Michigan is kind of deferring to OCC in its primary jurisdiction sense. It says customers, if you've got complaints about what this operating subsidiary is doing, you go first to the OCC; and then if we think -- we, Michigan -- thinks OCC has not given you an adequate response to your complaint, we take over.",
  "So it's kind of a reverse supremacy. Where it's usually the feds that have the last word, but here you're saying Michigan has decided that it will let OCC go first and Michigan will be kind of a supervisor for the adequacy of the OCC's handling of the consumer's complaint?",
  "Do you know another arrangement where the Federal agency goes first but then the state agency has authority to say Federal agency, you didn't deal with this consumer adequately, so we will take over? I know schemes that work the other way where the state goes first, and then the Federal authority, but do you know another one?",
  "Where the primary adjudicator, decision-maker would be the Federal authority, but then the state can override that if it thinks the Federal authority hasn't done an adequate job?",
  "Isn't the action an inadequate action? Michigan is saying yeah, the Federal authority can do with respect to this unit just what it would do to a national bank itself, but if we think that is inadequate, that is a question of just one act or the other, but if the -- it is the state judging the adequacy of a particular Federal response.",
  "Practically, is there any difference between the way they operated when they were just a corporation as before, and now a parent and sub?",
  "Mr. Korrell - -",
  "But can they have a race conscious objective? I think that that's the question that Justice Kennedy is asking you, and I don't get a clear answer. You say you can't use a racial means. But can you have a racial objective? That is, you want to achieve balance in the schools.",
  "But don't you agree that those cases left someone out of the picture entirely because we were talking about a selection of one person or another? The word \"sorting\" has been used in this context because everybody gets to go to school. Indeed, they are required to go to school. So no one gets left out of the system, and I think there have been Court of Appeals judges who have noted. We have never had that case before, not like the affirmative action cases.",
  "Mr. Korrell, before your time runs out, I did want to clarify something about the standing of the plaintiffs here. Do I understand correctly that none of the parents who originally brought this lawsuit have children who are now pre-ninth grade, but that newcomers, people who recently joined, do have children of pre-ninth grade age?",
  "But you don't dispute that membership, for standing purposes, the membership is what counts, not the association but the members?",
  "Well, if it is a member, jurisdictional questions generally, don't we go by what the membership was when the complaint was filed and not what it has become in the course of the litigation?",
  "Yes, but the transaction case situation is different.",
  "Suppose it was faculty, and the school district makes a deliberate effort to have members of the white race and members of other races represented in -- on the faculty of every school, so you won't have one school with all white teachers, so that you'll have a mix, and that's quite explicit. That's their objective and they're using a racial criterion criterion to get there. Would that be impermissible, to have a mix of teachers in all the schools?",
  "Well, what would be okay? How would you get there other than having -- the point I'm trying to make has been made by others. Let me read from Judge Boudin's decision. He says: \"The choice is between openly using race as a criterion or concealing it through some clumsy or proxy device.\" If you want to have an integrated school and you site the schools deliberately to achieve that objective, it's very hard for me to see how you can have a racial objective but a nonracial means to get there.",
  "Mr. Madden, there was a question raised about your categories, that is, you have white and then everything else. And it was suggested that if you are looking for diversity, what was -- the schools that you just mentioned had a large percentage of Asian-Americans, but they don't count. What is your response to that?",
  "You're saying that individual treatment makes no sense in terms of the objective here. I thought that's what you were saying.",
  "And the question of integration, whether there was any use of a racial criterion, whether integration, using racial integration is the same as segregation, it seems to me is pretty far from the kind of headlines that attended the Brown decision. They were, at last, white and black children together on the same school bench. That seems to be worlds apart from saying we'll separate them.",
  "Was the board simultaneously trying to introduce similar programs or attractive programs in the undersubscribed schools?",
  "Was that because she applied 4 months late? If she had applied before the deadline in March, would you be here? Would there be any issue?",
  "Where was she living before?",
  "So she -- that was - - August was the first opportunity she had to apply?",
  "But she, she could have -- if she had been there at the deadline, the child would have been admitted to -- if she had been there in March instead of August?",
  "Well, we're past that. When she didn't get the assignment that she requested for her son - -",
  "-- did she appeal that?",
  "How about for first grade? Did she make an application for first grade?",
  "And that's in the record, that she made an application for the first grade?",
  "How does it compare with the system that was in effect from, what was it, 1975 until 2000?",
  "Do you think that there's something of an anomaly there, that you have a system that is forced on the school, that it doesn't want it, works for 25 years, and then the school board doesn't have to keep it any more, but it decides it's worked rather well, so we'll keep it. What's constitutionally required one day gets constitutionally prohibited the next day. That's very odd.",
  "The board decided it liked the way things were going, so it kept it or something close to it.",
  "I'm talking about the plan that they've had for 25 years, and they decided to keep it.",
  "How would you apply a holistic review to a kindergartner?",
  "I can understand an approach to an applicant for an elite school and so you judge it on all these merit factors and other factors. But for a child entering the first grade, I don't understand this individualized holistic approach. What else is there other than that the child is of a certain age and therefore will enter a certain grade?",
  "I want to know -- you said that there are alternate, alternative means, so I'm asking what they are.",
  "And it's not that white children and black children are no longer sitting together on the same school benches?",
  "Was that how it worked under the plan that was forced on the school district? I thought it was roughly the same plan?",
  "Am I right in thinking that the government in 2000 opposed terminating this - - the compulsory plan?",
  "Yes.",
  "I thought it was the United States?",
  "But your starting place was the plan that was compulsory, that was forced on the school district in 1975? That is basically the same kind of plan?",
  "What would happen if you couldn't use this system?",
  "If the attitude is the one that this board has taken, then the same reasons would exist for the plan as long as there is segregation in housing.",
  "Otherwise, the Attorney General could just bring it all over again, a fresh complaint, and that would be wasted motion?",
  "But the theory is not necessarily bad. The, the relator has to cooperate with the Government, ideally he should. And if the Government said we prefer a variance of your theory, and the relator said fine, \"I don't want to put competing theories before the jury, so I'll surrender my first theory and go with the Government's,\" why should the relator be penalized for that good litigation practice? It doesn't necessarily mean that the original complaint is no good or even that it might not have been proved, if the Government had preferred another route.",
  "Explain why it would be a minor variation if what he has identified as a defect in the pipe system and what turns out to be the situation that was covered up is the inadequate cement that caused the loss?",
  "There were other documents. He said there were other documents and the district court said sorry, you came up with that too late, I'm not going to look at the other documents.",
  "Mr. Himmelfarb, does the government urge that we consider the point that you're now arguing and the other points? You started out by saying everyone agrees that the rationale of the Ninth Circuit won't wash, but if we go beyond that, then we are deciding the question as a matter of first view instead of review. Does the government urge that we dispose of those issues anyway, even though they were not disposed of by the Ninth Circuit?",
  "But it wasn't discussed by the Ninth Circuit, was it?",
  "Why would it have to be raised in the Ninth Circuit? I thought this case was controlled by a prior decision of the Ninth Circuit. Therefore, there was nothing more that was needed to take care of this case.",
  "How do we know that? I was looking at, what is it, 13-A? How do we know that that charge is as a principal? In the appendix to the petition.",
  "Even though that position has been widely criticized, I think. Is it the ALI Model Penal Code, which thinks it's a bad rule?",
  "Mr. Himmelfarb, before your time runs out, there's something curious about this California statute. This one is in the Motor Vehicle Code, and there's this offense in the Penal Code called car theft. Do you know what the difference between those two and what would move a prosecutor to charge under the Penal Code as opposed to the Vehicle Code?",
  "That's mentioned in what, 487(d)?",
  "It covers joyriding?",
  "Temporarily.",
  "But in California they would? Or is there a separate joyriding - -",
  "Mr. Meade, the Government says that definition holds for penal code offenses, but it's not altogether clear that a definition in the penal code would carry over to the vehicle code.",
  "Well how about how -- how the defendant was charged in this very case? Mr. Himelfarb thought that it was plain from that charge, that's on 13(a), that he was charged as a principal. And you must take the view that this charge, this information was inadequate to identify him as principal.",
  "But in the majority opinion, as opposed to the dissent, at least as I read it, on almost every page it uses words like \"local operator,\" \"local enterprise,\" \"local proprietor,\" \"local business,\" doesn't speak, as the dissent did, about a municipal facility. It seems great care was taken in the majority to not characterize that transfer pledge as a municipal facility.",
  "I'm sorry. At least as I read the Carbone opinion, it didn't deal with the public-private distinction. It seemed to assume it was a private entrepreneur. And it didn't take a position one way or another whether there would be a distinction.",
  "But not -- you know, you have a whole string of commercial products, but you have recognized, too, that garbage disposal has for long been considered a municipal responsibility, a municipal function. And you also say that the total, the -- what is it -- cradle to grave, if the county took over all of the garbage disposal business, the hauling from the garbage generator to the plant, and then there wouldn't be any commerce problem, right? But if it does something less, there is?",
  "Ms. Halligan, how do you answer something in the Petitioner's brief that says there's no difference between this case and Carbone because these transfer stations are constructed and operated by a private company?",
  "Mr. Waxman, going back to what you just said, isn't a third possibility, the most likely possibility, that this Court would simply hold the petition if there were -- if the attorney general filed a cert petition here while the Ninth Circuit had not yet disposed of the case, this Court could have just held it because the Ninth Circuit was likely soon to dispose of it.",
  "But isn't it just the case -- you've made several arguments, but you have a case that's lodged in the court of appeals. It's not simply a petition there. They have accepted it for review.",
  "So in the normal course when you have a district court decision, a trial court decision, then you're on appeal and the case is fully lodged in the court of appeals, it's like the judgment is suspended until the appellate court is done. So you have no final judgment that is properly taken anyplace else until that judgment is entered. I think that's the essence of your argument, isn't it?",
  "Perhaps you should go on to the merits.",
  "And on that I have a preliminary question, because we have a new attorney general and the question is whether the new attorney general continues to oppose the legislature and the governor on this bond issue. Do -- in other words, do we still have a case or controversy?",
  "Ms. Brinkmann, Congress sometimes withdraws jurisdictions from courts, but while the case is spending it isn't until the court issues the order -- there's no automatic dismissal of the case when Congress passes an act. There is a case lodged in the court, and that court will follow Congress's directions and dismiss it. But until it does, its hold final judgment. The judgment of the Guam Supreme Court is suspended while it's sub judicata before the Ninth Circuit, and then when the Ninth Circuit acts, then there is a trigger. But until there isn't.",
  "The Ninth Circuit would have been without authority to issue the orders in Santos under your reasoning. The Ninth Circuit is powerless because the authority had been transferred by virtue of the statute to this Court, so the Ninth Circuit was wrong in any orders it issued.",
  "And then when they decide they didn't have jurisdiction, then it's retroactive? That's what your position is?",
  "The Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction this whole time. But the day that it issues its decision dismissing this case, then it is retroactive back to the date that Congress passed the statute? That's what you seem to be saying.",
  "But those cases really are not on point. Because there was a vast confusion in the days when there was a three-judge court, do I file a jurisdictional statement, do I file a cert petition? Sometimes this Court said we'll treat the jurisdictional statement as a cert petition. But those existed from the beginning. Here there's a case lodged in the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals had every basis of jurisdiction. This was no big shakes about it. It wasn't, did they file the right paper? And then Congress does something. And the Court would follow suit. It just seems to me very strange to say the court has jurisdiction to decide whether it has jurisdiction, but if it decides it doesn't, then the date of that order is not the critical date, but you go back to the date that Congress passed the law.",
  "Do they tax on the basis of the - -",
  "This is a fractional, this 35 percent. In the other places, do they use as the -- the value taxed 100 percent of the property - -",
  "-- and then just have a lower tax rate?",
  "Did this value issue -- I mean, was the borrowing effective given the controversy between, the attorney general refused to sign, did that have any consequences for whether this bond issue went through?",
  "But you are -- what you are saying is that it was sufficient when he said, I don't want my lawyer to introduce mitigating evidence, and the trial court said, do you know what that means, and he said yes?",
  "That doesn't have to be fleshed out at all, unlike a Rule 11 colloquy. To see if he really understands? Do you know what that means, and he yes and that's the end of it?",
  "Could you do it concretely, Mr. Verrilli, for this case. The defendant is being rather obstreperous and says: I don't want any mitigating evidence; I'm a really bad guy. And that's how he's trying to portray himself. What -- you said, and you allow for the possibility that there could be a knowing waiver of mitigation. What would have had to transpire in this case to make it a knowing waiver?",
  "Do you know any case, Mr. Castanias, where there has been a forum non conveniens dismissal in favor of a foreign forum where the plaintiff has then attempted to go into a different U.S. court to get a different resolution?",
  "Either one.",
  "You -- you were urging that this is a threshold issue and it has nothing to do with the merits; but there is an argument that the existence of personal jurisdiction or not might have some bearing on the forum non conveniens evaluation.",
  "Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
  "One question that doesn't even have to do with the issue before us. I'm curious about why we're speaking of fora, judicial fora, there was in this picture an agreement to arbitrate. What happened to that?",
  "There was an agreement to arbitrate. And we're talking about a suit brought by one party in the United States, by the other party in China, and no arbitration occurred apparently, although I thought the contract called for it.",
  "Thank you.",
  "But the Gulf Oil case does say that a forum non conveniens dismissal presupposes that the forum is one in which there's personal jurisdiction and one of proper venue. It's just another forum is more appropriate.",
  "Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, because your time is running out, there is a question about a court without personal jurisdiction dismissing on forum non conveniens ground, and that is, it's common, as you know, to condition forum non conveniens dismissals on the defendant's undertaking that the defendant will not raise the statute of limitations and other conditions. If the Court has no personal jurisdiction over the defendant, it would be unable to impose such conditions; isn't that so?",
  "There couldn't be any question about the alternate forum taking jurisdiction here, because it, in fact, had. A proceeding was ongoing in China. So you brought up the question about the Court gives up -- if the Court dismisses on forum non conveniens and then the supposedly more convenient forum doesn't take the case. But that can't be a factor in this case, where the other forum was in China and was indeed litigating the case.",
  "I'm sorry. I'm not following you, so please straighten me out. I thought that the claim was that a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court.",
  "Your claim was that a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court in connection with the arrest of this vessel and the ensuing proceedings?",
  "Now, why in the world should a court in the United States get involved in determining whether a fraud was committed on a Chinese court?",
  "American law to determine whether a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court? It seems just stating it that it might be offensive to the Chinese court to have another court determine whether it had been defrauded.",
  "Well, that was a very polite way of the Chinese court saying: We don't care what the United States court is doing; we've got this case, we've got the ship, and we're going to adjudicate it; and it doesn't matter. We don't have to say anything to the United States to chastise it for even thinking it could become involved in this matter. It was polite.",
  "Why would a defendant that has moved to dismiss for forum non conveniens waive jurisdiction? It seems to me that there is something in this picture that is to your advantage and that is if you can get the Court to say, well, we have to do personal jurisdiction first, you ask for discovery on that issue and it goes out on forum non conveniens without deciding personal jurisdiction, you are not going to get that discovery.",
  "But we know that that's not going to happen here, because the Chinese court has adjudicated the case.",
  "We're dealing with, because it's a foreign nation, not the codified forum non conveniens that's in 1404 and 1406. And you are treating this as it were counterpart to 1404, which is forum non conveniens. But 1406 is wrong venue and, as you know, in the Goldlaw case this Court said a court can transfer even though it lacks personal jurisdiction and is a place of improper venue. Now, why isn't the forum non conveniens doctrine as applied to foreign nations a combination of 1404 and a 1406, and if it includes 1406 then you don't need your personal jurisdiction, you don't need venue, you just transfer it to a place where those conditions exist?",
  "Mr. Van Amberg, they were essentially the same as the prior regulations, were they not? And those regulations had gone through the notice and comment process.",
  "I thought that the formula was proposed to Congress by the Department of Education, which is not something that Congress did in other words, to stop the Secretary from whatever he was doing. But it was indeed -- wasn't it the Secretary's own language that Congress enacted?",
  "Well, just as to that, the provision that we're talking about, do you say, you say it wasn't drafted by the Department of Education?",
  "Well, as -- as far as the difference in time, it was the Secretary's decision, the later Secretary's decision to retain, as you acknowledged, the, almost the identical regulation. You said it didn't go through notice and comment the second time, but the text was basically the same in '76 and in - -",
  "Yes - -",
  "-- and I appreciate that. But the text of it, what the regulation said was not significantly different from what the earlier regulation said.",
  "Mr. Van Amberg, if there is any ambiguity in the statute, one relevant consideration might be how would this work across States, and I think it's true, is it not, that your reading would lead to wildly different, wildly different results from State to State depending on whether they have large districts or small districts at the top and the bottom, whereas the other way, counting pupils rather than school districts regardless of size, you would get uniformity going from State to State.",
  "Can you enlighten us a little bit about how this statute developed?",
  "As far as I know it was the same Secretary of Education when the statute came on the books and when the regulation was kind of readopted, I think it was - -",
  "But there was a peculiar proposal to drop, it was the Secretary's proposal to drop the bottom five. So it was a different proposal, and what was the reason for that? Why keep, keep the 95th percentile but not the 5th?",
  "Mr. Van Amberg, could a State get to the same result? Let's say your reading of the statute is the only permissible one. By combining school districts, it's no longer going to be the X school district and the Y school district, it will be the XY school district, and then the population would increase. Still only one LEA.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Is it relevant, General Clement, that the legislature didn't seem to be, or the ballot initiative didn't seem to be focused at all on beefing up the rights of the non-member of the union? It seemed to be concerned with the integrity of the election process, because they left the same old Hudson in place for union nongermane spending that didn't have to do with elections.",
  "But that's, under - -",
  "Under the Federal law you can't even have this opt-in system. You have to have a separate organization as I understand, for the election. So there would be no, no possibility that the nonmember of the union, that funds would go to election financing.",
  "And that's much harder on the union, I would think, isn't it?",
  "On which -- on what you were arguing, you were very careful in your brief to say funds lawfully possessed by the union, as distinguished from what's in a corporate treasury or -- there is something peculiar about this, and you recognized it by saying we possess them, because if the non-member wants it back, the non-member would be entitled. So it's not like money in the corporate till.",
  "Is this all hypothetical, Mr. West, or is there any empirical evidence about what the people who are non-union members, if they had their druthers, would they say not a penny more goes into the union till than we are forced to put there? Is there any empirical evidence that divides up the universe of people who don't, deliberately don't join unions?",
  "But the State of Washington seems to think that's fine for everything other than election expenses.",
  "Well, the content means a category of speech as opposed to what is the political position you're taking.",
  "But I thought that that was content. You could do it, say, in the press, but you couldn't do it over the air.",
  "But that's not what this bankruptcy court thought about the claim. This bankruptcy court said some rather critical things.",
  "And I don't -- there was never a time that the plan said we are not going to pay our workers' compensation.",
  "I thought there was a section of the code that preserved subrogation rights.",
  "Yes.",
  "Correct me if I'm wrong - -",
  "In -- in this case, I thought that if a contingency claim for indemnification is not allowed, but if it becomes fixed at some time, then the claim can be made and is not lost.",
  "I'm talking about 502(e)(1).",
  "In any case, this has nothing to do with the, Fobian, so-called Fobian issue, whether the Ninth Circuit drew the bright line.",
  "But it would be proper to remand for the Ninth Circuit to consider those other arguments?",
  "On both their statutory interpretation and the contract?",
  "And can we be, take one step before that and tell us if you are conceding that the Fobian rule has no basis in the statute and is wrong?",
  "Yes, but we are not a court of first view and you know that very well. We are a court of review. So no matter how well it's been aired, we wait to see what the lower courts have said on a question. We don't take it in the first instance.",
  "I understand that because they have the Fobian rule.",
  "Why doesn't it serve the purpose of saying that the fees will be covered by the security? They'll not be just be claims for fees that would stand together with the unsecured creditors, but that the oversecured -- the security will cover the interest, will cover the attorneys' fees, and that's the function of 506 whatever - -",
  "You're raising a provision that says just that, it's the absence of a provision for attorneys' fees that you're relying on.",
  "Where is the provision that generally disallows attorneys' fees?",
  "Is it really billions? How many of these have been certified as class actions?",
  "Would you, would you, as representative of the insurers, would you have a sound objection to class action certification in these cases?",
  "And gone to, gone to judgment?",
  "It's a question how many will sue for a thousand dollars, given the litigation costs.",
  "They haven't -- neither has been certified, has it?",
  "This is a different question. We've been talking about willful up to now.",
  "You haven't addressed adverse action at all.",
  "Yes. But, was there anything further on willful? You said that the statute was clear enough and you had the FTC informal advice, but now we know that courts have divided on this question, right? On - -",
  "Why, when we are told that, that the State will surely challenge Nelson in this Court, and we already have the issue before us, so all that you would achieve is delay, just substituting the Nelson case for this one?",
  "How does that, if the evidence, suppose we think the evidence is weaker, it's still evidence of childhood abuse and mental disorder of some kind, and those are relevant mitigating factors.",
  "So you -- if your case is less strong than maybe the jury will decide it the other way. But it doesn't mean that those factors are not mitigating factors.",
  "It's the same kind of evidence. It may be weaker. In other words, it's not evidence of good deeds in the community. It's two specific kinds of evidence, the very kinds of evidence that were involved in Penry. You can argue about whether this was weaker, but it's certainly different from youth and reputation for good character.",
  "But the evidence was that he didn't react hostilely, he didn't do bad deeds. On the contrary, he was gentle, kind, God fearing, and that's why the jury should regard the murder as aberrational. That was the Graham picture, whereas here we're dealing with people who are dangerous.",
  "What other choice does defense counsel have, given that the jury is going to get a question, is this man likely to be a danger in the future? What else could counsel argue?",
  "Yes. Well, maybe sending counsel into those two questions, what violates the Eighth Amendment instead of doing what Texas now does and say jury mitigating evidence is for you to judge. We're not going to bottle it up inside of two special questions.",
  "But realistically, a defense counsel who knows that the jury is going to have those two questions, he's got to fit his argument to the jury into those questions.",
  "You're looking at what Texas law forced him to do.",
  "Jurek was a facial challenge, and the Court said no, on its face we can see that there are things that would fit into it. Good character would fit into it. But Jurek said as applied, we're not certainly not ruling on that. All we're saying is it doesn't fall on its face, and then as cases come up the law is filled out. But Jurek doesn't say -- Jurek didn't say across the board, it's enough that there are these two special factors, that everything can be squeezed into them, all mitigating evidence one way or another can be squeezed into them.",
  "I thought in Johnson the only question presented was age.",
  "Yes.",
  "I don't see how this fits in the Graham package. The Graham is, this child came from a deprived background but managed to survive it, and he fits right into the category, he's not dangerous. Look at all the bad things that were done to him. He turns out not to be dangerous. Apart from this one murder, he's been a good boy. That's not the picture in either of these cases.",
  "Where is that charge?",
  "Is that what the Penry Court was talking about, something like what you just read?",
  "He's 30 years old, and the testimony is 40, 50. It says, jury, for 10 years this man is going to be walking in prison corridors and he's going to be a danger for at least 10 years. And that's an effective - -",
  "Mr. Marshall, I heard what you read from this charge, and I don't have the exact words of what the Court was talking about in Penry, but it did say a special instruction that would enable the jury who believed Penry committed the crime deliberately, that he committed it deliberately, not slowly, whatever you just read, but also believed that his background and diminished mental capacity diminished his moral culpability, making the imposition of the death sentence unwarranted. So what Penry said very clearly is yes, it's deliberate, but you give them a charge that tells them even though it was deliberate, because of his abuse, because of his retardation, he is not morally culpable to the same extent as someone who doesn't have those impairments. That's the instruction that Penry said could be given and that would be okay under the deliberateness. Quite different from the instruction you read.",
  "Wasn't there something about moral culpability in what you read?",
  "That's what Penry makes clear, makes the distinction, between these are factors that don't say he is that dangerous, don't say he didn't act deliberately, but they reduce or the jury may decide that they reduce his moral culpability. And that's not what this charge was?",
  "Are you suggesting that some kind of a psychological expert would say that abuse as an adolescent is not as damaging as abuse as a young child?",
  "Unless you take the view that Penry took, which is you have to let the jury distinguish between dangerousness and deliberate conduct on the one hand and mitigation for mercy purposes that don't tie in at all to dangerousness.",
  "The judge, the judge, I thought, told the lawyers what the charge would be, and I think also said I can't give a separate charge on mitigation because that's a job that only the Texas legislature can do. I am bound by the statute to give these two things. I think the judge said that, so it was the understanding of everyone.",
  "Otherwise you have a Supreme Court decision that the State court can say, thanks, thanks, that's very interesting advice, but we -- there was a procedural default here. Although we bypassed it the first time, we're not going to bypass it after the Supreme Court has told us what the Federal law is.",
  "General Cruz, none of this went on in the opinion and there were four judges of that court who said there's a procedural bar here, end of case. The majority never explained why they weren't going along with that. I didn't see anything in the majority opinion that said, well, never mind that there's a procedural bar here, we're going to deal with the Federal question.",
  "What instruction? I haven't seen one. I haven't seen - -",
  "Is your instruction - - I think this is of some importance. My understanding in this case is that the judge as well as counsel thought that the judge couldn't say in essence what became the Texas law because the legislature put it in, which is: Jury, is it two special issues, but you can consider all the mitigating evidence and it's up to you if you think that mitigating evidence is enough to have a life rather than a death sentence. That I thought the judge couldn't do. I have not seen a prelegislative change, charge in Texas that says what the legislature provided.",
  "And so the jury, what they take into the jury room is something that says these are the two questions that you must answer.",
  "Which tells them that the only way that they can give effect to mitigating evidence is if they answer one of those questions falsely.",
  "General Cruz, how can you make that assumption when the kind of mitigating evidence that has been considered possible within these special questions, the -- the -- in the Graham case where the reputation of this young man, he was sweet, gentle, kind, God fearing, and so the murder that he committed was an aberration. And youth. Those are the two things that I know that we have recognized fall within that. The evidence in this case is surely not that we are dealing with a sweet and kind person. We are dealing with somebody who has been abused as a child and who has a mental disorder.",
  "What would be your test of reasonableness for appellate review?",
  "Could you describe it again? Because I'm not clear what your answer was to what the appellate court stance is. I take it the appellate court would owe deference to the district court's determination?",
  "And no particular deference to the guidelines?",
  "So what is it other than -- is this arbitrary and capricious?",
  "But the -- one problem is that two judges, both reasonable, might approach the facts in this very case differently. That is, one as in this case might think as she expressed it, to sentence him to more than 15 months would throw away his life. Another might say it's -- it's unreal to assume that he just sold 23 grams of crack when he admitted that he had been out on that same street every night for two and a half weeks. So the quantity is much larger. And he was in that sense a repeater, so I'm going to sentence him to at least the bottom of the guidelines, nothing less. Those could be reasonable determinations, two different reactions that judges would have to the same set of facts.",
  "Mr. Dwyer, before we get to the prosecutor, you were candid in saying a district court -- different district judges could act reasonably, one of them giving whatever it was, 33 months, and the other giving 15 months, both of those would be reasonable and could be affirmed on appeal. But one of, one of the arguments that was made by defense counsel here was just there was -- there is an irrational disparity between the penalty for crack and the penalty for powdered cocaine. Your predecessor thought that was so wrong, he thought it was unconstitutional. I think at the very least you ought to take into account that if this man were distributing or possessed for distribution powdered cocaine instead of crack, the sentence range, the guideline sentence range would have been six months to a year. Now we know that Congress wanted to retain that disparity. Is a district judge free to say under advisory guidelines, I am going to ignore the difference, I'm going to treat this defendant as though he possessed powdered cocaine?",
  "Well, specifically, can you take into account, can he say I'm going to treat him as though he possessed powdered cocaine? Can he do that? Yes or no?",
  "Even though we know that Congress didn't want that to happen?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, if we could focus on the facts of this case and what the district court appeared to do, she made a kind of proportionality judgment, too. She said this is a young man. It's his first offense. He has a good family relationship, a good work record. I am making a determination that will put him away for a significant amount of time. But I'm trying to figure the point at which he will lose touch with his family, with his work, he will be thrown away. That was the judgment that she made. She tried to make a sentence that would be significant, 15 months, but that would not be so long that it would put him out of touch with his children and his wife and his work. Now, in -- by some measures that would be entirely reasonable. But on your measure, it isn't reasonable.",
  "But you did leave out what -- she didn't elaborate on it, but she said, I would be throwing him away. And I take it what she was saying by that is it would be -- he would be incarcerated beyond the point where he could reintegrate into the community.",
  "How can you say that, given that at the sentencing hearing, that military record was brought out, his physical ailments were brought out, his activity in law enforcement, all that was brought out? And indeed, the judge was assisting the defense attorney to make the case clearer when it was presented.",
  "So your position would be, Mr. Cochran, that the obligation to be even-handed would have to -- that the trial judge would also have to go through -- now this defendant maintained his innocence. He didn't express any remorse. He accused a Government agent of perjury. All that, he would have to take into account, just as specifically?",
  "Isn't that what the Government pressed at the sentencing hearing?",
  "How about the point that Justice Breyer made that these other factors have been taken into account by the sentencing commission because Congress told them to consider those same factors?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, may I ask you, please, to address a point that Mr. Cochran raised? I think you were very helpful in saying this presumption for the guidelines is how the court of appeals evaluates a district court sentence, that there is no presumption that binds the district judge. But one of the main points that Mr. Cochran made in his presentation was the district judge has to give reasons. He -- this was just a summary paragraph at the end of the sentence hearing. He has to respond to what defendant presented. He has to respond to what the Government presented. There is an obligation stemming from subpart (c) to give reasons, and that's what he saw as the principal flaw in this sentence, that the court of appeals has used. Reasons weren't given for it.",
  "The, the judge also pointed out that the jury made certain findings and he thought he was bound by them; that is, the defendant protested his independence, and the jury had found him guilty of false statements.",
  "The judge was bound by those.",
  "That -- Mr. Olson, that is the position of AT&T as I understand it, that what you call the object code appears in the -- in the computer that it's -- that is what is sent, along with the master disk, and the object code is the critical component, according to AT&T. In fact, wasn't that the first question that you raised, whether digital software code, an intangible sequence of 1's and 0's may be considered a component of a patent, patented invention?",
  "That depends on what you consider the component. They define component as including the, what you've been calling the abstract.",
  "What did the Federal Circuit say? And I read the opinion a couple of times and it was, it seemed to me ambiguous whether the Federal Circuit was identifying the component as the object code itself or the master disk.",
  "Mr. Joseffer, to the, to the extent that you are claiming that there are foreign nations that would have an interest in this, usually when that is so, hear from them and in this case there is a strange silence in that regard.",
  "Let me ask you about a domestic law question. One side is telling us it's the component that's supplied, whether it's the master disk or the object code. And the other side says this is just like a blueprint, like a mold, like a template. Can a blueprint be patented? Can a mold be patented?",
  "Yeah, but patent - -",
  "Windows wasn't around when this statute was passed.",
  "I thought it was the position of the Federal Circuit that Deepsouth has to be brought into an electronic era, and so the -- the Federal Circuit was taking a statute that had a shrimp deveiner in mind and saying well, this is how that notion should apply to an electronic world.",
  "Mr. Waxman, this may, this may help focus that question. Suppose the master disks were made abroad. You would be taking the same position, would you not?",
  "No. That's given by Microsoft to one of its offices in Europe. But the golden disk itself is made abroad.",
  "Yes.",
  "So the only thing - -",
  "The only thing supplied is this, one side calls it abstract, one side calls it something else. But anyway, it is the series of 0's and 1's; that's the only thing that's supplied from the United States?",
  "Any physical manifestation of it is done abroad. You would still be taking the position that you're taking, is that not so?",
  "And why did the court point out twice in Williams that section 7426 was not available?",
  "Because there was no levy. It was only a lien.",
  "But when Congress provides a special remedy for a particular class of persons, that special remedy usually excludes a more general provision.",
  "The court took care to point out why those were not realistic remedies. But here there is a prompt and efficient remedy.",
  "It was a determination that the word taxpayer encompassed someone who had, in fact, paid the tax. Here you don't even have that, because the tax wasn't paid directly by the EC Trust. The trust deposited the money in the bank, and then the Government levied on it, as distinguished from Williams, where Mrs. Williams, in fact, wrote a check to the Internal Revenue Service covering her husband's tax liability.",
  "Well, the whole case was about whether she indeed qualified as a taxpayer, having voluntarily paid the tax.",
  "Yes. It was an involuntary act, whereas in Williams, she stepped forward and paid the tax and claimed on that basis that she was the taxpayer.",
  "But you just -- you just pointed to situations where one to expect action to be taken promptly. You don't want to wait to, to get an injunction against a levy because the Government might be there and levy on the property and then you're out of luck. Where the incompatibility exists is post deprivation, when the nine-month, the interest in having these claims resolved properly is totally defeated if you can get the longer statute of limitations under the general refund statute.",
  "That's why the code has that nine-month period instead of the two-year or in fact four-years because you have to go to the administrative process first. The whole purpose of the nine-months is to get people to act quickly.",
  "And the Government -- and the opinion points out that if she had gone the quiet title route she would have lost the advantageous -- she would have had to make. She could never complete a quiet title suit within the time that she needed to execute this sale.",
  "And the, and the opinion suggests -- not merely suggests, determines -- that those other remedies, unlike 7426 in cases where it applies, were ineffective. The Government raised other remedies and the Court said they were ineffective.",
  "But Mr. Savrin, there was an episode in the parking lot where things came to a temporary halt. If Scott had stopped pursuing Harris at that point, maybe Harris would not -- maybe he would have slowed down. If he was -- he was trying to flee from the police, but if the police weren't after him there is no indication that he would have been speeding.",
  "Mr. Savrin, one technique that Officer Scott asked permission to use was described as a PIT technique that would be a life and limb- sparing measure. One oddity about this case is that he called and asked permission to use that less risky method and yet when he determined that he couldn't do that, given the speed of the vehicles, he didn't ask permission to do what he did do, which was life-endangering.",
  "Where is that?",
  "And he said he gave permission for more than PIT procedure?",
  "How do you deal with the Brower case? That it was a 193 -- 83 action against the police for setting up a roadblock to catch a speeder. And the Court said that the roadblock was enough to give rise to a 1983 claim?",
  "Was there any case at the time of the action in this case, any decision that said ramming, ramming a car to end a chase violates the Fourth Amendment?",
  "Brower was a roadblock case.",
  "But he certainly committed a lot of - -",
  "The key point is that he is endangering the lives and safety of others. Anyone who has watched that tape has got to come to that conclusion, looking at the road and the way that this car was swerving, and the cars coming in the opposite direction. This was a situation fraught with danger.",
  "Why wasn't there warning? There were lights, there were sirens. Surely the defendant knew that the police were trying to stop him.",
  "What is the, the court saying -- and this is on page 39 A of the petition appendix -- when Harris was driving away from officers and when there, when there were no other motorists or pedestrians nearby, thus casting doubt on defendant's assertion that at the time of the ramming, Harris posed an immediate threat of harm to others. This is a finding that there were no other motorists or pedestrians nearby when the ramming occurred.",
  "They are an aggrieved party for purposes of the administrative process. The question is whether that -- when that is done, whether they also constitute an aggrieved party. And one of the -- one of the points made by the other side is that there is an express provision for proceeding without counsel at the administrative level, and there's no provision for proceeding without counsel in court. So doesn't that suggest that the right to proceed pro se is limited to the administrative process?",
  "But then you would be establishing a right for the least needy. I mean, if they're seeking reimbursement, they're able to pay the private school tuition. It's the people who can't - - who have no alternative, they have to take what the school district gives them because they don't have the wherewithal to enroll their child in a private school. And your argument, concentrating on the reimbursement right, would leave out those people, would it not?",
  "What about the provision that says at no cost to the parent?",
  "But that's when the child reaches majority.",
  "The child is no longer a child, the child is an adult.",
  "There's a section you pointed to that says disbursements under subparagraph (d), but your brief doesn't include subparagraph (d).",
  "Well then, if this provision is limited to subparagraph (d), how can you argue that it covers the waterfront?",
  "So if you agree we're talking about. What is the toll on the states, it seems to me that if the state would have to pay for a lawyer, if it lost, and that parents who brings the case is not entitled to reimbursement, how is the state's pocketbook affected?",
  "Are you claiming that hiring an attorney would be a cost, if the phrase \"at no cost to the parent,\" if they have to hire an attorney, that the cost - -",
  "If this -- if Congress had enacted this executive order that's in question here, if it had been congressional legislation, would there be standing?",
  "Taxpayer money.",
  "Would -- you've covered the case where the Government itself, the executive is the actor and said that's not covered by Flast. But it is covered -- what is covered is if the give the money directly to the religious organization. If the money goes instead of to the Government -- take this case, if the conferences are run by a private contractor -- contractor with the executive, where would that fall?",
  "This claim, these conferences are run now instead of within the executive branch by various agencies, they are run by contractors, specialists in conferences that have been engaged by the executive to help people make grant applications.",
  "That's --that's a question on the merits. Right now we have to take the allegations of the complaint on the merits as -- the allegation is, I take it, that religious organizations are being favored over secular organizations; but that's a merits question. You've -- you've -- you have been clear that if the Government itself spends the money, then there's no standing. You've, you've been clear that if it gives the money to the religious group, there is standing. Now money is going outside the Government. Going outside the Government. But is not going to the religious organization. Where do you fit that?",
  "The difference was that it was because it was under the property clause, and made a distinction between property and money.",
  "We are talking about money, not property?",
  "Was it just - -",
  "Was it just a ministerial act or did the Executive have discretion involved, about who would receive the grant?",
  "But you can reconcile Valley Forge simply by saying when it's money from the Federal Treasury, whether it is a general appropriation or a specific appropriation, it is money from the Treasury, and that's what Flast is about. Because whether it is spent by the Executive under an Executive program, which you have said can violate the establishment clause as well as a congressional program. So why isn't that the line to draw based on Flast, that it's money from the Treasury that makes the difference?",
  "You're talking about an incidental expenditure as part of a regulatory program is quite different from looking at a discrete program. The Faith-Based Initiative is a discrete program, and one component of it is this set of conferences. This is not an incidental something pursuant to a large regulatory program. Faith-Based Initiative is the name of this program.",
  "Mr. Pincus, I would like you to go back to an answer you gave because it sounds to me like it wasn't right. The President needs protection at all times no matter where he goes. The President may be doing something that violates the establishment clause, but protection is the job, and it doesn't make any difference where the President is. And so your answer to the question, well, suppose he had a special protector who just took care of his religious activities? I would still say that it's, protection is the thing. So I don't think -- I think you didn't - - the answer you gave isn't consistent with your theory of this case.",
  "General Garre, there's a record here that the district court said there was substantial evidence, enough to go to trial, of a pattern of harassing conduct that included trespasses on this man's lodge and leaving the place in disarray, videotaping the guests, selective enforcement of the grazing laws, a whole pattern of things, even asking the Bureau of Indian Affairs to impound his cattle? This man says, this has been done to me by officers of my government. Is there a remedy?",
  "Well, what is, what is there that will really be effective, because if you tell me challenging each citation for violating the grazing permit - -",
  "And then the behavior will continue and he'll get one more and one more and one more.",
  "Well that's exactly what he alleged and he said, and it happened for over a five-year period.",
  "I thought there was one aspect of the videotaping his guests, that the Government was doing it on its own land, on public land. They had cameras and the cameras were stationed so they weren't trespassing, they were just making the guests feel uncomfortable.",
  "I would really like to have your answer to my opening question, and I said: If your only answer is each time something, he is charged by the BLM people, he goes one at a time, engaging a lawyer, spending a lot of time, but it was, one of the briefs called it, dying a thousand deaths. He doesn't want that. He wants to say: Stop, stop this whole pattern; not one citation; stop this whole pattern. How does he get that remedy?",
  "What does, what does he have?",
  "Who made that, who made that determination, including the selective citations?",
  "I thought the Department of Interior reached a settlement agreement in which they told the line people at BLM to stop.",
  "Nonetheless, they did enter a settlement which included that this behavior was going to stop.",
  "Would you agree at least to a minimum that we must accept for purposes of this proceeding that what the complaint alleged, and what the district court said on summary judgment, there was sufficient evidence to go to a trial. That that's true. So we have to accept his allegations that there were selective citations for violations of grazing -- grazing laws, that they broke into his lodge and messed the place up?",
  "Okay. So that's - -",
  "So that's the case we have. And you're telling me that the only remedy a citizen, assuming the truth of those allegations, is to fight these actions one by one?",
  "Can he get injunctive relief? Can he get injunctive relief? You said something about, that, you said they may seek to enjoin conduct that they claim will amount to an uncompensated taking. Can he have this litany of things that have happened and go into a court and say court, enjoin those --",
  "He can bring, he can bring this, he could bring this not one action at a time, but he could complain all at once about everything?",
  "He could -- he could not go into a Federal court with a Federal question? He would have to go to the initial decision maker, then the I - -",
  "But that's what his predecessor had.",
  "That's a given in the record. The record is that he was not on notice. So whether one says, gee that's unlikely if he wasn't - -",
  "And it's trying to cover for its own sloppiness or carelessness in not recording - -",
  "But the Federal Tort Claims Act is against the United States. It's not against the - -",
  "But then it wouldn't be a Federal Tort Claims Act.",
  "But he also lost the malicious prosecution suit, didn't he? Didn't he bring a malicious prosecution suit?",
  "And he lost.",
  "I thought there was something about Nelson having assigned his, the right-of-way that he had to the Government.",
  "Yes. But it wasn't that it was a new assignment; it was the former owner assigned it and the BLA -- BLM approved.",
  "The prior owner did assign it. The stopper was the BLM.",
  "So if the sign had been \"Bong Stinks for Jesus,\" that would be, and Morse had the same reaction, that this was demeaning to the Olympics and it was unruly conduct, that there would be a protected right under Tinker because the message was not promoting drugs?",
  "But it may have made a difference in Tinker. If the school had a policy, defend our troops in Vietnam, would that have brought this into the category that you are now carving out? You said that Tinker had no policy, but suppose the school did have a policy, patriotism, we support our troops, no bad speech about the war in Vietnam. Should Tinker have come out the other way?",
  "Suppose it were Saturday instead of a weekday.",
  "Suppose it were Saturday, not a school day. And the school children were not required to show up at the Olympic event but were encouraged to and the same thing happened. Would it make a difference that it wasn't in the course of a regular school day?",
  "But those were the words and characterizing them as offensive/ but here one could look at these words and say it's just nonsense. Or one could say it's like mares-eat-oats. It isn't clear that this is \"smoke pot.\"",
  "And at -- at this very rally, I mean I thought your brief said that it's okay to work for change in existing law which such a sign would be, but it is not okay to violate the law. And no one was smoking pot in that crowd.",
  "But it wasn't, it wasn't like an assembly, was it? As I understand it, the children were released from school, but they were not required to attend this event and they were not required to stand in front of the school on the opposite side. They weren't monitored by their teachers, so they -- and there were nonstudents in the crowd. So it's not like a school assembly.",
  "Can't it just say no signs when you're supposed to be learning?",
  "But couldn't the school, couldn't the school board have a time, place, or manner regulation that says you're not going to use the halls to proselytizer for your cause, whatever it may be?",
  "You could have reasonable rules of decorum for what goes on inside the school building.",
  "Was there any fact finding on that? You referred to affidavits.",
  "Now you said that in your brief, and I couldn't understand that somehow you got mileage out of his being truant that morning. Would the case have come out differently, would you be making any different argument if he got to school on time and was released with the rest of them? Does the case turn on the fact that he was late to school that day?",
  "So he's not a school child, he would be playing hooky?",
  "Even though the law required him to be there?",
  "Where did he go immediately after? He went to the school building for whatever it was, the third period of the day.",
  "May I ask to you clarify one thing. I initiated this line of questioning when I said I was surprised that your brief made such a big deal that he was late to school. You would still be making the argument about the free speech right if he had diligently showed up for his math class first period in the morning, gone out with the others, and had his banner to unfurl when the torch came by?",
  "I thought the State court didn't find that there was error. I thought the State court said, this was cumulative, I'm not going to let it in.",
  "It wasn't until we got into the Federal court that there was an error found. As far as the State was concerned, there was no reason to engage in any kind of harmless error review, Chapman or not, because there was no error.",
  "Is that a question on which we would be likely to grant cert?",
  "Are you talking about what's on the bottom of page 181 of the joint appendix? That was the only place that I found where the magistrate expressed a view on this. It reads: \"The court does not find that there has been\" -- \"the court does find that there has been an insufficient showing. So that \"insufficient showing\" means showing by the Petitioner.\" Is that what you're relying on?",
  "And that would put 2254 out of sync with 2255, where I understand if it's a Federal conviction then it's always Brecht on post-conviction relief?",
  "You said in your brief that the remedy, if the Petitioner wants to assure he's going to get Chapman review someplace, then he should have sought cert -- direct review from the State court's conviction. Did you say that?",
  "But realistically, the likelihood that such a petition would be successful, passing the problem that the Petitioner is not likely to have a lawyer, does the likelihood that this Court would grant cert on such a question is very slim.",
  "It was two to one in the Ninth Circuit.",
  "Judge Rawlinson I think said that using the Brecht standard, that there was actual prejudice.",
  "At what point, how many weeks had gone by when they said they were hung?",
  "But on the other side, State courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother in any case with Chapman because when it goes over into the Federal court they're going to apply Brecht.",
  "I thought the AEDPA question was out of it because that hasn't been -- there was no cross-appeal on that question. I thought it was a given, a given in this case, that the California courts did not apply or unreasonably applied clearly established Federal law. I didn't think that was an issue in the case. I think we took it on the assumption that it was such an error.",
  "It's not raised here. There was no cross-appeal from that.",
  "That's because there were many, many issues raised.",
  "But there were all kinds of infirmities in that truck driver's testimony, including the time, the timing of the murder.",
  "It's not just in isolation. Didn't this prosecutor constantly say this case is not about Weaver, this case is larger than Weaver. I think several times in the closing the jurors were told: Think big, think the large picture, don't think about this individual.",
  "But you just -- that's a bit inconsistent with your point that Newlon is distinguishable because there were no objections at all and that was the reason for the court saying this goes too far to the prosecutor. But now you say when there are objections - -",
  "Certain statements. There are were many objections made here that were overruled.",
  "To that extent the two cases were the same because in Newlon there were no objections either.",
  "Do you think - -",
  "There were two cases cited as involving the same prosecutor? Was it Shurn also?",
  "And that there was a significant overlap in the three charges in the three cases. The prosecutor had been told in two of them, you went too far. In this one, just in terms of what the prosecutor said in the closing argument, is this less offensive or would you say they're all on a par?",
  "That was a slip on the District Court's part, wasn't it? I mean, that original petition that was dismissed because he had filed a cert petition to this Court should not have been dismissed, it should have been held, in which case the petition would have been timely and would not have been trumped by an AEDPA variant.",
  "I thought Judge Bowman said were it not for AEDPA this case might come out - - in his view this case might have come out differently.",
  "There was an argument made, Mr. Olson, that it is somewhat difficult to distinguish vertical from horizontal in this context, that in fact, the agreement that the manufacturer made with the dealers was more successful in getting a horizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers had attempted it themselves, in which case some might have held back.",
  "But it was not so long ago that the Department of Justice took a different view. And of all of the vertical restraints, this is the only one where Congress has been a player. I mean, Congress allowed the fair trade laws to operate. And then it withdrew that. There's no other restraint where they are has been congressional action, where the argument could be made, well, Congress is well aware of this, the Court should allow them to make the change, if they so will.",
  "But in those cases you didn't have the counterpart to Miller-Tydings and McGuire. That's what makes this -- this one different in terms of congressional intention.",
  "Mr. Olson, before you sit down, there's just one thing that wasn't covered in your argument or in the brief, but the complaint alleged in this case that Leegin allowed certain favored dealers to discount; this plaintiff, but others were allowed to discount. And if that were true, as a matter of fact, then that would be a -- a plain violation of antitrust law, wouldn't it?",
  "-- in the complaint,.",
  "If the rule of reason is the one that applies, I gathered, perhaps incorrectly, from Mr. Olson's remarks that this would be -- this case would be thrown out on summary judgment, it would never get to trial. How do you think the rule of reason would operate if it were the rubric under which this case were to be decided?",
  "Well, that's the formula, but I take it from what you said and Mr. Olson said that the plaintiff could never get across the first threshold?",
  "But in this case, this case has none of those features.",
  "Leegin loses under the rule of reason, right?",
  "Even with the tremendous anomaly that the employer -- that the -- the manufacturer cannot do this by agreement, but he can do it just unilaterally and terminate any dealers that won't go along? Those two are substitute of each other. Colgate seems to say you can achieve the same end but we're not going to let you do it by agreement, you have to do it on your own, and then you have to do the draconian thing of terminating the dealer.",
  "Mr. Coykendall, the -- on the question -- you alleged in the complaint that there was some discounting allowed by, how do you pronounce it, Leegin?",
  "Leegin. And Mr. Olson says that that wasn't pursued at trial; is that correct?",
  "Suppose you were to lose, you would still have that claim, I take it?",
  "As Mr. Olson pointed out, under the fair trade laws this was per se legal. So that's kind of a different thing.",
  "Maybe on the year by year, don't spend any money on, maybe Congress decided that wasn't an appropriate technique, but Congress has used that after, hasn't it, in other cases?",
  "But wouldn't a reasonable lawyer have said see, I referred to the rule, when I made this motion for extension of time. The rule said 14 days; this judge obviously made a slip. He miscalculated. Wouldn't a lawyer faced with what the rule clearly says and an inconsistency scribbled on an order, say the judge probably made a mistake? So I better, if I want to protect my client, do what the rule says?",
  "That means that a rule - - that -- 14 days is really a rule left to the discretion of the district judge. If the district judge feels like giving a little more, this would be no control, unless the opposing side objects; is that right?",
  "But the respondent said he had no reason at that time to believe that you wouldn't follow the rule and file within the 14 days. So if they made an objection, the moment the judge put down a date that's 17 days later, the judge might say that's premature.",
  "What type of jurisdiction are you speaking of? It's certainly not Federal jurisdiction in the sense of subject matter jurisdiction, like a specific case arising under Federal law. What kind of jurisdiction do you have in mind?",
  "The provision of, is it 2107?",
  "Where does that appear in the judicial code? Does it appear under the provisions concerning jurisdiction?",
  "But it is under the heading procedure, court procedure, right?",
  "Yes, but that's under a chapter that deals with procedures, as opposed to jurisdiction.",
  "You know there have been a spate of cases that said the word \"jurisdiction\" has been vastly overused, it's a word of many meanings. And you are telling me that the meaning of these statutes is subject matter jurisdiction, just like it's diversity, is there a federal question?",
  "But amount in controversy is in 1332. Congress putting it right there together. It says diversity of citizenship plus amount in controversy, all in 1332. Here the limit appears in a statute, a rule of procedure, not jurisdiction.",
  "How far do you take it? Suppose this ^ slip is not noticed in the court of appeals, and then there's a petition for cert, and some clever law clerk notices that the notice of appeal was filed in 16 days instead of in 14 days. Would the court then have to dismiss for want of jurisdiction?",
  "I thought what we were talking about was that if the order had said 14 days instead of 17, then the act would have been properly done. That is, the only reason that -- the 16 days, according to Mr. Mancino the only reason he took 16 days was the judge authorized that. If the judge hadn't authorized that, the rule wouldn't have been discarded and he would have filed in 14 days.",
  "Justice Breyer quoted from the Osterneck case. There was another statement of the rule which goes like this: There is a sharply honed exception covering cases in which the trial judge has misled a party who could have and probably would have taken timely action as a trial judge conveyed correct rather than incorrect information. This case fits right into that description, doesn't it?",
  "The case that I'm reading from is the concurring opinion in Carlisle against United States. It does cite Thompson.",
  "But they would have filed that notice of appeal earlier if the judge had said, your motion for a new trial is untimely. It seems to me the same as in this case. The judge said: Your motion is timely, so you're going to have the trigger so much later. Fine. If the judge had said, your motion is untimely and you know you've got to get your notice of appeal in sooner rather than later. Similarly, here the judge said, well, you've got until 17 days later. If the judge had done right and said the 14-day period, then surely Mr. Mancino would have filed within that period.",
  "There was nothing in Thompson that prevented filing the notice of appeal.",
  "Mr. Stewart, do you think this is subject -- that question is subject matter jurisdiction?",
  "This is, this is all at the top of page 151 of the joint appendix, right? That's the that entire thing.",
  "Yes. It was handwritten - -",
  "How about in this case Did the SEC examine that question at all in this case? And did it take any position?",
  "How should we, we weigh -- Congress is asking with respect to securities, private securities litigation, Congress looked at that and thought some restraint had to be placed on private actions, but it didn't do anything with respect to antitrust private action.",
  "Are there many situations in which a particular industry is subject to regulators and they sometimes conflict? Like EPA and OSHA?",
  "What happens on remand in this very case based on your theory? You are not adopting the district judge's position that this case should be dismissed outright.",
  "What happens when it goes back?",
  "But why, if this is a sprawling complaint and if the problem is that it says too much or too vaguely? A district court doesn't have to leave the pleader to its own devices. It can have a pretrial conference and say, now let's get this whole thing in order, and it's not that the pleader is left alone to do what he or she will. But in complex cases like this, the district judge will often assert control from the beginning and not leave the parties to do what they want.",
  "What would, what would a satisfactory complaint for this party look like?",
  "You didn't have a chance to answer Justice Breyer's question about primary jurisdiction. Let's get the SEC's views first of whether there is any interference with securities law enforcement.",
  "Mr. Phillips, the Seventh Amendment or not, the question in 12(b)(6) is has the plaintiff stated a claim, and at the end of the line it's has the plaintiff proved a claim. But you're stating two different claims. The claim that must be stated is a stronger claim than the claim that must be proved, and I don't know of any other instance where that is so.",
  "I wasn't asking it as a matter of constitutional law but I'm thinking, how do you construe these words, what is it, \"strong inference?\" And the words come out of, as I understand it, a Second Circuit decision. So I would think the most logical thing is that you'd look at the Second Circuit decision and say ah, Congress picked up those words from the Second Circuit decision, then we should pick up the standards that the Second Circuit applied. But your definition of strong inference is quite different from what the Second Circuit's was.",
  "Is it fair to say at the pleading stage it's the equivalent of a clear and convincing standard, whereas at the end of the road it would only be more probable than not?",
  "So you do - -",
  "-- there was a pleading stage, I would like your clear view on how much that changes. It has been the understanding that when there is a 12(b)(6) motion, you look only to the face of the complaint and you construe the allegations in that complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Is that rule not applied under the interpretation you are giving us of strong inference?",
  "You said the Court of Appeals to apply it. Could the Court of Appeals applying the standard that you say is correct come to the same decision that it came to using a different verbal formula.",
  "Well, let's take one specific example that the petitioners did, and that is this matter of the channel stuffing. They say here's a notion, channel stuffing. It could mean goods were shipped that nobody ever ordered, or it could mean something different. It could mean discounting and other incentives to get people to buy. So there's good channel stuffing and bad channel stuffing, and it sounds like good cholesterol, bad cholesterol; you can't tell from the allegations that it's the bad stuffing that's at issue.",
  "But then you're doing away with reading the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.",
  "But Mr. Phillips, you don't look at these things one at a time. You look at them altogether.",
  "Is the statute all you had?",
  "It says you must plead the facts with particularity.",
  "But when one judges the adequacy of the complaint, one looks at all the facts pleaded with particularity, not just one.",
  "Well, I think that this case was a good example. There were two defendants and the court of appeals - -",
  "Well, to take the two that were at issue in this opinion. The court of appeals said the CEO, yeah, there's enough there to get over that threshold. The other guy, no, there wasn't. So it's not that she's saying what you find for one, you find for all. She is going at it defendant by defendant.",
  "What do you do with a report that you know exists because you had one of these 26 confidential people tell you? But you haven't seen the report, so you don't have the date on it? And you won't know that date unless you have access to discovery. Do you have to assume the date is later rather than sooner?",
  "But you -- if the plaintiff - -",
  "The plaintiff can't know for sure without seeing the document with a date on it.",
  "Congress -- Congress used words, \"strong inference.\" Those words are not self-defining. One can think of several ways, in fact the courts of appeals did think of several ways. Why should we pick your way as opposed to the other ways one might define them?",
  "The district court thought it was and one we did, the district court said I have no authority in -- under -- over any of these people. So back it goes.",
  "-- talking that -- where are these statements?",
  "But Thermtron was such a far cry from this case. In Thermtron the district judge said yes, I have jurisdiction but I'm just too busy, so I'm going to toss this case back to the State court.",
  "I don't think the court said in Thermtron, so therefore, I have no subject matter jurisdiction.",
  "Why? Why was it wrong when with respect to the sovereign parties, the district court said I have -- these people are totally immune from suit; therefore, I have no jurisdiction over them.",
  "Did you request -- when the question of Powerex -- authority over Powerex was before the district court, did you request that the district court give you a 1292(b) order before the court remanded the case, so that you could have gotten the case -- the question up on appeal?",
  "Because that would have taken care of it if the district judge agreed to delay the remand to allow this question of law to be determined by the court of appeals.",
  "Did anybody in this case -- did any of the Defendants in this case request a trial by jury?",
  "And have they asked for it? Has any party asked for a jury trial? If not, that part of the case seems academic.",
  "The case is settled?",
  "Well, that's different than it is in the Federal courts. You have to -- can't wait to the eve of trial to demand a jury.",
  "Osborn made it very clear that was an extraordinary case where Congress had explicitly ordered two conflicting things. One, it said no remand of a case of this type, and then it said no review of remands. So the Court was as clear as it could be that only when you have those conflicting signals does that court -- does that case have any application.",
  "Under the -- under the district court's view, would there have been original jurisdiction against Powerex?",
  "Well, we don't know - -",
  "The immunity question, the immunity question is the same as State or Federal court, because the statute as it's written, any foreign sovereign, China, whatever, is as immune from State court jurisdiction as it is from Federal court jurisdiction because Congress said so. But with respect to the commercial enterprise, Congress said, we're going to give you a Federal court and we're going to give you a judge trial. That doesn't apply to State courts.",
  "There was a sovereign party who said: I'm out of this; I have suit immunity. And that was the B.C. - -",
  "What happened to B.C. Hydro? Because as I understand the district court sent that party back, too.",
  "Yes, but it couldn't - - if you are right, then the Ninth Circuit never should have touched this case. So what happens to the three parties, two U.S. parties, one British Columbia, who are entitled to suit immunity?",
  "Immunity, suit immunity, is you can't be sued anyplace, not in State court, not in Federal court; you can't be sued, period. But now it is admitted that you can be sued. That's not in dispute in this case, right?",
  "So the only question is where.",
  "The question is if - -",
  "But they raise that there is still the question of Federal forum over State forum.",
  "And Congress said, those entities don't get any immunity, they get two things: They get a federal forum and they get a judge trial. That's all that's at stake.",
  "Are those -- have they been sued by the plaintiffs in any of these cases or have they always been brought in by defendants?",
  "I thought the words were home of the person who employs, not who receives the services but who employs.",
  "By -- reading out the words \"of the person who employs\" her?",
  "I thought that the Department of Labor's first take on this was that the exemption did not apply to third-party employers. That was the original Department of Labor position, wasn't it?",
  "I'm referring to the notice and comment rulemaking in which you place great stock. I thought the original notice and comment rulemaking said the exemption does not apply to third-party employers.",
  "And -- and there was no further discussion of it after -- after it sent out the notice of proposed ruling that said third party employees will not be exempt, and then it said they will be exempt, did it give reasons for the change?",
  "Some would be the ones that qualified as -- what is the phrase, enterprises engaged in commerce?",
  "Were they covered before, before there was any provision that dealt with household workers? If state and localities were considered enterprises engaged in commerce, then presumably they were -- they had no exemption before, their companion care people, just as household workers, would be covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.",
  "The statute treats together babysitters and elder care people, but I take it the babysitters if they were working for an agency rather than for the householders, there wouldn't be any exemption? Is that right?",
  "Isn't it odd that this - - the basic thing about the '74 legislation, it was going to add to the Fair Labor Standards Act people who were not covered before. So it added household workers. And yet you say that, while Congress had its mind trained on adding people, it also subtracted people who were covered before, took them out, removed them from the coverage of the Act.",
  "Mr. Becker - -",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Becker, if there is room for the Agency to read this statute either way, one way that the third party employee would come under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the other that they would not, would be treated the same way as the person employed by the elderly person himself or herself, but if the concern of Congress in making this exemption was for the householder with limited funds, if the Agency is subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it's going to end up being the householder paying for it anyway. So why isn't the most reasonable interpretation of what Congress meant by the exemption that the exemption would apply across the board, so that all workers in this category would be exempt?",
  "Isn't there a difference between denying the application because the Endangered Species Act hasn't been attended to adequately, and saying you meet the nine criteria, you're going to get your application. But then, so it's not just automatic that the thing becomes the State's domain rather than the Federal. But isn't there something rather detailed called a memorandum of agreement that's worked out, and couldn't the Endangered Species Act concerns be accommodated that way instead of saying one statute is out the window, even though EPA in a number of states has made an accommodation. Why couldn't the Endangered Species Act concerns be reflected in that memorandum of agreement?",
  "Are you referring to, in what you just described about the cooperation among the Federal agencies, to what has been called in their brief, it's referred to as a coordination agreement?",
  "And that agreement, I take it from what you just said, is in full force? EPA hasn't retreated from that agreement and it will continue to - -",
  "You mentioned a whole string of states, I think, Texas, Florida, Maine were mentioned as states that -- in connection with the transfer of the permitting authority had conditions that made the Endangered Species Act applicable.",
  "So what was done in Texas, Florida and Maine?",
  "So that, would that apply in this case? Would that apply to Arizona?",
  "But one piece of evidence that -- one piece of information that wasn't given apparently to those jurors, they didn't know about it, was that life meant life without parole. Because when he was questioned, he was surprised, he didn't know that that was the law.",
  "He gave that as an example. He didn't say and that's the only circumstance in which I be willing to vote for the death penalty.",
  "He was asked to give an example. He didn't say for example. But he didn't say this would be the only situation in which I would vote for the death penalty.",
  "Is it a finding? It's listed under \"Summary and conclusions.\" Under \"Findings,\" I thought under \"Findings\" the -- the findings were that he misunderstood the standard. He said beyond a shadow of a doubt, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. And what other finding of fact was there? Because this one is listed under conclusions. \"From the facts, I conclude that he would be impaired.\" But the impairment is the conclusion from what facts?",
  "But even at this point, this juror, he doesn't know anything about aggravating circumstances. He doesn't know about mitigating circumstances. He hasn't been told what the standards of -- that it was beyond a reasonable doubt. And to say that he should be criticized because when he was asked to give an example he said one thing and not another, it seems if you just read the transcript, that there's nothing disqualifying. So as you said, everything is the weight falls on the demeanor, which an appellate court can't review.",
  "Judge Kozinski thought the reason there was no objection was that this juror came across as being pro-death penalty. Isn't that what he said?",
  "Because you don't know him.",
  "You, according to this structural error, so you have a death case, and so you have this kind of error you don't have to prove.",
  "And then you're zeroing in on this particular juror and the colloquy, but shouldn't we look at the entire proceeding of the jurors, including that there were -- what was it - - seven attempts by the prosecutor to have a for cause excusal?",
  "But it does seem that this trial judge was doing a conscientious job. He granted five of the -- rejected five of the prosecutor's, and how many of those had been where defense counsel had objected?",
  "He objected in seven and in five of those - -",
  "Well, I'm not - -",
  "Isn't the number of the page that you gave telling this is an appeal from a capital sentence, and there are umpteen challenges made. So the judge is dealing with Richard Deal in one paragraph. The defendant raised a host of challenges, and so there's not perfect consistency with what these two passages in the opinion. But mustn't we take into account what this was? It was the defense brought out every objection they probably could conceive of and they didn't put particular emphasis on this, so it comes out this way.",
  "In the Supreme Court. Now we're talking about the Washington Supreme Court. You said they got it wrong because they said in this paragraph that he got the law you wrong, he made an incorrect statement of the law because he said he would impose the death penalty where the defendant would reviolate if released, which is not a correct statement of the law. We don't know exactly what that court meant by that paragraph, but we do know that the Washington Supreme Court was basing -- I don't know how many objections they were dealing with in this opinion, but a great many.",
  "Well, my point is simply that where the court is faced with so many challenges, this particular one, there had been no objection at the trial. So an appellate court might think we don't want to spend too much time on that one.",
  "But do we have to judge all preliminary and judgments alike? I mean, in some cases, the preliminary injunction is the thing. For example, suppose in this case, the demonstrators had said yeah, we went in with a -- with a broad challenge but we knew all we wanted was that peace demonstration, and we got it; so we're -- that's enough. We're not going to fight on.",
  "But why should a plaintiff do that when the plaintiff's position is we got precisely what we wanted; this is not going to be - - this is a one-time only demonstration. We're not going to repeat this. Why force litigation, especially when we can say in this case, you lost on the merits? The judge made a prediction. Turned out that -- that that was wrong.",
  "So you get a case that involves a student. And -- and something like the DeFunis case. The student is admitted to the law school event. They have much controversy over this affirmative action program. The student graduates. And -- but the student has prevailed up until that time.",
  "But can't fight on because first, the student had gotten everything that he wanted and the case is moot. The student has graduated.",
  "On if you had a class action. He had a single action, and he's graduated.",
  "Apart from the class action, what -- what else is there?",
  "Oh. Yeah.",
  "Even though you got what you wanted? You got to put on the show. I thought that at the end of the line, the judge said your First Amendment rights have not been violated, the nudity ordnance can be enforced. If you had come back again, say the next week, and said, we want to do another peace symbol, after the court has ruled on the permanent junction and you lost, you certainly couldn't prevail when you're coming back with another as-applied, when the court has said this ordnance is good and doesn't violate the First Amendment. That's correct. But if there were an intervening fact, if they permitted a performance of \"Hair\" and then said, but we'll enforce the nudity prohibition against your protest, then we would be able to come back. The final judgment in this case does not preclude future as-applied challenges, either content-based or arbitrary, and the district court recognized that when it made very clear that it did not reverse or repudiate its preliminary injunction ruling simply because we lost the permanent junction.",
  "I thought this court said, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you wanted to put on a demonstration that would be like the plays, that would be hidden from public view because you have a curtain or whatever around it. And then the judge said, oh no, that's not what they wanted, they didn't want it to be hidden from you view, they wanted people to see their demonstration, so if that's what they want to do, they don't have any First Amendment protection.",
  "Let's stay with this case because your interest is in getting fees in this case. Suppose you had lost the preliminary injunction and then you won at the end of the line. Certainly you would be prevailing throughout, right?",
  "Even though you lost on the preliminary injunction?",
  "That parsing, is there any doubt that if you won on the main, in the main bout, that you would get your fees for your entire representation?",
  "Not that. But would you not get -- would the judge say you don't get a penny for the effort you made to achieve the preliminary injunction because you lost, you lost it, even though in hindsight I could see that that was the wrong decision, you should have had it?",
  "They're obviously related. It's the same thing. I need -- I have a short time to answer the preliminary injunction. The judge said: You haven't shown probability of success on the merits, or denies it. You win. I thought that there wasn't any doubt that you could get your fees for the successful result from the time you filed the complaint until the final judgment.",
  "Where -- can you -- I thought what he said was -- I thought they wanted a demonstration that was going to be secure from public view, and instead I understand now that's not -- that wasn't what they wanted from the start. So on the premise on which I was operating, I was right, that they were going to do it just like the plays. But what they really planned to do, and did do, I was wrong because those facts were not before me. Had those facts been before me, they would have lost on the preliminary injunction.",
  "But that was also a - - that was the demonstration or the show arrangement under the -- was it the Brooklyn Bridge or the Williamsburg Bridge?",
  "At 6 a.m.",
  "You get costs? The phrase is \"attorney's fees as part of costs\". So, do you get costs for up to the preliminary injunction?",
  "So you would split the costs?",
  "So this defendant, having succeeded in being the winner in the whole case, didn't get costs for the whole case; is that what you're telling me?",
  "So they were entitled to costs for the entire case?",
  "And attorney's fees under the statute are to be awarded as part of costs?",
  "So if you're not entitled to costs, if the defendant got the full costs, then how do you get entitled to attorney's fees when the statute puts them together? Because attorney's fees are part of costs.",
  "But this wasn't - -",
  "This was one that the state got all of its costs from your client?",
  "Ms. Seitz, would you clarify that point about costs? Did your client have to pay costs?",
  "May I ask you a preliminary question, Ms. Mahoney? And that is, we are told that at the time this issue arose, the practice itself was all right, and it was all right for one school to invite students from another school to join the invitee school's practice. And now I take it that it's no longer permissible, that one school's, one school's practice, is reserved for its own students and not -- others are not invited. But if it was permissible under the association's rules to invite students from other schools, then why is it impermissible to talk it up? I mean, you can do it, but you can't talk about it?",
  "But then that's part of the trophy, whatever it is when you win at the end of the year.",
  "And the fine has not been paid. The fine.",
  "Mr. Blumstein, there's one feature of this that I find puzzling. You're making this a First Amendment case. But you joined an association that has such, certain rules and when one joins, one agrees to abide by the rules. Nothing in the world stops Brentwood from saying this anti-recruiting rule is a really bad rule, it is unfair to us; you could have written op ed pieces about it, the school could have talked about it, the school could have urged the board of education to drop it. Nothing stopped you from attacking this rule that you don't like. But when you signed on, the First Amendment doesn't give you license not to follow the rules that you disagree with.",
  "But isn't part of what you agree to is a organization that has a certain governance structure, the people in the organization decide, and then make public to all the members of the association what the rules are and how they're going to be interpreted?",
  "Mr. Blumstein, you're making that distinction. Is there -- if the association says no school in this association can invite students enrolled in other schools to its practice, that's okay? Because that's conduct, right? If this is your statement, there's nothing to recruit for, because we don't allow it period.",
  "That would be okay.",
  "It's a little odd, isn't it, that they could do -- they could take the stronger measure but not the lesser measure of saying it's available but we don't want you to broadcast it?",
  "Is it fair to say \"your coach\"? The letter was signed by your coach, not just coach.",
  "If you bring it earlier, it will be unripe. But it did, I think, leave open the precise procedural posture that we're in now. It didn't resolve that.",
  "One problem with a mental illness that is a peculiar feature of this case, in other cases something different is introduced late. It wasn't ripe. It wasn't there before. But here you have an individual who has a severe mental impairment. He had it before he committed these murders. He's had it when he was -- when there was the original competency to see if he could stand trial. He had it all along. It may have manifested itself with different delusions at different times. And yet at every stage he says he's incompetent to stand trial. They hold he is competent to stand trial. Then he says, well, I'm competent, so I want to represent myself. The judge says, yeah, you're able to represent yourself, you're competent. Every -- this is not anything new that has happened to him. He has been in this delusional state all along. And now to say at this point it counts, but at other points it didn't?",
  "This would mean that in every first Federal habeas, no matter how farfetched, every single Federal petitioner has to bring a Ford claim. Otherwise he won't have it at the end of the road. Has to burden the district judge with this that is frivolous because it's so far premature. But that's what you're saying, Congress -- the statute can be read only that way, to say that the Ford claim has to be made even when there's no basis for it, even though it couldn't be handled by the district judge.",
  "That's a -- on that point, Mr. Redding, it seems odd that given this tripartite system, Congress would want only the tax court to be restricted in the people who could claim the abatement, the net worth test applicable in the tax court on your theory, if there is authority in the claims court and in the district courts, they're not limited to the net worth restrictions.",
  "Can I go back to something you just said, that I thought you said that the people would have no remedy if the tax court -- were the only forum for abatement claims? And it would be the exclusive forum but nobody -- it wouldn't deny access to anyone.",
  "Abatement claim, if you read this as the Government does, is one place where you go, and the tax court but everyone who has an abatement claim could go there. So who's being cut out?",
  "Oh, yes. But -- yes. And I had asked you before well doesn't it seem, it seems strange that Congress would want to limit the authority of the, of the court where most people go and have no limit for the wealthier taxpayers.",
  "I thought Congress was operating on the assumption that no court could hear an abatement claim?",
  "Well, give me a decision of the claims court or a district court that said courts have authority to abate the interest before Congress enacted this legislation?",
  "And it didn't exist before this statute? I mean, the lower courts as I understand it said, routinely, yes, you can have jurisdiction, but have you no claim for relief because there is no, no law to apply. This is a totally discretionary matter of the Commissioner's grace. So Congress perhaps didn't grasp the subtle distinction between no jurisdiction, and you can walk in the door but you go out the next door, because there is no justiciable claim. And it provided peculiarly in the tax court for relief that was not available anyplace before?",
  "The Fifth Circuit -- I thought the Fifth Circuit went your way.",
  "I thought the Fifth Circuit went your way.",
  "This was for purposes of attorneys' fees?",
  "Wouldn't it have been simpler if Congress just said the tax court shall have exclusive jurisdiction, instead of just saying jurisdiction?",
  "And there is no linkage between the two, with, it's one thing to split a claim when they have common elements, but the interest abatement has nothing to do with the substantive underlying -- substantive liability?",
  "But the point that Mr. Marcus just made, that the issue is discrete on interest abatement, and it involves mishandling within the Internal Revenue processing, and it's not like other questions that have to do with the -- with the intricacies of the Internal Revenue Code - -",
  "Mr. Hungar, was this Court wrong in your view, it wasn't dispositive of the case in Key Tronic when it said, \"Section 107 unquestionably provides a cause of action for private parties to seek recovery of cleanup costs?\"",
  "So you think that when the Court says this, it didn't contemplate that PRPs would be included among private parties?",
  "How does it work with \"or a State\" because I thought that there was some suggestion that States, they don't want to bother with the Federal legislation, so they'll say you're okay under the State legislation. You can't force a State to -- to take on that responsibility.",
  "The States, we have a brief from the States telling us look, we don't want to put our money on that kind of thing. We've got very high-risk sites and we want to spend our resources making sure those are cleaned up.",
  "Well, they -- they can. Of course they can but the States are telling us that this puts a burden on them that they don't want.",
  "Well, let's just go back to Justice Breyer's question, because it was I think a major point of the Eighth Circuit. That is, they said the United States, the United States is a big polluter, could avoid its own responsibility by not bringing any enforcement action and by not settling, and you -- you said there would be a disincentive for the PRP -- a disincentive to settlement, but you didn't answer the question of why wouldn't the United States when it is a polluter and it would be responsible on this site, to say well, we are going to, we are not going to settle?",
  "Then why this case - - there's a point that was made by the Eighth Circuit, and also in the States' brief on page 24, and that is that the EPA was engaged in settlement negotiations with Atlantic Research, and then after this Court decided Cooper Industries that negotiation terminated.",
  "The person who settled, wouldn't that person be protected? Wouldn't the court say, this person has made a bargain with the EPA and we're not going to extract any more from them?",
  "Yes, but to make the statute work in harmony, to harmonize 107 with 113, it seems to me that would be an altogether reasonable position for a court to take. If someone has settled and is protected by virtue of that settlement, then when someone else tries to go after that same person the court could say: We have to make the statute work and we're going to honor the settlement.",
  "But to talk about the other polluter or the other in this case, where the other polluter is not someone who is going to settle because it's the Government itself - -",
  "So I don't think you're in a position to concede anything one way or another because that's not your case.",
  "What about the Government's concern that prenups shouldn't go on unsupervised. That's when EPA brings an enforcement action, there's a monitor there. When there's a settlement, then the Government is there. But if you just go off on your own and do this, you're doing it unsupervised by any State authority, any Federal authority, and that could - -",
  "What about the disincentive to settlement? You just said how important settlement was, or what a good thing it is to encourage it. But the Government says if you could just clean up without any order and without making any proposed settlement, just do it and get back your costs, then there's a powerful disincentive to settle.",
  "The fact that the action - -",
  "Mr. Zall, let's say we have just an intelligent reasonable person reads the newspaper and says: Oh, they handed down a decision today that said the police can order me to get out of the car, the police can order me to stay in the car. How could such a person feel free to leave knowing that it is the law that that person can be told, get out, or if he tries to get out, stay in?",
  "It may be that you can walk away, you're not in an enclosed space. Suppose the passenger knows when the police approaches: Oh my goodness, I didn't buckle up. Would that passenger be the object of the police authority from the start?",
  "So it could be, it could be sometimes the attention is directed at the driver, but that's not always the case.",
  "But the question that's presented is kind of a standing question. It's who can complain when the police stop a car? You say the driver. The question that's been presented in this case is, can the passenger also complain, and that's the only thing that we're dealing with. So the -- the arrest warrant may pose a disqualification for this particular passenger, but that would be a second question. The question that is tendered to us and that was answered by the California Supreme Court is when the car is stopped by the police who can complain.",
  "But what of the question that was raised about well, a passenger is locked in for the moment, but so are all the cars that are backed up behind the car that's been stopped? What's the difference between the passenger - -",
  "I could understand that if the plan is being set up or if there's going to be a change to the multiemployer plan while the business is ongoing. But in this situation, you, you say if the employer elects to have an annuity, then choosing which insurance company is going to supply the annuity, that would be a fiduciary function. Well, this is, the termination, the merger that's proposed here, is instead of having an annuity we'll put the assets into this other plan. It's quite different from choosing a form for an ongoing operation and saying, we're out of it and we're now going to try to distribute the assets in the way that will best protect the beneficiaries.",
  "Suppose the argument is made very forcefully that the insurance companies with these annuities haven't been doing so well, but there is this multi-employer plan that has been just performing so well, and so the -- an appeal is made to the company, you're going out of business, you're not going to be running a plan anymore. Put those assets, distribute those assets to the place where they will serve the employees best.",
  "You're making the same rigid argument that Mr. Baker made, that whatever the termination, even though the company is going out of business, it's bankrupt, it's always -- a merger is always characterized as a sponsor business, not fiduciary.",
  "Was it specific in the plan or it just didn't exclude, the plan didn't exclude the possibility of merger?",
  "So that could be if they just didn't say anything so it would be a choice. Just like it doesn't say, may not say anything about a lump sum, which would be an alternative. But your point - -",
  "Do I understand that your position is twofold? One is you say you -- you put this on the table, the board was bound to consider it with their fiduciary hat. So it's not just that they were to consider it. But they had to consider it as a fiduciary and not as a sponsor?",
  "But what New York is seeking is an interest in land and a lien is an interest in the land. It runs with the land, doesn't it?",
  "The counterclaim sounds to me very much like it comes straight out of the Federal Rules, not out of any convention. It's the same transaction and occurrence, right?",
  "Well, that's exactly what it says in the Federal Rules about compulsory - -",
  "There was nothing vague about the State Department's brief in the Englewood case.",
  "But anyway, at a time closer to the passage of the Act, the State Department was taking the position that a lien was an interest in land.",
  "And in reality, you will never get there, because the Vienna Convention deals with the substantive liability -- you're talking about jurisdiction. On your theory, you would never get to the fee for picking up the garbage, because you wouldn't have any jurisdiction.",
  "The commercial activity, it's applied to that same building that you say can't be -- it can't be any suit for taxes.",
  "Even -- even if this, the building were only the mission and the representative, the minister to the U.N., even then - -",
  "-- the water of a municipal service, garbage collection, could be charged.",
  "Well, it's the city. Not a private company, the city itself.",
  "You could easily say there has to be a relationship to the property itself.",
  "In a very practical way, you're expressing that right means ownership means ownership. But the title is certainly impaired by this lien. India could not turn around and sell it to anyone without doing something to discharge the, lien right?",
  "So the title is certainly clouded by this lien.",
  "How long did the United States take the opposite position and when did it change?",
  "How long did the United States adhere to the position that's reflect in the Englewood brief and when did it change?",
  "Well, let's take the parking ticket that your colleague raised, that New York would make a parking ticket a lien, unpaid parking ticket a lien on all, all property.",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "Foreign aid - -",
  "I thought that the Federal, the 100 percent withholding, relates to taxes?",
  "Taxes, not for parking tickets or anything else.",
  "Do you think -- do you think that we owe any special measure of respect to the Congress, that is most intimately concerned with the Speech or Debate Clause, with their view that this is, this legislation is compatible with that clause?",
  "But what we are involved with in this case is Congress subjecting itself to the laws that govern all other employers.",
  "That's part of -- how many second selves would there be?",
  "On the Senator's staff?",
  "How many second selves? Of -- what universe are you covering? Who is not a second self, who works in a Senator's office?",
  "That would go for a stenographer in a committee hearing?",
  "Have any cases gone through a district court on the merits under this Act?",
  "Have any cases under this Act gone to a district court to judgment on the merits?",
  "That is -- this is certainly not your revenue officer needing help from a citizen or the Federal agent going to close down a still during Prohibition. But what about the Government contractor cases that are cited, the Agent Orange was one example?",
  "Well, the prison case, there's not any if about it. A State, municipality, has a contract with a private entrepreneur to run a prison. One question that I think must have come up in that context comes under the 1983 action in - - against a, a prison guard, a privately hired prison guard.",
  "I don't follow that. The Government is always altering people's conduct when it regulates them.",
  "Has it been done? I mean, this is -- I don't recall any case like this. Are there other product liability cases that are removed from State court to Federal Court on a similar basis?",
  "Mr. Gornstein, was there any Government litigation against the cigarette companies?",
  "Again, you're talking about an agency that has set certain standards that the entity its regulating must meet. They must meet all kinds of requirements for certain kinds of tests by OSHA, say, for example. Think of pesticides, think of hazardous substance -- quite precise tests that the Government says you must make this test before you market that dangerous product. I don't see how cigarettes are any different from hazardous wastes, pesticides, just the vast number of potentially dangerous to health products that are marketed and the Government says: We're not going to let you put those things out on the market unless you go through a certain testing regimen. That doesn't make the party an agent of the Government for the testing purposes.",
  "But there must be many times when an agency prescribes a test that a regulated party must comply with. It's still a relationship of a regulator, the FTC, sets standards that the regulated party has to meet. I just don't see -- it could be called \"the FTC test,\" but it's a test for what? Are you complying with the law when you're manufacturing and marketing this product?",
  "I thought that, Mr. Olson, that the cigarette companies wanted to make a light brand so that they could keep customers who might be tempted to quit if there was only the heavy kind. But to say that, the light cigarettes were forced on the cigarette companies by the FTC certainly - -",
  "Well, any product that the Government supervises, certainly the Government would want to promote a safer -- I mean, think of a jet ski. Think of -- products are marketed because people want them, and off course the Government as supervisor will want to encourage a safer product. But let me ask you a different question, Mr. Olson. The removal area has been really closely guarded by Congress. You know it's not easy to get a case out of State court and move it to the Federal court. In fact, Congress has said if the Federal court shifts it back, no matter how wrong a that decision was, it stays in the State court. One can't remove -- you may have a wonderful Federal defense, a preemption defense. You can't remove on that basis. You may have a counterclaim, so you're really the same as a plaintiff. You can't remove on the basis of a counterclaim. Well, Congress has been so careful to let the State courts do State tort litigation. Then we are supposed to read into a Federal officer removal statute, that kind of, the removal of a State tort case from State court to Federal court? Because that's quite the fashion.",
  "Well there's one different. If you're doing it for the Government, the Government says we want Agent Orange; we know it's a very dangerous substance. So they give you an order; we're going to make very precise specifications. But you're doing it for us. We, the Government, want that, and so we are going to put tight controls on your manufacturing it for us. A little was different from a commercial company going out to sell market goods to the public at large?",
  "But the company is doing it so it can stay in business and market this product, not as a service to the U.S. Government.",
  "General Clement, that Jane Doe ad was in the record last time. They were others, weren't there, the issue ads?",

  "So that enabled the parent to remove the child immediately and risk that - -",
  "-- the public education would be found inadequate.",
  "But all that section does is to repeat the Burlington scenario. It says, it codifies what the Court held. The Court didn't say anything in Burlington about the situation where the child was never in public education.",
  "Are there not children - - I think there was a brief on behalf of the Autism Society that says many school systems simply do not have the facilities to attend to the needs of these children?",
  "Are there not cases where school districts have said from day one, look, we don't have facilities to handle this type of disability?",
  "But isn't it true that the parent will never be reimbursed? Let's take the parent that Justice Scalia has hypothesized, will never get one penny of that tuition unless that parent carries the burden -- the parent would have the burden of showing that there was no appropriate public education?",
  "That's not the question I asked.",
  "I said that the parent - - let's assume that the parent never sends the child to public school, nonetheless seeks reimbursement. In order to get reimbursement that parent would have to show, would have bear the burden of showing that there is no appropriate public education available; is that not true?",
  "Then the conclusion would be that that parent hasn't met the heavy burden of showing that there is no appropriate public education.",
  "What is the basis for saying that, when the one thing that the statute is very clear on is that the starting premise of any reimbursement claim is that an appropriate public education is not available? That wouldn't concentrate, testing that wouldn't concentrate on what the private school is doing but what the public school could do.",
  "But you don't have the burden; the parents do.",
  "I thought this statute was also premised on Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, in which case it wouldn't have spending clause notice argument.",
  "You have two choices and I think there's another one on page 12, is there not? So are you representing, General McKenna, that one of these will be what the State of Washington ballot will look like?",
  "General McKenna, may I ask you at that point - -",
  "-- if that's a correct statement of your position. I didn't understand you to take the position that a candidate has a constitutional right to state on the ballot. The State of Washington has chosen to give the candidate that option, but is -- I have not read anything in your brief that suggests that a candidate has a right to do so.",
  "But you did say that it is unlikely voters will be mistaken, that they will mistakenly consider a statement of party preference to be the equivalent of a party endorsement. You did say that, and on what basis are you predicting that the statement of preference will not be confused with a statement of endorsement?",
  "Where does that right come from? I thought in Jones, the Court had said if you had just a blanket primary, with no indication of party affiliation, that that would be constitutional. And if that's so, then parties don't have any right to have a candidate.",
  "So you would have no objection if this - everything was the same, except no party affiliation were shown.",
  "That would be constitutional?",
  "How does one associate - - this one -- I think General McKenna told us that in the State of Washington people do not register membership in one party or the other, so how does the Republican Party determine who is a Republican?",
  "No, who do you consider a member of the party? If you say I am a Republican in the State of Washington, what does that mean? It doesn't mean I registered Republican because Washington doesn't register people by party.",

  "Mr. Nachmanoff, in the absence of anything further from Congress, and accepting your argument that there's no -- that the Guidelines did not have to adopt the ratio that is applicable to the mandatory minimum, could a district judge then say, I see that this disparity is untenable, but I think drugs are a very bad thing, so I'm going to sentence for powder as high as for crack?",
  "But if we throw out the 100 to 1, what is the range open to the district judge -- hundred to one is okay, but I have to use the -- I'm going to use the crack for both? Or say there is a difference between the two, so I'm going to set it at 20 to 1 and another judge 5 to 1. What is -- are all those reasonable within the position that you take in this case? Would all those have to pass muster at the court of appeals level?",
  "And Mr. Nachmanoff, I think that you are agreeing, although you don't want to come right out and say it, with Justice Scalia's point; that is, anything from a hundred to one down to one to one is open to the district judge; and within that range, there is no abuse of discretion.",
  "In any case, your answer is anything from what Congress has said, down to one to one, would be a reasonable sentence that would be - - that would pass muster on appeal because it is not an abuse of discretion.",
  "But you've given me a bunch of hand holds that, quite frankly, are quite easy for a district judge to say: Here's my laundry list; and I'm going to go through every one of them; but in the end I think the ratio should be 20 to 1; and that's what I'm going to impose.",
  "So -- Congress not having done that, then the range is open to the district judges, 100 to 1 to 1 to 1.",
  "And then are you saying that either the guidelines are out of it and the statute controls, the ratio is a 100 to 1, or that Congress has, in effect, made a particular guideline, the one setting the drug quantity, made that mandatory? That guideline -- I mean, it sounds to me that if you must adhere to the 100 to 1, then that's a mandatory guideline.",
  "What about the Eighth Circuit, laying aside the extraordinary circumstances test, saying the judge, the sentencing judge gave credit for his leaving the conspiracy, but he didn't blow the whistle, so the conspiracy continued. He could have stopped the conspiracy. And, similarly, yes, he rehabilitated himself, but he earned some 30 to $40,000 in the drug business, and that aided his rehabilitation, and maybe there's some kind of obligation to pay back. So could a court of appeals try to instruct district judges and say: Now, in this factor, leaving a conspiracy, we want district judges to be aware of the difference between one who leaves and blows the whistle and one who lets it continue; and, similarly, one who uses the ill-gotten gains to set himself up in business.",
  "There is no indication that he gave it back, or there was no fine attached to it.",
  "How?",
  "How can it fix the - -",
  "But you said -- you said before that, and very definitely, that Congress could fix the case of where one judge said, I'm always lenient on 17-year-olds and the other said, I throw the book at him. You said yes, Congress could fix that. Well, how other than in the way that Justice Alito just proposed?",
  "What in your view would be -- would fail the abuse of discretion test? If we have a sentence of -- what was the guideline range?",
  "And the judge gives no prison time, three years probation. What would it take to be -- describe what an abuse of discretion would be?",
  "I'm sure that the prosecutor argued that, and the judge heard it, and he listed what thought were the key factors. You made a distinction between a sentence could be rational but not reasonable. And I'm accustomed to understanding rationality review as equivalent to reasonableness review, but you made a distinction between those two. So I get your idea of rationality passes the lunatic test. What is reasonableness?",
  "It is hard to see this - - that, just in the sense of laundering, nothing is being concealed. They're not -- the money that's being paid to the runners and the collectors, it is an ordinary and necessary expense of the illegal business. So I think Justice Scalia was emphasizing that this is, for the very same conduct two discrete statutes, one with much heavier penalties. That makes it odd, too, that the basic gambling statute has a lower penalty than this money laundering statute, and yet it's the same conduct that's violating both.",
  "What about the qualification that Judge Easterbrook made when he said, at least where the crime is a business-like operation? He gave the example of gambling, he gave the example of selling contraband. And it seems to me that he was narrowing his definition of proceeds to cases where the crime is not robbery or a one-time event, but a business-like operation.",
  "Wouldn't it be - -",
  "Mr. Roberts, the Seventh Circuit in this case was following a precedent in another case and it thought that the defendant was would prevail under its theory. If this Court should say that that theory, that it's profits and not proceeds that matter, wouldn't it be appropriate for us, if we don't decide the question ourselves, to remand and say, Seventh Circuit, your precedent was wrong; but you could consider a question that was not necessary for you to reach because you had your precedent on the profits issue?",
  "Mr. Robert, may I go back to something you said about -- of the options that Justice Breyer mentioned. You said the way to handle it is in sentencing. Santos was sentenced to 60 months on the gambling counts and 210 months on the laundering. You said the statute has been changed. So what would be the sentence under the statute as it now exists? And this is vastly disproportionate. 60 months for gambling, and 210 for money laundering.",
  "That's not your question presented.",
  "Well, let's take this context. There is, if you are going to go with profit, a question of what expenses? That's one of the difficulties of working with a net proceeds, because we don't know what the expenses that you would deduct, and the hit man was given as one example. You said no, not that one. But salaries to the runners, yes. To figure out what would count to come up with a net figure is the least difficult, is it not?",
  "That convention - - conventions can come in all sizes and shapes. The argument here is that this system shuts out rank-and-file party members and gives the total control to the party leaders, and that the preliminary was the primary or selection of delegates, but it's really a sham because nobody is going to run for that except the party faithful, someone picked by the party boss. So the argument on the other side is that this system, as complicated as it is, reduces to the party leaders choose the candidates.",
  "So the party is -- you're identifying the party with the party leader because the argument comes down to this is not the rank and file that's making this election; this is the party leader; and the party might like that or the leadership might like that, but the rank and file might not, and the argument is that they have rights of association, too.",
  "In practice, how many people other than the slate selected by the party leaders run in New York for this delegate position?",
  "But if the autonomy of the party and, let's say, the leader is the justification for this, the party -- how -- how autonomous can a party be when it's told, even if you want to be more democratic about how you choose your candidates, you can't because New York is forcing this system on you?",
  "But Storer - -",
  "Could a State decide it doesn't want candidates to have any part in this delegate-selection process? It thinks it's unseemly to have would-be judges engage in that kind of activity. So it structures the system that says that they choose delegates for a convention, but we don't want those delegates to be the delegates of any particular candidate. We want to insulate this process from would-be candidate influence. Would that be unconstitutional?",
  "That's the -- that's the remedy that, the temporary remedy, that you sought was -- at the bottom line, the court's order was, until New York reacts to this decision, the candidates will be chosen by primary.",
  "There's also one view, I think it was, in the Feerick Report that said, the worst thing in the world would be to return us to the primary system this system was intended to replace.",
  "And was the price four to five times higher than the normal rates for advertising?",
  "Who told -- who told Charter that it was necessary for them to have a time spread between the contract -- the $20 above the contract price and the advertising payment?",
  "Well, if it told them that, didn't it have -- it sounds to me from that that the accountant says, look, if you want to make this appear on the balance sheet as though the advertising revenues were just ordinary advertising revenues, you better separate these two. That suggests that Arthur",
  "Mr. Grossman, before you finish, there is one statement made by the other side that you are trying to use this -- small in comparison to all the fraud that was involved here in order to collect on the entire loss. That is, you are asserting they were just a bit player.",
  "So what are you seeking? How would you measure your damages?",
  "That's if you equate this with aiding-and-abetting, and I think the question is is there a middle category between Charter, who is clearly primarily liable, and Central Bank, that didn't do anything deceptive?",
  "But you are saying -- I thought your argument, unlike the government's argument, is that there was no deceptive device. There was no deceptive device. They simply aided and abetted.",
  "But Charter said -- vendors, I need you to consummate this fraud on the public. I can't do it without you. I've got to have those revenues that you're going to give me through these phony advertising payments at four or five times the usual rate.",
  "But you must assume that they are now.",
  "That's if they are -- that's if they are aiders and if there are only two and abettor, then you're right. But if there's a middle category of people who, while not the benefited company -- the company that's trying to achieve the deception -- but made it possible for that -- for that deception to happen.",
  "No --",
  "In Central Bank, it was conceded that the bank engaged in no deceptive act.",
  "Here there is the charge that it did engage in deceptive acts.",
  "Because the whole purpose of it --",
  "Mr. Shapiro, if --",
  "If it was communicated to investors that there had been $20 per set box over the regular price, if there had been advertising that was paid for by the very money that Charter gave, then the whole thing would have failed. So this can work only if the vendors are silent. Silence and not speech is what counts. If the vendors communicate anything at all, the whole thing fails.",
  "Was there any --",
  "Was there any economic substance to this?",
  "Is it true that the price that they were charging, they did not charge to other customers -- the $20 hike?",
  "But it was --",
  "-- a sham then, because they said the reason they upped the price $20 a box was renegotiate the contract, but didn't renegotiate with any of their other customers.",
  "That's the essence of the scheme. You said that they -- they are home free because they didn't themselves make any statement to investors. But they set up Charter to make those statements, to swell its revenues -- revenues that it in fact didn't have.",
  "That's if they are aiders and abettors, which is what Congress covered. And I everyone -- either Charter, the person whose stock is at stake, the company whose stock is at stake and everyone else is an aider? I take it that that's your position.",
  "It's either the company whose stock is in question or you're an aider and abettor.",
  "Which I thought speak about aiders and abettors.",
  "But is usually --",
  "-- aider and abettor -- then again we get back to the question: If there's nothing in this world other than the company that puts out the false statement and the aider and abettor --",
  "-- and is there something in between?",
  "But we're taking those out. We're talking about independent actors.",
  "Does the SEC distinguish this kind of situation where silence is the essence of the thing for the deceiver, silence not speech? Does the SEC distinguish this from aiding-and-abetting?",
  "Could the SEC get any monetary recovery for the investors on your theory? You say yes, it's a deceptive practice, but this belongs in the SEC's bailiwick, not in private suits?",
  "Private suits; obviously they are seeking damages for the decline in the share price. What could the SEC -- suppose it should take up this case -- get by way of remedy? civil fines, as well as disgorgement remedies.",
  "But there is no disgorgement here because the vendors didn't get anything. For them it was a wash.",
  "Well, but this case, disgorgement would not be a remedy. You say fines, but those would be payable to the government, right?",
  "But there would be no disgorgement relief.",
  "What profits did the vendors get? For them it was a wash. They got -- what did they have to disgorge?",
  "But did they receive something that they then disgorged?",
  "I don't see --",
  "Would you address first whether receipt of the gun constitutes possession of the gun?",
  "But under the statute as amended, possession is also indictable.",
  "In Smith, the Court said that the reason that selling the gun in exchange for drugs -- what was dangerous about that was the potential for instantly converting the gun from currency to a cannon. But here isn't that even all the more of concern because one who receives the gun can instantly turn it around and shoot the drug seller?",
  "But it's the same on both sides. It seems to me in both cases there is a risk of using the gun. The one who comes in with the gun can use it; the one who receives the gun can use it.",
  "Mr. Koch, but the government answers that, a dollar for coffee, by saying it depends what question you ask. So if you ask was the coffee part of a beverage transaction, the answer would be of course yes.",
  "This is a gun transaction.",
  "I don't remember whether you ask in your brief as an alternative argument for the overruling of Smith.",
  "It has to be used by somebody, some human, and the human in this case is Mr. Watson.",
  "And in answer to my question, you said you were not urging the overruling of Smith?",
  "If he has a gun in his hand he is certainly carrying it.",
  "May I ask - -",
  "It was -- Watson possessed the gun, would you agree with that, in furtherance of the transaction? Would you say that this case fits the statute, as amended, so it could have been charged as possession?",
  "Why was it -- why wasn't possession charged here?",
  "But the prosecution would certainly want to assure the success of the argument; and if this is clearly possession, why wasn't possession charged? And does the Department of Justice give any guidance to prosecutors since the 1988 amendment on what to charge in these situations?",
  "But -- but Smith, in Smith, Justice O'Connor used the illustration turning currency into a cannon. You can't do that very well if the gun is in a car, in a locked trunk in a car on the street. You can't turn the currency, the gun, into a cannon.",
  "Does the ICJ ever issue a judgment of that character? It issues a judgment between two nations, two or more nations, and it is instructs the United States to do something. I'm not aware of any -- any decision of the ICJ that says what a sentence should be for a particular individual.",
  "If you had a - -",
  "If you had a treaty on the recognition and enforcement of judgments, mutual recognition and enforcement, then we would enforce the judgment that we agreed to enforce by treaty. We wouldn't look behind it to see if we agreed with it on the merits. Are you saying that this undertaking, this agreement to submit to the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ gives the judgment in the particular case, although not precedential effect, the counterpart to full faith and credit?",
  "Then it becomes - -",
  "Then it becomes a penal judgment, and I thought the rule was that no country forces -- enforces another country's penal judgment.",
  "But if we say - -",
  "-- this man goes to jail for 5 years, it seems to me that's a penal judgment.",
  "You didn't mention the - -",
  "You didn't mention the Optional Protocol which is -- is where the United States gave its promise. It voluntarily accepted this jurisdiction. It didn't have to.",
  "But that would take an action by somebody in the country.",
  "Here that hasn't -- that hasn't happened. 94 would never be triggered because we haven't said we're breaking our promise, we're not going to comply.",
  "If you don't -- if you don't comply, you don't comply. But we -- certainly not -- in that situation here, the President said the United States agreed that it would submit to the binding jurisdiction for one case only, and we are bound by that judgment and I'm going to enforce it.",
  "General, can we just clarify something which I think is important? Justice Scalia suggested that this wasn't self-executing. The State Department with respect to the Vienna Convention itself told Congress very clearly: You don't have to do anything; this is self-executing. And then the protocol says: We the United States agree to accept the jurisdiction of the ICJ in a certain class of cases. And Congress ratified that, too. So I don't think that self-executing has anything to do with this case.",
  "But in Nicaragua the United States took the position from day 1 that the ICJ had no jurisdiction over the case. So the absence of jurisdiction is always an exception to the obligation, even within the United States, to give full faith and credit. If the court had no jurisdiction, another State doesn't have to give full faith and credit. But if it does have jurisdiction, then the obligation kicks in.",
  "That's after there's a breach, but we -- let's stick to the protocol, the Optional Protocol -- optional. The protocol says: We accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ. \"Jurisdiction\" means power. We agree that in cases of this character, Vienna Convention violation cases, we submit to the jurisdiction of X tribunal, the ICJ. What is there that needs execution about that? Congress said yes, the United States, the Executive Branch of the United States decides that it's a good idea to submit to the -- to the jurisdiction of the ICJ. We ratify that. And I don't see anything left for Congress to do. It said the United States can submit to the jurisdiction of the ICJ.",
  "Well, I still -- I would like to get back to that Optional Protocol. It -- was it submission to jurisdiction? My understanding is that any two parties that can agree, can have a formed selection clause, can agree that we accept the authority of this tribunal, and then it follows from that that if you accept their authority to adjudicate, you are bound to follow its decisions. And that that seems to be understood in the world community because, is it not so that even though there are cases like Nicaragua and Iran, most ICJ judgments are indeed complied with by the nations that agree to submit to the jurisdiction of that tribunal?",
  "Do you have a case that says that? A Mexican case that says that?",
  "Maybe it hasn't come up.",
  "But - -",
  "Mr. Cruz - -",
  "Are you saying that even --",
  "Then we couldn't have a treaty with another country on the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgment, because the other country might get it wrong, we might disagree with its interpretation of the law, and, therefore, unlike the rest of the world, the United States can't get the advantage of a reciprocal guarantee that our judgments will be respected, and in turn we will respect your judgment.",
  "It may be that if the case turns on a question of U.S. law, and we may think, as many think about the ICJ, that they got that question wrong. Still, it's always been if you don't look behind the judgment. You say in the next case I'm certainly not going to apply that wrong interpretation. But here I'm bound by a judgment. And that's why I questioned your use -- your heavy use of Sanchez-Llamas. I agreed with the court in that case because it was a question of interpretation. We don't have to agree with the ICJ. We were not faced with a decision, a binding adjudication, which we accept for that case only. So there's a difference between Sanchez-Llamas and this case that you appear not to recognize in your brief.",
  "I thought you said that -- oh, you said that this is a matter of goodwill or that most ICJ judgments -- ICJ judgments, they're not binding but people comply -- nations comply with them as a matter of goodwill?",
  "What could -- other than -- I mean, the most logical place to have this go on is the court that rendered the judgment. It's always better for the court that rendered the judgment than some foreign court or another State court. So what else could the President do? The ICJ did say U.S., as a matter of your own choosing. And the President chose the most logical forum, but what else could he have done?",
  "Let's start with the first one. Why should this case be in Federal court? It's a state judgment that's in question.",
  "But you can have the Federal court overseeing the State court and telling the State what to do? That seems to me practically much more of an encroachment on State authority than to say, State courts, you do it.",
  "-- or to say Federal courts, you do it.",
  "Who would be doing the review?",
  "A law passed by Congress saying Texas dispense with your procedural bar rules?",
  "So what's absent in your view is Congress. You say that all of this could have been done - -",
  "-- and Texas could have been ordered, but the President doesn't have the authority to do it just on the basis of the ICJ,",
  "The not self-executing in the position of the State Department, wasn't there -- in the parallel proceedings in Oklahoma, wasn't there a letter from the current -- the then current legal adviser telling Oklahoma that this is a judgment that's binding on all courts in the United States, State and Federal, and that the President has directed Oklahoma to comply? I think that was sent both to the governor and the other officials.",
  "Which -- which letter are you quoting? Are you quoting - -",
  "Yes, there is. We have interpreted the law, and we have said as far as what Article 36 means, we disagree with the ICJ.",
  "And Oklahoma has taken the opposite position, and they -- they did give the review and reconsideration?",
  "And has any other State acted?",
  "I thought the ICJ flatly refused Mexican -- Mexico said ICJ annulled the judgment. The ICJ said no, and it didn't vacate it, either. It just said that it did a reconsideration to see whether there was prejudice.",
  "Their very own statute, the statute setting up the ICJ, makes it clear that is not the case. They can issue a binding judgment in the particular case. It has no precedential effect for other cases, not even within the ICJ.",
  "Has that ever happened?",
  "And the U.S. exercised its veto.",
  "Mr. Days, can I interrupt you there, and ask, if you would - -",
  "-- if you would define the transactions -- the particular transactions on which you rely to come within that provision and what rules of the exchange or the clearinghouse do you say was violated?",
  "You think you - -",
  "You've talked about the transaction, but I also ask you, what were the rules that the Defendants violated, the rules of the statute?",
  "It would be an argument for this case because that absence has been cured. Wasn't that in the 2000 amendment that -- that they changed the - -",
  "-- the list to registered entity and which does include clearinghouse.",
  "Didn't Judge Friendly refer to the FCM as a central player or a principal in - -",
  "Why isn't it just - -",
  "-- the guarantee, the relationship between the clearing organization and the clearinghouse -- the clearing organization has to give a guarantee and has to put up margin?",
  "So there is a transaction between the clearinghouse and the clearing organization.",
  "What about the argument that if we accept your view of it, allowing the FCM to sue, then there could be multiple liability?",
  "Is that why the Second Circuit was wrong in saying it was just like a securities broker?",
  "Mr. Pincus, if your view were correct it would have been so easy for Congress to say \"buyers and sellers\" or even \"trade,\" but it used a word \"transaction\" that you say has a special meaning in this context, but \"transaction\" appears all through the law and usually it's a term that has encompassing meaning, like in the Federal rules \"any transaction or occurrence,\" and you would say that Congress has given it here this very constrained meaning.",
  "Why didn't it just say sustained by a buyer or seller? \"Shall be liable for actual damages sustained by a buyer or seller.\" Why - - why would it need to be any more complicated than that?",
  "When everything else is the same, instead of \"a person,\" just \"buyer and seller.\"",
  "I don't know why.",
  "You recognize that the Second Circuit was wrong when it said that this FCM is just like a securities broker. He is just making a deal for a commission. It seems to me that that -- that was not proper.",
  "But it's not just Klein. It's every FCM. That is the job of an FCM.",
  "So that's not -- not comparable to just a broker who executes my order for shares and gets a commission for it.",
  "Mr. Pincus - -",
  "Justice Kennedy was asking you about the government's position. One of the positions -- one aspect of the government's position is that -- that you would not dispute that a person who engaged in a transaction subject to the rules of a clearinghouse would be a proper plaintiff under the current law. Well, certainly the FCM is a person subject to the rules of a clearinghouse.",
  "That's what I thought your position was. So that's not an accurate.",
  "-- characterization.",
  "But the only one that has this relationship that's different from an ordinary broker, the only one is the FCM.",
  "But they're not people who are at risk. I mean if there -- if it's a broker who was just executing a trade for a commission is not at risk, but this FCM is at risk, in this transaction, series of transactions.",
  "Is there some - -",
  "Mr. Pincus - -",
  "The -- the agency that's supposed to be the supervisor of this area, the CFTC, is taking the position that the government presented to us today. Apparently, it doesn't have the concern that you have just expressed about reaching people who are not themselves subject to the regulation of the exchange, the clearinghouse.",
  "I thought that what he was telling us was that, even if you assume that Klein has that, even if you've assume that.",
  "Did you say IRS officers, because they would be covered? It's tax and customs.",
  "You gave an example in your brief that didn't seem to fit. I mean you spoke of a DEA agent who was searching for narcotics, and that sounds to me like what DEA agents do. They were not auxiliary to a customs officer.",
  "But they were doing it for their primary business, which was to detect narcotics.",
  "Does that still exist after the Westfall Act?",
  "Because now, the -- there wouldn't be -- the United States would be substituted - -",
  "-- for the agent's abuses.",
  "Why wasn't it federally funded? I thought there was a provision for indemnification.",
  "You have a difference with Mr. Andre on the extent to which other law enforcement officers assist customs and revenue agents. In your brief you say that's a rare occurrence. And Mr. Andre says oh no, it's quite common. So which is it?",
  "I know your time is running out, but I would like you also to say a word about what remedy, if any, does Ali have when you're saying he had his prayer rug and Koran, and the government lost them and he didn't get any compensation? Does he have any remedy?",
  "But there's no court - - there's no court role in that process.",
  "Wouldn't they have IFP status?",
  "Here there wasn't that much at stake.",
  "So if you had a statute -- a State like, I'm told, Vermont, that doesn't take away any one's civil rights, not even a first degree murderer's, then that first degree murderer would be equated to someone whose civil rights were taken away and then restored.",
  "They're not anomalies because the gun prohibition would cover them, even though they never had their civil rights taken away? Is that -- is that what you're saying?",
  "Well, then, maybe the problem was that Congress included misdemeanants who were subject to over a two- year sentence. The point has been made that, on your reading, that was a futile gesture, or Congress did one thing that was cancelled out by someone else, by another provision. And then they put in this group of misdemeanants who were subject to an over-two-year sentence; but most of that group -- and in many states all of them -- would not have their civil rights taken away. So what is left of the group that was put in, misdemeanants with over-two-year sentences?",
  "What was the point of putting that group in the statute as covered by the Career Criminal Act?",
  "But how many would be - - take a State that doesn't take civil rights away and gun rights from misdemeanants. What effect in that State would this legislation have -- what effect would the provision of this legislation -- that says misdemeanants who are subject to a two-year -- over-two-year term are covered? It wouldn't be covered because the -- because they're not having their civil rights taken away.",
  "Everyone in this case. The point might be arguable in a case that involved that domestic violence statute. Everyone in this case. This case doesn't involve that other provision.",
  "There are cases in the pipeline that don't think it's as clear as day.",
  "Yes.",
  "But Ferber confined the meaning of child pornography to, I think, the greater extent than this statute does. It talks about artistic value, but this -- there were several examples given in the briefs. One was this film depicts 12 year old child having sexual relations with an old man. Now that statement could be perceived as this film shows child pornography. Just that statement. But it's a truthful statement about Lolita, is it not?",
  "Why not? If you say - - if you say, 12 year old child -- this film shows a 12 year old child, and it doesn't tell you that the person who's playing a 12 year old is a young adult?",
  "But - -",
  "I just wanted to clarify the footnote to which the Chief referred, that footnote 4 in your reply brief. It says, to the contrary, the government's brief expressly acknowledges that the statute's proscription encompasses noncommercial speech. So I think Justice Breyer's suggestion that you said in your brief, that the statute is limited to commercial speech, is something that you -- say, no, that's not so; we say it encompasses noncommercial speech.",
  "Even though -- even though what you are, in fact, showing or presenting does not fit the definition? Even if what you're showing - - you say, have I got some hot child porn and here it is, and the \"it\" is -- is -- an adult pretending to be a child, or a virtual image. So the -- the problem is not an accurate representation that this is hardcore porn, and it is, but saying, have I got the real stuff, but what you present is not at all the real stuff.",
  "You could -- just one question. You mentioned a film, \"Traffic,\" which I did not see, but one of the briefs said there was an actual 17 year old playing that part. But you said that wouldn't be -- that wouldn't fit.",
  "But the statute says simulated.",
  "What about \"present\"? The word \"pandering\" itself is not used in the statute. It uses a lot of words, \"promote\" and \"advertise\" - - well, maybe that's just redundant. I guess that would be the government's position -- but \"present,\" \"distribute\" -- what else?",
  "And rewrite -- and essentially rewriting the law, and that's my question about this technique that Justice Breyer has proposed. This Court is not generally in the business of writing appendices that say well, the statute couldn't apply in this situation, and it couldn't apply and as long as we put those contours around it. Certainly the Court could write an opinion that would inform Congress why this particular statute as written is overbroad, and explain what kind of statute wouldn't be overbroad. But for the Court itself, I think that that -- I don't know any instance in which we have provided that kind of appendix that said things that are like Traffic, they're okay, and things that are like something else are not okay. I don't know.",
  "Do we see them getting prosecuted in any state?",
  "I asked you have there been such cases? A lot of states have pandering laws now, and is the case that you posit a case that has occurred in any of those states?",
  "Maybe that's because the quantity of material has increased.",
  "The only thing that limits the statute is the First Amendment. What else - - you say it may not be covered by the First Amendment. What else gives you a right to challenge the statute?",
  "How is it different it would be strange to trust out the document -- the doctrine as I -- as I understand it is what we relied on when we had the predecessor to this statute before.",
  "How did that occur in - - free speech coalition.",
  "That issue is not a necessary part of your case at all, but you don't have to suggest that you could depart. You could do less than Teague. For example, Griffith. You can accept that as a given because it doesn't touch your case. Isn't that so?",
  "But there is -- there is -- it's not as though we have a new rule, and we apply it from this day forward. Crawford is retroactive at least for cases that are not yet final. When they were on trial, Crawford wasn't there, but maybe somewhere toward the end of the appellate process, lo and behold, they can take advantage of it. So it's a question of where you want to cut it off. And at one time, didn't this Court cut it off in a different place?",
  "I'm -- I'm confused on this one, because I thought it was part of our retroactivity jurisprudence that the States must apply that new rule while the case is still in the pipeline, while it is on direct appeal, not that they -- well, they just may, but they absolutely must apply it retroactively. I thought that's what Griffith said.",
  "If it comes up after - - if the prosecution is after the Federal decision, of course, the decision has to apply.",
  "But if you can say -- it is a little odd that the State executive can say, yes, as far as we're concerned, we like the new law, or what was always the law but the Court wasn't perceptive enough to see that, we like it, so we're not going to raise Teague. It would be an anomaly, would it not, that the executive of the State is not bound by Teague, but the courts are?",
  "It's subject to the floor, that the floor that this Court sets, it must be retroactive to a certain extent.",
  "That's not the point. I thought that Teague was driven not by some abstract notion about finality, but the intrusion on State decision-making. Here was State that had conducted an entire process that appeared to be in line with what the Federal law then appeared to be. And then the State is told by some Federal habeas court, State, you've got to do it all over again, because you didn't -- you didn't predict that we were going to interpret the Constitution differently. I thought that the really motivating idea of Teague was it addressed the Federal forum and said, Federal forum, don't step on the States' toes, don't make them redo trials that have long since been over.",
  "That was not a question addressed to you, Mr. Diamond.",
  "You do recognize, though, that one of the propelling forces behind Teague and why we changed from the Linkletter regime was respect for State courts' processes and the resistance to the heavy hand of Federal habeas courts telling States what to do. It seems a little ironic then if you take an opinion that was driven by the Feds staying out of the State courts' territory to say oh, no, we're going to tell you that it's not -- we control when we want to.",
  "-- State executives can upset all those expectations. The State executive says I want this -- the issue -- the substantive issue in this case settled, so I'm not going to raise Teague. And so Crawford is going to be retroactive because I say so. It is a bit of an anomaly that the prosecutor has that power but not the State court itself.",
  "It is also difficult to see what Federal interest is vindicated when the State says we know we have to respect this -- call it what you want -- new precedent in cases still in the pipeline, and we don't have to if the case has reached a final judgment. But \"not required to\" doesn't say \"can't, even if you want to.\"",
  "Could a -- could a State say: We know that Federal habeas, the Fourth Amendment, is out. Stone v. Powell says when it's -- when you go through the direct process, that's the end of your raising a search-and-seizure claim. Could a State say: Well, we know the Fourth Amendment is binding on us under the Federal Constitution, but we think that we should extend the Fourth Amendment, right, not only to cases on direct review but to collateral review as well? Federal habeas courts can't do it, but could States?",
  "There's something not quite right about that. Wasn't all the evidence submitted, but the district judge said, I have all the evidence, but I can't consider. It isn't a question of introducing new evidence when it goes back. It's a question of looking at the body of evidence that was submitted.",
  "Could the district court appoint a special master to help her?",
  "And if you limit it to the application and not the methodology, then Congress's overriding goal was there was a problem with overevaluation of the railroad's property, and Congress was responding to that problem of overevaluating the property. But if you limit the challenger to just the application, then you are not going to have as vigorous a check on over evaluation as you would have if you could -- if you could reach back to the methodology.",
  "I thought -- I thought you conceded that that was what it would be, because you said that the Federal court would be turned into a board of equalization, and a board of equalization is not making grand law for setting precedent.",
  "I think what they want is to be able to attack the methodology and not be limited to the application of whatever methodology the State prefers.",
  "I thought both sides agreed that the unit - -",
  "I guess the term methodology is confusing because you could think it means unit rule - -",

  "Mr. Trower, were private activity bonds considered at all below? As far as I understand, this is not a private activity bond, it's not, what's at issue here. And there was no adjudication with respect to that type of bond - -",
  "-- in the lower courts.",
  "Why is it any different from a tax credit?",
  "What about the example that was given of a interstate compact, say, to operate a port authority that covers a few States, and the compacters agree that they are not going to tax the income on bonds issued by the port authority, but they are going to tax the income from out-of-State municipal, but it's only the bonds from this port authority. So they -- it seems your theory would reach that too.",
  "And yet Congress has approved compacts that say just that.",
  "The Court, in that old Bonaparte case, it was just kind of very naive because the Court made a decision that didn't -- that State A can't create bonds that are going to be exempt from tax in other States, right?",
  "I think in Contracts it was used as an example of a so-called built-in statute of limitations, one that is thought to bar the right as well as the remedy.",
  "It said determining when and under what conditions Federal courts can hear cases falls within the court's adjudicatory authority -- or that are within the adjudicatory authority are jurisdictional, when and under what conditions Federal courts hear cases. That would be very broad, but it did say that. Could not interfere with the plain-text reading of 2501 once you assume - -",
  "Then there would be a built-in limitation, and usually that's not considered jurisdictional. It would be under the heading of failure to state a claim; that is, your claim has been extinguished, so you have no claim to state, as opposed to the ordinary operation of the statute of limitations which bars only the remedy, not the right.",
  "Bowles said that.",
  "Bowles said if it's equitably tolled, it's not jurisdictional. If it -- a provision that is jurisdictional cannot be equitably tolled.",
  "One member of the court did think that Irvin -- Irwin overruled Soriano, but only one member.",
  "Is it just Irwin or a whole line of cases? There was a time when the jurisdictional label was used rather frequently. There is a more recent case that says \"jurisdiction\" is a word of many meanings, too many meanings. And I think the Court has been trying to cut down on the too many meanings.",
  "It did say statutory time limits -- this is Irwin -- applicable to lawsuits - - well, the sentence about the suits: The rule of equitable tolling applicable to suits against the government. It says the rule that was announced is applicable to the government, the same as with respect to private parties. So it's hard to think of what territory Irwin would cover if it doesn't -- because in all suits, at least for money against the government, there has to be a waiver of sovereign immunity.",
  "Even if -- even if you're right, couldn't the Federal Circuit say: Well, that's all very interesting but Day v. McDonough told us that if we want to raise it on our own -- we don't have to if it's not jurisdictional; but if we want to, we can.",
  "But you certainly would be mixing categories terribly if you suggested that something that goes to the court's authority to proceed in the case can be waived if it's equitable to waive it. I mean, those two notions are at odds with each other.",
  "Well, what would, what would Irwin and Franconia that made statements -- when it's a question of a time limit, they operate against the government just like they operate against private parties, to what kind of case would that apply? I mean, it's been pointed out that 2501 covers a whole slew of cases, not just takings cases.",
  "What about -- what about the rules of the Court of Federal Claims? Rule 8(c) states that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense. And that's in suits against the Government because that's all the Court of Federal Claims deals with. So to what would that Rule 8(c) apply?",
  "But all those statutes of limitations would be statutes of limitations operating against the government.",
  "Would you say that Franconia did use loose language, because although it dealt with accrual -- when does the claim accrue, and not when is it cut off -- but it did say, it called 2501 specifically \"an unexceptional statute of limitations.\"",
  "And if we looked at the Court of Federal Claims decisions now, I think they're spelled out in the opinion. They go both directions. That is, some say 2501 is jurisdictional, some say it's not.",
  "Did Congress think that Rule 8(c) has no range of application? And -- we have two recent statements saying statutes of limitations against the government are like statutes against private parties. But if 2501, which covers all of the cases over which the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction -- if, if it's for jurisdictional, then I don't know what cases there would be in which there's a time limit in a suit against the government that isn't jurisdictional.",
  "But we do know the CFC is at least confused because they have some cases going one way and some cases going the other way. And from the government's point of view, the government can be relied on to raise the statute of limitations, I suppose, but aren't there cases where the government would really like to get the substantive issue settled? So it says, well, the statute of limitations is arguable, but we'll concede that the action was timely.",
  "But, of course, Bowles - - I mean the Court did miss something. Everyone on the Court did, and that is that the period to file your notice of appeal was originally not in any statute. It was in the rule, the FRAP rule. The opinions, both sides, assumed that the statute came first, and the rule was adopted to conform to the statute, but in fact it was just the opposite. It was a rule, a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, which can't affect jurisdiction. We know that. As Congress says rules of procedure don't affect jurisdiction. So there was the rule, and then the U.S. Judicial Conference said to Congress, when it referred the rule to Congress, you might consider a conforming amendment. And then the statute, after the rule came into effect, conformed to the rule. So what the Court, both sides, thought in Bowles -- we just had it in reverse.",
  "Well, Congress didn't think about it at all until the U.S. Judicial Conference said do this - -",
  "-- and the U.S. Judicial Conference wasn't thinking that thereby it became jurisdictional.",
  "It was addressed specifically. It was addressed that the rule -- that the -- that all of this was statute driven. But the rule before -- before there was a conforming statute, you would say, well, then it wasn't jurisdictional, right?",
  "Well, why don't we do exactly that here? I mean, you say that the proper thing to do, now a charge labelled Form 5 has been filed, is to dismiss this lawsuit; and then we wait 60 days; and the identical lawsuit is reinstated. Why shouldn't the court simply toll the case and say, now we have a proper Form 5. The employer didn't get a chance to engage in settlement. So we hold on to the case and allow the 60 days to elapse, and then the complaint is there. Why isn't that the appropriate solution for this case?",
  "But you said the same complaint could be filed at the end of the conciliation. What difference does it make that you have a piece of paper there? What I don't understand is the only effect of your position -- dismiss the whole thing, 60 days, start over -- is you're making the plaintiff file an additional filing fee. The complaint has already been filed. The filing fee has been paid. Now, everything would work out just the same except the plaintiff has to pay a second filing fee. In the court there are certain inefficiencies if it's first dismissed and then they have to docket it again. So I don't see any -- it doesn't seem to make any sense to me.",
  "After she had a lawyer. But is it -- is it not the practice at the EEOC when you're dealing with an unrepresented person who files the intake questionnaire and if the SEC reviewer thinks that it fits within the statute, that the Form 5 will be filled out, not by the layperson, but by the EEOC officer herself?",
  "But that's not the question. The question I asked is if they decide that the, what the intake -- the information on the intake questionnaire fits within the statute so that the claim can go forward, isn't it the practice not to ask the layperson to fill out the Form 5, but for the EEOC to do it itself?",
  "Well, it has to be signed.",
  "Well, she filled out hers after she was already in court and had a lawyer. But I thought that this statute, as all the statutes EEOC administers, are designed for claims that are put forth initially largely by unrepresented people. And the notion is that the agency should make it as easy as possible for them to get through the legal process.",
  "What happens -- what happens if -- in this case it's not a problem, but I can imagine it would be in many cases -- - if you have a 300-day or a 180-day problem, you withdraw the complaint, and then you're out there and the clock keeps ticking, and you get past the 300 days and you are totally out. That's why it's important not to follow - - to say, well, it's, it doesn't make any difference, if we dismiss this complaint, she comes back in 60 days. Well, but 60 days may be 360 days.",
  "Wasn't she appealing?",
  "Wasn't she appealing the dismissal?",
  "Well, I don't understand that, because EEOC is a responsible agency. Congress has told it: You weed out the people complaining about something that happened in Paris, and then you give notice. But the notice obligation -- and I understand it is EEOC's, not the complainant's. So we would not expect this agency -- yes, it messed up in this case - - routinely not to give notice, routinely not to engage the employer in conciliation efforts.",
  "What about the new form, the EEOC's new form -- I suppose responsive to this case and others like it -- that says if you don't file any other administrative complaint, we'll count the intake questionnaire as the charge?",
  "If the EEOC treats it as a charge, then the EEOC is obliged to give notice.",
  "Where -- where does it say if you don't file it's only - -",
  "Yes.",
  "That's the new form.",
  "And where in the form that - -",
  "The new form does say that, that if no other paper is filed, this can be treated as a charge?",
  "Do we know whether that's true in this case?",
  "Do we know whether -- I mean the difference -- what you are suggesting would be perfectly fine is once the charge was filed, and this is a lawsuit, and then you would investigate or whatever, but you would be under exactly the same disadvantage if the time lapse has meant that employees have left, that you have -- you have removed evidence as old and disposable. It wouldn't -- you would -- on your scenario of what would be the right way to do this lawsuit, you would be -- you would suffer the same disabilities in terms of documents and witnesses.",
  "If she had the obligation to give notice, you would have a much stronger argument, but the statute places that burden on the EEOC, not on the lay complainant.",
  "This is where -- you're reading from where?",
  "Is a complaint different from an intake questionnaire?",
  "Mr. Heytens, is it true that the Form 5 for somebody who's not represented by counsel is usually done by EEOC itself? Is it that true?",
  "Mr. Phillips, would you say the same thing if the agreement provided for de novo review in the district court?",
  "That would be -- I am assuming that the parties wrote that standard into their contract, so to the extent you're relying on party autonomy why couldn't the parties elect whatever standard of review they wish?",
  "But they were both - - they were both in this agreement, both the substantial evidence rule and the standard of review of legal error. So are you saying that you -- we don't have to deal with that question or you're not going to defend it, because the standard was dual. Am I not right about what they --",
  "It doesn't read like one. 10 and 11 don't read like default - -",
  "What else is there besides the manifest whatever? The - -",
  "What about public policy? That was the other one Mr. Phillips brought up.",
  "Miss Brinkmann, can we back up a bit, because this agreement had an usual genesis. This was a big case, and the judge kept right in the court a piece of it. And then he and the parties agreed that another piece of it would best be resolved in arbitration. So the judge was in equal participation in that effort. All three parties wanted to get a particular issue resolved through an arbitrator rather than the court, itself. And I doubt very much whether the judge would have been at all interested in that scheme if he thought he were doing an idle thing. That the parties, having agreed to just what the judge thought was a nice way to resolve this issue, would then find themselves out of Federal court and have to bring some kind of suit in State court. It doesn't seem to fit this scenario.",
  "Why not use -- why not use Rule 16, pretrial procedure, and the parties and the judge can work out what they think is the most efficient way to resolve this controversy? So they decide at the pretrial conference that they are going to build into this arrangement one issue that they are going to peel off to go to an arbitrator, but the judge is going to retain control through the legal error.",
  "That's a strange argument in this respect. You are arguing that this non-Article III person has more control rather than less control; that if the judge controlled this arbitrator, somehow that would violate Article III. But if the judge has no control and is essentially little more than a rubber stamp on what the non-Article III person does, then that's all right. And the sense of that doesn't come across to me.",
  "Are there any - -",
  "Are there any -- are there any such States left today that are using the Illinois model?",
  "Is there a possibility that the reason the language in the statute is as it is -- when was the Federal Arbitration Act; what year was it?",
  "And there was still abroad in the land considerable distrust of arbitrators. Judges said arbitrators are stepping on our turf, and so they would be naturally resistant to let the arbitrator go ahead and have the most minimal review in court. Maybe the act was written the way it was to say, if the parties want to go to arbitration, courts, you stay out of it.",
  "Is that what - -",
  "Well, let's take this statute and let's take the circuits that have the rule, the opposite rule. In fact, the Ninth Circuit had the opposite rule until rather recently. What has been the experience -- I think the Fifth Circuit is on the other side?",
  "What has been the experience there?",
  "I think a lot of those horribles, Mr. Phillips would agree with you because he hesitated even on de novo, and I think he thought that trying to control an appeal from the district court, that would be out of the ballpark.",
  "But one problem that I have with your position is you say that the -- you should continue to prevail, although that would be in violation of the parties' agreement. Under the Ninth Circuit decision, you win, what the arbitrator says goes, and there isn't the review that the parties bargained for.",
  "Where does it say that (a)(1) is available only against the plan?",
  "I thought your own argument was that (a)(3) is the catchall. So if (a)(2), which is described as very precise, if that's applicable, you would not get to (a)(3). You would be asking us at this point to assume that somehow the (a)(2) case folds, and then we flip over into (a)(3). But why should we get there prematurely? It seems to me if it's right that (a)(2) comes before (a)(3), it isn't -- it's not quite a ripeness issue, but it's close to that.",
  "Mr. Roberts, would you clarify what the government's position is on this (a)(1)(B) argument? Are you saying it is available, but (a)(2) is available?",
  "Well, now we know what benefits would be due because he has withdrawn, but when he made this complaint and he hadn't been withdrawn, he could have made an unwise investment the next time. And - -",
  "Russell was about a welfare plan, not a pension -- and as I recall, the plaintiff in Russell was seeking medical benefits that she didn't get and she wanted, not the benefits because she did get those, she wanted straight out damages, compensatory and punitive damages, for delay in the receipt of benefits. That's quite a different thing from saying I want the contributions made so that I will get the benefits to which I'm entitled.",
  "So then you would agree that (a)(1)(B) is not available?",
  "But what is the plan other than a collection of individual -- I mean the trustee is the trustee for the plan. All of the assets are there. The individuals do not have them in their pockets. So the trustee is managing this fund, which is then segmented into accounts for each individual. So I think your -- your suggestion is that these defined contribution plans, they come out entirely because - - because of the segmented accounts. So you could never bring a claim because it would always be an individual.",
  "Yes, but you said -- you said it doesn't have to be every single member of the plan.",
  "You said it has to be more than one. How then do we read the statute to say, well, it doesn't have to be the plan as a whole because there may be some people that are not entitled to this? How do we get that number between more than one and less than everybody?",
  "But I'm -- I'm asking you just -- in your -- you have said, you conceded, that to bring the suit against the trustee, it doesn't have to involve every member, every contributor to this defined contribution plan. But it has to involve - -",
  "-- more than one. So that's the question I'd like to you address. You recognize that there can be a claim against the fiduciary for breach of trust on behalf of contributors to the plan? So in that lawsuit, how many people would there have to be to qualify? You say not everybody, but more than one.",
  "For example.",
  "What? What other remedies?",
  "But you said this isn't -- you said it isn't a claim for benefits. It's a clam for lost profits. You said that a few times. I thought (a)(1)(B) is a claim for benefits, current or future.",
  "I know, because in making this, hitching your wagon to the (a)(1)(B) -- I thought you were arguing -- what did you say the remedy for this person would be? Assuming it's true that he put in his slip and he said invest in X set of mutual funds and the trustee missed it, lost it?",
  "What is his remedy?",
  "Is that what you argue in your brief?",
  "So what did you argue is his remedy, in your brief?",
  "What would that be?",
  "He didn't know until he got the report.",
  "But it's much too late. It's over and done. It wasn't made.",
  "Let's take, because this case was tossed out on the pleadings, the -- there are forms to fill out and says I want this set of investments as opposed to that set of investments. The contributor fills out that form, gives it to the fiduciary. A careless employee for the fiduciary loses it, and that's the story. So what's the remedy for the contributor who gave his instruction that weren't followed, not out of anything deliberate but just carelessness?",
  "Enjoining him to be careless?",
  "If you say I want these funds invested in this particular set of shares for this period, for this six-month period, then two years later you can have that trade made? I don't understand it.",
  "And never available in a court of law.",
  "Well, then what is it? It's got to be something.",
  "This isn't like a cleanup.",
  "Mr. Rubin, you were not willing to agree with the Chief when he said: Well, maybe there are some investment expenses that are special because this is a trust. But there must be some that any investor would incur. But you say it's got to be all one way.",
  "Is that true? And I'm looking at testimony given by J. Roger Mintz in 1986 when this measure was before Congress, and in that written testimony is the statement: \"First, the treatment of trusts as separate taxpayers with a separate, graduated rate schedule can cause income to be taxed at a rate lower than if the grantor had retained direct ownership of the trust assets or given the assets outright to the beneficiaries.\" So apparently the Treasury was telling the Congress that there is a problem.",
  "A grantor trust would be one of those pass-throughs.",
  "Why is it not administerable? Whether you think it's a faithful rendition of the statute is one thing, but this is exactly what Justice Breyer was talking about. It says these are the things that are special to the trust, and then these are the things that are not. That's what the proposed reg does, right?",
  "It wasn't narrow in the beginning, right?",
  "This is somewhat of a mystery, the wording of that clause. And since it came in at the very last minute, isn't it appropriate to give it a limited reading, rather than, in your suggestion, that this provision that up until the very end read just administration, \"costs paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust,\" period? And then there was this add-on. Why should we give that an expansive meaning?",
  "Why that limitation? Why wouldn't it say just \"investment advice,\" but it's - - investing for total return is more limited?",
  "It doesn't say it's one or the other. So it's not so sure, right? It's sure about advice on investing for total return.",
  "In other words, the regulation, the proposed regulation, doesn't answer this case of investment advice in general as opposed to advice on investing for total return.",
  "They certainly weren't sure about it when they drafted this regulation, proposed regulation.",
  "But in other categories, they express no such limitation. Custody or management of property, not qualified. And they -- but when you get to investing, it has that total return. Everything else has got maintenance, repair, insurance.",
  "Are you saying - -",
  "Are we saying, as a question of law, the taxpayer has the burden of proof? If it isn't a question of proof, it isn't a question of evidence?",
  "And this must be one. The Service must think this is one because it was certain about the tax return. It says tax return that doesn't get the subject to the 2 percent but only this kind of investment advice for total return. So that the Service didn't see this as a clear and certain category.",
  "As far as a tax return, are there accountants this specialize in trust tax returns as opposed to individual or corporate returns?",
  "Mr. Farr, one of the striking things about this Compact is that to the extent that it is definite, there is a lot in here in detail about service arrests on the river and about fishing, but then you get to these two articles at the end and they certainly don't have that same definite detailed quality. As I read the Article VII that you're stressing, it says -- let's see -- \"may continue to exercise.\" So it seems to me that \"may continue to\" was just whatever was the status quo, that will continue; not to do anything dispositive, just whatever was will continue.",
  "Mr. Farr, what about the article that follows Article VII? Article VIII says: \"Nothing herein contained shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State in or over the Delaware River.\" So that's a qualification at least on every other article.",
  "Yes, and I don't see anything expressly set forth in VII, which just says \"may continue to,\" which says the status quo is maintained.",
  "That suggests --",
  "-- it's still an extraordinary power for one State to give up. If Delaware -- if that land -- they didn't settle the boundary, but it might be on the Delaware side. If Delaware was giving up so much, what did it get in exchange?",
  "No, I'm not assuming that. I'm assuming it's unknown, but there is the possibility that it's going to end up --",
  "-- end up --",
  "There's a possibility that it will end up on the Delaware side. And you're suggesting that Delaware relinquished all of its regulatory authority and gave it to New Jersey, no matter where the boundary turned out to be.",
  "And there was in fact in this project, was there not, there was required dredging of 1.24 million cubic yards of submerged soil that would be --",
  "-- on the Delaware side of the boundary?",
  "I thought this extended out more than any prior exercise of riparian rights.",
  "Yes. This was going to be 2,000 feet, and the greatest extension up until then was between 500 and 600.",
  "It's rather recent that Delaware has gotten into the business of regulating at all. I thought that for most of this period until the '60s, Delaware just wasn't doing anything unless something was a nuisance, and that didn't come up.",
  "I don't.",
  "But you're not talking about nuisance. You're talking about Delaware's environmental laws. That's what this project concerns.",
  "And you were saying Delaware's environmental laws trump whatever riparian right New Jersey can grant?",
  "You used the word \"riparian jurisdiction.\" We have riparian rights. That's a familiar term. Riparian jurisdiction which is used in Article VII is a novelty.",
  "Mr. Stern, at the time that the motor carrier deregulation came into effect, were there any products where Maine told the retailer, if you want to sell not face-to-face, you must choose a carrier that will provide X, Y, and Z services? Was there any -- is tobacco alone or were there other commodities?",
  "Does the Postal Service adhere to -- or I don't know if the Postal Service is used to ship cigarettes, tobacco products. But if it is, does the Postal Service adhere to Maine's requirement?",
  "But it does -- you say the Postal Service provides something that conforms, that they have the -- you must deliver it to the person, to the addressee herself?",
  "I thought that wasn't clear from their brief. I thought they had a footnote that said they weren't arguing the point in this case, but I thought they didn't concede the total ban.",
  "But isn't that the result of a settlement?",
  "And nationwide, not just in New York; isn't that so?",
  "So, then, practically, you don't have a problem with cigarettes because the New York settlement takes care of it. You're just talking about other tobacco products?",
  "But I thought, as a result of the New York settlement, carriers are no longer shipping directly to consumers anyplace cigarettes.",
  "Mr. Stern, you told me in -- in response to my question earlier, you mentioned only, I think, game; and you said that those prohibitions were directly on the carrier - -",
  "-- that is, prohibitions and instructions for how you can ship game. And I don't know if that -- if there are other food products. You mentioned only that one. And is it not the case that explosives - - that that's Federal regulation?",
  "But is there -- in addition to the Federal regulation, which I take it would cover various dangerous substances, does Maine add to what the Federal regulation is, say, for sending fireworks, firearms?",
  "Before you do that, Ms. Brinkmann, would you tell us how alcohol is handled, because that is, as I understand it, that's by virtue of the 24th Amendment State regulation. Does UPS carry alcohol packages from one State to another?",
  "But I asked the question only in response to your impossibility argument that you couldn't cope with such State regulations with respect to tobacco, when it seems you are with respect to alcohol.",
  "How did they deal with under the New York settlement? I take it this would be a problem under that settlement, because it doesn't touch selling from a duly licensed dealer. And so, under the New York settlement, which operates nationwide, what does the carrier do to make sure that the recipient is a licensed dealer?",
  "But the first condition, and the package is clearly labeled, aren't there some commodities where UPS does have to pay attention to the label?",
  "It can't be -- Ms. Brinkmann told us that they've got these -- so many packages and it's going to cost millions. But they do have to do it for a package that's labeled hazardous.",
  "What do you mean by that? You repeated several times there must be -- must lay a foundation. You do recognize, I think in your reply brief, that some other supervisor evidence would be relevant and admissible, but you refer to the foundation. Tell us what you think a proper foundation would be.",
  "What do you mean by \"nexus\"? If they both work in the same physical facility, is that a nexus?",
  "And didn't the Tenth Circuit read it to be an absolute prohibition? That it must be the same supervisor? \"'Similarly situated' requires proof that Paul Reddick was the decisionmaker.\" That seems as though that the district court thought there -- it must be the same supervisor, and I thought that's how the Tenth Circuit read - -",
  "-- the district court.",
  "But that didn't present the other supervisor, which I think is more -- a better way to comprehend this, because \"me, too\" could be 10 witnesses working under the same supervisor. But these two people, as I understand it, were in the direct chain of supervisory command.",
  "But that's not \"other supervisor.\" They are both supervisors of this employee. She's in a unit that includes both superior officers. I thought that the issue here was simply other supervisors, witnesses who had worked for other supervisors, people for whom the -- with whom the plaintiff had no connection.",
  "But you say -- I thought you said in your reply brief that other-supervisor evidence could be relevant.",
  "I think you said in your brief that the plaintiff does not have to lay a foundation. And that's the difference between you, I thought -- with respect to Justice Kennedy's question. Your brief takes the position that it is not necessary to lay a foundation in order to introduce other-supervisor evidence.",
  "Mr. Garre, do I understand correctly that the reason the Tenth Circuit thought that the district court was ruling under 401, making a relevance determination, was that the court of appeals had a precedent in the area of employee discipline, and the Tenth Circuit said well, the district court was following that precedent, but that precedent doesn't apply in this situation. So that's why the court of appeals, as I understand it, read the district court as just applying an absolute ban.",
  "But I thought they said that it should be admitted. I thought they went to the opposite extreme.",
  "How did they?",
  "But the -- how can we make that assumption when the Tenth Circuit says we know why this district judge ruled as he or she did? We had a precedent. It -- it dealt with employee discipline. We said, categorically, it's got to be the same supervisor; otherwise it's not relevant. The district judge was simply applying that case to this case.",
  "So it wasn't any 403 question. It was this doesn't some in.",
  "But that's not -- the point is that the Tenth Circuit said this judge made an absolute rule: It doesn't come in. We know why he made an absolute rule; that was our precedent.",
  "Do you not think that there is an important value that the Tenth Circuit recognized in making it clear that there is no absolute bar? If we just assume in favor of the district court, when we don't know that the district court didn't take it as an absolute rule, that -- this is a point of law that should be clarified for the benefit of district courts. Either there's a categorical bar or there's not.",
  "The -- the Government said it was not necessary to lay a foundation. Mr. Garre confirmed that point.",
  "Couldn't counsel at that point have gone back and said, ah, now I see what's going on, so I'm going to challenge -- I'm going to interpose a Batson challenge with respect to the second and third African-American?",
  "Mr. Bright, the Judge was quite passive, and was -- was the judge, in fact, present throughout the entire voir dire?",
  "Mr. Laws was an identical -- he came up too. He said - -",
  "Before -- before the rebuttal, this prosecutor was going around advertising this as his O. J. Simpson case, and the defense attorney said please, Judge, get him to stop saying that. This is long before -- you are painting a picture of someone who was answering an argument made by the defense, but this prosecutor initiated it, and the defense attorney was reacting. She said judge, he's talking in this county, that county about this is his O. J. Case; stop him from doing that.",
  "Then he says I'm an officer of the court, and I'm giving you my word.",
  "What's the difference between that and \"okay\"?",
  "One says I can make arrangements, and the other is more economical and he says \"okay.\"",
  "-- meaning Brooks.",
  "The difference is between \"I can make arrangements\" and \"okay.\"",
  "That wasn't done here. That was the point that you made.",
  "When the third -- the back strike of Brooks was made, they could have gone back for Hawkins and the others, but they didn't.",
  "Mr. Boudreaux, I'd like to ask you a question before you finish. It is not an issue in this case, but we are told that African-Americans are 20 percent of the population of Jefferson Parish, but they were less than 11 percent of the people summoned for jury duty. Is that typical?",
  "That's -- and because it's almost half of what you would expect.",
  "Thank you.",
  "And how does it -- how does it compare with another process that the FDA looks at very closely, I think even more closely than new devices -- new drugs. New drugs also go through a very long testing period. Is there -- and the FDA gives its approval, and the drug is marketed, and it turns out it has risks people didn't understand and there's a tort suit. Is there -- is there a defense to the manufacturer, \"I followed to the letter the permission that the FDA gave me\"?",
  "So it would certainly be at least the same here, right? That compliance with the Federal law would be a defense on the merits.",
  "Is there a reason -- as I understand it, tort suits are not preempted with respect to new drugs. Is there a reason to treat the two differently? For new medical devices and the new drugs?",
  "So that's the difference. So the question -- what does the express preemption provision mean?",
  "Take a - -",
  "Take a concrete situation where the FDA is asked: We'd like to make this improvement. And the FDA says no, we don't think that enhances safety. And then there's a tort suit based on the failure to make that improvement. Wouldn't the FDA rejection of permission to make that improvement - - wouldn't that at least be preemptive?",
  "I thought your response was it wouldn't go to the jury if the FDA had said no, you cannot make this, and the plaintiff's point is you must make it in order to make this device safe. I thought your answer to me was that the FDA regulation -- the FDA's action in refusing to allow the change to be made would be preemptive and you wouldn't give it to a jury to second-guess that determination by the FDA.",
  "I was asking you, if it was -- as a matter of Federal law, if the FDA says - - rejects.",
  "-- a proposed change, can a State court say, well, we think the FDA was wrong in rejecting that, so we're going to let it go to the jury. I thought the question I was posing to you is, isn't Federal law preemptive in that situation, when the FDA says you can't do it and the personal injury lawyer wants it to convince the jury that they had to do it?",
  "How about the - -",
  "Another variation -- the FDA says you must include X in this device or we won't give you the pre-market approval. And so the manufacturer puts X in, and then there's a lawsuit that wants to charge that putting X in made the device dangerous. Would the FDA's insistence that X be put in take X out of any State court's tort litigation? That is, wouldn't -- if the FDA says you must have it, a State court couldn't put to a jury whether you should have eliminated it?",
  "What about the label - - that you're pressing? So you said you really don't know what the design defect was. How about the label? That would be the other thing.",
  "Why, Mr. Olson, is it more essential to this scheme than the new drugs? I would think that if everything that you said about new devices would apply in bold letters to new drugs, because the testing procedures are much longer, are they not?",
  "Well, there's an argument that what it was intended to do was to cut out State pre-market approval, where States like California came in when there was a Federal void and said we shouldn't let the manufacturers put out whatever they'd like. Let's have a pre-market approval. And the argument is, as you well know, which was presented in Senator Kennedy's brief, that's what we meant to do with the preemption provision. Nothing more.",
  "Why isn't there -- to - - to take care of that kind of hypothetical where the FDA says this isn't it, to say that kind of suit can't be brought. But it is, indeed, mentioned that there's a category of suits that is simply saying: Manufacturer, you didn't do what's in that pre-marketing approval? So we're kind of a backup to not doing anything in conflict with the FDA's approval. We're simply saying you didn't follow the labeling requirement, or you didn't follow the design submission that you - -",
  "You would say the same thing for -- for design and labeling if the manufacturer did not do what the FDA approved?",
  "Mr. Olson, what about the argument that once you've got this very valuable pre-market approval, even though you could make that device safer, you have no incentive to do that. You have permission to market this product as is. Even if you know that there's a better way to do it, there's a disincentive to try to go through the process and make the change. Why should you, when you have carte blanche to continue without making the change?",
  "I thought that you conceded that there would be conflict preemption, that the States could not -- either through a State agency or through a jury -- come up with a requirement that would conflict with an FDA requirement.",
  "Everybody agrees that far, that the States were not to be in the business of issuing PMA's. The question is does the preemption clause mean any more than that?",
  "Isn't it -- isn't it - -",
  "If you compared drugs, which -- I think you will -- you will concede -- go through a very arduous process, new drugs, why -- maybe you think that the same preemption applies there, although there's no preemption clause.",
  "Did anyone -- when this preemption clause was put in the new Medical Device, did the government -- when was the government change? Was it 2004? The government's position, the FDA's position, was 180 degrees different - -",
  "Mr. Waxman, how could that be, because the D.C. Circuit never got to that question? The D.C. Circuit, as I understand it, ruled that there was no access to habeas, end of case. So the D.C. Circuit never examined the procedure under the DTA, did it?",
  "So shouldn't we, if we agree with you, that there is authority in the D.C. Circuit, send it back to them to make that determination whether habeas being required, this is an adequate substitute.",
  "But your basic position has to rest on Guantanamo Bay being just like if we had the detainees in, say, the Everglades. But do you concede that if these people had never been brought to the United States, if the facility were in, say, Germany, that these detainees would have no access to habeas, no access to our courts?",
  "I thought this was decided in Rasul. That's why I am so puzzled by the Government's position. I think Justice Kennedy said it most clearly when he said that, well, in every practical respect, Guantanamo Bay is U.S. territory; and whatever Congress recently passed, they can't, as you pointed out, change the terms of the lease.",
  "General Clement, I remember in a prior hearing about Guantanamo that the Government was taking the position firmly that these detainees were not prisoners of war and, therefore, were not entitled to the protection of the Geneva conventions. So if the Government is maintaining that position, these people are not prisoners of war, then the treatment of a prisoner of war is not relevant.",
  "General --",
  "I think, to go back to the beginning, my notion of your position was you never get to that question: Is the review of these procedures adequate in the D.C. Circuit, because there is no authority, period, for the D.C. Circuit to engage -- to grant what is before us is if the -- our applications for a writ of habeas corpus. You say that's out the door. They might bring some other proceedings. I thought that was your position.",
  "You're talking about taking the statute, Congress's statute that set up this system with limited review in the D.C. Circuit and saying that's it. The D.C. Circuit never got to that question because it said the acts that these people are trying to bring habeas doesn't exist. The only thing that they have, the only remedy they have is the one that Congress provided. And it seems to me the only question before us is whether there is jurisdiction in the court of appeals to decide that threshold issue. They tossed it out and didn't reach -- didn't say one word about the adequacy of the procedures or of the things that you're talking about.",
  "That would be -- we would be deciding that as a court of first view because they didn't decide that? You don't need an adequate substitute for habeas because you have no right to habeas.",
  "Can we consider that in your case, given that the application to reopen was made when there were only two days left to run for the termination of the voluntary departure time -- in other words, it was your delay, not the Government's, that made it impossible to decide this in the requisite time?",
  "Why isn't -- why isn't it fair to say: You have the short time frame by statute to leave the country if you've left in voluntary departure. Yet, the Government has provided reopening for all aliens. Okay. Why isn't it reasonable to say that, by asking for reopening when you've gotten permission to voluntarily depart within \"x\" days, you are relinquishing your voluntary departure status?",
  "Isn't that a perfect reconciliation of the two?",
  "But you raised the question, as I remember, when you put it in the cert petition. The Government advised against granting on that question and limiting it to the question of having it -- having it both ways, keeping your voluntary departure and moving to reopen.",
  "But it existed? You're not saying something that came up later? What was the ground that the, in this case, that wasn't brought up by the first counsel?",
  "Going back to the question that Justice Alito put to you, that he would then be, and you agree this is what you asked for first, like any other removable alien. And Justice Alito asked you: Well, then he could be removed immediately, is that not so? My understanding was, yes, that's so, but you can move for a stay of removal when you have a reopening pending. Is that true?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, why did the Government advise this Court not to grant cert on question number 1, which was: I want to apply to reopen and simultaneously, I want to withdraw my voluntary departure and be just like any other removable alien, take my chances just like anyone else? The Government said don't present that -- Court, don't consider that question. Why?",
  "And it seems that this litigant said, number one, I don't want to take advantage of the status of I have to get out, but I can do so voluntarily. The first thing I want to do is to move to reopen, withdraw my voluntary departure. And then the second thing was, if I can't do that, please extend my voluntary departure time while I move to reopen. It seems that this litigant is being put in a bind by not allowing this Court to consider what was the alien's first preference, that is, to withdraw the voluntary departure.",
  "Why isn't the solution to withdraw, relinquish the voluntary departure?",
  "With the provision that he can get a stay.",
  "But then because he would then be back -- if he stays here after the period is run, then he has relinquished the voluntary departure. He is like any removable - -",
  "But not to stay -- but he would not be hanging on to his voluntary departure. That's gone.",
  "Which you say -- you say that under the current regime, the voluntary departure application, granted, is irrevocable. That's - -",
  "The regulations don't say that. The regulations are just blank. It doesn't say and if you do this it's irrevocable.",
  "But the order didn't say he couldn't withdraw?",
  "But would you -- would the monitoring suffice? In other words, you started out by saying there is no way that it could be administered and assure 100 percent against risk, so it would be helpful if you clarified: Yes, there is a way of monitoring adequately and tell us what that would be, or no, there is no way.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, I think that your main argument in this case, I mean, there's - - barbituate only seems to have come up rather late in the day, as Justice Alito pointed out, but your main arguments seem to be that the controls were inadequate. So you were beginning to say what controls would be necessary to render this procedure constitutional, and one that you said -- trained personnel to monitor the flow.",
  "Yes.",
  "And what is - -",
  "Two questions: Who would the trained personnel be? And, the second question, what would be the measures that they would employ?",
  "Could you use those EMTs? Would they be qualified? Would the team that inserts the IV, would that team be qualified?",
  "And the government has told us they do.",
  "In the Federal response.",
  "Mr. Englert, I thought that there wasn't a serious question about who inserts the IV, that those are trained people, but the point that was highlighted was that the people who control the flow into the IV connection, that those people have no training, the ones that are called executioners, the ones who operate the, what is it, the syringe.",
  "But they also are not trained people. I think what seems puzzling to me is the State has made an effort to make sure that the people on the team that inserts the IV, that those are well-trained professional people, but then apparently they leave the room, so that once the IV is inserted there is no professional person that has any further part.",
  "It's still unclear why they should make such an effort to get trained personnel in the first instance and then even if they are in the next room, why isn't, why did they deliberately pick nonprofessional people to both administer the drugs and to check the inmate for consciousness.",
  "What are the reasons.",
  "But have you that expert team and it seems that they would be preferable to executioner who have no professional qualifications.",
  "I mean the people who administer the -- who place the IV lines.",
  "And the executioners are also not visible to the public?",
  "There was a finding that the second drug serves no therapeutic purpose.",
  "That's - -",
  "Mr. Garre would you explain to me I can't the Federal Government has picked five grams instead of flee.",
  "Mr. Newton, you're not claiming in this case that the defendant was any way disadvantaged by the magistrate judge conducting the voir dire, are you?",
  "But there was no objection to any of the proceedings by the magistrate judge. There were no objections to any -- well, she didn't do the questioning. She allowed the lawyer to do the questioning.",
  "But there's a big difference between having a judge trial and a jury of one's peers. The difference between having a magistrate judge and an Article III judge to do the voir dire doesn't have -- is not a question of the same dimension.",
  "Well, we're not talking about a trial. We're talking about the voir dire. And perhaps you could tell me one piece of information. In the Federal proceedings that I've observed, it's always the judge who does the questioning, and this one seemed to me extraordinary. The magistrate said it was her practice to let the lawyers do it, right?",
  "You were referring a while back to the Gomez case. And if I remember that case correctly, it was the defense counsel who made the objection to the magistrate; and there's nothing to indicate whether the defense counsel had done that in consultation with the defendant. We don't have any idea what the defendant's wishes were, but it was the defendant -- it was the lawyer who raised the objection.",
  "It was the lawyer's choice, and we have no indication that it wasn't -- it was anything other than the strategic choice of the lawyer. And your position is that it must come from the client, and there's no indication that it did in the Gomez case.",
  "Ms. Blatt, if you, if the Government prevails, what happens to the 11th Circuit's ruling in the -- what was it, the Maragh - -",
  "-- case where the 11th th Circuit said, we're not going to mess with any constitutional question, but under our supervisory power, we're going to tell the district -- the magistrate judges, district judges in this circuit; it's a simple thing to do, put on the record that the defendant himself consented. That would be -- that would no longer be valid, right?",
  "They specifically said, we're doing this under our supervisory powers, not under the Constitution. So my question was could a circuit still say, we think it's better for the defendant himself to be told, so in our circuit that's going to be the rule?",
  "Well, perhaps because - - because the Government might very well be on the other side of that question, that is the dominant shareholder takes money from the corporation, gives it to his girlfriend, and the Government is saying that corporation had earnings and profits, we want to tax this as a dividend to you.",
  "Yes.",
  "But you did say something about the interception that -- your argument is that this corporation had no earnings and profits, so what the shareholder got was a return of capital. But part of what was involved was he was taking, I thought, receipts for goods that customers were -- had paid and giving them to the girlfriend. In determining whether that corporation had any earnings and profits, wouldn't you have to credit the corporation? In other words, did you prove that there was no -- that there were no earnings and profits? You would have to prove that, wouldn't you?",
  "What about the -- the Government did say that this accountant -- what was his name, Monango, or something like that?",
  "Testified at the trial that there was no return of capital in the relevant year.",
  "But if it turned out that there were earnings and profits and everything else was the same, would the Government be taking the position that the proper test is: Was this a distribution with respect to stock?",
  "Suppose the government - - the corporation is rich with earnings and profits. Would the Government be saying: Oh, aha. So we have to go through the motions of first seeing was this a distribution with respect to stock? I thought that the idea of was it \"a distribution with respect to stock\" refers to was it - - was the corporation -- was there to be any quid pro quo? That is, the shareholder gets money from the corporation. Is the shareholder expected to pay it back, or is it just that it comes out of the corporation into the shareholder's pocket with no expectation by the corporation to get it back? I thought that that's what \"with respect to stock\" means instead of \"with respect to salary,\" \"with respect to a loan.\" That's what I thought was the understanding of the term. Am I wrong about it?",
  "Was there anything in the tax court at all that used the words as having any significance for this determination whether there was a tax evasion here with respect to this stock? Was there any -- any hint that those -- those words were controlling?",
  "In the tax court originally. Was this a -- this was in the tax court?",
  "This is a criminal case.",
  "Okay. In the trial court first.",
  "Tell me about the civil case? There would be a tax deficiency, and wouldn't the Government have to say what were the elements of the tax deficiency? You said in a criminal case they don't have to characterize it at all. You just say he got -- he has money on which tax hasn't been paid, and there was a likely source of income. But now you're in a deficiency mode, and the Government asserts a deficiency. Doesn't it have to say what the elements of the deficiency are? And what would it say in this case?",
  "Well, let's take this case. Let's take this case and not some hypothetical, and where -- on the civil side -- the Government is asserting a deficiency. Just change one thing. The corporation is rich with earnings and profits. What would the notice of deficiency say?",
  "Wouldn't the Government want to take the position that this is a dividend and not something else, if that were the case?",
  "If there were earnings and profits.",
  "Do you recognize that he would have the burden? If he said this corporation had no earnings and profits so what I got was a return of capital, it would be his burden to show that?",
  "Coming forward, he had the burden of coming forward?",
  "I think the Congress recognized that what they were protecting was not age as such, but old age, where in the other case they say it's the racial criterion and whether it's -- or the sex criterion, whether it's a man that's adversely affected or a woman it doesn't make any difference; Title VII applies to them both. But the Age Discrimination Act doesn't apply to younger workers. It doesn't say that you can't discriminate on the basis of age, so you can't prefer the older person over the younger person.",
  "There is one little piece of it that seems, that clearly does favor the younger retiree. And that's the -- what is it -- you're guaranteed, what was it, at least 25 percent of your final monthly salary. That's not under -- for a regular retiree; and also this 10 percent that you get added on for each child -- that's not part -- that's somebody who is disabled gets that, but not somebody who is already a retiree. Isn't that so?",
  "I'm not sure that I follow that answer.",
  "But let's take the one who gets over the five-year initial period. The disability pay when you no longer can be in the hazardous occupation, it will begin immediately, right? You don't wait until you get -- you're 55 to get it.",
  "And with respect to that, Mr. Stewart, the problem that Justice Breyer brought up, you -- if you would look to your brief, page 30, footnote 13, the question is, so we have this -- if we take your interpretation of the statute, how can we deal with a person in her 30s who becomes disabled when she is making a low salary and has only, say, 10 years of service? She is going to get a very low disability. And you say that's one thing that's all right. On a prospective basis, what could Kentucky do? One is give the younger workers only their actual years of service, which Mr. Klausner said is what is happening, and therefore, these people are getting a lot less than they used to get. And then you say, oh, but there's another way, and that is to impute additional years of service on an age-neutral basis. And you're not specific about what would the age-neutral basis be.",
  "Mr. Stewart, before you finish, that little piece that seems to be favoring the younger worker that you guaranteed at least -- what was it, 25 percent of your final monthly salary, and you get 10 percent for each child -- now that does seem to be something that's -- that's not available for a regular retiree.",
  "Mr. Smith - -",
  "-- suppose at the time of registration there was a photograph taken right in the registration place and on the spot they gave you an ID with that photo, and everybody who registers would get one and there isn't any question of paying money to get a birth certificate. Would that be satisfactory? Ir that -- if you could make a photographic ID universally available, you would still have the problem of the religious objectors, but wouldn't everybody else be covered?",
  "And you could, you could do it twice. You could make the two trips, one to your local place and one to the distant place.",
  "As I understand, they were going to have some years in between when their proposal was enacted, and they were going to have a mobile unit going around to all the neighborhoods, lots of advertising, because a premise of that Carter-Baker report was that everybody would easily and costlessly get this photo ID.",
  "That is not the case that you are confronting.",
  "I mean, the reason they are bringing a facial challenge is because the horse is going to be out of the barn. They will have the election, and just what they are afraid of could happen, that the result will be skewed in favor of the opposite party, because there are people who have not been able to vote. So, if you're going to talk about what is the impact of this, they are in this bind after the election -- well -- they've always -- already lost that one. Now, there is something in the briefs that happened after this case was instituted, but we know from Marion County that there were 34 people who were not able to have a vote counted. And of those 34, only two ended up qualifying after the fact. So, we know that in that one particular county, most of the people who were unable to satisfy the requirement initially ended up not satisfying it. Is that -- I mean that's not hypothetical. That's real. But it does give you some confirmation that it isn't mere speculation that there are going to be many people who will not -- whose vote will not count.",
  "It's the same board that said in all our experience, in all of our memory, there has never been an impersonator.",
  "How does Indiana stack up against other States in the inflation of the voter rolls?",
  "And you are under a consent decree to do something about that?",
  "One aspect of your system -- I know your time is about to expire -- but it seems to me that every indigent person in -- who doesn't have a photo ID is put to a burden that the mass of voters are not put to -- that is either the two-step process and not going to my local precinct, but having to go to the county courthouse. That burden is on every indigent person who doesn't have a photo ID, so we are not speculating about numbers. That would be true for every indigent person who doesn't have photo ID, right?",
  "Well, they can go home and get the identification and go back to their precinct; that's what the indigent can't do.",
  "Before you do that, General Clement, I'd like to you to concentrate on the one group of people where I think you can make a facial challenge and may not all speculating, and that's the indigent people who can't get -- don't have the photo ID. They don't drive, and they can't get up the money to get the birth certificate or whatever else. They do have a burden that, it seems to me, the State could easily eliminate if they want those people to vote, and that is to say okay, do the affidavit, the whole thing in your local precinct; we'll make it easy for you and not send you away, send you off to the county courthouse to get it validated. Why -- why, if you really wanted people to vote, wouldn't you do it that way?",
  "But I'm - -",
  "Just on -- just on that one class of people.",
  "And that's not going to change after the election. I mean here is a group of people who are being put to a burden of going someplace else. And my only question is, why couldn't the system make it easy for them if we really want to help America to vote, all Americans, and say we'll do it in the local precinct, somebody will be there to help you fill out the affidavit, instead of doing it in a way that's really going to discourage people from voting?",
  "Well, I'm not concentrating - -",
  "I was trying to deal with this one category of person, and the State -- it was addressed, and the State said, well, we can't do it that way because that will lead to congestion at the polling place. But it seems to me that that is powerfully hard to reconcile with the claim that there are so few of these people it's not really a problem. If there are so few of them, then I don't understand why they should be put to the burden of going someplace other than the polling place.",
  "If this officer had complied with the State law, that is he had issued a summons, then you agree that the exclusionary rule would apply if he went ahead and searched.",
  "So would you explain the logic to saying that when the police violate State law, then the evidence can come in; but when they comply with State law, it can't.",
  "Would you agree that there was no probable cause to arrest, given the State statute?",
  "You're talking about probable cause to believe that he committed an offense.",
  "But was there probable cause to arrest?",
  "Could he -- could this officer have gotten a warrant to arrest Moore? Could he -- is it -- oh, there's an offense going on under Virginia law, I'm going to check with -- call in to see if I can get a warrant. Could he have gotten a warrant?",
  "How could he -- how could he have gotten a warrant to arrest when it's a nonarrestable offense?",
  "He couldn't -- would a judge have told this police officer -- they have a call-in procedure, call the judge. You want to -- you need to issue a warrant to arrest him for driving with a suspended license, but that's not an arrestable offense.",
  "Did these officers think this -- those circumstances exist?",
  "If you're right, Mr. Dreeben, then the Court gave a false signal when it GVR'd in Lovelace, in the Lovelace case, the person who was drinking in public, it GVR'd in light of Knowles.",
  "There could not have been a warrant -- a grant-- a judge could not have given a warrant for arrest on these charges.",
  "How often and under what circumstances is that Virginia -- Virginia law rule? I mean, when does a general district court give permission for a custodial arrest in a certain class of cases?",
  "Any crime at all?",
  "Any crime at all; jaywalking, for example?",
  "Mr. McCullough, there is one thing that I was curious about. It is this Virginia law that allows the custodial arrest pursuant to an order of a general district court.",
  "When is that used?",
  "What would be the basis of a -- can a district court enter such an order just because it thinks it's a good idea? Are there any grounds in - -",
  "Well, you may have a right to go to arbitration under this context, to proceed at once to arbitration. But could you stop a parallel proceeding from going on before the Labor Commission? In other words, your adversary says under the arbitration contract I'm stuck, I have to arbitrate at once, but I can go to the Labor Commission; there's nothing in the Federal Arbitration Act that says I can't do that.",
  "Could the arbitrator decide, I know I'm not required to do this but the Labor Commissioner is the expert and I'd rather wait until the Labor Commissioner acted before I proceed with the arbitration?",
  "Take out the exception. The arbitrator just thinks that it would be good to have the advice of the Labor Commissioner because the arbitrator is not so familiar with these talent agency arrangements.",
  "I thought Buckeye was - - was such a case, going to court despite the arbitration agreement.",
  "Volt involves a third party who is not party to the arbitration agreement. You have a party who is bound nonetheless invoking the Labor Commission to avoid going immediately to arbitration. Volt is very clear. It involves a third party, litigation involving a third party who is not bound by the arbitration agreement. Here you have only two parties. They are both bound by the arbitration agreement. I don't see how you can invoke Volt.",
  "Litigation involving a person who couldn't be brought into the arbitration.",
  "It makes sense to say that piece of it involving a party who can't be before the arbitrator should be -- should be -- go first. But here you don't have anybody who isn't bound to go before the arbitrator. You have no third party.",
  "You said something about that in your brief, and I think that you got it wrong. You said something about -- that the outcome of the litigation can have preclusive effect in the arbitration. But that would be so only if the result favored the non-party to the litigation, because the non-party to the litigation cannot be bound by a judgment that would adversely affect that party's interest. That party wasn't in the proceeding. It isn't bound by it. The parties to the litigation are bound by it, not the non-parties to the litigation.",
  "A de novo right in Superior Court?",
  "Mr. Brunstad, I'm looking at the point in which you said this in your brief. You said you go to the labor commission, and then you go to the Superior Court. This is page 13 of your brief. The court is required to grant a motion compelling arbitration if the parties have executed a valid and applicable arbitration agreement. Well, who determines if the parties have executed a valid and applicable arbitration agreement?",
  "Well, we know -- this is not a mystery in this contract. It says it in the contract, and it says it under the AAA rules. But you phrased this in your brief in a way that says, well, if the parties have executed a valid and applicable arbitration agreement, that's what the superior court is going to decide. So it won't grant a motion to compel unless it determines that the parties have executed the valid and applicable arbitration agreement.",
  "Related litigation with someone other than the parties that you bound yourself to arbitrate with. That involved Stanford and two companies, Stanford suing two companies or -- in litigation with two companies with whom it had no arbitration agreement.",
  "In that light, on page 43, you say in this case, it is undisputed that Preston was an unlicensed talent agent and that the contract he drafted did not meet the requirements of Section 1700. I thought it is very much disputed whether he was a talent agent at all. I thought the position was -- that your opponent is taking is that he was not a talent agent, that he didn't come under the statute.",
  "But that's not what you said here. You say it is undisputed that Preston was an unlicensed talent agent. That's your statement.",
  "What I just read you, this one, you said it isn't. You say it is undisputed that Preston was an unlicensed talent agent. And you just admitted that that is disputed.",
  "But that's not what you represented.",
  "But this is not a proceeding brought by the administrative agency.",
  "An agency like the EEOC Waffle House.",
  "This is somebody who's bound by arbitration invoking whatever authority the Labor Commissioner has, quite different from the Labor Commissioner commencing a proceeding.",
  "Well, in one way -- in one way it is, in that like those other crimes it presents a serious risk of potential injury to another. That's what they all have in common. It's a residual - - one argument that was made was when the statute was first drafted all it had was the residual, \"presents a serious risk of potential injury to another.\" So that's, the argument is, that's what drives this statute, and then these, these specific crimes, were added just to be sure they would be covered.",
  "How about a habitual speeder?",
  "One of the anomalies about this, and we start out -- this is an armed career criminal. And you can say, well, burglary -- burglary and arson, if you're apprehended, you're the career criminal; you commit these kinds of crimes. Congress doesn't want you to have a gun, or if you do, you're going to get the book thrown at you. But there doesn't seem to be much of a connection. I mean how -- how is it going to make the dangerous -- the drunk driver more or less dangerous if he happens to have a gun in the glove compartment?",
  "What else -- what else would be in this catalogue? You rejected my speeder, but I think you said something about a reckless driver might, habitually reckless driver. What else would fit the description \"conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\"?",
  "I'd like to know specifically. You said reckless driving; and what else?",
  "That has the potential of doing that, not - -",
  "But wouldn't that come in in the first, the violent crime, the first part?",
  "May I ask about something in your brief on page 37? You said: \"Congress settled on this language because it had two other proposals, one that it considered too narrow and one that it considered as potentially too broad.\" And the one that it considered potentially too broad is \"any felony that by its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against a person or property of another may be used in the course of committing an offense is the\" - - this is on page 37 of your brief.",
  "I thought you said that you -- you look at the generality of cases. In most extortion cases what they want is money.",
  "Does it matter what was the sentence actually imposed in the State court? That is, suppose it is a second offense, but the prosecutor chooses not to charge as a second offender and so, although it is in fact the second offense, he is sentenced in the State court as a first offender. Would it count under your reading of the Federal statute that it was a second offense?",
  "Do all States treat first convictions from other States -- do they all count for recidivism qualification if the prior offense was committed and the conviction was in another State?",
  "But it did use the language \"a maximum term,\" not \"the maximum term,\" which would support the government's view that the statute contemplates more than one maximum.",
  "What about the defendant's own understanding? In connection with one of these offenses the defendant acknowledged in court, the crime with which I am charged carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",
  "You are saying to me, Ms. Brinkmann -- we talk about an asset, an investment. This was one company. This -- it's strange to talk about unitary basis or investment. This is a division of one company. And we are talking about a sale of assets. Not the sale of stock of a subsidiary. So what more is there than this is one company, it sells some of its assets?",
  "Do we have any cases - - do we have any decisions that go against the state taxing authority that involve divisions as opposed to subsidiaries?",
  "What is -- what does the domicile State -- we have Ohio. But you say as a matter of constitutional law, not State tax policy, as a matter of constitutional law, the only State that has authority to tax the capital gain is Ohio?",
  "Does Ohio -- would Ohio give credit for the tax that its sister State thinks is due? What is, in fact, Ohio's tax law in this respect? Does Ohio give credit to taxes paid by other States - - to other States?",
  "Can I have an answer to a very simple question? If Illinois claimed the tax, would Ohio give credit for the tax paid in Illinois?",
  "Do we know what -- what Ohio does in these situations?",
  "Why isn't the answer both? Why isn't the answer both, just as here it is both a paper or office supply company and a Lexis/Nexis, electronic data company?",
  "They're raising it in - - in support of the judgment. So if it's novel, but it supports the judgment, then at least shouldn't the Illinois courts have a chance to look at it and say, oh, that's what we really meant, we just got -- explained it the wrong way?",
  "It was a sale of stock in that case, wasn't it?",
  "It was the sale of a subsidiary. And here we have a sale of assets of one company, and that's why it's so hard for me to see this, as, why are we talking about unitary or not? There is only one company; it's Mead.",
  "You told me that there was no case that the tax -- taxing authority lost that involved divisions of a single company and sale of assets, rather than the sale of stock.",
  "Well, we're talking about what Due Process permits States to do, and you're asking us to declare a restriction that, as far as I know, has never been declared in any case.",
  "It's not just that it's an investment, it's not just that it's holding on to the shares in another company. It's both of these are ongoing businesses, Lexis/Nexis and Mead, and they are both generating income, and all along Illinois has been taxing the income of both of them, right?",
  "Weren't those foreign corporations?",
  "So running them as -- as a single company would have been a little harder.",
  "Yes, there is, Ms. Brinkmann. The Illinois appellate court never got to that question. Illinois argued all along this is a unitary business. The only one who said it wasn't was this trial court, and the Illinois intermediate appellate court says, well, we don't have to deal with that because if you use the other label, operational function, that comes out all right, too. But this argument was certainly the number one argument that Illinois was making. It lost only in the trial court on -- on it. And the appellate court said we don't have to get to it. So I think your answer to Justice Souter really wasn't accurate because it isn't - -",
  "All we know is that a trial judge said that was so.",
  "Maybe when we're talking about Due Process and Commerce Clause limitations on what States can tax, we ought to ask ourselves if those three -- is that it? If we're trying to measure, is there a sufficient relationship between Lexis/Nexis, Mead, and the State of Illinois to make it fair for them to tax? And you say, oh, yes. Each year when they're making income, when they are a going concern, Illinois can get a piece of it. But when the assets are sold, assets that would have generated income for Illinois year after year, but when those assets are sold, Illinois can get nothing to represent -- to substitute for that stream of income that it would have gotten.",
  "But Lexis/Nexis is gone.",
  "Suppose it had been Delaware, and there was nothing there in Delaware except it was a Delaware corporation.",
  "Do you know what -- or did you know what Ohio did in the - -",
  "Well, what would you say -- I mean, we talk about apportioning income and allocating income, allocating to the commercial headquarters. What in an enterprise like this would you say is allocated to the commercial headquarters as opposed to being apportioned among all the States?",
  "And -- and I'm not following your argument, because I thought that the argument that this was a unitary enterprise was made in the Illinois appellate court, and the appellate court recognizes that it was made, and said we are not going to reach it because we have this operational-function test?",
  "Was there any sort of stipulation between the parties to say what each, what Lexis/Nexis was doing in Illinois, what Mead was doing in Illinois?",
  "Let me ask you about the theory that both the trial court and the intermediate appellate court went on, this operational function test, which has been brought up in a few of our cases, but I don't know any that was decided. Did we ever have any case that turned on the operational function test to hold for the State taxing authority?",
  "Yes. But one of the problems with applying it as you urge here is that that would just override -- why would anyone go to the trouble of making a case under the so-called unitary business test, because the operational function test would be much easier to meet? So - -",
  "So say you -- but you would be asking us, if you were going to go on that operational function, to take two examples that were given in Allied-Signal that are quite different from what's involved here, and to make that a doctrine when you recognize that we have never used that theory to hold for a State taxing authority in the context of a multi-state enterprise?",
  "If Illinois -- if Ohio is, in fact, taxing the whole gain at its full rate on the theory that this entire income should be allocated to Ohio, then you do have an element of double taxation, right?",
  "There was no \"it\" to tax, right?",
  "At the time of this sale of Lexis/Nexis assets, there was only one taxpayer; it was Mead.",
  "Ohio.",
  "May I give you a specific example? I think the Chief has something on this order in mind. Could the patentee say to the licensee, to the Intel, that, I license you to sell only to buyers who have a license from the patentee? Could -- could the licensee be limited in that way?",
  "But explain to me - - perhaps I should ask Mr. Phillips this question -- but why isn't it done that way? The way -- if the patentee wants to maintain control further down the line, why doesn't the patentee just limit the licensee to selling to people who are licensed?",
  "Mr. Hungar, is there a reason why Congress codified this doctrine in the Copyright Act, but not in the Patent Act?",
  "And the PTO didn't take any position on whether it should be codified?",
  "Why? This Court hasn't so held. We haven't had that issue before us.",
  "Did the government - - well, we'll ask the government, but I thought they kind of qualified that in their brief. The brief says that the case -- this case presents no occasion to consider whether Title VII's ban on discrimination against Federal sector employees incorporates that Act's private sector retaliation ban. So they haven't made a concession.",
  "She could complain; it's just that she couldn't go very far with the complaint.",
  "Why is that so clear, because section 2000e, 16(d) says section, whatever it is, f through k of this title, as applicable, shall govern civil actions brought hereunder. And if there is no right against retaliation, then the remedy wouldn't be applicable.",
  "It isn't that simple because the government hasn't conceded that, with respect to Title VII, Federal employees are covered for retaliation. If the Government -- we'll ask them - - will make that concession, then the argument is very strong. The words are identical.",
  "Why not, given the Jackson precedent, where there was a similarly general ban on discrimination and we defined discrimination to include retaliation for complaining about discrimination?",
  "But that's -- Mr. Garre, that's traditionally when you're suing the government, you don't get a jury. And so that's on one side. Here, as I think you would recognize, retaliation claims go hand in hand with discrimination claims. A person who is discriminated against will quite commonly say: I was not promoted because that was discrimination and then because I complained about it all these bad things happened to me. It's very common that those two go together. And yet, without any indication that Congress meant to send a Federal employee off to one forum to argue discrimination and another forum to argue retaliation, without any hint that that's what Congress had in mind, it would be rather strange.",
  "But you -- I recognize it's not absurd. But if there is ambiguity and one interpretation is, well, that in every other context retaliation goes together with discrimination, why would Congress leave out this one category of persons, especially when it might have said, well, the Supreme Court says discrimination includes retaliation?",
  "What is the government's position? What does, for example, EEOC or whoever passes on these complaints, what is the government's position in practice with respect to a Federal employee who complains, A, I was discriminated against because of my race and then they retaliated against me for complaining?",
  "Has any Federal court found otherwise?",
  "So you agree -- then you agree with Mr. Garre about the meaning of those words \"as applicable\"?",
  "Do we know what Congress had in mind when it said don't incorporate private sector?",
  "There must be an explanation for that section.",
  "What could she get - - what could she get by way of remedy? And you recognize that this employee is not covered by the Civil Service Act, but does have collective bargaining rights. Suppose there is a finding of reprisal in that forum.",
  "What about - - MR. GARRE -- is corrective -- is corrective action, Justice Ginsburg. There is no right -- unlike Title VII, there is no right to compensatory damages under the Age Act for things like pain and suffering or emotional distress; and so in that respect the Age Act is quite different. What you typically get -- you get this under the Civil Service Reform Act and under the Age Act for discrimination claims -- is back pay, front pay and corrective action to -- to address the discrimination. The other way in which the Age Act, section 663a, is different than Title VII -- and this is actually another thing that makes it inherently incompatible with an anti-retaliation right -- is that the prohibition in section 663a, the Federal sector provision of the Age Act, is limited to employees who fit within the protected class, employees over the age of 40.",
  "Isn't the typical retaliations claim, though, like the one in this case, whether it's under Title VII or the Age Discrimination Act? That is, I think I have a solid claim of discrimination, but maybe not. Nevertheless, once I filed that complaint, this unit doesn't like people who complain about sex discrimination, age discrimination. Therefore, I was retaliated against. In this case, isn't it the fact that the age discrimination claim, the claim of direct discrimination, was rejected and the question is but nonetheless, was there a retaliation claim?",
  "Mr. Garre, I just want to make sure I understood something you said before, rather pleadingly. One is if one could imagine a claim just for reprisal, but you called something a \"mixed claim\" if you're suing, as she started out to sue, for both. So if you're suing for both, on your theory you still must split them up? You cannot bring the reprisal claim together with the discrimination claim?",
  "But there's a different administrative mechanism.",
  "Oh, oh, but how about court?",
  "But then you -- you would be putting everything under the civil service umbrella and nothing under the - -",
  "But if it didn't amount to an adverse action under the Civil Service Act - -",
  "And you wouldn't get to court.",
  "Yes, but it would not be within your control. It would not be up to the - -",
  "Wasn't there -- there was something that was said about this -- that doesn't apply to congressional employees or White House employees, that they would have a claim of retaliation.",
  "So why would Congress say when you -- when it's Congress that's doing the reprisal, we're going to give you a suit, but not if some other - -",
  "But FERC thought it could live with the Ninth Circuit's decision, because the government recommended that we deny cert in this case; isn't that so?",
  "But, Mr. Kneedler, this is a decision, the Ninth Circuit decision, that empowers FERC. FERC says: Oh, we don't have that authority. And the Ninth Circuit said: Yes, you do. So this is an agency arguing that it can't do what the Ninth Circuit says it can. And why can it not? Because of two decisions of this Court. Is that right?",
  "I thought -- let's go back a step. I thought FERC's position was: We could not decide as a matter of discretion to do this because we are limited by those Supreme Court decisions.",
  "So it's not what FERC - - FERC independently interpreting the statute to reach the conclusion, which it might, to reach the conclusion the Ninth Circuit did. It's FERC saying: We can't do that because we have our marching orders from the Supreme Court.",
  "Did the companies who were involved in this case make those reports? I mean, there was something about during this energy crisis there was rampant noncompliance with the filing, with the quarterly report filing.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, I do have one question. It was the position that FERC took in December of 2000, when it was encouraging the entrance into the long-term contracts rather than using the spot market, and in that order FERC said that it would monitor long-term contracts vigorously for rate reasonableness and that buyers could challenge rates through 206 proceedings. What happened to that position?",
  "And how did FERC monitor the rates vigorously to make sure they were reasonable?",
  "Well, those decisions are puzzling transposed to this setting, because in those decisions it was the seller who had made a bad bargain; the price was too low; and the seller wanted to get out, right?",
  "And now we are transposing that. And one of the main themes I think of Justice Harlan's decision was this Act was meant to protect the consumer, to make sure that the consumer wasn't going to be overcharged. And that runs through those two 1956 decisions, at a time when there was no market-based authority, or any such, right?",
  "That's the same order where they said we are going to monitor the rates for reasonableness.",
  "You said the Commission is on the job, but one of the pieces of information here is that the Commission staff said that the dysfunction in the spot market carried over into the forward market, such that prices in the forward market were inflated.",
  "Mr. Dellinger, wasn't the staff saying something more than that in that -- in that report?",
  "But the Commission didn't -- didn't respond to the staff report, right? Didn't say anything one way or another about it.",
  "Did they say it with respect to the staff report? Or -- I thought they thought the staff report was irrelevant?",
  "But how would you -- how would you go about determining in this case? You said it's not the traditional cost of service, return on investment. So how -- if you prevail, what should FERC do to determine whether this rate was fair and reasonable?",
  "\"EES-ter-brook.\"",
  "Are you saying that before the 1991 amendment retaliation was included?",
  "Why isn't that true here? Because we're not talking about retaliation in a vacuum; we're talking about retaliation for complaining about race discrimination.",
  "What kind of -- what kind of right to be free from discrimination would there be if once one complains one can be fired, demoted? That would not be a very effective right, would it be?",
  "But one can say the same thing for Title VII and, say, the Equal Pay Act. There are a lot of overlapping antidiscrimination laws. That doesn't mean that we shrink one because another exists.",
  "Well, that's -- that's often the case, isn't it? I mean, the argument you just made could go as well to somebody who uses 1981 to complain about a racially-based demotion wasn't able to use Title VII because he filed too late. That's a typical use of 1981; is it not?",
  "So what is the difference between this case -- you say, well, there's Title VII and this would erode Title VII. Doesn't it erode Title VII when I'm complaining about, say, a demotion?",
  "And you say - -",
  "Of course, it's just for race claims, and Title VII covers sex, national origin.",
  "My point is that 1981 would not be available to other categories. It's only race, right?",
  "But it's a statute that has the same derivation. They're both from the 1866 Civil Rights Act, and they're both set up the same way. 1982 also says \"same\" as 1981 does. So wouldn't it be odd to take these twin measures and say one includes retaliation and the other doesn't? Wouldn't Congress, when it revised 1981 in 1991 been aware of Sullivan and expect this Court to interpret those twin statutes the same way?",
  "Wouldn't you look at what Congress was trying to do in the 1991 amendments? That is, Congress changed the law that this Court had declared; and the message, the essential message, was this Court has been too stingy in its interpretation of Title -- of 1981, so we're going to change it.",
  "And it seems to me that we wouldn't be hearing -- we wouldn't be grasping that message.",
  "There is something to that effect in the legislative history that explains why Congress made the amendments it did in 1991.",
  "When were -- when there damages, as opposed to back pay, added as a remedy for Title VII?",
  "So it wasn't that it was cut back, as the Chief suggested.",
  "It's the first time ever Title VII plaintiffs were entitled to get money damages as distinguished from simply back pay?",
  "The interpretation was consistent with this -- was it 2005, long after those other new approach statutes, decisions were on the books. Jackson was in 2005.",
  "If he were a courier bringing the marijuana into the United States what would be the crime and the penalty?",
  "If he was bringing marijuana into the United States instead of returning with the proceeds?",
  "But now he possesses money. And you're not saying this is innocent behavior. It is criminal behavior, so what is the crime if not money laundering?",
  "But that requires knowing that it's illegal to take out more than X amount of money, and there's nothing that indicates that the common courier would know anything about such a provision.",
  "And it doesn't matter for purposes of the bulk cash statute that it was illegal. It could be perfectly lawful money.",
  "It sounds like he was making the distinction that didn't the dissenting judge make between -- the dissenting judge says transporting to conceal is no good, but concealing to transport is okay.",
  "Why isn't it simply to change the nature from being drug money to look like it's apparently innocent? I mean the change of the nature -- the nature going in is it's always dirty. It's drug money. And the purpose of the concealment is to get it converted to some different nature, i.e., clean money. Isn't that what \"disguise the nature\" means?",
  "And if he -- if he didn't know about the currency-reporting requirement, then he's not guilty under that statute because it requires knowledge.",
  "If he's not -- if he doesn't fit into either category, then there's no crime?",
  "Would you say the same thing for -- if you just put it in a safe deposit box in a bank in the Bahamas?",
  "Were they concerned that this was a 20-year penalty, not what you're talking about, the person who gets -- who is the drug dealer, but all that this evidence shows is that we have a courier. We don't even know if he knows who put the money in the car. We don't know if he knows the -- who the person is that he's to deliver the money to. So on your theory, all you have to prove is that this defendant drove a car in which illicit money was hidden in order to get it out of the country. No grand design. All he is is a courier.",
  "That's a -- that's a lot of fancy language. All he knows, in fact, if he's just a courier is that somebody gave him money to take this car in which drug money is hidden across the border.",
  "Not his design. His design is only -- I mean, he's just a drug courier, and I think that's what -- that's a problem with your interpretation of the statute. One can think of the kingpin having this elaborate plan, and when it gets to Mexico it's going to go into this bank and that place. But here the defendant is simply a courier, and on the government's theory anyone who transports hidden money to get it out of the country, who drives the car, just the driver, is a money launderer.",
  "Why do you make distinctions between methods of concealment? And if the design is to get the money out of the country, why should it matter whether you put it in a travel bag, you put it in the glove compartment, you put it in your wallet, or you go through this elaborate disguise that we see here? What -- if what's important is getting it beyond the border beyond the reach of law enforcement in the United States, why should it make a difference how carefully it is concealed?",
  "That's transporting to conceal.",
  "But you're saying this statute covers both?",
  "In your brief, you said the bulk cash statute would not apply to a courier. Do you still take that position, that the government's choice is to indict for money laundering or nothing?",
  "The point -- the point about aiding and abetting something, this money reeks of marijuana, and that was very puzzling to me. Why this is the standard operating procedure to take this money and wrap it in containers that had contained the drug. So when the police find it, they know it's drug money.",
  "Mr. Phillips, isn't - - isn't the standard -- in the standard tort claim, no Michigan statute, but a defense that's available to a drug manufacturer who is charged with putting on the market a defective drug, its regulatory compliance, right?",
  "And so the State of Michigan has said: Drug dealers -- I'm sorry -- drug sellers - -",
  "-- drug manufacturers, we are going to give you an invigorated defense. Instead of just saying you show regulatory compliance, we're going to take you off the hook altogether, except if you didn't come clean with the FDA, if you withheld information or misrepresented information. It seems to me that what -- you could say this is just like Buckman, but you could also say this is giving the manufacturer an invigorated regulatory compliance defense. So why shouldn't it be looked at as the second, rather than the first?",
  "If you're right in your argument, the Michigan statute provided two things: One good for the manufacturer, immunity; two, a qualification on it. It seems to me that those two can't be unstuck. So to strike out one, as was done in the Sixth Circuit case, and not the other is certainly not faithful to the Michigan legislature that put these two things together.",
  "Mr. Joseffer, let's assume that -- that you're right. The Second Circuit, because it thought your position it was wrong, never got to the severance question. It had been decided by some intermediate appellate court. But would it not be appropriate then to leave it to the Second Circuit on remand, if it chooses to use the Michigan certification process to say, well, we want to find out from the Michigan Supreme Court whether they think that the sweet stays, but the bitter goes?",
  "Wasn't -- in this case one of the charges was that the original FDA examiner had recommended against approval for this drug, and then something happened inside the FDA, and that examiner was taken off the matter, and another one who approved it was put on? Isn't that the kind of thing that the FDA would want to police itself and not have State courts look into?",
  "The question is: Would we be disrupting the FDA by taking depositions of examiners to find out what went on at the FDA?",
  "That's been contested, and we are going to hear that case next term.",
  "Right. But it's been - -",
  "-- at least since the 1930's, State tort litigation of the very kind that Justice Breyer has described has gone on. Isn't that so? That you -- even though the FDA has approved a drug, an injured party can say this was a defective drug, and the manufacturer says regulatory compliance. That's a defense. And you would say it's a defense, but not a conclusive defense.",
  "That's how -- that's how --",
  "Well, would you say that my characterization of it when Mr. Phillips was presenting his case, that this is an invigorated regulatory compliance defense, that it is more favorable, far more favorable, to the manufacturer than the standard regulatory compliance because it says that the manufacturer is immune, totally immune, unless - - and then the exception that we are debating here. But it is a deliberately pro-manufacturer measure. It gives the manufacturer an immunity that the regulatory compliance defense does not.",
  "Ms. Zieve, how many States have a statute like Michigan's?",
  "No other State does that?",
  "But was there any experience with this in Michigan? How many years was it in operation before the Sixth Circuit decision?",
  "Have there been many trials to test this theory that it would be disruptive, that - -",
  "The discussion in the Sixth Circuit was not very extensive on this point, on this - -",
  "I didn't think that the Second Circuit discussed severability, but I can go back and check.",
  "I thought that it had been raised there, but they didn't get to it because they - -",
  "In a very, very quick - - it isn't a very thoroughly reasoned discussion. It's a is very -- it's just one paragraph.",
  "I mean, because it is odd -- I mean, it is odd that you'd have a statute that says: Manufacturer, we're going to give you immunity, but there's an exception. They seem so tied together and it really would be a case of letting one side keep the sweet and get rid of the bitter. And it seems to me that there is -- that there was no discussion of that in the Sixth Circuit.",
  "But the question is whether the legislature would have passed the statute that it did if in a case like this one the manufacturer could have the immunity without the exception.",
  "It would be -- it would be open to the Second Circuit on remand because it's not foreclosed.",
  "The government told us in its brief that the FDA has no system for addressing public complaints -- this was in their brief at page 24 -- because that would divert attention from their primary mission. So there's no action for fraud that one can bring to the FDA.",
  "But The FDA doesn't have to do anything about it?",
  "What about the certificates of conformance with specifications of? I believe they were the Navy's specifications and Allison submitted to someone those certificates of conformance.",
  "Could the government have asked -- could the Navy have asked for them?",
  "No. In connection -- the Navy -- the engines are being supplied for Navy destroyers and the Navy obviously has an interest in making sure that the -- they measure up to the specifications. So my question is whether in this procedure for dealing with subcontractors there is any kind of audit where the Navy can say, we want to see the certificates of conformance for those engines or other documents relating to them.",
  "But if it's disguised, how would the -- how would the prime contractor know?",
  "But there wasn't any trial, was there?",
  "There was?",
  "Well, how could -- they would have at a minimum, even if your theory is not correct -- they would have to prove loss to the government. Otherwise they would have no claim.",
  "Well, the government certainly has that in its brief.",
  "Well, perhaps we should ask the government to explain what its position is. But one of the points that has been raised in opposition to your argument is that your interpretation would cut out claims that today are regarded as properly presented under the False Claims Act. And the one that was featured was false claims for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, because those are presented not to the government but to an intermediary.",
  "So the whole difference -- the whole difference, then, is if the - - the invoices are passed on, as opposed to the government having the right, if it so chooses, to inspect the books and records?",
  "The difference is if the government gets the invoices from the contractor, then there's a claim under the False Claims Act. But if, instead, the subcontractor is required to make its books and records available on request to the government, that's not enough?",
  "But it made -- I thought you said that it is this case that the government had the right - -",
  "-- to audit the - -",
  "Mr. Olson said on the Medicare that the providers, that the intermediary does present the - -",
  "Before -- before you finish, the major objection is the one that Justice Breyer just voiced, that your position is vastly overbroad and every time there's government money there will be -- one of these qui tam people can come in. What are the limiting principles that you say attach to this statute?",
  "Whose certificate is it? Is it the contractor's certificate that everything that the subs have done or the certificate of conformance that Allison provided, that SOFCO provided?",
  "But that was only the contract. You didn't show that in fact that had happened, that the certificates of conformance actually were shown to a naval officer?",
  "There has been a statement, in opposition to your position, that the way you read (a)(2) would render (a)(1) useless, That everything would fall within (a)(2). Is there a distinction between what comes under (a)(1) and (a)(2), in your view?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Dellinger, how was that rule settled? You go in that story and The Amiable Nancy, but no one even raised the question of punitive or exemplary damages in those cases. So what is the long-settled line of decisions of this Court in maritime law that you are relying on?",
  "That was on land on the railroad.",
  "You are talking about maritime law, and relying on The Amiable Nancy. And my only point is that was not raised, argued, or decided. So it's rather, I think, an exaggeration to call it a long line of settled decisions in maritime law.",
  "Well, the Lake Shore case, if I remember right, did not involve a managerial employee. It involved a conductor on a train.",
  "But I thought that you're talking about a different level. I think we ought to be clear on this. I thought it was conceded that Hazelwood was, indeed, a \"managerial agent\" as that term is used in the Restatement of Torts, right? So you are talking about it's not good enough that you are managerial agent; you have to be in a higher echelon in the company. That's your position?",
  "But there aren't many States that follow the Restatement position.",
  "Am I right, Mr. Dellinger, that in the railroad case the court was dealing with the concept of respondeat superior? It didn't make any distinction between regular employees and managerial employees, and, indeed, it was not dealing with a managerial employee.",
  "But I don't recall that they made anything about managerial. They were just talking about respondeat superior at large, I thought.",
  "Are you - -",
  "There was -- there was sufficient evidence of that. I mean - -",
  "The jury could have found that Exxon knew that this captain had a severe alcohol problem; and, yet, they let him stay on voyage after voyage and did nothing about it. So the jury could have found: Never mind the captain. Exxon, itself, is a grave wrongdoer because it allowed the tanker to be operated by a captain who was certainly not fit.",
  "It was a jury question. There was evidence both ways. So, on this issue, am I right in thinking that if you succeed, all you can get is a new trial?",
  "And, I take it, next time around the jury would get a special verdict and be asked: Was Exxon, itself, reckless in allowing this captain to stay on the ship?",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Dellinger, before we get into the merits of that issue, the Clean Water Act did not enter this case until 13 months after the jury verdict. And the trial court, who had very carefully managed this case -- and it was a humongous case -- would never list it as an issue in the case. And so he said: I won't hear it 13 months after the verdict. Why shouldn't we instruct the court of appeals that when a district judge does a diligent job like that one did to try to get at all the issues - - says you're too late; you can't come in 13 months after the verdict and argue a point of law that would have overtaken the verdict, because essentially you're asking for judgment as a matter of law on this issue.",
  "No. Well, what did you make -- you made a motion to bring up the Clean Water Act as dispositive on punitive damages, and you made that motion 13 months after the jury verdict.",
  "And what is the basis in the Federal rules for that motion?",
  "13 months after the verdict.",
  "But I -- that's not my question. My question is: Under what Federal rules did you move to bring up this issue 13 months after the verdict?",
  "49 is on special verdicts. What did this have to do with special verdicts?",
  "Rule 50 is pretty strict, isn't it? I mean, rule 50 -- if you want to use rule 50, you have to first move before the case goes to the jury. And if the judge says no, I'll reserve it. Then you move again after the jury. And if you don't, it's got very tight timelines. And you are arguing to a court that has held that these limitations in the Federal rules must be strictly observed. And I don't know of any time limit in the Federal rules that's stricter than the rules that involve 50(b).",
  "And you didn't appeal on that. You raised it properly, you lost on it, and you didn't appeal on TAPAA.",
  "Statutory. But the statute was TAPAA, and it was not the Clean Water Act.",
  "As you know, there were or at least some strong amici briefs in this case that have asked this Court, tell the court of appeals that's no way to operate vis-a-vis district courts.",
  "What about looking at what this Court said in TXO was proper in a punitive-damages case? That is, this spill was horrendous, but it could have been far worse. And so, under TXO, you look at what was the -- could be the maximum damage that could have been caused by this occurrence, and that could be many times - -",
  "But it wasn't - -",
  "-- a factor here. I mean, wasn't the example that the captain was trying to maneuver the ship after the disaster in such a way that would have made it much worse?",
  "There's some confusion, Mr. Fisher, about this Kolstad. I take your -- it has entered this case at two levels. One is this business about the company policy; but as far as Exxon having a policy, you don't mix alcohol with employment on a tanker; but Kolstad said it has to be a consistently enforced policy. So you don't have any problem with Kolstad on that issue, if you're using it here for a managerial - -",
  "There was a statute that was raised in the district court. And the district court raised this TAPA Act, and they thought that that was the statutory guide, and that was the reason why there should not be punitive damages, but -- so that was one of the things the court of appeals said under the head of waiver. They're substituting one federal statute for another.",
  "Mr. Fisher - -",
  "-- your time is running out. And this there's one question I'd like you to address, and that is are there other cases against Exxon seeking compensation and punitive damages based on this oil spill that are still awaiting trial or decision? Or is this it?",
  "So you don't have the problem of litigant A getting these punitive damages and than B, C and D all wanting to - -",
  "Just as a class, if you take them individually, each individual, did Mr. Fisher say 15,000 something?",
  "That's been pending how long?",
  "So it's from 2004 to 2008?",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, will you explain then how it was that the Philippine Government supported the litigation against Marcos that led to the, what was it, the $2 billion judgment?",
  "Said that it had no objection to that suit. In fact, he thought it was a good thing for the Philippines that that litigation go forward. But if the government's position is the judgment would be uncollectible because all of those assets belonged to the Philippine Government and not to Marcos's estate, so the -- that whole litigation would have been an exercise in futility.",
  "There's one other point of Philippine law that's unclear from the briefs. The Respondents say they have no right to intervene in the proceeding that's going on before the corruption court and your brief suggests that there is a right to intervene. What is it? Can they become part of that litigation or will they not be heard by the corruption court?",
  "Seek to intervene, but no right to intervene?",
  "In privity with the estate? You're suggesting that the plaintiffs would be connected to the Marcos family that wants to get these assets?",
  "When you say \"great weight,\" Mr. Kneedler, then you are not agreeing with Mr. Rothfeld, who says it's automatic?",
  "Doesn't that depend on there being a foreign judgment, which we don't have in this case?",
  "Isn't it also a requirement that in that proceeding in the foreign nation that all claimants would have an opportunity to be heard, which is not true here?",
  "Is there any explanation why the freeze that was imposed by a U.S. court in 1987 was simply allowed to lapse?",
  "I would like you to address -- you seem to put heavy weight on this in rem characterization. That is a judgment there's a thing. But our law over the years has come to appreciate that things do not have rights; people have rights in things. So we have modified the once rigid notion that the suit is against a thing, to recognize that it's people's rights in the thing that count. And your use of that label seems to forget about all the more recent understanding.",
  "Did -- did the district court in Hawaii or the Ninth Circuit ever decide what the Petitioners tell us is the basic question, that is do these assets belong to the Philippine Government under that 1955 statute, or do they belong to the Marcos estate? It seemed to me that our courts were just assuming that the assets belonged to the Marcos estate and that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit were creditors of the Marcos estate.",
  "But it didn't say, find, that: And they belong to the Marcos estate and not the Philippine Government.",
  "But isn't that what - - that's what sovereign immunity means. I mean, they do have the right to pick their forum. You say I can only be sued when I consent, so I can consent where I will. The problem with what you're presenting is it sounds like, yes, you have sovereign immunity, you don't have to be part of this lawsuit and it can't affect your rights, but then when it seems to be eventual judgment, it's a default judgment effectively against the Philippines, because they can never get those assets once they're disbursed. So, it's a -- it's kind of a deceptive immunity, because by asserting the immunity they are going to lose their opportunity to claim these assets.",
  "Not necessarily. I'm focusing on this situation. There could be others.",
  "I thought that the Ninth Circuit went on a statute of limitations in New York. It didn't give the sovereign immunity claim, it seems, in the end of the day any weight, because it says we don't have to worry about the Philippines being out of this case because they would have no claim on the merits.",
  "Where is that? Then why were they bothering with the statute of limitations? Both courts said that the action would be time barred in New York. But if they made a definitive ruling that the assets belonged to the Marcos estate and not the Philippine Government, then that would be preclusive.",
  "I just did not find in either the district court or the court of appeals an answer to that basic question: Whose assets are they? It seemed to me they were assuming the assets belonged to the estate and not to the Philippine Government, but they made no specific finding on that issue.",
  "But then you're ignoring a 1955 law that says anything that belongs to Marcos that he didn't get legitimately belongs to the government.",
  "Isn't that -- I mean it sounds shocking, but I thought that in the Philippines, as in many countries, the filing fee is determined by what you're asking for. So it would be a percentage of $2 billion. And if they just did that automatically, then you say, oh, but, but this -- the filing fee of that size would mean that the Plaintiffs can't sue. But that's -- but it wasn't they picked whatever figure, filing fee, out of a hat; it was a percentage of what was sought in the litigation right?",
  "Yes, they do because if they are able to successfully knock out the judgment, then they are back to square one. Then they -- they lost on the merits, but that judgment would be wiped out.",
  "If there was no authority of the court to proceed, then the judgment is -- is as though it were never made.",
  "If -- if the proceeding can't go forward because of sovereign immunity, that judgment would shield Merrill Lynch from any other claim. It could say to any other claimant: Sorry, a binding judgment has been issued saying this matter can't be settled without the Philippines being in it. So I don't really get your: Merrill Lynch is going to be subject to repeated proceedings. They will be armed with a judgment that says, suit can't go on without the Philippines being there.",
  "Ms. Spinelli, there's something confusing about your presentation of this, because you say that at this initial appearance that's called a magistration, you are not contending that there was a right to counsel at that very proceeding.",
  "So when, at what point in time, did this right to counsel attach? If it didn't attach during that magistration proceeding, when did it attach?",
  "But you are taking the position that there was a right to counsel that attached in this case. And I'm asking you at what point in time that right attached.",
  "But that was at the magistration, and you -- you have said that there was no right to counsel at the magistration.",
  "Any time prior -- any time prior to indictment?",
  "So you're saying that that is the critical stage that he needed to have counsel's advice about.",
  "What was filed by the police? What was filed by the police --",
  "-- to justify holding this person? You can't just say the police brought someone in and they get locked up in jail. The police had to present something --",
  "-- to show probable cause and it was the burden of the State in the presence of the police officer to prove probable cause. So that had to be based on something. What was it based on?",
  "And then -- and then the defendant was told or was given Miranda warnings. What was said to him precisely about right to counsel in the warnings that the magistrate gave him?",
  "Yes. But if he is told -- the defendant is listening to this. And, magistrate, you just told me I have a right to counsel. Okay, I would like counsel. And then the magistrate says, no you're not entitled to counsel?",
  "I thought you -- I thought you recognized that if he had opted to have this examining trial to determine whether there really was probable cause, that he would be entitled to counsel at that examining trial. And, yet, that's detached from the fair trial. The whole purpose of it is that they will never get to trial.",
  "Suppose that he is out on bail, but he has a suspicion that this alleged felony -- that that wasn't cricket because it was expunged. So he says to the judge: Judge, I want to contest my being held to some kind of criminal process because there is no basis for the charge. So he is out on bail. He has no lawyer, but he wants to contest the State's right to hold him at all, and he asks for a lawyer to help him do that.",
  "Is it then episodic? That is, if the right is turned on when there is a critical event, and then the critical event is over, and no more right to counsel until the next critical event? It's not -- you have no right to counsel in between those critical events?",
  "So you only need this one critical stage, and then you get appointed counsel at that stage, and that counsel will continue thereafter. You don't have to --",
  "Mr. Dellinger - -",
  "-- short of that, just to get your position clear, short of reactivating State militias, on your reading does the Second Amendment have any effect today as a restraint on legislation?",
  "But it doesn't, as far as I know.",
  "But wasn't there a leeway for some weapon prohibition? Let me ask you, in relation to the States that do have guarantees of the right to possess a weapon at home: Do some of those States say there are certain kinds of guns that you can't have, like machine guns?",
  "It's in interpretation.",
  "It doesn't means all. It doesn't mean -- \"keep,\" on your reading, at least if it's consistent with Miller, keep and bear some arms, but not all arms.",
  "If we're going back to the English Bill of Rights, it was always understood to be subject to the control and limitation and restriction of Parliament. And I don't think there's any doubt about that. And that's what we're talking about here, are legislative restrictions.",
  "Can I interrupt for a minute?",
  "There is a lot of talk about standards and stop words like strict scrutiny. Does it make a practical difference whether we take your standard or the strict scrutiny that was in the D.C. Circuit's opinion? And specifically there is a whole panoply of Federal laws restricting gun possession. Would any of them be jeopardized under your standard? And the same question with the District scrutiny, does it make any difference?",
  "Well, it did. It said it's just like the First Amendment. First Amendment has exceptions, but strict scrutiny applies. It says strict scrutiny applies here too.",
  "Is it a limitation? Is it any limitation on the legislature? Is the first clause any limitation on the legislature?",
  "If you were thinking of \"the people,\" what those words meant when the Second Amendment was adopted, it was males between the ages of what -- 17 and 45? People who were over 45 had no - - they didn't serve in the militia.",
  "For example?",
  "But why wouldn't the machine gun qualify? General Clement told us that's standard issue in the military.",
  "At this time -- I would just like to follow up on what you said, because if you were right that it was at that time, yes; but that's not what Miller says. It says that the gun in question there was not one that at this time -- this time, the time of the Miller decision -- has a reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia. So it's talking about this time.",
  "If it's a fundamental right, what about licensing? One piece -- we've talked about trigger locks, we've talked about the ban on handguns, but there is also a requirement that there be a license for possession of a handgun. Assuming you're right on the first question, that you couldn't flatly ban handguns, what about a requirement that you obtain a license to carry -- to have a handgun?",
  "What about this very law? If you take out the ban -- there is a law on the books. It's one of the ones that you challenged. It's section 22-4504(a). Wouldn't that be okay -- would that be okay? It says that you have to have a license to carry.",
  "It just says -- it says you have to get a license if you want to possess a gun. What kind of standard? It just says you have to have a license.",
  "Mr. Wolfman, what about the cap that's not present in 1988 and is present in EAJA?",
  "Mr. Wolfman, if there's any discretion in the district judge in setting the amount of the fee, then why wouldn't it be appropriate to say, now there's a cap for the lawyer is $125 an hour, but we know the true market rate for that lawyer is $200? Does it do the same thing with the paralegal? The true market rate is X, and we're going to knock it down so that it will match the knock-down for the lawyer?",
  "But isn't it likely that when Congress said that, it was not thinking of paralegals.",
  "What is cost? Could you -- one could say I'm going to look at the Internet and come up with $35 dollars an hour, or you could say in the case of a paralegal there is a part of the overhead, there is the fringe benefits -- so just giving the hourly rate is deceptive of what the actual cost is to the law firm, because the law firm has to add on to determine what in fact it's paying for the paralegal, the fringe benefits and part of the overhead.",
  "I know you said that a few times and you have authority for it, but it seems to me odd if you look at 1988 and if the attorney's fees and costs -- and costs is very limited in the statute in 1920 -- and if you have attorney's fees and other expenses, other expenses is a much larger category than costs within 1988. So I -- I would think that, well, EAJA is the more compensatory because it allows for more items.",
  "Am I right that when this language first came in -- this is in relation to Justice Breyer's question -- there was no cap? When did the - - when was the cap put on?",
  "It was.",
  "It would be a lot of weight to be put on three little words: \"Billed at cost.\" If you just read those words, you could be the costs to the client, the cost to the law firm and then you'd have to go to this further document, the Administrative Conference document, it's rather thin I think.",
  "I'd like to go back to a question that Justice Kennedy asked of Mr. Wolfman. Isn't there -- doesn't it make sense to take a word like \"attorney's fees\" and like the word \"discrimination,\" we have many different anti-discrimination statutes, but there has been an attempt to give that word \"discrimination\" the same meaning in all those statutes. And here the term attorney's fees, if it means that includes all of them, in terms of 1988, why not say every time attorney's fees comes up, that's what it's going to mean?",
  "Then why did Congress in several statutes have a provision from which California copied when it enacted this measure? In several statutes, the Congress has said this Federal money will go to the grantee, if the grantee says it will not use any money that we give them to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.",
  "But they run against that principle because they say at least under these programs -- I think there were more than three. Wasn't Medicare --",
  "Those -- those grantees would be subject to the NLRA. So, as to them, it is modified.",
  "I thought you -- you are bringing a facial challenge, and I thought that you must show, not that the State must show, and the State -- the simple argument is look we are paying for certain things, and we want to get what we paid for. There are a lot of other things that we could have paid for, but we -- we want to get, say, a training program for elementary schoolteachers. And that has nothing to do with union organizing. We don't want to pay for union organizing.",
  "Where did the lower court say it has nothing to do with the State getting what it is paying for and not paying for things it doesn't want to pay for?",
  "That in - -",
  "So it would come out - - it would come out differently if the statute has said, we want to get what we pay for and we don't -- we choose not to pay for labor relations?",
  "Did they say something different from what Congress said in those three or four statutes that were mentioned earlier?",
  "What policy was Congress implementing in the Federal funding statute that California copied?",
  "But they do say that the money is not to be spent to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.",
  "And why do they do that?",
  "But you don't -- there's no reason, rhyme or reason to what they would have done in these three statutes that you say is flatly contrary to national labor relations policy?",
  "May I ask you a question before going on with this line? You say that both the 802(13) definition has to be satisfied and the 44 definition, right? But was 802(13) ever applicable to this situation? What was the law prior to the 1994 amendment? There was a section, wasn't there, that defined \"felony drug offense\"?",
  "Right.",
  "Would you take a look at that provision that was in 841(b)(1)? Because it seems that it would be duplicative of 802(13).",
  "Yes.",
  "But read -- read the end of it. Read on where it says, \"or a felony under any law of a State or foreign country,\" et cetera.",
  "Well, what - -",
  "But it defines what the felony is: \"A felony under any law of a State or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana,\" et cetera.",
  "Why would you need to look - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Fisher, could I just go back to what you quoted. Are you quoting -- you're quoting a Sentencing Guideline, right?",
  "Not a statute.",
  "But, of course, they had to leave it on the books because they need a definition of \"felony.\" \"Felony\" has to be defined in many places, but this is a definition of \"felony drug offense.\" So --",
  "Just one. You said that in most States what Burgess did, his crime, simple possession, would not encounter a sentence of upward of one year. Did you do a survey? Did you document that in your brief?",
  "Well, I suppose it might for countries that use that classification, for common law countries.",
  "The -- the information we have in the brief says that there are two States that have dropped those labels. Are there more than New Jersey and Maine?",
  "It might help if you raise that lectern a bit.",
  "Yes, thank you.",
  "But why shouldn't it be a suit contesting the constitutionality? I mean, in the usual case where you seek a refund, there are adjustments that have to be made. But here, if the only question is the constitutionality of the tax, then what is the point of going through any kind of administrative process of the refund route?",
  "If 7422(a) had said any -- any Internal Revenue tax, including a tax imposed in alleged violation of the Export Clause, that would cut -- cut out the six-year statute of limitations, right? If it said the refund procedure applies to any Internal Revenue tax including one imposed in alleged violation of the Export Clause?",
  "Nothing different from what it is now, but just Congress makes clear that a tax and alleged violation of the Export Clause falls within the term \"any Internal Revenue tax\"?",
  "I thought you didn't have to pay - -",
  "Well, what about the deficiency procedure? And I don't know if that applies with excise taxes, but suppose they didn't pay this tax and they get a notice of deficiency. Where would they go?",
  "Why not?",
  "But you're saying it's both. You're not saying it's \"either/or\" because for three years you did use the refund procedure. So you used the refund procedure for the years that were within the three-year period, and then for the years that were outside the three-year period, you have this other theory. So you're not saying this is not for refund. That route is closed. The only route is this constitutional -- this claim directly under the Export Clause. But your own conduct seems to have been it's our option. We can treat it as a refund claim or we can treat it as a constitutional claim.",
  "In other words, what were you just telling us is that this is not a refund claim; this is a constitutional claim. But you are now saying, I think, that it's both; it's whatever the taxpayer or the plaintiff wants it to be.",
  "You're saying you get interest too in either way. You're saying -- I thought you said for the three years that are within the three-year refund limit, you get interest and then you're also saying, going back six years, you also get interest. You're not saying that if you -- if you're outside the refund procedure you don't get interest.",
  "2411 -- 2411 is what you use in the court when you have a straight tax refund claim. It's not as though 2411 is there for some other claim. It's what you get when you go to court and you're suing for a refund. That's 2411. That's applicable if you get a judgment for an overpayment in respect of any Internal Revenue tax. That's what - - it's in Title 28, but that's what it's for. It's for an overpayment in respect of any Internal Revenue tax.",
  "But -- the use of any Internal Revenue tax, and your whole argument is this isn't an Internal Revenue tax. So it's clearly not an Internal Revenue tax that you have a constitutional claim directly under the Constitution, so how does it become for purposes of 2411 an Internal Revenue tax?",
  "But you don't agree in your basic claim that if the government is treating it as an Internal Revenue tax, which it certainly didn't, you'd say that works only for the interest, not - -",
  "Mr. Jay, I hope in the 15 minutes, you will state what the government's position is on this Enochs case that's been mentioned at least a dozen times.",
  "And it was precleared at what point? The 1985 law was precleared before the litigation?",
  "And it was submitted by?",
  "Yes. And then the litigation came.",
  "And so your point is that if the circuit court -- there are only two levels of court in this, the circuit court and the supreme court?",
  "Mr. Newsom, before you finish I would like to ask you a question about what action Governor Riley would take if you're right on the law? That is, a mistake by the Alabama Circuit Court can't invalidate a law that the Supreme Court says on judicial review of -- on review of the circuit court, that the circuit court got it wrong. The first time around, when Jones was elected and then the Governor mooted any controversy by just appointing him. Now we have a similar situation. We have somebody who has won an election overwhelmingly against the person that the Governor appointed. There are, what, five months left in the term? If your position on the law is correct, would the Governor in fact oust the person who was a four-to-one 1 winner in a popular election and install the person who was a loser in -- would that happen? Could we project based on what happened the first time around that the Governor would not so thwart the will of the people?",
  "Then it was the district judge that made Alabama go to the preclearance after the second - -",
  "But still, if you take this case at its essence, a circuit court got Alabama law wrong and that's what you say counts as to make the law operative. The law becomes operative because an Alabama intermediate court or trial court made a wrong decision about Alabama law; and then when the supreme court corrects it, that doesn't count. That's essentially your position, that they're locked, Alabama is locked into a mistake that was made about Alabama law by that circuit court.",
  "It's a review of a lower court by a higher court. That's what higher courts do. They review for correctness, and the Alabama Supreme Court said the circuit court got it wrong. It misconstrued the law, and we are correcting that. And that's -- that's correct.",
  "The Federal court told the Alabama - -",
  "It told Alabama. I thought -- I thought that one of the reasons was adjudication wasn't complete when the district court made its first ruling, so the district court said, now, go off and get those two Alabama Supreme Court decisions precleared.",
  "What did they say?",
  "But the State's position was it shouldn't have to preclear a decision of the State's highest court - -",
  "-- saying that the State lower court got it wrong.",
  "That all depends on there having been a change. What there was was gubernatorial appointment. Then the legislature passes a law. Suppose that the circuit court had said, sorry, legislature, you got it wrong, general prevails, you can't do it this way, the law is invalid. Suppose the circuit court had said that. Then there would not have been an election, right.",
  "So there becomes -- there becomes a change only because the circuit court has made the mistake about what the State law is. That's very odd.",
  "There's another difference, too. There was a conviction and a sentence in Hirota, here in Omar's case he has not yet been as far as we know even investigated by the Iraqi courts, certainly no conviction; and in Munaf's case the conviction has been quashed.",
  "Mr. Garre, just to clarify one point. The -- at the time of the briefing, the U.N. resolution was due to expire in December of 2007. Has it been renewed.",
  "Mr. Garre, it is at least equally plausible, I think, because it's the only factor that Hirota mentions more than once, that the Court was going on its lack of power \"to review, to affirm, set aside, or annul the judgments and sentences imposed\" there. And here we have no judgment or sentence. So I don't think you can pick one of these strands, citizenship, and say, oh, that's it and it isn't the judgment and sentence. So I think we know your position. This is an opinion that says \"under the foregoing circumstances.\" I don't think you can take it much further than saying citizenship was one of those circumstances.",
  "There are - -",
  "There are in the U.S. custody a number of non-citizens. Is that -- how many people are being held in the custody of the Multinational Force that the United States controls?",
  "But the Court certainly listed it as a circumstance; and, as I said before, it's the only thing that's repeated in the opinion. But I think that we've come to a standoff on that.",
  "There's an important distinction, I think. At least in this case it has been alleged that if these people are released to Iraqi custody, there is a high risk that they will be subject to torture and other abuse. You know the brief that was filed on behalf of the NGOs where there is a quotation from Iraq's deputy justice minister: \"We cannot control the prisons. It's as simple as that. Our jails are infiltrated by the militias from top to bottom, from Gaza to Baghdad.\"",
  "This is a quotation from the deputy justice minister.",
  "Let me ask you about that, because if your basic point is that here is an officer of the United States that has someone in custody - -",
  "-- someone who is in jeopardy, among other things, of being tortured - -",
  "-- that United States official has to safeguard a citizen?",
  "But can throw a non-citizen into the lion's den? Is that the instruction that the United States gives to its officers, take care of our citizens, but the rest of the world, we don't care?",
  "But you're making this distinction now. Justice Kennedy asked you does -- does your case turn on citizenship, and you said citizenship is very important.",
  "There are thousands of noncitizens that are being held in the very same circumstance.",
  "Well, but in the cases - -",
  "But he -- he is still within the Iraqi criminal justice system. He wasn't - - his case wasn't dismissed. It was sent back for further investigation.",
  "So what's happening in his case is he's undergoing a criminal process in Iraq; and we are holding him during that process. So if you're not objecting to our holding him while the process is going on, what is -- what is he seeking through habeas? He -- he can't get out from under the Iraqi criminal justice system. He is alleged to have committed crimes within Iraq. We are holding him safe while that process is going on. So what is the basis of his petition?",
  "I don't get up to transfer. This man is now under investigation in the Iraqi system.",
  "Now, we -- transfer isn't an issue. What do you want done with him while he's subject to the criminal process in Iraq?",
  "One distinct difference in Munaf's case: He is undergoing a criminal process in Iraq, and Omar has also -- it is alleged that he has committed offenses in Iraq. Has no prosecution, no investigation been started with respect to Omar?",
  "I didn't see that in the junction, itself. It just -- the injunction was very spare.",
  "If one could go agree - - let's say one could agree that was overbroad. Does that mean that the whole injunction falls? Let's say, take two pieces out of it: No information sharing; that's beyond the pale. And you can't make an order that a foreign court shouldn't hear a case. Take those two out.",
  "But how about the rest of it?",
  "So we have a basic question: Is there habeas jurisdiction; and, as I understand the posture of this case, the Federal courts did not examine the merits of the habeas petition. They were just hung up on the bare jurisdictional question.",
  "General Mukasey, is there any indication why this prosecutor chose to hook the carrying an explosive onto a false-statement charge, instead of some charges with which it would have been more logically linked, like the one -- the first one, conspiracy to commit an act of terror -- terrorism?",
  "So it's a difference in two respects. One is 924(c) has the \"in relationship\" requirement, and it also has a shorter term. It's only -- in one it is five years, and the other is ten years. Is that right?",
  "And maybe they said -­ maybe because they're trying to draft legislation without using pronouns.",
  "Let me give you a concrete illustration that was brought up by the other side. If you have this coherent expression test, what happens to the person who has a bad speech impediment? Or someone who needs -- who isn't conversant in the English language? Are they -- automatically the right of self representation is automatically ruled out?",
  "Mr. Fisher, are you making essentially a \"we know it when we see it\" argument? Because you're not talking about some abstract notion of what would be an abuse of discretion, but you have in your brief -- you have at pages 15 and 16 -- some examples, concrete examples of this defendant. And you could say when it gets to that level, you don't have to wait to see how it's going to play out. If this is how this man speaks and thinks, how could a jury be exposed to it? It would be gibberish.",
  "I thought your argument is it's not a choice, that there is only one standard, either you're competent or you're not competent? That is, I thought your position is competency is a unitary notion and your opponent's position is, no, there are shades of competency.",
  "But this is a trial judge who has a very practical, immediate concern. And he's not looking at Dusky, not looking at Peretz. He says: I have found that Mr. Edwards is able to stand trial with the assistance of an attorney. I never made any finding that he was -- that he was competent if he didn't have that aid. I never found that he was competent to defend himself. He's competent, but only if he has a lawyer who is running the show. That was the finding that the trial judge made: That's my finding. Are you tell me to make that finding I have to say that he's not competent to stand trial?",
  "Well -- suppose the judge, the trial judge, says: Mr. Stancil, please turn to page 15 of the blue brief. I have had considerable communication with this defendant. Read what it says there. Do I have to wait for this to be repeated in the courtroom? \"Listen to this case, the foundations of my cause. The Criminal Rule 4. Court's territory, acknowledged May 29, 2001, abandoned for the young American citizen to bring a permissive intervention acting as the forces to predict my future disgrace by the court to motion young Americans to gather against crime.\" Now, that's not an isolated incident. This record is full of that kind of statement coming from this defendant.",
  "Well, take the rest of the paragraph.",
  "You have to stop. I mean, you have given a reason that this might make sense.",
  "But the judge says: Does that means I have to sit here and every time he makes a statement like that explain to the jury what he meant? Then I'm becoming involved myself in a -- in a consulting role, not as an impartial judge of this case anymore, but as a kind of a facilitator of the defendant.",
  "Mr. Stancil, you do agree that the basic precedent on which you rely, Faretta, you would be -- you are asking for an extension of it because that case starts out with a defendant who is described as literate, competent, understanding.",
  "And was there anything in the record showing that he had, that Faretta had, mental delusions, mental disease?",
  "But the judicial posture there was a little different. It was a question of what the State had to do, not what the State could do.",
  "There's another assumption then that was in Justice Breyer's question about, well, you have to have the petition, the bankruptcy petition. But in this very case wasn't the sale -- wasn't the basic arrangement made the day before the petition was filed?",
  "But are you not -- are you questioning -- what I understand to be the case, it's not at all uncommon for a Chapter 11 these days to have the 363(b) sale of property, then have some kind of global settlement, and then distribute all the assets, never have any kind of reorganization. And I didn't understand that it was necessary to kick the case over into Chapter 7. Aren't there many cases filed under Chapter 11 that end up with no reorganization?",
  "What I don't understand about the -- how the Florida system works, I thought you don't get -- you don't get the transfer recorded until you pay the tax. I thought that's what Florida law was.",
  "I thought, Mr. Brunstad, that the question was asked: So the State is not going to get its tax at the time of the asset transfer, because the cash is needed to eventually have a plan that works. So the State doesn't get its tax. And then it turns out that there is no plan; that the case is dismissed. What happens then? Florida has to get back -- at that point gets the tax that it wanted up front?",
  "They are all paid up front, but they are put into escrow. Is that what you are telling me?",
  "Mr. Brunstad, there's an aspect of the way this looks that I don't understand, and you're an expert in this area. Perhaps you can explain it to me. You have one of these 363(b) sales of property, and then you have a global settlement with the creditors. What function does the plan serve after you have all that? The assets have been sold. The creditors have made a settlement. There's going to be no reorganization; whatever there is, is going to be distributed. What is the function of having a plan after all that confirmed? I know one purpose of it is that you avoid paying the stamp tax. But is there any other purpose once you have already settled that the sale is made, the creditors agree on how it's going to be divided up? What is the function that the plan serves?",
  "Why shouldn't we look to see how it was in the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the Federal State tax exemption? That I think leaves no room for argument. This case might be argued either way about does it apply to preconfirmed plan asset transfers? But as I understand it, this section 4382(b) was limited to post-confirmation transfers, that is transfers made within five years after confirmation of the plan.",
  "Well, what was -- what did section -- I'm not talking about -- you mentioned 267. 42 -- 4382(b), what did that say?",
  "Section -- 26 U.S.C. 4382(b).",
  "Yes.",
  "That was in the 1954 Code. I'm not talking about 1898.",
  "I thought that said that the tax exemption was limited to transfers post-confirmation.",
  "Maybe you can straighten me out, because where I get this from is the brief for the State, and it's at page 17, mentions the now-repealed 4382(b).",
  "So what about a case, say, you've got organized crime wants to get rid of - - an organized crime enterprise wants to get rid of rivals, so it makes misrepresentations about those rivals to customers and suppliers, not to the -- to the rival. So there was no -- there is no misrepresentation made to the plaintiff but to the plaintiff's customers and suppliers. So on your theory, is there no RICO claim because the misrepresentation was made to someone other than the plaintiff?",
  "But no civil case in that -- in that situation?",
  "Well, why - -",
  "Why isn't it -- there is reliance on their allegations by the county. The county thinks that each bidder is putting in only one bid. So the county has been deceived, and the plaintiff suffers the effect of that deception. Why doesn't that qualify?",
  "Yes, but that's a different point, the point that you made in your reply brief, that maybe there isn't this rotational system, and maybe they can't prove that they were -- that they were injured; that they would have gotten a greater share. But your case is about -- it doesn't matter even if you -- you have to accept the allegations of their complaint as true, even if everything they say in the complaint is true, they have no claim. They have no RICO claim.",
  "So we have to assume what they say about the rotational system is right and -- but -- but you are hanging your hat on no misrepresentation was made to them.",
  "May I just go back to a statement you made? I thought you -- you conceded that on their allegations your client would be indictable for mail fraud?",
  "But those -- those weren't mailed, or at least that's not what you're relying on. You're not relying on the affidavits that make the misrepresentation using the mails. I thought your reliance on the mails is only the tail end of this transaction, the notices that get sent to the property owners.",
  "Mr. Becker says they were interference with a business relationship, not fraud.",
  "One concern, because RICO can be a very broad statute, is that if you are right, then any unsuccessful bidder could look through a rival's submission, find a false statement, and sue under RICO.",
  "Can you give any example of that? I mean, I found that rather surprising your brief. The Montana -- a clear case that Montana talks about is tax, the imposition of a tax. Well, if a jurisdiction has authority to tax, then surely it has authority to sue to collect that tax. So I am not aware of a case where a State or tribe or nation has authority to regulate, to legislate, but lacks authority to enforce that regulation. And if you have an example of that, I would appreciate being enlightened.",
  "What was the regulation that was authorized but unenforceable in the courts? I don't recall -- Montana -- Hicks having said anything on that subject.",
  "Who would consent to be taxed? I mean the tax is - -",
  "It's being imposed. But, say, at the gas station, they don't ask you when you drive up: Now do you consent to the tax?",
  "But that's different from consent. You can say I don't consent as loudly as you like and as often as you like, and you still have to pay the tax.",
  "Well, do you recognize that the bank was on notice, at least that it was a Federal requirement that when you deal with individual Indians or what this loan company was, it was an organization of Indians -- that's what the Federal law calls it -- there is a duty of fair dealing? The Federal law requires that. Isn't that so?",
  "But it's not -- it's not uncommon that a State would adopt a Federal standard as its -- as its own on a question of civil rights. A State might stay, well, we choose to construe our human rights law in accord with the Federal -- Federal law?",
  "But it is an organization of Indians?",
  "Did they - -",
  "I thought that the bank -- I thought that the Long Company was a plaintiff in the tribal court?",
  "And as I understand it, the Long Company asserted, along with the individuals, contract claims?",
  "But the Long Company did not make a tort claim?",
  "So why isn't this judgment, even if you're right about the individuals in the tort claim, why isn't this judgment good at least as to the contract claim, which are not challenging and which runs to the benefit of the Long Company which has nothing to do with the tort claim that you are challenging?",
  "So the consensual relationship is what you just said, contracts, leases or other commercial. So the consent is to the commercial relationship.",
  "Certainly not in Strate, which you quoted before as saying if you have jurisdiction to regulate, then have you jurisdiction to enforce the regulation.",
  "Well, they said they don't need to because they said if they win on their claim, then their whole case - -",
  "There is no objection - -",
  "You're not asking us to resolve that circuit split in this case.",
  "To elaborate tribal common law.",
  "Mr. Frederick, before you finish, I would like for to you give your best answer to a lurking, underlying concern, and that is the the Chief Justice brought up the outsider subjected to courts where the outsider has no vote. That happens when you sued in a State that's not your own, but there is the right to remove and also at the end of the line is this Court. And I think in the case of the tribal courts, neither of those exist. There's no -- you can't remove to a State or Federal court, and this Court has no review authority over a tribal court's judgment.",
  "Not the same faith and credit that it would give to a sister State judgment?",
  "But then could you go into Federal court under what was in farmers and say we had no jurisdiction because we had a forum selection clause?",
  "What would have been?",
  "And how much time -- this is two questions; time question and the content question. What would she have had to say to comply with the rule as you read it?",
  "That's a complex answer. And I -- this seems to me to be a clear case of what was in the judge's mind. She said I have a record here of repeated e-mails to this woman, threatening to kill her, threatening to kill her new husband, threatening to kill her mother. He did it again and again and again. I have seen this person, he appeared before me. It is my educated prediction that he will do it again. So I'm going to put him away for as long as I can. That's -- her reasoning process is not at all mysterious. What notice is the defendant lacking?",
  "Why should we put into rule 32(h), as Justice Scalia suggests, the 3553(a) factors, when we know that the rule makers did make a change in 2007? That is they put 3553(a) into 32(d)(2)(F); so they made a change there and they said the judge could ask to have these things included in the pre-sentence report; but they left (H) looking like it's dealing just with the guidelines. Why couldn't the Court say well, we didn't put 3553 in (h), and so it's not there?",
  "Couldn't you have asked at the hearing, couldn't you ask the judge: Judge, please have a continuance here because you have taken us by surprise and we'd like to offer some evidence that you -- that might influence you?",
  "When? I asked Mr. Madden and didn't get a precise answer: When does this notice have to be given? We're told that the court itself did not get the full sentencing packet until seven days before the hearing. So when must this notice be given and how much does it have to say?",
  "But you think that this case is a poor example because you're urging us to apply the harmless error rule and say this case would have come out the same way - -",
  "If we -- if we grant the review so we can resolve the question, does the judge have to give notice or not? And if she has to give notice, what time? What content? But now you're urging us to say -- to do something that ordinarily this Court doesn't do, that trial judges do, to deal with harmless error, which would be spending our time on this very particular case setting no law for any other case?",
  "But then it would be easy for a district judge to escape any obligation to give 32(h) notice because he could simply say: Oh, yeah, before I would have ranked this as a Sentencing Guidelines matter, but now I'm treating it as a 3553(a) factor, so I don't have to bother with 32(h) anymore.",
  "Why isn't it just whatever is the reason that the judge is considering is going outside the advisory Guidelines, whatever that reason is, just say it. So the judge says -- could say here, \"I'm contemplating going outside because I don't think that this man is going to stop these threats.\" Period. That's all.",
  "Is that based on any - - any precedent of this Court's?",
  "So just on the cross-appeal rule?",
  "This would not be a mathematical error?",
  "Double jeopardy if it's a new judge? Is that what you said?",
  "Let's go back to where you started, and that was with the statute, 37 -- what is it? 42?",
  "-- (f). And the -- that has two subparts, and the first part just says the court of appeals can decide whether a sentence was imposed in violation of law, period. And (2) has two subparts that refer to the party appealing. So why doesn't the first one cover both sides when the second one is distinctly divided into (a) and (b) parts?",
  "What difference does it make? Now, you said this is a jurisdictional rule because its no rule. What difference does it make if it is labeled \"jurisdictional,\" or if it is just regarded as a tight procedural requirement?",
  "Even though the prosecution didn't ask for it? I thought that you were relying on the division of authority between the executive, the prosecutor, and the court. And that is that a court reacts to the charges that the prosecutor brings, and if the prosecutor isn't asking for a higher sentence, the court has no authority to grant it.",
  "Why not? Why wouldn't the prosecutor still have control and say: Judge, the government is asking for ten years, no more?",
  "Why didn't the Government cross-appeal in this case?",
  "Mr. Jorgensen, suppose I think there's a larger anterior question to all of this? And that is what I suggested in the colloquy with Ms. Howe, we have a system in which the prosecutor can bring charges. The judge may think, my goodness, looking at this set of facts, you could have charged much more. The judge can't do that, he can't tell the prosecutor you have to charge \"Y\" in addition to \"X\". The government chooses not to appeal. Now, what right does the court say, I know you didn't appeal, Government, but should have so we're going to take care of it for you? It seems to me that our system rests on a principle of party presentation as many systems do not. In many systems, the court does shape the controversy and can intrude issues on its own. But in our adversarial system, we rely on counsel to do that kind of thing. So, my problem with your whole position, without getting down to particular statutory provisions, is what business does the court have to put an issue in the case that counsel chose not to raise?",
  "Well, he doesn't have to pursue it if the Government appeals.",
  "I didn't understand that a party couldn't voluntarily withdraw a notice of appeal. I mean, suppose the only way that the court of appeals can get into this is because the defendant has pursued an appeal. Suppose this comes up and the defendant says, oh, my goodness, I stand to get 15 more years in prison; I'm withdrawing my notice of appeal. There's nothing before the court of appeals then. Nothing.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Can you go over that, Mr. Fisher? Because the -- there was a plurality opinion, right, in Coker? And Justice Powell wrote separately, and I thought he left open an outrageous rape resulting in serious, lasting harm to the victim. He said that the Coker jury was not asked and could not have found from the facts in that case that the offense was outrageous or want only violent in that it involved a aggravated battery. So you don't have an opinion of five Justices saying that, in any and all circumstances, rape that leaves the victim alive cannot be punished by the death penalty.",
  "I'm questioning -- you're saying it's off the chart because the Court held that you cannot have a death penalty for rape. And I suggested that that's not so clear.",
  "At any rate - -",
  "There were four justices on the plurality opinion. That was the only point I wanted to make.",
  "There's a brief in this case on behalf of several States, and the argument that's made in that brief on the point that the Chief Justice has raised is we can never know whether there is a consensus one way or another so long as Coker seems to cover the waterfront, so long as Coker admits of the interpretation that you cannot have the death penalty for rape, period. So the argument is on this question -- not talking about the universe of crimes, but as to rape - - we cannot know if there is a consensus one way or another until this Court clarifies what Coker stands for.",
  "There was, at least in the amici briefs in Coker -- may not have been explicit in the Court's decision -- but the argument was made that the rape law in question, the Georgia law, came from an earlier tradition when a woman was regarded as as good as dead once she was raped; and the crime was thought to be an offense against her husband or her father as much as it was to her. And that was the background of Coker, plus the racial element in it was very strong. I imagine that that -- if the question were -- the Coker question were to come up again, those would still be factors. I mean, the notion was that making rape equivalent to murder was no kindness to women, because it said once you've been raped, you're spoiled. That's not -- there's no parallel with child rape. So I think that what was going on under the surface in Coker is quite different.",
  "But it isn't -- it isn't the notion that she's somebody else's property; and - - which was the history of the rape statutes.",
  "It was 25 years, right?",
  "In one respect is broader, and perhaps whether it assists your position, Coker is a crime that could have only a female victim and a male perpetrator, but this child rape statute as I understand it could be the -- the victim could, male or female; the perpetrator could be male or female.",
  "But - -",
  "The claim that Justice Souter has posited is not one that the second person would have been -- he was soliciting. He was solicited to be a plaintiff in that second case. That is not the case that is involved here. As far as we know - -",
  "As far as we know, Taylor didn't even know about the first case. He brings the second case. There is no indication that it was solicited by Herrick. So I don't know why you're even reaching the case where someone -- someone is -- you say has to be controlled, but why are we getting into the details of such a situation when we have no solicitation?",
  "And it does cover idle curiosity. I mean, I suppose if anyone in the courtroom were to file a request for the same information, there could be no argument that there would be any kind of preclusion just because it's been heard before.",
  "And the judge's obligation to look out for the trial to see, for example, any settlement has to be approved by the judge to make sure it is fair to the absent class members.",
  "The word that we use is privity. If you are in privity with somebody else, you can -- that's a pre-existing legal relationship.",
  "As the beneficiary and the trustee.",
  "Which is the case here. It is the statement lawyer that's involved?",
  "But in the case of the Chief's hypothetical, of course, it would never come up, if the client sends another lawyer to bring this. But there's no automatic preclusion in that relationship as there is in the traditional relationship.",
  "Why isn't that not like Montana, where the government was not a party to the case but it was in control of what the contractor was doing?",
  "You don't think that somebody who finances -- who solicits a litigation, recruits someone to bring the case, pays for it, and then says, \"I recruited a very good law firm, so I can stay out of it. I'm not going to try to -- I don't know anything about the law, I'm not going to try to manage this case.\" But someone who recruits the firm and pays for it wouldn't be bound.",
  "Would you explain to me how that could possibly work? I can understand that you're making an argument that the second case, there was a recruitment, there was collusion or whatever. But for all we know from this record, how could Taylor possibly be bound when Herrick's suit is over? Because as far as we know, Taylor never heard of that first case. How can somebody be bound by a litigation in which they had no notice, no opportunity to be heard? So if we freeze the situation at the of case one, how could Taylor possibly be bound?",
  "Because he's asking for Herrick who is bound by the first case.",
  "Because what you're saying is the person who is really in the second case is the same person who was in the first case, and Taylor is simply acting as an agent to give Herrick another chance?",
  "But we're talking about binding Taylor.",
  "There was no finding of that. There was no finding here of agency relationship. There was no finding of collusion. That would be a different case.",
  "No. It said it wasn't reaching that question.",
  "There is in the -- in the Restatement of Judgment, as far as I know, all of the examples involve a representational relationship that existed at the time of the first litigation. There's nothing in the Restatement that suggests that preclusion would be proper here.",
  "Yes, but here - -",
  "Do you agree with me about the facts that we're dealing with here? As far as the first case is concerned, no evidence that Taylor even knew that Herrick was -- Herrick was bringing that suit?",
  "But -- and while the litigation is ongoing, Taylor doesn't know about it, right?",
  "Okay. And is there any evidence that Herrick asked Taylor to file a FOIA request - -",
  "-- after Herrick lost his case?",
  "But that wasn't my question.",
  "My question, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, is: Did Herrick ask Taylor to file that FOIA suit? And I think your answer is no. There's no evidence of that.",
  "Is there any evidence that Herrick financed the litigation?",
  "Is there any evidence that Herrick called any of the shots in that litigation?",
  "In any case, the decision that we're reviewing didn't find any of those things.",
  "So if another member of the club, let's say another member of the aviation association who's interested in antique planes, just files a FOIA request, would that person be precluded who is -- who knows that Herrick brought a suit and lost? He's just a member of the club. He doesn't want to help Herrick restore the plane.",
  "But my question was just a member of the association, whether - -",
  "But why does there have to be any interest? Going back to a question I think Justice Scalia asked, we're dealing with a most unusual statute. You don't have to have any reason for a FOIA request.",
  "I'm not sure what the hypothetical is. I mean it is certainly not the case that -- let's say you have a whole busload of people who get injured in the same accident. Plaintiff one sues and loses. Two sues and loses. Three is not precluded. Four is not precluded.",
  "And if all that has been proved, the problem is that the D.C. Circuit said: We're not going to look into what they call strategic whatever. We're going to take it just as it is, with none of -- no showing that these two are in cahoots.",
  "There was no showing that Herrick ever asked Taylor -- well, there is a showing that they're interested in rebuilding this plane or restoring the plane. But we don't have -- and the D.C. Circuit said it was not relevant to its analysis. Yes, I would totally agree with you if we have a recruiting situation, if we have a financing situation. But the D.C. Circuit said: Well, that's irrelevant.",
  "That's out of the case because the court of appeals said: We do not need to determine whether they count as tactical maneuvering. We do not do so.",
  "It could be remanded. It could be remanded with instructions that the collusion question is still open. Prove it. It hasn't been proved.",
  "Anyone --anyone in this audience, and anyone in the association would be a proper FOIA plaintiff; is that right?",
  "Ms. Stetson said that the district court unlike the court of appeals, did find collusion, and she referred to a page that I didn't check.",
  "What about on the Federal level? Could a Federal employee who says just what was alleged here come right into Court to bring a Bivens action and says, I was discriminated against and similarly situated people were not, and it was irrational? Could a Federal employee come to court with such a complaint?",
  "And it doesn't matter that the State has civil service remedies that were not used --",
  "-- or there were union grievance procedures that aren't used? You can go right into Federal court and say, I don't have to use those State remedies?",
  "Let's take this case. You say there were 30 similarly situated people with regard to this employee being let go. Wouldn't that be a contested matter? The employer will say they are not similarly situated; each of them is differently situated. How does that get resolved on summary judgment?",
  "I thought they withdrew from saying that it was a budgetary matter.",
  "I thought you did not agree with that in your brief. I thought --",
  "-- you said no hypothetical justification is there. Not like legislation where any conceivable basis, even if the legislature didn't conceive it. I thought you were quite clear in saying no, that's not what rational basis means in this context.",
  "All of those involved a group characteristic. One involved people -- Beazer, wasn't it was methadone users? But none of them involved a situation like this, where she is not claiming anything about being a member of any identifiable class. She is just saying, they discriminated against me -- not because of sex, race or anything else. They were out to get me.",
  "But you brought up -- you said this is 1983. It's a cause of action provided by Congress. So that's why this is something State and municipal employees can do, but no Federal employee could do. 1985 also uses the word \"person or class of persons,\" and yet this Court held that 1985(3), that claim, it has to be some group-based animus, not malice directed toward a particular individual.",
  "Well, maybe because 1985(3) is in a discrimination context, The Court could say 1983 -- we know the classification to which Justice Breyer was referring, tax classifications, zoning classifications, but this group of claims we're cutting out.",
  "But it's a -- it's a general statute. It's not a precise statute like Title VII or the Age Discrimination Act. So it's the kind of legislation that seems much more amenable to court interpretation.",
  "Well, it certainly opens a can of worms to say that you take every claim against the government, every claim of wrongdoing by the government, and make it an equal protection claim because you say other people were treated properly and I was treated improperly; therefore, I have an equal protection claim.",
  "The Ninth Circuit decision would rule out the case where an employee says: I was the most qualified person for this position by far, but the supervisors took a bribe from a rich uncle to promote somebody else.",
  "That would be out?",
  "The scapegoat case, too, would be out?",
  "That's not -- you know that that's not the position they took in their brief. They said it's not a hypothetical, any conceivable. They said that by qualifying -- even in the at-will category, the government has to articulate a reason rooted in the facts of this case, not a hypothetical. A hypothetical reason is not good enough.",
  "In Oregon, is -- would there be a civil service remedy available to someone in this situation?",
  "The Administrative Procedure Act doesn't apply to State -- to State procedures. It's a Federal act --",
  "-- governing Federal agencies.",
  "Except this wasn't -- this wasn't employment at will, right?",
  "When you do that with the two cases that I raised with Miss Metcalf? That is, the bribe case and the scapegoat case, they are out, too. If public employment is taken out from this class-of-one, those two cases would go as well.",
  "I thought if you have a peremptory challenge it means that you can't challenge on any basis other than the group -- the groups that Batson has recognized. You - you said you could challenge a peremptory, exercise a peremptory challenge if it's unrelated to the selection of an impartial jury. Well, I thought that a peremptory, outside of the class cases, is matter of the prosecutor or the defense attorney don't like this juror.",
  "Has there ever been a challenge to the exercise of peremptory challenge on the ground that the challenge was unrelated to the selection of an impartial jury?",
  "How is the government speaking? You have already acknowledged that the wealthy candidate can spend as much as he or she wants and the end result of this scheme is that there will be more, not less, speech because the non-affluent opponent will now have money to spend that he didn't have before. So I think you have to concede that overall the scheme will produce more political speech, not less.",
  "Has it done it? I mean, we do have some experience under the statute now.",
  "But it was a four-year record and the numbers are rather startling that -- is it 110 senators or representatives qualified for the enhanced contributions and only 6 of them were incumbents?",
  "Well, if that's so, one of the reasons that has been given for this statute is that it encourages the parties to favor the wealthier candidates; it deters people who are non-affluent but highly meritorious. So -- and it gives the public the perception that the seats in our Congress are there to be bought by the wealthiest bidder. And if there's anything to that -- well, do you reject that out of hand as what the statute is all about?",
  "But I thought -- I thought your brief -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- said at one stage that there is -- what Congress was driving at is a valid concern, but there are less restrictive alternatives. And I was trying to find what those less restrictive alternatives were.",
  "But isn't there something different between what the statute was at the time of Buckley, that a lid on, you can't spend more than X amount of money, and a statute that says we're going to let you spend, the sky is the limit for you, but we're going to give a boost to your opponent?",
  "I'm talking about the statute as it was originally enacted by Congress did have expenditure limits and this Court said that was no good. This statute doesn't have that problem because it doesn't put a lid on the candidates self-financing.",
  "Could you clarify with respect to that question two things: The party is not at liberty to give anything it wants. You explained that it would be -- it's tied to that formula. So the wealthy person could still have a lot more to spend. But the party also is -- there's no obligation of the party to give one cent to anybody that it doesn't choose to give money to; is that right?",
  "The problem is it's every $10,000. As you pointed out, it doesn't require more disclosure. All of this information would be disclosed under the system without this 24-hour, and that I think is the complaint, the burden of having every time you spend $10,000 to file something.",
  "It --",
  "But I thought that --",
  "-- that Justice Breyer's question, General Clement, was he asked you to assume that that was unconstitutional, and you were answering if it was unconstitutional. But there is one person whose speech is being discouraged in the picture, and that's the contributor to the self-financed candidate. You have to recognize that that one can't speak as much vis-a-vis the contributors to the other candidate.",
  "Where did the money come from? Was it a war chest left over from prior campaigns?",
  "Yes, because he didn't -- his opponent did not take advantage of the relaxed contribution limits.",
  "Because he was just a good fundraiser? That --",
  "But he got -- he got on the stand, and he said some very nasty things about her. I mean he painted her as aggressive, vengeful. Isn't there a legitimate rebuttal when he is painting her as the aggressor, and she has given a statement that suggests that he is the one who was aggressive?",
  "But could it have come in as rebuttal of his testimony, the same testimony by the police? Was it the police officer that --",
  "-- took her statement? Okay. He gets on the stand, and he says all of these unpleasant things about her. And then the State says, okay, now we have our chance, and we are going to put in her statement through the testimony of the police officer to rebut what he has just said.",
  "Maybe they would be wrong -- maybe they would be wrong in another case, but we have this case, and Justice Scalia has suggested, I take it, that this testimony could not come in even by way of rebuttal.",
  "Even by way of cross-examination. Do you -- do you share that view?",
  "It may go to his credibility. He has just painted a picture of this woman which is quite different from what her statement to the police officer would portray.",
  "I think your answer was that in Crawford that was the situation. It was a spouse; wasn't it?",
  "In Crawford.",
  "And it was the defendant who said he didn't want her to testify.",
  "There are some things that are not just testimonial. For example, suppose she left a sealed letter. She has been murdered, and the letter is to be opened only upon her death, and the letter says: If I was done in, go after him. Could that come into evidence?",
  "Well, is it? I'm just giving you --",
  "So what's the line between what -- I understand that she is accusing him to a police officer.",
  "So you say that's testimonial.",
  "If she is talking to a friend and saying that she is scared to death of this man --",
  "-- the friend could testify?",
  "Why?",
  "What's the difference? If this rule is going to separate the testimonial from the nontestimonial, you have to be able to tell when it's one and when it's the other.",
  "But the -- here it's his own murder trial. So he didn't murder her so that she couldn't be a witness at the trial for her murder.",
  "But he might have murdered her because she had good grounds to get him indicted on criminal assault charges. Maybe he murdered her so that she would not be available to testify at such a trial.",
  "Does that mean, what you just said, that this is not a problem in States that have adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence? Because, as I understand it, there is an exception, the standard exception, for when the defendant procures the witness's absence for the very purpose of preventing the witness from testifying at a particular trial. That's the exception that's in the Federal Rules of Evidence. You don't have an exception, a hearsay exception, for just being responsible for the witness's unavailability. So practically, this couldn't come in under a hearsay objection in places that have the Federal Rules of Evidence; is that right?",
  "Isn't there a problem that was brought out in the briefs with -- this man is standing trial before a jury that's going to determine guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but if this testimony is going to come in, the judge has to make some kind of a preliminary finding that he killed her in advance of the jury making that determination.",
  "If you're right, it would go back on the harmless error question, right?",
  "Mr. Russell, this is the problem that I have with your double inquiry. First, you decide business necessity. Then you decide reasonable factor other than age. Once you determine that there is no business necessity, there is a readily available alternative, so what you're left with is a pretext for age discrimination, what -- what function is there for anything else to perform? I mean, I understand the business necessity, whether you have it pre-1991 or post, but I don't understand putting this other test on top of it. It sounds like you're making it harder for the -- for the plaintiff.",
  "The expression comes from the Equal Pay Act, with a substitution. In the Equal Pay Act it's \"any other factor other than sex\" and here it's \"a reasonable factor other than age.\" And my impression is that that formulation in this Equal Pay Act has been rather problematic. First, you have to find there is a differential between the pay of men and the pay of women, so -- and then you go to any other factor other than sex. Are you suggesting any different analysis for the age category than for the sex category.",
  "Your point that it's sandwiched between two things that are clearly affirmative defenses, BFOQ, the employer has the buried of production and persuasion. And I forgot what the third one --",
  "Is also an affirmative defense. So I take it your point is why should this middle one be any different?",
  "But the argument was that EEOC never spoke to disparate impact?",
  "The problem is that you would be making this provision more generous to the plaintiff than -- for example, in Title VII the defense is business necessity; the employer has the burden of production; the employee has the burden of persuasion. Here you'd read -- you're saying you come into the covered category, you were shown because of age through impact, and then the burden -- the total burden is on the employer. Am -- am I making myself clear here?",
  "Mr. Waxman, the first part --",
  "The way you phrased the first part, it sounded to me like you were going back to the interpretation that this Court rejected, that is, under the Age Discrimination Act there is only differential treatment, not neutral factor with a differential impact.",
  "Still, the numbers, the way it came out, are rather startling. That there were 31 people who were RIF'd; and of those, 30 turn out to be over 40.",
  "But the terms \"flexibility,\" \"criticality\" -- I mean the way you described it, it sounds very mechanical, mathematical. But those terms are -- they call for some human judgment.",
  "Well, maybe because he thought that, given the subjectivity of some of these factors, that there was at least unconscious age bias in the decisions that were made.",
  "But that was taken out of it by Judge Jacobs when he redid it. He said, we were on the wrong track with business necessity. Business necessity is out. It's only reasonable factor of age.",
  "Is that --",
  "Was Judge Pooler wrong, then? She said, in effect: You forfeited reasonable factor other than sex, because you didn't bring it up. You were going on business necessity.",
  "The jury didn't hear a word about reasonable factors other than age. They heard about business necessity.",
  "Let me follow up on Justice Scalia's question because I think your brief really goes astray on that. Think of the many situations like the remainderman who is the trustee. He has to look out for the interests of the live tenant, but he's going to keep all the rest, so maybe he wants to be economical. That's not saying that he is. So I've always understood that the term \"conflicting interests\" means just that; you have conflicting interests. It doesn't mean that you necessarily slide over into misconduct. And I think that if you would keep that separation in mind, is there a conflicting interest? Yes, there is. Has the trustee in fact slipped and taken unfair advantage because of the conflicting interests?",
  "But then you come to the end of the line. You have to prove that the authority was misused. And as I understand the Sixth Circuit's decision, what those judges were doing, they say we're going to look at this with some skepticism because of the conflict. And let me give you a concrete example. This woman got Social Security disability benefits and she did it at the suggestion of MetLife is; that so?",
  "But she got a lawyer that they recommended that she have.",
  "But the point is they came to her and said: Get Social Security disability benefits. Now, to get those she would have to show that she is totally and permanently disabled.",
  "So here is a company that says: Tell the U.S. government that you are totally and permanently disabled, but -- and then we'll recoup all that money that we paid out to you; but then when we get a chance to look, look it over, we'll say you're not disabled. Why isn't it appropriate to regard just that set of circumstances with suspicion?",
  "Yes, I'm not questioning that at all.",
  "That sounds fine. It's a question of why, after helping her tell the government that she was totally disabled, they, after the initial two-year period, turned around and said she's not.",
  "Well, let's take these facts.",
  "As the trier -- I mean ERISA, yes, it certainly says you can be both the plan administrator and the payor, but all it says is that that's permissible. But it also provides for review of those decisions, judicial review in court. And here is, say, a district court is looking at it and says: I don't understand why the company didn't look at the doctor's explanation and put such heavy weight on a checkmark. And I also don't understand the suggestion that she is totally disabled to the government and then saying, well, she's really not, in this very close time frame. So it might be okay and it might not. I am in equipoise about this case, not the terms of the plan but the decision that was made to deny her benefits. So which way do I call it? That's the question that Justice Souter posed, and you seem not to want to face up to it and answer it.",
  "How does that bear on making a determination that the - -",
  "-- employee -- that the plan administrator has to make: Is this person disabled and is she not?",
  "Where, where is this decision from that you're - -",
  "There's one feature of this that I don't understand. It was referred to very swiftly in Judge Merritt's separate opinion. He said at one point there was a proposal by MetLife that they give this woman a trial run at a sedentary job to see if she could do it. And he said that that made a lot of sense to him, and it was MetLife's proposal, but then it got withdrawn. Could you clarify what that was?",
  "Then why did MetLife withdraw that proposal?",
  "My question was not what Dr. Patel said, but how did that proposal get dropped?",
  "And what would -- how would you verbalize it?",
  "Because everybody talks about yes, it's a factor, it's a relevant factor. But if you are writing an opinion to give clear instructions to the district judges who are the first-instance judicial decisionmakers, what do you tell them?",
  "Why - -",
  "If we look at Firestone, it's rather laconic. It's just says -- it says, ordinarily, if you don't have this discretionary authority, it's de novo review. And then -- this is on page 115. It says if the fiduciary has discretionary authority to determine eligibility benefits, then it's not de novo. And what more does it say? I don't see that it says anything more than that.",
  "Is it a question of just how you phrase it, Mr. Olson? Is there any scope - - does your argument leave any scope for attorney general, state attorney general imposition of state law remedies against a deceptive practice involving advertising cigarettes. To give you concrete examples, suppose a state attorney general said in every - suppose the practice were in every carton of cigarettes the cigarette manufacturer includes an insert that says: If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes; if you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes. And the state attorney general goes after that statement in the carton as false and deceptive advertising. Would there be any scope for that?",
  "So your answer then to my specific example would be the attorney general could not go after such a statement, \"If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes\"?",
  "Is it the jury fracture? You said the attorney general could not stop, my example, \"If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our lights.\" The attorney general could not proscribe that. So nothing that you're saying turns on it being the jury rather than the attorney general, does it?",
  "So your position is essentially that Congress, as -- as far as the advertising of low or light, Congress empowered one decisionmaker only and that's the FTC, and if they don't act then the cigarette companies can say anything they want about low tar and low nicotine?",
  "Does the -- does the consent decree say anything about advertising low, light, those specifics?",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Frederick, are you saying that the consent decree -- because we have overtaken Judge Kessler's decision by consent decree, right and it has terms? Does a -- does a consent decree terms allow state attorney generals to say don't advertise low?",
  "Could a state attorney general say under my authority to check against false and deceptive advertising, no cigarette company can advertise in this State low or light?",
  "Suppose he wins the lawsuit -- he wins the lawsuit that it's false and deceptive to say \"low.\" Could he then have a regulation that says cigarette companies don't advertise \"low\" or \"light\"?",
  "Well, can you make that concrete? What would change about the label \"low\" or \"light\"?",
  "This is in the Reilly case.",
  "Mr. Young, I thought that in Ellis the litigation -- the Ellis Court said that that litigation did not have as its subject matter negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining contract.",
  "I'm quoting from -- I'm quoting from that decision at page 453. The case involved litigation \"not involving negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining contract.\"",
  "Well, are you saying the Court got it wrong? I mean, the words that I'm quoting are from the opinion: \"Not involving negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining contract.\"",
  "That's the only thing that could be germane. If it doesn't relate to that, then your case is solid.",
  "But why isn't litigation -- what I don't understand is how you draw a line between the -- the negotiation of an agreement, where Lehnert said this kind of pooling is okay, and the enforcement of the agreement. I mean, we're not talking about litigation unrelated to collective bargaining. It is only litigation that deals with the meaning of a term in the contract, whether what the employer has done was an unfair labor practice, whether there has been a contractual violation.",
  "I don't understand why enforcing, one thing is making the agreement and there you agree as you must because of our Lehnert decision you can't have these pooling arrangements. What's the difference between negotiating an agreement and litigation to enforce it.",
  "But what did the Court mean in Lehnert when it said there must be some indication the payment is for service that may ultimately inure to the benefit of members of the local union by virtue of their membership in the parent organization?",
  "But couldn't it be, couldn't the national say, local, you have asked for assistance with such-and-such litigation. We think your case is what this Court sometimes calls a bad vehicle. We don't want to finance your litigation, the issue is important and we are going to wait for a case that presents it in a better light, is more likely to win.",
  "Mr. Ortiz, why isn't section 2 of the Arbitration Act sufficient to take care of the ouster doctrine, whatever may have been left of it?",
  "I'm not sure that I follow that, because it seems to me -- where did this doctrine of ouster come from? It came from the court. The courts said, no, we won't enforce arbitration agreements if it would oust us of jurisdiction. Why would a court reading section 2 not say, well, that rule never made any sense in the first place, so we're not going to follow it? It's not any rule that Congress has imposed on the courts.",
  "That may have been the historic model. This was never a notion that Congress enforced on the courts. They imposed it on themselves. So my question remains why shouldn't the Court then say this agreement has been declared enforceable, the ouster doctrine didn't have much to recommend it in the beginning, but certainly not any more; we can change it?",
  "You just -- you just used the words \"arising out of the controversy.\" \"The controversy\" is used in several sections of the Arbitration Act, and \"the controversy\" in other contexts means the underlying dispute between the parties. \"The controversy\" is not over the enforcement of the arbitration agreement.",
  "But that's the question that I have, Mr. Phillips. What is the underlying dispute between the parties? It seems to me that your look-through argument is look-through only halfway. That is, if you look -- if you consider the controversy, the suit that was brought in the State court, the controversy is here we have a customer who hasn't paid the amount charged. So we have a suit on a debt. Why isn't that the controversy? You have to make the counterclaim the controversy, which comes up only defensively. It wasn't brought as a lawsuit.",
  "But -- but she chose to assert it only defensively; and it's not a complaint - - the counterclaim if it had been brought as an independent action, everybody agrees qualifies for Federal jurisdiction. But the litigant who has this claim is asserting it only as a defense to a claim that you admit does not qualify for Federal jurisdiction.",
  "But in the practical effect, what happens? Now you have asserted that you can enforce because of the counterclaim that asserts - - that arises under Federal law. But you say it's is not the same as removal because the underlying claim, your suit on the debt owed, remains in Federal -- State court; but what happens to that claim once you have this arbitration?",
  "I meant -- I didn't mean to say you couldn't get affirmative relief on a counterclaim. Of course you could. But this - -",
  "Chose not to - -",
  "-- chose not to litigate the case, chose to -- well, I'm being sued, so I'm going to bring up this claim. It wasn't as an original matter.",
  "The controversy between the parties is the credit card company says, customer, you're in default $10,000; and the customer said, if that's so, then I have certain offsets because they charged me too much interest. How do you - -",
  "-- how do you -- it's all part of the same controversy, isn't it?",
  "There would be nothing inappropriate about a State court entertaining that excessive interest claim, but applying Federal law to it. I mean the -- 1831(d) says that Federal law governs the interest - -",
  "Not state usury law. So you could have this case going on in State court.",
  "And the State court would be perfectly competent to apply the Federal law.",
  "That claim doesn't - -",
  "But there could be nothing left for the State court to do after you have the arbitration. I mean, not that you arbitrate about interest due on a nonexistent debt. I mean, you have to have the two things together.",
  "I just can't envision a case where what you haven't effected is taking a case, a debt, simple debt, no diversity a State court case.",
  "And you remove the State court from the picture and gotten it over into Federal court to order the arbitration and any follow-up to the arbitration. It just seems to me you have effected - - accomplished what you could not have accomplished by the -- by removal, which you admit that you can't remove on the basis of a counterclaim.",
  "But you could have asked for that in the State court as well, and - -",
  "Why isn't it proper to look to see -- the party who wants arbitration has a dispute; the dispute is we are owed money by the debtor. Why shouldn't the court say, well, we'll see what your case is about; if your case would qualify for Federal jurisdiction, fine. But we are not going to look to see what the defendants cases is or might be. We'll just look at your case and that's how we will define the controversy.",
  "But then you'll have not only a hypothetical claim, because nothing has been brought, but an hypothetical answer by way of counterclaim to that claim.",
  "So you would come into the court and say there is no suit going on anywhere, but if we were to bring this suit in State court, the defendant could have brought this Federal counterclaim? That's a lot of hypothesis.",
  "Excuse me - -",
  "What do you do with the assertion that sections 9 through 11 are not in sync with your view, because they would not give you -- you could go in and -- to compel arbitration but once the arbitration was award -- an award was made, you would not have access to the Federal courts to enforce the award?",
  "But how do you know? How do you know? That's the problem.",
  "Well, one is that you - - you are stuck with the Arizona v. Evans, which says if it's the court - -",
  "We don't know if these records are good, bad, or indifferent. As far as this record shows, this could be an isolated incident, or it could be typical of what goes on. We just don't know.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, what you've said about the danger to the arresting office -- officer and so they don't undertake an arrest lightly, doesn't fit with the facts of this case. This was a police officer who really wanted to go after the defendant. He expected -- he suspected defendant was a bad guy. So that's how this all started. So he called his own department, do we have any warrant, and then the next county's department. But this was an officer who wanted to go after the defendant.",
  "But that's not what we have here, and we have a 13 percent error rate. If this case goes your way, the police have limited resources; why should they spend them on upgrading their computer system when if there is an error it wasn't matter?",
  "How many 1983 recoveries have there been when someone says the police, they convicted me on the basis of this evidence that wasn't suppressed, but they committed a Fourth Amendment violation so I should prevail in the 1983 action? How many defendants in that situation have ever won a 1983 action?",
  "But not if it occurred in the station house, right, if the -- if the arrestee had been taken into the station house?",
  "Well, why isn't this situation more like the station house than it is like - - the Belton situation is the police apprehend the -- a driver. They are concerned about weapons, about being assaulted. But here we have someone who is locked up inside a police car, handcuffed, can't go anywhere. That sounds to me more like the station house than it does the urgent situation where the police have a legitimate concern for their own safety.",
  "What happens to this car? Now, we had no passengers, just the driver. He is put away in this squad car, so he is not going to drive that car home. What happens to the car? Let's say there was no search. The car is there. It has no driver. What do the police do with it?",
  "But suppose they didn't? Suppose they said, well, he is secure; he is no danger to us, so we are not going to search the car without a warrant. What -- what happens to the car? It just doesn't stay there stranded on the road, does it?",
  "In Belton, wasn't the notion what was within grabbing distance? And the trunk wasn't within grabbing distance. That was -- and here nothing is within grabbing distance.",
  "Could they have impounded this car? I thought they didn't have grounds to impound it because it was -- we were just told it was parked in an alley of a private house.",
  "So they could have impounded, and then could they have done an inventory search?",
  "You are not asking to overrule Belton; you are asking to take it in the context in which it was presented, where there was genuine concern for officer safety. Is that - -",
  "You did in your reply brief address the plan question?",
  "The problem is that is that if you, even if we hold for you on that issue, you could still lose on the plan documents rule, right.",
  "Or he might have -- he might have decided that he didn't want to revoke that one. We -- we just have no way of knowing. It's odd that he revoked as to one plan but not the 501(k) plan, as I understand.",
  "Well, because he could - - he could have -- despite her waiver, he could have named her as the beneficiary of that plan and that would have controlled.",
  "I think there is a question of the way it was phrased. And perhaps the court just didn't get it, what that question on which we didn't grant cert was driving at.",
  "Before you do, leaving the plan -- the beneficiary designation, you say that the plan administrator is not required to give effect to a waiver that conflicts with the beneficiary designation. Is it just not required? Does the administrator have discretion to give effect to the waiver, or it -- must it disregard the waiver and strictly follow the beneficiary designation?",
  "You made the contention now -- and I think you have it in your brief -- that if you get something in return for a disclaimer, then the disclaimer is not effected. That it's effected only if you receive nothing in return. And what -- what is the source of that contention that you can't disclaim if you get something in return?",
  "Mr. Schnapper - -",
  "But why are we -- why are we spending so much time on hypotheticals that are so far from this case? This was a person who appeared at an internal proceeding, she gave testimony, very specific testimony. She wasn't saying: I'm against harassment. She said: This boss harassed me. It is about as specific as you get. So we're dealing with a particular case of somebody who was a witness in an internal investigation. Why do we have to reach the outer boundaries of this claim in this case?",
  "But I thought that - -",
  "But I thought that the - - real case -- the real case that we're dealing with is somebody who appeared in an internal investigation, and I thought that what was the debate between the two sides; anyone who made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in the investigation, I thought that the other side's position was, well, this is not an \"investigation\" within the meaning of the statute. That what goes on internally doesn't qualify. \"Investigation,\" \"proceeding,\" or \"hearing\" under Title VII requires first that there be a Title VII charge. I thought that that's what the controversy we're talking about today is about: Is this a qualifying investigation?",
  "The -- the other side says this is not an investigation. There was no charge filed. She's filed no charge. So this is not a qualifying investigation. What is the government's position on that?",
  "The investigation is not of her. She's testifying as a witness.",
  "And this is an act that's meant to protect people against discrimination in the workplace, including harassment.",
  "This is a woman who testified truthfully -- we have to assume that because this was tossed out at the very threshold, so we have to assume that everything she alleged in her complaint is true, right?",
  "There is no -- no dis - - then there has to be no genuine dispute as to any material fact. That means we must take her allegations of fact as true at this point. But in any case this is a statute that's meant to govern the workplace with all of its realities. One of them was when they asked, well, why didn't you make a complaint, use whatever internal remedies are there are? She said, because the person in this outfit who is charged with receiving complaints is the harasser.",
  "But we have to - - everything -- for you to prevail, since there has been no trial on the facts, we have to take the facts as she alleges them.",
  "And how about taking our decisions in the Faragher and Ellerth case which in a sense made the employer's internal investigation part of the EEO process because it says to the employer, if you don't have that find of effective internal complaint and investigation procedure, then you're going to be stuck on respondeat superior liability. If you do, then you will be shielded. So this Court's decision in those two cases seemed to me to say to every employer, as part of your EEO compliance you had better have this internal complaint procedure and investigation.",
  "What are the other arguments on summary judgment.",
  "When you say it's not that the employer is stuck because there's a potential retaliation claim, if the employer is certain of its grounds, that this discharge had nothing to do with her testimony, then go ahead and discharge her.",
  "On the other side, that attorney, there's a large disincentive. He hasn't got a good case. He's not going to be paid any retainer as you might be. And he's not going to get any counsel fees. Why should such -- why should it -- counsel be available to a person who obviously was discharged for having her hand in the till and not because she was harassed?",
  "No. I meant that as a hypothetical.",
  "What was the reason that she was -- what was the employer's reason for discharging her?",
  "I said if you have a really strong case of having discharged this person for cause that has nothing at all to do with harassment, you are going to win the lawsuit and it would be hard for the plaintiff to get a decent lawyer to represent her side of the case because she's going to lose.",
  "General Garre, when you address the injunction, do you mean the injunction as originally ordered by the district court or are you taking account of the modification made by the Ninth Circuit, and would you say that the three points you just made would apply as well to the injunction as modified?",
  "You didn't mention the 564 exposures that were typed Level A in the environmental assessment.",
  "I thought the 564 number was Level A, which I also thought meant exposure resulting in severe harm.",
  "Rulemaking to do what? To set up an orderly regime for Federal agencies to carry out their obligations under NEPA?",
  "But what good is it if, as I understand it, the whole training program will be over in December, and then the environmental impact statement, which was supposed to come first, is going to come after the whole project is concluded?",
  "Near -- \"near certainty.\"",
  "I thought that you were not suggesting - -",
  "And you are not suggesting that -- that there is a probability of success on the claim that you had to file an environmental impact statement.",
  "Yes. I thought you conceded that point.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, why -- why -- why is that so? I am reading this ARA statute, and it seems to give people a right to notice, an opportunity to comment, and to undertake an administrative appeal. Why isn't this statute that says, interested public, you have those rights, you have essentially a right to a seat at the table, why isn't this statute like FOIA, like the statute that the Court considered in the Atkins case, in the FEC case involving information about APAC? These were people who said: We are concerned about saving our forests. That's why Congress said that before these actions occur, there should be notice to the interested public, comment, and we are being cut out from that seat at the table. It doesn't do us any good after the project has been authorized. We want to be there when the decision is made to take action.",
  "But this statute says says before there is a specific action you have a right to notice, comment, and administrative procedures.",
  "Maybe he has no - -",
  "Why is that different from FOIA? I mean there anybody can request anything. You don't have to show anything beyond -- well, you only have to show curiosity. You say: The statute gives me a right to ask for this information.",
  "Then you are saying that this statute is just unenforceable, because the statute is supposed to operate before the project?",
  "The question is where do you draw the line?",
  "I thought that you said the government's position is that the line is to be drawn for cases that don't require either an EIS or an EA. Those -- in those cases you don't have to do this notice, comment, appeal thing. And I thought the other side is saying, no, that's the wrong place to draw the line. It would be the same thing in every case, from the government's point of view, no environmental impact statement, no environmental assessment required, no notice and comment. And they are saying you put the line in the wrong place.",
  "If you had had a ruling on where you draw the line in the Burnt Ridge case, then that would have been precedent for all these other cases, but it was settled, right, so you didn't get a determination?",
  "But you are seeking a different line. And, by the way, I don't know what the line is that you are seeking. But the government says if you don't need an EA, then you don't have to give notice, comment, et cetera. What would be your standard for when you need notice and comment?",
  "Do you want to say a word about the Ninth Circuit making a law for the entire nation, on a controversial question that normally the court would just rule for its own area?",
  "And that -- that has been stipulated here, right, that you meet the third Gingles factor? So it's not at issue in this case, but the point was made that, in one of the cases that you rely on, in Metts, that reliance on crossovers to prove the ability to elect the candidate of a racial minority's choosing undercuts the argument that the majority votes as a bloc against the minority preferred candidates. So there's tension between the crossovers on the one hand and showing that the dominant race votes as a bloc.",
  "But you're opening yourself to this line of questioning about the third factor, which is conceded by both sides, so it's not in issue. But you are opening it by having a test that looks to the second and third factor and leaves the first factor out of it. I mean, whether you agree with it or not, the 50 percent line is bright if you know what's in and what's out. You don't have any test for the first factor that's comparable, that would give district courts and attorneys some degree of security about how you determine the first factor.",
  "Mr. Browning, I thought there was something in the record that said never in North Carolina's history have you had African Americans able to choose the -- able to elect the candidate of their choice where the minority population was less than 38.37 percent.",
  "Well, does that mean a proposal if you succeed, we should remand on that question?",
  "But you stipulated. You didn't want to argue the third factor. You wanted - - you just started out by saying you were tired of this litigation, we wanted to concentrate on one issue and one issue only, and that was the 50 percent rule. And now you are suggesting that, well, no, the stipulation really didn't stipulate away the third factor. I thought you were giving in on that issue so that you could get the first issue decided.",
  "What was wrong with the clear rule that Justice Souter suggested in the LULAC case?",
  "Justice Souter, in his opinion in the LULAC case - -",
  "-- he suggested what he called a hard-edged -- a clear, hard-edged rule which is not going to be an exclusive rule, but, anyway, if you met that standard, you're okay.",
  "What -- what Justice Breyer proposed a rule at the end of his question. He said: Suppose you make it, the threshold, instead of 50 percent, it would be twice as many in the African-American population as in the crossover group. That would be the threshold.",
  "I thought you were conceding that it isn't a rigid rule, and that the North Carolina Supreme Court should have to be -- I mean they could be 48 percent, I think you said.",
  "But this -- but yours is below? Just slightly below.",
  "Oh, but there is an enormous difference between the training and the character of a police officer and, as this very case illustrates, the confidential informants are often very shady characters who can't be counted on to be truth-tellers, and have a powerful incentive to get someone for the police, because in most cases they are seeking to have their own case dealt with sympathetically. So, how can you equate a police officer with a confidential informer, who is usually someone who knows where the drug house is because he's a dealer himself?",
  "How about this one? Wasn't this one that fits my description, the one in this case?",
  "There's one feature of this is that I think is really puzzling: What this case is about is the Fourth Amendment, that requires, with certain exceptions, the main rule is to get a warrant. And here you have a confidential informer going to the place to make sure that they really do have the goods. Then he goes back to the police. He spends two hours. He's being wired and whatever else. Why didn't somebody pick up the phone and get a warrant at that point? The confidential informer could say: \"I was there and I saw the drugs.\" What -- the whole purpose of these rules is to have the police get a warrant when they can. And how do you explain that two hours lapse between when they had probable cause and when the -- when the informant returns for the second time?",
  "I thought it was established not only that there were drugs, but that he actually tasted some.",
  "But - -",
  "May I just establish one thing? Tell me if I am wrong. That this argument about consent once removed was not presented in the lower courts. That is, in the trial court you argued exigent circumstances, and then on appeal the inevitable discovery rule. So there was -- in the courts below, this was not given as the reason, the consent once removed was not alleged as the basis, as the justification for this search?",
  "That's -- it's not just this case. Maybe you can tell me. I thought because they were dealing with a confidential informant rather than a police officer, they sent him in to do the dry run. I mean the -- in the police officer cases usually the -- the undercover police officer goes in. The other police officers are there ready to come in when he gives them the signal. But the police officers don't ordinarily go through this dry run that they had here with the confidential informer.",
  "You are talking about the main role of police is get a warrant, except -- and I think the Court has said a number of times to make this search reasonable, the police have to get a warrant if you want to interject the judicial between police and the person in jeopardy. So the main rule is warrant unless -- and then you have exceptions, but I think your point is that there is a main rule.",
  "This Court has gotten from the Constitution?",
  "Get a warrant if you can.",
  "Even if there is such a thing as citizen's arrest, I think it was part of this record that -- that they do not want confidential informers to go making arrests, so that the police distinguish the confidential informer.",
  "But going back to why should we decide this question, particularly in Fourth Amendment cases when these issues will come up on suppression motions, so there isn't a need to decide them in the -- in the civil context.",
  "Mr. Lannet, there - - there is one significant difference, I think, between - - the-- in Apprendi it doesn't matter whether the State labels something a \"sentencing factor\" or an \"element.\" Every one of those questions that goes into determining the maximum length of a sentence has to go to a jury under Apprendi. But when it comes to consecutive versus concurrent, it's perfectly okay if a State says, our main rule is consecutive, but the judge, if there are certain mitigating factors, can make it concurrent. Or it leaves the total things to the discretion of the judge. And if we are looking at it from the point of view of a defendant, the State says, well, we are not going to make it totally discretionary because we want to be more defendant-friendly; that is, we are putting certain restraints on the judge. So it seems -- what seems odd to me about this case is the Sixth Amendment is supposed to protect the defendant's right. And here the State is saying, we want to give the defendant more of a right. And he can say, that's unconstitutional, but if you give me less of a right, it would be perfectly constitutional. It's that enigma that I think is very disturbing about this case.",
  "Mr. Lannet, if we agree with your position and let's say you are engaged by the Oregon legislature and they say to you: We don't want to make this just be the judge's discretion alone, what can we do to achieve Constitution of what we were trying to achieve, that is to say encourage as the main rule but -- that is, if we have to leave it to the judge's discretion but we want to rein in that discretion so that you don't have arbitrary differences going from one judge to another? They want -- they want to say, yeah, we wanted this to be discretionary with the judge, but we want to install certain controls so that the trial judges will be operating more or less uniformly. How could they do that constitutionally?",
  "The juries are find - - that's what is going on now, the juries are part of this trial of guilt?",
  "Which is it? Do they do it in the guilt trial or leave that up to the judge?",
  "Where -- where a defense attorney might not want all of that stuff to come out.",
  "It held as far as the State constitution went, this is fine. It's only the Federal Constitution that stops the legislature from doing this.",
  "One way of -- if you are right about the application of Apprendi -- the Oregon legislature could say as a main rule is we leave it to the judge's discretion. However, before the judge makes a sentence consecutive, the judge should take account of the following factors. That would be okay?",
  "I thought there was - - that there was this -- there were three possibilities, and one was that the defendant didn't do anything before, didn't do anything during, but was simply an accessory after the fact. If the jury believed that, then there was no way it could convict him of the crime that he was convicted of.",
  "How do we know that? Was there a special verdict?",
  "How do we -- in this - - how do we know what the jury found? They just came in with a guilty verdict; is that right?",
  "The district court didn't say that.",
  "So if we were to say, Ninth Circuit, you were wrong, but the district court was right - -",
  "That's what the district judge did, right?",
  "It could just review the district court's decision using the standards that the district court used?",
  "I wasn't questioning that. The issue, is the United States position say structural error was wrong, harmless error was right, and then just have the Ninth Circuit review the district court's decision that held that there was harmless error the way it would ordinarily review a district court decision?",
  "But the question is knowledge of what. And I thought it is now recognized that in this State you have to know not just that a crime -- you have to know in this case of the potential for a homicide.",
  "This is -- the prosecutor's charge -- the prosecutor's charge was just filled with the suggestion that as long as it was a crime, that was sufficient. I don't find that what you've said is an accurate description of the charge - -",
  "-- of the prosecutor's summation.",
  "What about the instruction that follows the hypothetical, first the statement that the person gets assaulted, gets killed, in for a dime, in for a dollar? The law in the State of Washington says if you're in for a dime you're in for a dollar; if you're there or even if you're not there and you're helping in some fashion to bring about this crime, you are just as guilty, in some fashion. And that was tied in to the person who thought he was assisting in assault and it turns out that the victim got killed.",
  "But what about the statement I just read, that the law of the State is you don't even have to be there if you're helping in some fashion.",
  "Yes. It's in the same paragraph, the paragraph with the example of the accomplice who is - -",
  "No. This is in the summation.",
  "What about the appellate court? I mean, the first time around the appellate court was as mixed up, more so perhaps, than the prosecutor.",
  "Because the appellate court the first time got it wrong and it thought it was enough that the defendant knew that a crime was likely to be committed, not the crime, crime specified in the indictment, not -- not murder one, attempted murder, et cetera, just a crime. And the second time around that appellate court said, yeah, we got it wrong, now we know we got it wrong because there has been an intervening decision of the State's supreme court clarifying it. But what the prosecutor said, at least as I read it, more than once is exactly what the intermediate appellate court said the first time around: Said he didn't have to know that there was going to be a shooting.",
  "They say, the court itself said: We got it wrong. We said go away appellant because you knew that a crime was likely to be committed.",
  "Maybe so. Let's go to the third question, when the jury asks: \"When a person willingly participates in a group activity, is that person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the group?\"",
  "How could the jury better express its puzzlement? It wanted to know, if someone participates in a group, but did not -- that that person is -- is an accomplice to any crime by anyone?",
  "And the -- the counsel for the defense says, tell them no.",
  "It says \"a group activity.\" When a person willingly participates in \"a group activity,\" is that person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the group? I don't think there is any ambiguity in that question.",
  "They didn't get an answer. They were told to read an instruction that they had been told three times to read and obviously didn't understand.",
  "But we already know that many people, prosecutors, justices, misunderstood this \"a crime.\" Was it \"a crime,\" or \"any crime.\" Or \"the crime\"? So I think you can't avoid the confusing nature of the statute and the charge, which repeated the statute. It doesn't get clarified until the Washington Supreme Court says it means \"the crime,\" not \"a crime,\" and not \"any crime.\"",
  "They didn't say anything at all about Mr. Reyes. They asked the question about an accomplice, a crime.",
  "Mr. Waxman - -",
  "It didn't say -- it didn't say IV across the board. It said IV push is the claim, and that was -- as I understand this, the FDA was aware of the IV use and a certain risk. But did it ever, ever discreetly consider IV push versus IV administered the usual way by a drip bag?",
  "But that doesn't answer the question of was it -- the risk of gangrene and amputation is there. No matter what benefit there was, how could the benefit outweigh that substantial risk?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, at the outset, would you clarify something that is central, I think, to this case? Some of the briefs tell us that this represents a change of policy on the part of the FDA, that in fact the FDA once approved and said torts were -- tort suits were a helpful adjunct to the FDA's own efforts to protect consumers. They helped because they prodded manufacturers to -- to disclose risks that were either unknown or under- evaluated. Was that once the FDA's policy; and, if so, when did it change?",
  "But why is that -- why is that likely, considering the huge number of drugs? I mean, one figure said that there are 11,000 drugs that have this approval. Is the FDA really monitoring every one of those to see if there is some new information that should change the label?",
  "What -- can you turn to the references that Mr. Waxman and Mr. Kneedler made? They said oh, yes, IV push was considered discretely from IV drip bags.",
  "But we're told that that -- that effort was ridden -- ridden with mistakes. So could you have, under your definition, a tribe that is recognized relatively recently, whether it is about 16, but that was, in fact, a tribe in 1934; that is, the - - although it wasn't formally recognized until later, it was, in fact, a tribe in 1934?",
  "As you read the statute, Ms. Maynard, the words \"now under Federal jurisdiction\" could be deleted and the statute would mean the same thing that you're urging. So what do the words \"now under Federal jurisdiction\" add?",
  "How did it get to be recognized? I thought the recognition reflects that it's had a history going way, way back?",
  "But does it get at any speech other than union speech? I mean you say, yes, it is content-based, but it's viewpoint neutral. But it seems that what is banned by the statute is union speech. Is any other organization affected? Does the ban affect any other organization? Isn't it simply union speech that's at stake?",
  "But, in practice, is there any other application?",
  "But I thought your whole argument was that the counties are simply instrumentalities of the State, and the State has full power over them. It chooses to delegate to them autonomy, but it holds the control rein. And now you're saying no, that the Federal Government can give the State local-unit authority that the State, itself, chooses not to give. And you say that's beyond cavil. I really don't understand your argument.",
  "Well, if the State wants to, it's because it can exercise a heavy hand and control its local units, but if it wants to give the local units discretion, then it has to leave it to the local units whether or not they want to enact such a ban. That's your position?",
  "My question really is, if you look at this at the most basic level, we have two important concessions. You don't question the constitutionality of the ban as to State employees. And the other side doesn't question that it is unconstitutional as to private employees. So here we have State local employees. Do we bracket them with with State employees or with private employees as essential - -",
  "Isn't there -- isn't there some State tax money that goes to fund local units? I mean, you say here there are State taxpayers' funds involved; therefore the State doesn't have to pay for what it doesn't want to buy. But are there State funds that fund local government entities?",
  "Mr. Stewart, we're reviewing a decision of the Federal Circuit. And the Federal Circuit relied dominantly on the Florida Power case in which the same issue was presented, albeit under a different statute. But I -- reading that Florida Power, where the Federal Circuit adopted the Government's position, the Government's position then was that this very same transaction involved the rendition of services and not a sale of goods. Does the Government have a distinction between those two cases, or are you now saying in hindsight you realized that the position that you took before the Federal Circuit in the early case was wrong?",
  "Wasn't the Commission - - the Commission asked the Second Circuit, said: We've changed our policy; we want you to remand the case to the Commission so the Commission can explain what its new policy. I mean, isn't that how this whole thing arose? The case was in the Second Circuit and the Commission said it wanted to have an opportunity to explain its position more fully?",
  "One of the problems is that, seeing it in operation, there seems to be no rhyme or reason for some of the decisions that the Commission has made. I mean, the \"Saving Private Ryan\" case was filled with expletives, and yet the film about jazz history, the words were considered a violation of the Commission's policies. So that there seems to be very little rhyme or reason to when the Commission says that one of these words is okay and when it says it isn't.",
  "Are there only those two words in the FCC's new policy or are there other words on the list?",
  "How are the contemporary community standards determined in this context? Does the FCC survey any particular audience to find out what their standards are?",
  "That was before the Internet. Pacifica was in 1978.",
  "Wasn't there a different word? Wasn't there a euphemism in the script? I thought there was a euphemism in the script.",
  "Because you had gone from Pacifica until 2004 with a different policy, where this kind of thing would have been okay?",
  "Remind me about that, because there was -- the statement that the networks don't do this at all at the time of Action for Children's Television, the fight was, was it going to be from midnight 'til whatever it was. The networks wanted more hours for adult viewing. They said the only hours that the Commission gave them were hours when most everybody is asleep.",
  "May I just ask one question? It's about the bottom line of your brief. This whole argument has an air of really futility, because the Second Circuit more than tipped its hand when it said: And even as they gave a reasoned explanation, we have grave doubts whether this would be constitutional. You suggested in your brief a remand for briefing and a hearing in the Second Circuit on the constitutional issue. So, is there a way that we can say, well, really, this issue that's before us now is ignoring the big elephant in the rule, room; we have to get to that anyway?",
  "Could that be -- could that be done without deciding this APA or are we forced to decide that?",
  "Mr. Phillips, this - - this is similar to the question that I asked General Garre. The Commission asked for a remand so it could provide a reasoned explanation. But you had or your clients had -- in their complaint they made an APA claim as well as a First Amendment claim, didn't they?",
  "Yes.",
  "Correct.",
  "Yes.",
  "You could have just done the First Amendment, but you -- you did put the APA into it.",
  "You have the F-Word in there too, and even Judge Leval says he didn't understand why that word should be on the list.",
  "In the background of this case, Mr. Goldstein, is that in fact he didn't know the first time that his appeal had been dismissed. He didn't know that his lawyer had filed an Anders brief. But when he found that out, he waited some four and a half years. So why isn't the -- Texas right when it says look at (B) and (D), they would have fit his case? He could have used those to get time starting from the date that he found out. It wouldn't give him four and a half years. But why -- you say we, all we have to consider is (A); you said that in answer to Justice Kennedy. But why shouldn't we say that either (B) or (D) fits his case?",
  "May I ask if laches is something that the Texas court could bring up on its own, or is it for the State to raise or not as it chooses?",
  "Even though, as in this case, it turned out he found out within a year. But suppose he didn't find out for more than a year; that is, he didn't find out that -- that the appeal had been filed, and he didn't find out about the dismissal? So because either his counsel or the State blundered, he is out in the cold, and he can never present his direct - appeal claim.",
  "Mr. Goldstein just explained to us why those two provisions, the (b) and (d) would not work. That this - -",
  "And Texas could -- and Texas could have gone into the State court and said: Don't give him the direct review; he waited four and a half years after he -- but the State didn't ask for that.",
  "Justice could have -- not only, that don't some States have a limitation period when -- when he finds out that his appeal has been dismissed, without notice to him, aren't there some States, criminal justice systems, that say from the date that you had knowledge, you have X days to file?",
  "Why shouldn't the starting point be what this Court decided in the Fedorenko case? The wording of this provision is very close to the wording of that statute, much closer than the UN covenant that you have referred to.",
  "What would be -- what would be the minimum. You say the statute is clear. It requires some culpability, how would you verbalize what is the lowest standard that the Attorney General could impose to read statute to infuse in it some element of culpability?",
  "Mr. Katsas - -",
  "What -- what about the position that the displaced person's act was special to the Holocaust? I mean, we are dealing with people who said we were just following orders, and we did not want to grant those people asylum. Now in this post-World War II effort, we are engaged in an enterprise where other countries in the world -- and should we look to see how they are interpreting this notion of duress, coercion? Are they considering it irrelevant; would just look to see if the person in fact was provided some material assistance to persecution?",
  "What do you mean they were made all the time?",
  "This is creating -- this is creating a database. And what was the year of this prosecution?",
  "And back in 1979 we did not have the information-gathering electronic capability that we now have. So what are we talking about? What kind of database? How would it operate? Would you - -",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, you have, it seems to me, a theory of this case that is not the theory that the Ninth Circuit went on. I mean, the Ninth Circuit talks about training and supervising deputy district attorneys. And why do we train them? Because we want to ensure that they share information. Now you are cutting out the training and supervision, and you are saying the obligation of the supervising attorney is to have this information bank, which the deputy attorneys can then -- then consult, which, may be a very sound policy. But is it an element of due process that the supervising attorney has to devise a system to share information? Where is there anything -- anything that the Court has held that suggests that there is a data collection function required by due process?",
  "And there is nothing in the Ninth Circuit -- there was nothing that was presented to the Ninth Circuit by Mr. Goldstein that had to do with this talk about training?",
  "But the bottom line would be, if you are right, that every district attorney in the country, large or small office, would have to have a data bank that can be shared by all prosecutors, informants that are used. That would be the constitutional requirement for every supervising prosecutor in the land.",
  "What was the sentence for that?",
  "But he didn't get any extra jail time?",
  "Mr. Roberts, wouldn't that be so of any crime? This is failure to report. Any crime, any -- an arrest for any crime has a certain risk that the arrestee is going to resist. Is there anything different, is anything greater, about this arrest for this kind of crime?",
  "That's what Mr. Hochman told us - -",
  "-- when I asked that question.",
  "But would the statute apply if -- say he is supposed to go in on the weekends. Instead, he goes out on a binge, and then he voluntarily comes in on a Monday morning saying, yes, I failed to report, and so here I am.",
  "The distinction between this crime and crimes in general is that this person has shown that he or she doesn't want to go back into custody, is that - -",
  "There is -- there was, this case comes to us from the Seventh Circuit, right?",
  "And am I correct in understanding that since this case was decided, the Seventh Circuit has changed its position and has gone the other way?",
  "The first time around, didn't one of the judges suggest that there ought to be a study comparing the frequency of violence in escapes from custody to the frequency of violence in failure to report, and isn't that what we now have from the Sentencing Commission?",
  "I thought he did this four times. I thought there were four.",
  "Well, then why -- why isn't it an adequate substitute to say that, if the defendant wants this testimony, the defendant can call the analyst and cross-examine the analyst as an adverse witness?",
  "But you would say that what they call the notice-and-demand type statute, that that's all right?",
  "May I -- may I just ask, you would extend this to a -- a breath test, a blood test, fingerprints, urinalysis? All of those would be covered by your position?",
  "And you answered the question that a supervisor wouldn't be an adequate substitute for the analyst. But suppose the lab says: We are very busy in this place; could we schedule a deposition; we'll present the analyst at a time mutually agreeable to both sides, rather than have the analyst on the hook to show up on a trial date?",
  "But only if the analyst wasn't there on the day of trial?",
  "Then you're predicting that grind to a halt, but there are going to be a large number that wash out because they are plea bargained. So they won't get into the picture at all. There will probably be a goodly number in which defense counsel will stipulate that the drug quantity -- the drug type was such and such and quantity such and such. So you don't know in how many cases the defendant would take advantage of this confrontation right?",
  "Well, maybe if you were just -- if you were just putting in the machine, the raw information from the machine. But here what speaks is the certification by the analyst, so you don't have simply a machine-generated result; you have a human person who seems to be testifying: I certify that this is an accurate report.",
  "The suggestion was that Congress may have wanted to give an incentive to States to have special domestic violence statutes instead of punishing domestic abusers under a generic battery statute.",
  "Wasn't the -- wasn't the statute responding to just that problem, that domestic abuse tended to be charged as misdemeanors rather than felonies? And it was that fact that the Senator was responding to when he included misdemeanor. The whole purpose of this was to make a misdemeanor battery count for the statute's purpose.",
  "I thought it was that the use of force -- to make it clear is a misdemeanor -- had to involve a use of force, and that wasn't clear before, right?",
  "What sense would it make for Congress to say take two abusers? The conduct is identical. And in state A there is one consequence to bar on the possession of guns, and state B there isn't for the identical conduct, why would Congress want these two different results?",
  "But suppose this statute, the one that was enacted, had the word \"if\" before \"committed.\" Would that then convey the meaning that the Government is urging? Has as an element use of force, comma, \"if\" committed.",
  "\"If committed\" would break from \"use of force.\" The element is the use of force, but then the crime would have to have been committed by a current or former spouse; so wouldn't an \"if\" separate what is the element, that is, use of force?",
  "But if -- counsel advising Mr. Hayes surely would have looked at what was the uniform position in all the circuits. All the circuits that had this question before the floor read it the way the Government is urging. So counsel I think would have been highly irresponsible to advise Mr. Hayes that he would be home free, simply because his own State didn't have a separate domestic violence statute.",
  "I didn't hear the -- the last part.",
  "But the Virginia Supreme Court, on habeas, said we are going to accept as true all the facts as the Petitioner alleged them. They said specifically \"all facts alleged in the petition will be taken as true.\"",
  "They said they did.",
  "I don't get the diligence part because the whole ineffective assistance of counsel is the client isn't expected to do any of this; it's counsel that's been ineffective.",
  "So, it doesn't translate into ineffective assistance of counsel because the client is not the one -- the lawyer has been -- has not been diligent, but there is nothing that the client could do. I just don't see how - -",
  "-- how you could talk about the diligent -- the diligent client bringing up the ineffectiveness of his lawyer.",
  "But you use the -- to say that it's a new claim, because that's what it has to be, right, but it's such an extraordinary use of \"claim.\" I mean, we have exhibit cases, the notion is a claim, is a tort claim or a contract claim, but not additional evidence in support of the basic claim. The basic claim is ineffective assistance of counsel.",
  "I that what it was saying is there is legitimate -- this is a Strickland question. Strickland has two parts. Part A is were counsel inadequate; and Part B is did it make any difference? It seemed to me the district court was just making a straight out Strickland determination and not deferring to anything else. It was just saying no, I've looked at all the evidence, and yes -- they certainly were -- they were not effective. On the other hand, there is no prejudice because using the strict Strickland test, there was no reasonable likelihood that a jury would have come out differently.",
  "Well, what about the point that Mr. Bress made that there wasn't enough time in the Virginia Supreme Court on habeas to develop everything that was later put before the district court; that there was a very short time to get the petition in, and there were many issues other than ineffective assistance of counsel?",
  "I think she said - -",
  "-- she answered -- the answer that I wrote is the same thing that you could have on the Brady claim you could also have for ineffective assistance of counsel. It's a wholly new matter. I thought that's what she said.",
  "Before we get -- before we get away from the Government, the Establishment Clause, you said, well, Van Orden answered that, but did it? Because you don't have here a 40-year history of this monument being there, and nobody seems to be troubled by it.",
  "In the context of all other lawgivers. This is a stand-alone Ten Commandments and you don't see, I don't think, anywhere \"I am the Lord thy God.\" That's not shown.",
  "Yes.",
  "If that -- if we accept that there is Government speech, I think Justice Souter's question is isn't this really the Government endorsement of the Eagles' message? I mean, the Eagles are all over this monument, their symbol of the eagle, and the Eagles want it to be known that this is their monument. Indeed, I think in Van Orden wasn't the -- in the district court there, wasn't the statement, well, this -- Texas did this in recognition of the good work that the Eagles do in preventing -- - help try to prevent juvenile delinquency.",
  "Can we go back to -- your basic premise is this is a public forum, in any and all instances; and we do have, certainly in the speech area, demonstration area, from time immemorial public parks have been places where people can speak their minds. But I don't know of any tradition that says people can come to the park with monuments and put them up if they will, so long as they meet the equivalent of time, place and manner. So you're making an assumption that from time immemorial, monuments, just like speeches, can be presented by anyone who wants to.",
  "Are you taking this line because you say if the city council votes for it, then the voters can know those people voted to put up the Ten Commandments; we don't like that; so we are going to vote them out? Is that -- what underlies this notion that it isn't good enough for them to approve the placement of the monument, but it has to be some kind of formal declaration?",
  "But here it wasn't.",
  "Here we are dealing with claims that the union said: Sorry, we are not going to process these claims because we have some tension since the younger workers that replaced you, we also represent them. So you are proposing, as far as I understand it, a situation where these workers would have no individual right at all if the union says: We -- we won't represent you.",
  "Where does -- where does the contract say anything about the -- the individual succeeding to whatever arrangement there is between the union and the employer?",
  "I thought that only - - only the union can invoke the arbitration clause, not an individual.",
  "But the union could not bargain about these anti-discrimination rights. These are rights given to individuals by Congress. The union couldn't bargain about them the way it bargains about collective rights, the way it bargains about wages and hours and -- and other things. This is, this is not a bargainable right. This is a right Congress says you as an individual have a right not to be discriminated against. This is nothing that the union can bargain about.",
  "And nonmembers, too? What about the people who -- who are not members of the union, but they have to pay an equivalent amount for the union's services in collective bargaining? They would be bound as well? They couldn't - -",
  "You said -- the -- fine. I -- I grasp your answer to that. But you said that the employee would have the absolute right if the union says, \"sorry, for whatever reason we can't represent you,\" absolute right to that arbitral forum. What -- who pays then? I mean, if the union is in it, then the union and the employer are going to split -- split the cost. But what happens when the union drops out and you have the individual and the employer in this arbitral forum?",
  "Mr. Salvatore, would you just clarify something for me? I thought that the union ceded its rights to the employees and said that they could use this collective bargaining agreement's arbitral regime so long as they paid for it. But you tell me they don't have to pay anything; the employer pays everything.",
  "What about - -",
  "-- if it's not a statutory right; it's just a wrongful discharge? One practical problem is so often these are overlapping claims. You can say, \"I was discriminated against before because of my age. I was arbitrarily discriminated against. It was a wrongful discharge. It was a discharge without just cause.\" Usually, there's multiple claims that can be made, and some of them would be bargainable, I mean, would come under the union -- I mean if it was just a question of the worker says, \"I was discharged without just cause,\" no Title 7 or anything else, that would come under the arbitration clause, wouldn't it?",
  "What about the argument that you are -- if you win this case, you are subjecting the employee to a worse situation because the employer will simply say: Fine, I don't have to bargain anything with the union. If you want to work in this workplace, you sign an arbitration agreement that says you have no access to the court, and you have to -- just like in Gilmer, just like in Circuit City.",
  "Mr. Salvatore, would you straighten out this business it seems about who pays? Mr. Frederick said that 50 percent would have to be paid by the employee. If the union bows out and there is just the employer and the employee in the arbitration, that employee would have to pick up 50 percent. I think I understood him to say that.",
  "What page did you -- did you reference?",
  "If the -- if the idea is that the union sees this right to the worker, then doesn't have to -- doesn't the burden go with the right as well? I mean, the -- if the union would pay, you're saying that the employer will just accept that the employer picks up the entire tab?",
  "In all those -- in all those cases has the Special Master ever called a court's witness, that is a court's expert, appointed a court's expert, and if so what is the pay rate for such a witness? I mean, courts of the United States, district courts, occasionally appoint witnesses, court witnesses as distinguished from party's witnesses. Do you know if that's happened in Special Master situations?",
  "Do you know whether any other -- you didn't know, in answer to my last question, what the practice had been, but with respect to expert fees in other original jurisdiction cases, has the Court ever deviated from the $40 or when it was $30, $30?",
  "But have they ever approved a Special Master's recommendation of a rate for the expert witness that deviates from the $40?",
  "Do you know -- do you know whether there were expert witnesses in that case?",
  "Isn't it -- isn't it customary for it to be divided 50/50? I mean, we periodically will approve the fees that the special master charges and then they are divided between the parties. And I thought that they were divided 50/50. Is that not so?",
  "But we don't know -- - General Suthers, do we know what has happened in past original jurisdiction cases? Maybe it hasn't come up because other special masters have said, we'll give the expert witness a reasonable fee for services commensurate with the qualifications and the work that the expert has done. We don't know if that has or hasn't happened in the past, do we?",
  "Did you find any cases where the special master had appointed his own witness as distinguished from the parties?",
  "But you -- but you recognize that if a special master appointed a witness, or the court, that that witness would be paid a compensatory fee?",
  "Now, in a -- in a case like this one, where the nature of the work that the expert did seemed to be very helpful to both sides, isn't it odd that the special master chose the court expert, that expert would be compensated fairly but if you have one party calls an expert who renders great service to the Court, to both sides, doesn't get compensated? Isn't that an anomaly?",
  "Parties pay a lot -- a lot of expenses and then they may be -- may or not be reimbursed to the prevailing party; but the prevailing party in our system certainly doesn't get anything like the full cost of the litigation.",
  "But the Constitution uses the word \"judge.\" A \"judge of the United States\" is a Supreme Court Justice or a judge of an inferior court.",
  "Could you raise the podium?",
  "But we can hear you.",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, I follow your argument entirely, and then in the civil rights area there are a lot of overlapping statutes. You can sue under Title VII. It doesn't take away your right under 1981. But in this case, as we get down to what this case is about, we have a determination by a court that the school district acted reasonably in relation to these complaints. And then you say: But we have constitutional claim. A constitutional claim requires you to show deliberate, intentional conduct if it's an individual; if you are talking about an institution, some kind of not just one incident, but a custom, a pattern. What, when you get down to the merits, is different about those? In other words, is it on the wrong track to talk about precluding a statute? Instead of talking about just plain old issue preclusion, what is different about 1983? Yes, you have two claims; but if you lose under IX, you are going to lose under 1983 as well.",
  "What more? What more is alleged in the complaint? I thought the complaint just spoke about deliberate indifference.",
  "Spell that out -- spell that out practically. I know you used - -",
  "But there was no allegation at all of that kind in this complaint.",
  "I still don't follow. What disparate treatment? Did you have to have that they treated girl's complaints one way and boy's complaints another way?",
  "And as far as this record shows, there has just been this one incident of harassment.",
  "But we find that out on remand.",
  "What you're saying is they made a basic legal error.",
  "You may have a losing case under 1983, but let the First Circuit decide that?",
  "Well, because they were relying on case where we did say that a very detailed scheme was pre-emptive?",
  "It did that because if you could use 1983, then the very elaborate mechanism that Congress had set up, who would use it?",
  "Just on that one issue on attorneys' fees.",
  "Have there been any decisions on Title VI and 1983?",
  "And those constitutional rights have negated -- I think it might be -- it's at least arguable that it would be harder to win a 1983 case, given that, as to the individual, you have qualified immunity, and, as to the institution, you have to show a custom or practice.",
  "It would be a different claim, but there would be issue preclusion.",
  "And the official -- it's the plaintiff who would be precluded.",
  "And the plaintiff has had a full and fair opportunity to argue those issues.",
  "Would you go over that again? I didn't understand it. You said Title IX provides - -",
  "-- against sex discrimination than the Constitution does.",
  "Explain that to me.",
  "Give me an example.",
  "And what would the standard be under 1983?",
  "But they didn't go on the issue of preclusion. If they had done that, it would be a different case. They said that Title IX is preemptive of 1983. And they cited the cases where -- like Smith against Robinson where that is what the Court held.",
  "But you -- you must, I think, recognize that the elaborate scheme that Congress set up under the Education of the Handicapped Act is quite different from what this Court did. It just said there is a private right -- right of action. There is an implied private right of action. It didn't set up any administrative mechanism. It didn't set up any regime for going to - - to an agency first and then coming to the court, none of that.",
  "Do you have any case in all of Title IX that -- that fits that abstract picture that you have just described? I mean you have to have a pattern and practice of what -- a pattern and practice of discrimination -- to get -- to get under the Constitution or under 1983? You have to have deliberate indifference to what: To the gender harassment, to the gender discrimination? So can you describe to me that - - anything, any Title IX case, that has a disparate impact? We really didn't want a Feeney type of case. We really didn't want this to happen but we had a test, and it came out that way.",
  "Can you describe a Title IX case that's like Feeney in that respect where we didn't want this diverse impact to occur; we really didn't want it at all, but it happened?",
  "On the basis of gender.",
  "And Feeney says it wasn't on the basis of gender. It was on the basis that she wasn't a veteran.",
  "But there is -- you are leaving out something quite glaring in that respect. For example, single sex schools, military academies, admissions to elementary and high schools, are not covered by Title IX.",
  "Wouldn't your reasoning apply to, say, a race discrimination case in employment? We have got title VII and you have 1981. Title VII has a lot of accoutrements, a lot of text to go through; 1981 is plain and simple. So therefore, title VII ought to preempt 1981, right? So you -- in the area of race discrimination and employment, title VII would end any access to 1981. It would be the same kind of argument, wouldn't it?",
  "What does that have to got to do with what you are arguing is that if you have an elaborate mechanism, which you said you have under Title IX, I think that is debatable? But that was certainly the picture in Smith, and it's the picture in Title VII, Title VII versus 1981. That -- that fits your -- the -- your description, Title VII and 1981, much better than Title IX and 1983, I think.",
  "There was no constitutional claim in -- what was it -- Palos Verdes.",
  "I thought you just said that a deliberate indifference under both statutes, under 1983 and Title IX.",
  "Then you wouldn't have gender discrimination.",
  "Response to what? Response - -",
  "So you wouldn't have - - if you work for a municipality and your boss has been harassing you, you would not have a case under 1983?",
  "You were saying the constitutional standard is different, so I am just giving you a case. It could be a school, it could be another municipal employment.",
  "The Second Circuit recognized that latter kind of taking account of costs disproportionate, more than the industry would bear, and they also recognized a cost comparison. If you have a cheaper method that is almost as good, you can use that and you don't have to use the one that will capture the extra fish. So everybody agrees that there is some consideration of cost. The question is how much, and the concern is, as Justice Souter says, that you are comparing things that aren't comparable.",
  "Does it make any difference - -",
  "You have the two labels: The BP, \"best practical,\" and then \"best available.\" And isn't it so that the best available technology, thinking of the Clean Air Act, what they call \"BAT,\" is considered the most technology-forcing standard and then there are lesser standards? But you seem to think that these can be - -",
  "So if it \"available to reduce\"? \"For minimizing\" is no stronger than if it had said \"available\" -- if it meant what you suggest, why didn't it read \"available to reduce\"?",
  "It's an ambiguity the government said it could live with. Now the government advised this Court not to grant cert in this case, isn't that so?",
  "That's not how it moves through the courts. That is, you don't have a forum. That sounds to me like a jurisdictional ruling. Those cases that say, our courts don't sit to hear cases where the parties are nonresidents, both sides; our courts don't sit to hear cases about accidents that happened in Timbuktu, those sound like, we don't offer a forum for that type of case, as distinguished from here, where New York does have a forum, it just won't kind of give one kind of relief.",
  "What Justice Kennedy has asked you: Say, you could have this Federal claim, but we are going to offer you a substitute under New York law, which the Federal authority could not force us to do, because it's a State waiving its sovereign immunity.",
  "Now, why can't New York take the position, we want to be realistic about these suits? New York has provided that it is going to - - it's going to pick up the tab. If you sue a correctional officer, New York is going to pick up the tab. So -- so we are going to channel this suit to the court, the one court in the State that deals with the State, the sovereign, paying money, the court of claims. So all they are doing is recognizing the reality that this is a suit against New York, not the correctional officer because it won't cost the correctional officer a dime; New York is going to provide counsel and is going to pay any judgment. So really where this case belongs is in the court that hears claims against the State of New York.",
  "Ms. Underwood, there is a feature of this case, even assuming that you were right about -- New York has not withdrawn jurisdiction from its courts over a 1983 claim; it has simply limited, taken away, one mode of relief. That is, you can sue a correctional official for declaratory relief, you could sue for injunctive relief. All New York has taken away is one mode of relief. That's not jurisdictional unless you say that every element of damages is jurisdictional. New York allows this type of claim in their courts. We are talking about jurisdiction over the person? Yes, they have jurisdiction over the correctional official's person. Subject matter - - subject matter is a 1983 case? Yes. All they are cutting off is one form of relief.",
  "Practically - - practically, hasn't what New York has done is to confer on its correctional officers absolute immunity, not merely qualified immunity? So if you want to be realistic about what is the effect of New York's law, it says you are going to be subject to equitable relief, declaratory relief, but as far as money is concerned, you are absolutely immune.",
  "What's the difference of -- practically?",
  "Isn't the -- isn't the practical effect -- if you tried to explain to correctional officers what is your exposure, you would say: You have absolute immunity from anything that's going to try to reach into your pocket.",
  "I thought the theory was that in our Federal system, Federal law is State law, too? That is the highest law for a State. Federal law by virtue of the Supremacy Clause is State law; and sometimes Congress creates an exclusive Federal jurisdiction over certain types of claims. But if Congress doesn't do that, the assumption is there is concurrent jurisdiction.",
  "I thought that in Testa the State said we are evenhanded, we don't bring -- we don't allow penal actions to be -- to be brought on the civil side of our court?",
  "Was there any substantive change from what the original enactment to the amendment -- the one that's currently enforced?",
  "Mr. Shapiro, we are dealing with a State supreme court, and our bottom line always reads \"for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\" And it was my understanding that a State court can resolve a case on an alternate State law ground, if there is such a ground in the case.",
  "Didn't -- did the Court -- suppose the -- what is it called -- \"correct in all respects\" had been raised and decided by the Oregon Supreme Court in the first instance. Suppose it had said, well, we don't have to deal with whether Instruction 34 was right or wrong in this particular, because it was wrong in other respects. Suppose that had been the first time around what the Oregon Supreme Court said. Would that have offended any Federal due process? Would that have been an appropriate disposition for the Oregon Supreme Court to make?",
  "How could we have determined it when the Oregon Supreme Court itself hadn't made any determination?",
  "But we don't decide questions, particularly questions of State law, that may have a Federal check. But we don't decide them in the first instance. And there's one point, Mr. Shapiro, that I think affects this concern of fairness to the parties who raised this \"correct in all respects\" from the beginning. This Court had not clarified, had it, until the Williams case itself, the rule about harm to others. In State Farm we were talking about harm to nonresidents. So if I recall correctly, Williams was the first time we ever clarified that harm to others included people within the same State; is that correct?",
  "I thought the notion was one issue, one charge. And it wasn't in just one practice manual. There were a few cited in the brief that the charge should be limited to one issue, one point of law.",
  "But I thought the whole thing about -- this is the NAACP case you that you were discussing?",
  "-- that this was something that the Alabama Supreme Court really sprung at the last minute, that it was not like this rule. There were not 28 cases in the Alabama Supreme Court applying the rule. It seemed to be quite a novel rule.",
  "She didn't get to the - - the other grounds, because I think it was all about that paragraph and whether that paragraph was adequate under our then precedent. And I don't think that -- that the -- the incorrect portions of the charge that have now - - are now before us were -- were even reached then.",
  "And where is this colloquy? I mean, we went through the parts, she said I think it's covered and it was okay. You seem to be saying more than ws included in that colloquy.",
  "You've made it much clearer than it was.",
  "You -- in answer to the Chief Justice, you are not suggesting that we should go ahead and decide the second question when there has been no briefing on it?",
  "Which portion of the charge specifically are you referring to?",
  "What about this point that was made that in 2002 that is exactly what Philip Morris did, give one simple, precise instruction?",
  "Is it -- is it true that they gave one simple sentence stating their position on -- on what harm to others, how that - -",
  "But -- but was the instruction stated in a -- in a single paragraph, but all the other requests to charge were broken out?",
  "Can we go back to the question that was just posed? We have never held that every agency -- agencies come in many sizes and shapes, but in all cases, the APA places the burden on the -- on the petitioner. But this Court has never held that across the board, no matter what agency we are talking about, that's the rule.",
  "But if the government has the obligation at the very first to tell the veteran what the veteran must produce to substantiate the claim and the government doesn't do that, why shouldn't it be the responsibility of the government to say to the court, \"this is what, if we had done what we were supposed to do, this is what we would have included in our notice.\" And looking at that, the court can tell whether there's anything the veteran might have done. But why shouldn't the government at least have the obligation to say what it would have done had it complied with the statute, what it would have said specifically in this case?",
  "What is the experience? When the case is remanded, it goes back to the -- does it go back to the regional? Suppose the -- the veteran is now given an opportunity to present whatever additional substantiation.",
  "Does the -- the notice can be given -- skipped entirely, as it was in Simmons case, or notice could be given but it's defective. It can be defective in a major way, it can leave out -- you said Congress recently required a more detailed notice. Do we treat all those like, as long as the notice doesn't measure up fully to their statutory requirement, then the veteran goes back to square one? And so, you wouldn't make any distinction between whether the notice was not given at all, and the case where the notice was given, but it was incomplete?",
  "Your case is one where the veteran did get what they call the first level notice.",
  "So Justice -- the implication of Justice Breyer's question is that your client would lose, because your client did get the first level notice and you say that that's not good enough.",
  "Do you know where this first level, second level -- I'm looking at the statute on page 98a of the petition. And it seems to me all part of one. It is one notice? It doesn't seem to specify a second and a third. It's describing the contents.",
  "\"As part of that notice, the Secretary shall indicate which portion of the information and evidence is to be provided by the claimant and which portion by the Secretary.\" The statute seems to be talking about one notice, not \"first level,\" \"second level.\"",
  "I thought that was taken out, the fourth one. No?",
  "And tell me what that is. It's not in the statute?",
  "I thought they asked to have the Ninth Circuit decision vacated. They didn't ask us to affirm it. They said vacate that decision is wrong.",
  "When this comes up, we usually, if a -- if a party abandons a position in support of a decision, the court of appeals decision, we have appointed -- as you noted in your brief, we have appointed a friend of the court to represent the position of the circuit. And here we don't have that. We don't have anyone that we have appointed and say you presented the position. You defend the position below.",
  "I don't understand what you just said. Judge Gould dissented. He said the Ninth Circuit majority was wrong. And you're urging us to accept Judge Gould's position.",
  "How can we do that without saying that the majority was wrong?",
  "The Ninth Circuit had a precedent that it thought it was following. Was it Anaheim?",
  "So isn't it important that if you think that they were wrong and we agree with you, that we get -- not just vacate but say you were wrong on the law; you were wrong in this case, and you were wrong in Anaheim. And then the Ninth Circuit will not follow those decisions anymore.",
  "But it was -- it was decided. It was decided -- wasn't it decided the first time around? I mean, the Chief Justice calls your attention to page 25a. The reason the court said they're not Brady material -- we said it before, we said it the last time the case was before the court.",
  "If it is - -",
  "But your proposal would be that they would never do it because you want to send it back to the Federal district court, and it's -- and if the State was laboring under misapprehension, it thought that, because he brought up the issue twice, he had somehow been defaulted, everyone can agree that that didn't make sense. But now you're proposing that the State court will not be the one to look at these materials; instead it will be the Federal court. I think there was something that Judge Merritt said in his dissent that indicated he thought that the State court ought to be the one to do this close examination. Didn't -- didn't he propose a stay of the Brady claim in the Federal court pending exhaustion of that claim in the State court?",
  "Where is that colloquy? I remember witnesses saying he looked weird, he looked wild-eyed. Where was the answer that he looked - -",
  "You recognize that a -- a defense like this, that the defendant was high on drugs, that isn't ambivalent? I mean, a jury, just like it might react adversely to the defendant if he says I was drunk on alcohol, that they might say this is a person who put himself in this condition where his will could be overpowered, this is a voluntary act, why should we consider it, why should we consider it mitigating, we - - we could just as well consider it aggravating?",
  "But what about the prosecutor who said \"baloney.\" He said the prosecutor -- the prosecutor says: The defendant tells you he was a drug user. Baloney, he was a drug dealer. The prosecutor deliberately tried to paint this man as somebody who had a huge quantity of drugs, which he did, and he was dealing in them. I mean the - - the prosecutor tried to portray a man who was a cold - blooded killer, who didn't have any blurred vision. And that line to the jury, \"baloney\" -- he says he was a drug user -- that, it seems to me, is exactly what the prosecutor wanted to do, which is to tell this jury this guy's a dealer; he's not a drug abuser.",
  "Spell out the waiver in light of what he said. The first time he learns that these -- cases, other cases cited and he has access to the district attorney's file, he then files a habeas, State habeas petition in which he said that the facts on which his Brady claim rests have been revealed through disclosure of the State's files which occurred after the first conviction proceeding. Those words are in the affidavit -- right -- that came with the second petition. So how could he possibly have waived this when he has explained it wasn't available to him?",
  "Then you're doing away with the first Terry factor altogether. Do you think all you need is reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous? What happened to the reasonable suspicion that a crime has just been committed or is in the course of being committed?",
  "Then you are doing away with the first Terry factor. There are two factors recognized: One, reasonable, articulable suspicion that a crime is afoot; and two, this person is reasonably suspected of being armed and dangerous. Your answer to Justice Souter suggests that you don't need the first one, you don't need to have any suspicion that a crime is afoot; it's enough that you reasonably suspect that the person is armed and dangerous.",
  "But Officer Trevizo herself testified that she thought the seizure part was over. She asked him would he get out of the car, and then she said -- I think she used the word \"consensual\" herself, that it was a consensual encounter.",
  "That after the initial seizure was over, and then she wanted to question him about gang, his gang affiliations -- and didn't she testify? I seem to remember she did, and she said it was voluntary.",
  "When -- when did this end? You just said -- you said when the car is stopped everyone is seized, the driver and the passengers as well. The seizure ends at some point. Is that when the driver is ticketed and the police cruise off or - -",
  "Then how did the -- how did the officer come up with the marijuana as well as the gun?",
  "But you say -- your brief goes much, much further. And I'm looking at page 9 where you say: \"Police have to be able to protect the officer's safety from a person reasonably believed to be armed and dangerous whenever the officer encounters that person in a place where the officer has a lawful right to be.\" I read that to mean if the law -- the officer is on the street, in a pub, any place where he has a lawful right to be, that officer can, on the basis of a suspicion of armed and dangerous, pat down, and you don't need the first Terry. It's only -- it's only the armed and dangerous.",
  "But that's not -- Mr. Parkhurst said in his opening that the traffic stop is the equivalent of the articulable suspicion that a crime is the equivalent of the articulable suspicion that a crime is afoot. It justifies this stop, and then you have to have something further to justify the pat down, but the car, the seizure of the car and its passengers, that is the equivalent of the first Terry. And why isn't that so? It's a stop; it's a legitimate stop.",
  "And then don't you lose under that line of cases? This is the picture that the officer was painting, or I thought was, to bring this within the \"Mind if I search your luggage\" category of cases.",
  "So -- she's got consent. She doesn't have to -- she says, he said okay, he would get out and talk to me; he said okay when I began to pat him down; it's only in the middle of it he began to wriggle a little bit.",
  "How could he not be dangerous? First, she said: I suspected him because he was looking behind, but -- and then she said he was wearing the clothes of a gang, and then he admits to having been convicted of a burglary. Why isn't it very normal for a person to be apprehensive?",
  "General Garre, will you clarify one point? You said \"fails to state\" enough to overcome qualified immunity. But, usually, these -- the pleading is analyzed discretely. This is a 12(b)(6) motion, is it?",
  "And so that tests just the pleading. Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense which hasn't even been stated formally. So isn't it entirely conceivable that you could have a good complaint judged from the 12(b)(6) point of view, but when the qualified immunity defense is asserted, the plaintiff isn't able to come up with enough to stave off a summary judgment motion?",
  "General Garre, I think that the Bell Atlantic case -- and -- and I'm sure that Justice Souter will correct me if I'm wrong about this, but most of it is about what it takes -- what are the essential elements of a Sherman section 1 charge. And there's a big mistake that the pleaders are making; that is, there has to be an agreement, and they haven't alleged an agreement. This case seems to be quite different. And I think you have taken Bell Atlantic, frankly, for more than is there. That is, twice -- at least twice in the opinion, the Court says, we are not developing any heightened pleading rules. Form 11 is as good today as it was yesterday. What we are talking about is a missing -- is an essential element to a substantive claim for relief. I thought that's what --",
  "How about --",
  "How about Rule 11 to take care of Justice Breyer's problem? The judge would say to the lawyer: Now, you signed this pleading, and when you made -- you signed it, you made certain representations, and I'm going to read the Riot Act to you if it turns out that this is a frivolous petition.",
  "I was responding to Justice Breyer's Coca-Cola president. I think Rule 11 would work quite well to answer that.",
  "General Garre, there was a reference, I think, in Judge Gleason's decision in the Eastern District to the Office of the Inspector General report on the detainees' treatment at the Metropolitan Detention Center. Is there nothing in those reports that lends some plausibility to Iqbal's claims?",
  "Is there other litigation, General Garre, pending with respect to the detentions?",
  "Is there -- is there a Tort Claims Act action pending or -- I don't know where I got that impression -- arising out of these detentions?",
  "Are you suggesting General Garre's statement he just made to us -- he said there's nothing in the Office of the Inspector General's report that suggests that the Attorney General or the head of the FBI were engaged in any wrongdoing?",
  "What is the statute of limitations that would apply?",
  "You have -- you have not had discovery from the Attorney General or --",
  "So --",
  "So it's -- it's as though discovery with respect to those two defendants was stayed pending your discovery from the lower level defendants?",
  "Has it?",
  "Wasn't it limited to people who were already indicted on other charges?",
  "We're not dealing with the universe of men who are of a certain national origin; we are dealing with only ones who were incarcerated for an offense that has nothing to do with terrorism.",
  "But it -- it did happen? At least it did --",
  "But at the time -- at the time of the original reduction of credits, was there any right claimed that any of these women had? I mean, nothing had happened to them except there was a bookkeeping entry. They wouldn't be hurt until they sought retirement or sought some other benefit that increased seniority would give them. But could they have come into court just from, on the books of AT&T, they were docked X number of days? Nothing has happened as a consequence of that.",
  "But it hadn't been applied in any of those situations yet. At -- at the -- at the point when the person returns from leave and is docked a certain number of days, it hasn't been applied to any of the situations you mentioned. I grant you the case would be totally ripe if there was a better job to bid for, if there was an early retirement opportunity. But here there was nothing -- nothing to be done.",
  "But you -- you have to, I think, recognize that there's a big difference between Evans, who was told, goodbye, you got married, you have to resign -- a definite act that had immediate consequences -- and this, where there -- there is a potential for future consequences but no immediate consequence of the kind that existed in your model case, Evans.",
  "But that was when Gilbert was prevailing. Certainly, we would not regard it that way today.",
  "At that time, even --",
  "-- even more so. You -- you've said several times that it was perfectly legal, but isn't it true that the law in all of the circuits was the other way, and it wasn't until this Court decided the Gilbert case that the law changed? But if you were -- if you were an employer and you were advising a client in, say, 1975, look to see where the circuits were, the circuits said, yes, discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is surely discrimination on the basis of sex. It wasn't until this Court decided first the Aiello case and then Gilbert that -- that that law changed. But --",
  "Miss Blatt, that was not the position of the only representative of the United States in the Ninth Circuit, as far as I know, the EEOC, the brief in the Ninth Circuit. We don't hear from the EEOC in this Court, but I think it was not just that brief but in the EEOC manual, they are taking a position that is 180 degrees opposite yours. Am I right in --",
  "But this is not a situation like Evans, somebody who was out of the workforce for 4 years and then is going to come back and bump some people who -- who filled in while she was not working, and get that credit. This is quite different. This is just a question of weeks.",
  "That was -- that was coming back to work and having all of your seniority stripped. Is that --",
  "Mr. Russell, what do you say to Mr. Phillips' argument that you brought -- you brought essentially this case way back when, that the union said that this retirement plan is in violation of Title VII?",
  "Are you -- are you making a claim that they had the choice or that the claim wasn't ripe until they felt the impacts of it?",
  "The United States at some stage told the tribunal in The Hague that the Cubic judgment -- and now I'm quoting -- \"has nothing to do with matters before the international tribunal.\" \"Nothing to do with.\"",
  "There is no counterclaim stated before the tribunal as of this moment.",
  "There is no counterclaim in the case before the tribunal.",
  "Explain to me why it would effect the relief? Because suppose Iran doesn't get the proceeds of the Cubic judgment, but instead a creditor of Iran, in this case Elahi, a creditor gets it. It should still be -- you've paid the -- Iran's bill. Iran owes money to X. Why shouldn't the United States equally get the credit whether the Cubic judgment in the end is pocketed by Iran or by Iran's creditor, Elahi?",
  "Would you -- something that I would just like clarification on. You mentioned that the Cubic judgment is on appeal to the Ninth Circuit. It has been on appeal since June of '98?",
  "And there are cross appeals. What are the positions taken about that judgment by the respective sides, and why is it pending for ten years?",
  "Could -- let's assume that the -- that Iran is able to execute on the Cubic judgment. Could it take the proceeds out of the United States, given the 2007 blocking order?",
  "You mentioned -- you mentioned that there were other claimants or others - - others who would like to execute - -",
  "-- other lienors -- other attachments. And so, you said in the end -- well - - well, what would be the effect of those other liens?",
  "But that's not saying that. Isn't that -- that issue is moot?",
  "But if we -- if we took the position that you are expressing about what is at issue, we would never reach the second question.",
  "Do I understand correctly that that means that because it's a blocked asset, then Dr. Elahi can get it, but Iran itself couldn't get it?",
  "Yes.",
  "So why wouldn't the United States get credit for that, too, on the theory that I suggested before?",
  "It has nothing to do with matters before the - -",
  "Why not? I mean, the question I raised before, why wouldn't the United States be urging that it gets credit, whether Iran gets the money or whether the people who are creditors of Iran get the money. In either case, the United States should be able to have - -",
  "Mr. Phillips, one piece of -- I don't -- you have agreed that the United States could recoup from Iran the amount paid to the victims, including Dariush Elahi, including the 2.3 million. How would the United States go about recouping from Iran the money it has paid to the victims of Iran's terrorism?",
  "Yes. How would that work? How would -- how would the United States - -",
  "You said this is a one of a kind case. Are there no other victims who have successfully sued Iran?",
  "But you are including then -- suppose that the result of the federal habeas is that the State -- that relief is granted unless the State retries the defendant in X number of days. And your reading I think would be the appointed counsel on federal habeas would be responsible for representation in all available post-conviction process, and that would be an available post-conviction process.",
  "What would? Tell me, what would fall under \"all available post-conviction process\" in addition to clemency and competency proceedings?",
  "This goes back to my earlier question: So what else fits under \"all available post-conviction process\" other than competency and clemency? What else?",
  "Right. But what would be included?",
  "But all this is dependent upon the defendant is showing that he is financially unable to obtained adequate representation. And if he is in the State court, then that's the answer to it. It's the only when he isn't. And I thought in the clemency cases, particularly, there was no funds in State court.",
  "How could it be settled, because isn't it a fact that before 2002 if the primary purpose was disposing of waste that the 402 permit applied?",
  "So it's not in 30 years' experience, and when it was disposing of waste, it was under 402 until 2002.",
  "But in fact, was there ever a permit by the Corps of Engineers when the purpose was disposal of waste? Was there ever a 404 permit, rather than a 402, for disposal of what they call \"processed wastewater\" or \"wastewater\"?",
  "Weren't they then thinking of fill material as material that was used either to fill in, to reclaim land, or in a construction project? I mean, to call filling a lake, to call that a fill, when what it's doing is providing a disposal place for a mining operation, it's not what one ordinarily thinks of as a filling operation.",
  "There's one question that Justice Souter raised and before you sit down I would like to get your answer, and that is, can anything, any water of the United States that the Corps of Engineers decides is appropriate to be used as a disposal place, can any waterway be a settling pond? That is, here we have a lake. And is it just up to the Corps of Engineers? They say this is a settling pond, it's a settling pond?",
  "The definition that was adopted, if I have it right, was the EPA definition. That was the effect. And it was the Corps that had the purpose test. And yet, until 2002, if I understand correctly, if the only reason of raising the elevation of the lake was to dispose of waste, you didn't get a 404 permit. That was not a 404 situation until 2002.",
  "But in an application that never included filling a lake, raising the elevation of a lake simply for the purpose of disposing of waste.",
  "And how do we know that life will ever be restored? I mean, that's a guess. Nobody knows.",
  "-- your description of that effect? The other solution we were told would involve filling in a vast expanse of wetlands and then having these huge piles that could be seen by all the tourist boats.",
  "How about getting another jury? That was -- one of the reasons that counsel gave why he, counsel, was withdrawing the NGI plea was the jury had just found -- rejected the second-degree murder charge and found that he had acted deliberately with premeditation. But couldn't -- because the first jury had -- in the guilt phase, couldn't the attorney have requested a brand new jury to hear the NGI plea?",
  "We should treat the district court proceeding as though it had never happened on the ground that the Ninth Circuit never should have remanded it to the district court, and we just take it as though we had a 2254 petition from the State supreme court in the district court. And then the district court doesn't conduct any hearing; it just applies the standard. So that the whole thing about clearly erroneous at the district court, that -- that should be out of the case.",
  "Isn't there something on the other side? You seem to present this as a case, but counsel did a careful job, and then he lost faith. He lost hope, and so he acted irrationally. But wasn't there on the other side consideration of the sentence that he was going to get, and might not a -- a lawyer perfectly rationally think: If I give up this defense, it is just going to waste everybody's time. The judge is going to give me the benefit of -- of having done that in the sentence, in giving a lower sentence, in giving -- making the sentences on the multiple offenses concurrent rather than consecutive.",
  "Had Wager ever represented a defendant who pled NGI?",
  "Is that the special -- he made a request for a particular prison. Is that the one?",
  "But there was also something about the revocation? There were three revocations involved, I thought, two years on each.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, the defendant himself could say, \"Police, I'd like to talk to you.\" That would be okay. But this is police initiation.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, do I understand correctly that the scenario here was the defendant, uncounseled, was taken before a judicial officer who read him rather standard information, one piece of information was, I'm appointing a lawyer for you? Was there any opportunity for the defendant to say anything at that hearing?",
  "He didn't get -- he didn't in fact get a lawyer. I thought he was told that the public defender - -",
  "Right, and the actual lawyer didn't show up until later.",
  "Did he have an opportunity to do it at the so-called 72-hour hearing? Was there any -- did the judicial officer ever ask him anything about whether he wanted counsel, whether he accepted counsel? Was there any colloquy between them at all?",
  "And is that standard operating procedure at these 72-hour hearings: That the -- the defendant, who is there uncounseled is -- is just standing there, and the judicial officer says: I'm appointing counsel for you, and he goes on to the next thing he's telling him?",
  "Is that how it operates?",
  "Did anybody ever tell him he needed to request? I mean, he had just been told by a judicial officer: I'm appointing counsel for you. He's not counseled at that point. How does he know that, in order to protect his right to counsel, he has to make some kind of an affirmative assertion? He's just been told he's got one.",
  "I would have no problem at all with the argument you are making if someone had told him that he needed to do that. But he didn't have a judge to tell him that; he didn't have a lawyer to tell him that; and the police certainly didn't tell him that.",
  "That's very puzzling. This is an experienced police officer. The 72-hour hearing is required in every case where defendant is in State custody. So how could an experienced police officer not know? Somebody, by the way, who knew this man had been kept until -- even more than 72 hours. And he testifies -- it's true that Detective Hall testified: I didn't know that he appointed -- had been appointed a lawyer. The very same day that he got to the 72-hour hearing a day late, how could he not have known?",
  "Louisiana.",
  "Did the Louisiana Supreme Court say there has to be a request? I thought they said there had to be some action, affirmative act of acceptance.",
  "It's just that everything after -- as far as I understand, the only piece of evidence we're talking about is his condolence letter to the widow which amounted to a confession of guilt.",
  "There is no other. Because all of the Mirandized free 72-hour hearing, all that is not in contest; all of that came in.",
  "Ms. Landry, you're trying to explain your position, let's assume, to an intelligent layperson, and the first example is, in many States at the equivalent of the 72-hour hearing, the defendant is told: The court is prepared to appoint a lawyer for you. Would you like us to appoint a lawyer? And the defendant will say yes. So he will have made the request for a lawyer. And then there are States like Louisiana where this is a rapid-fire proceeding, and the defendant isn't asked any questions, he isn't asked to agree or disagree, and he doesn't have any lawyer there to assist him. So you are essentially asking the Court to make a distinction between defendants in the same position, both uncounseled, both not knowledgeable in the law, but the one who has the good fortune to be in a State where the judge tells the defendant, \"You have a right to have a lawyer. Would you like me to appoint one?\" And then this procedure. Shouldn't defendant's rights turn on that distinction in the State law?",
  "But, Mr. Verrilli - -",
  "-- you just struck two chords: One, harmless error; the other, that this defendant testified at his trial. We have held that a defendant's statements, although he wasn't given his Jackson right, can come in by way of impeachment if he testifies. So in this defendant's case, even if we accept everything you say, the -- that condolence letter could have been used for impeachment purposes.",
  "Ms. Rainville, underneath or between the lines there seems to be great discontent on the part of the Vermont Supreme Court with the way the public defender system is operating. And if we hold for you as a matter of the federal speedy trial right, the Vermont Supreme Court could go back and decide just the same thing under the Vermont Constitution, couldn't it?",
  "Did he get to offset it against the time for the pretrial incarceration?",
  "It's an anomaly, though, isn't it, that easily might have matured into ineffective assistance? It wasn't yet, but if Attorneys 4 and 5, Donaldson and Sleigh -- if the case were for ineffective assistance of counsel, then the defendant would get a new trial, but here the result is he walks.",
  "But knowing that the new lawyer would have to start from scratch, from the beginning, so it was going to take more time. If he got a new lawyer, it was going to take more time than if he stayed with the lawyer who was already acquainted with the case but just needed a few more weeks.",
  "Well, wasn't there a concern about this defendant trying avoid a particular judge? That's why he wanted the continuance?",
  "Not only did the Vermont Supreme Court make that finding, it does not hear the witnesses, it -- it has a record before it. I can understand if you're talking about a finding made by the court of first instance, but the Vermont Supreme Court is reviewing a record, it's not making findings.",
  "What about the point that Ms. Rainville made? And she talked about this balancing that comes out of Barker, and she said you have to weigh against the defendant very heavily, the episodes with lawyer number one and number three, because that was really bad stuff. The State is perhaps responsible for some of the other delays, but she called those \"neutral\" in the weighing process. Don't those two episodes, counsel number one was fired, counsel number three, who says his life was threatened by the defendant, don't those have to count very heavily against the defendant?",
  "Well, the rest, I couldn't find in his final counsel's representation -- I didn't see anything in her representation that would suggest any lack of diligence on her part or any reason to count that in the speedy trial calculus. That runs from August 2003 to June 2004.",
  "Mr. Fernich - -",
  "-- are we talking just about the instruction to the jury? I know you think that the instruction given here was incorrect. But is it just a question of charge error or are you saying that there was insufficient evidence of enterprise for this case to go to the jury?",
  "You're saying if a proper charge had been given, this jury on this evidence still could have convicted the defendant?",
  "Did you make that -- did you make that objection in the trial court?",
  "What does \"structure\" mean? I think you said it doesn't mean that this has to be an organization with a president, a treasurer; it doesn't mean that.",
  "What is -- what is the minimum to qualify as having a structure?",
  "The jury -- the words that you asked for, what was it? \"Ascertainable structural hierarchy.\" And suppose the judge gets questions from the jury: \"Your Honor, what do you mean by ascertainable structural hierarchy?\"",
  "Those are the words that you wanted the judge to include in the charge - -",
  "-- and it's your requested charge, as to say to have an enterprise you need to have -- the group has to have an ascertainable structural hierarchy. Those are the three words in your requested charge.",
  "But those -- but you did ask for those.",
  "And now I'm asking you, what does that mean? The judge gives your charge, the jury is puzzled: Your Honor, we don't understand what you mean by \"ascertainable structural hierarchy\"; would you please tell us specifically?",
  "And some of those examples it seems are present here. One you gave was longevity, well, this has been going on for 10 years; another was a unique way of operating, and they are specialists in deposit boxes and they have look-out people and they have people who actually break into the bank, and they have a certain amount of skill. So we have longevity, modus operandi, and a division of labor. They have some people being their lookouts and other people doing other things. So I was looking at your list in the reply brief, and it seems to me that this organization, this association of individuals, has some of those characteristics.",
  "Would it include, let's say, a street gang? How about -- this may be before your time, but \"The Lavender Hill Mob\"?",
  "The Alec Guiness movie, \"The Lavender Hill Mob.\"",
  "Isn't there a record that this is a more or less steady group that hangs out together, except when one of them gets caught and put in jail, and then they replace him with someone? But this is -- this was explained as a group that meets regularly in the Brooklyn Social Club?",
  "But one of the members owned the club, right?",
  "How about during the period that this man -- what was his name, Mangia - -",
  "Yes. When he was running the show, it seems that he was a leader, and that the - - and that the group wasn't quite as democratic before he got sent to prison.",
  "That wasn't what I meant.",
  "I meant, would the organization, as it was described to exist at the time Mangiavillano was there, would that have satisfied the definition of \"structure\" because it had a leader?",
  "Before you do that, Mr. Yang, could you give us a sense, if you know it, about the practical results of the different formulas that - - there are at least three formulas, I take it that the different circuits have approved. In the result of the RICO prosecution, does it really make a difference which one of these is charged or do they could out the same way, anyway?",
  "Mr. Isaacson, you said there were two facts. Aren't there three? Isn't it a fact that after the plea bargain the defendant in essence broke his side of the bargain by committing a crime while he was in jail?",
  "But this judge said - - and he was open in his thinking. He said: \"Unheard to me that I would give acceptance of responsibility credit to someone that as soon as he gets sent to jail is out there committing another crime.\"",
  "The judge did say that. He said it was unknown to him that judges give acceptance of responsibility credit to someone who in the interval between the plea and when he shows up in court for sentencing commits another crime.",
  "But he could have, if he felt that way -- I mean, there they were in the courtroom; all of them knew about the plea agreement because there had been the Rule 11 colloquy when it was taken, right?",
  "When the plea was taken - -",
  "-- it was the same judge, wasn't it?",
  "And so they were all there and the defendant was asked all these questions, and the government-- and the judge knew about the government's side of the plea bargain.",
  "So it was not a secret to anyone that the government said it would ask for the extra acceptance of responsibility credit. And yet the defendant and his lawyer stand there and they don't say a word: Wait a minute, judge. They didn't object at - - there was no motion to withdraw the plea, was there?",
  "But - -",
  "Before the judge there was no plea to withdraw the plea.",
  "And so that's why we are -- if he had asked to withdraw the plea, then we'd have a different case. But he didn't, so we are here on plain-error review.",
  "But Santobello was a case where there was a timely objection.",
  "What relief are you seeking now? You didn't -- you didn't ask to withdraw the plea when you were before the sentencing judge.",
  "Right.",
  "Which would expose him to a considerably greater penalty.",
  "It did include it in the motion, didn't they?",
  "Wasn't there a motion - -",
  "-- for credit for acceptance of responsibility, and had as a condition that the defendant be law-abiding?",
  "So isn't it odd that the -- that these documents both meant to serve the same purpose, one has the provision for law-abiding conduct in the future and the other doesn't?",
  "There was part of this agreement that was honored. In fact, the judge after having said that, I never heard of giving credit for responsibility to somebody who commits a crime in the interim, but he said: I understand there was an agreement to sentence at the low end, and that's what I'm going to do.",
  "So if you say what you want is a trial, the defendant would be exposed to not just the upper level; plus weren't there add-ones in this case that the judge ordered to be served concurrently rather than consecutively?",
  "Why wouldn't someone read what happened here as the defendant saying, well, I didn't get the acceptance credit, but the judge is still sentencing me at the low end, and he's still making the sentences run concurrently, so I think -- why, if he doesn't try to withdraw the plea, why isn't it the logical assumption that he says I didn't get the whole promise but I got part of it, and I'll take it?",
  "How do we know this one didn't?",
  "As a matter of practice among U.S. attorneys, we do have six and a half years at stake here, right? That's the difference between the two levels? Why wouldn't it be the appropriate thing for the U.S. attorney, the assistant U.S. attorney, to say, \"Judge, I want to call your attention to paragraph 8 of the plea agreement. At the time we entered into it, we made that undertaking.\" And so then everybody is sure that the judge's mind is focused on that. Wouldn't that be the better practice?",
  "It was sent to another judge, that judge would still have the presentence report. After all, it wasn't the government that initiated reneging on the -- if it was the -- it was the presentence report. And before the government said a word, the judge had read and was discussing the presentence report, which said, judge, earlier, we said you should give credit for acceptance of responsibilities, now we must tell you, you should not.",
  "Yes.",
  "Before we -- before we get to the statute, McNabb-Mallory are exercises of this Court's supervisory authority over the lower courts?",
  "And they were both pre-Miranda decisions, when now the defendant is told of his right to remain silent. Whatever Congress put in 1301 -- 3501, this Court could say, well, McNabb-Mallory are no longer viable cases in light of Miranda.",
  "Do you need fundamental principles when you have got Rule 5 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure? Don't they say that an arrestee shall be taken before a magistrate without unreasonable delay?",
  "At least one time limit that has been complied with -- and that's the Fourth Amendment, how long you can keep somebody seized without taking them before a magistrate -- there is no violation of that time period, is there?",
  "Well, what about Rule 5? And Rule 5 doesn't say a word about voluntary. It says unnecessary delay -- shall be brought before a magistrate without unnecessary delay. So whatever the balancing there may be in 3501, I think what you're saying is that Rule 5(a), which just says bring theoretically before a magistrate without unreasonable delay, that that has no teeth; that that is effectively unenforceable.",
  "Rule 5 is about unnecessary delay, and here we have a case, if I remember the facts right, where the officer said, yes, the reason we didn't bring him before a magistrate sooner is because we wanted to get a confession from him.",
  "You are really asking the Court to overrule McNabb-Mallory, because you say Congress provided six hours, no McNabb-Mallory, but after six hours the test is voluntariness -- only voluntariness. So there's nothing left under the government's view of McNabb-Mallory.",
  "That's Rule 5.",
  "And as you have said without the exclusionary rule, Rule 5(a) has no teeth at all. And I agree with that. It says -- it's a straight out command, no unnecessary delay. And isn't the reason for 5(a) exactly what happened here? This was a case where the police officers were trying to admit that the sole reason that they didn't bring Corley before a magistrate properly was to extract a confession.",
  "That's exactly what McNabb-Mallory was trying to - -",
  "Is there any indication of the rules advisory committee, any of their notes, that 402 was meant to overturn McNabb-Mallory?",
  "Would it make no difference, I take it, General McAllister, if this had been a police officer who was pretending to be a cellmate? In this case it was a snitch, but it could be a police officer doing inside the cell what he couldn't do outside; that is, the police officer outside wants to interrogate, must inform the arrestee of his Miranda rights, but inside the cell, the police could pretend to be a jailbird and they can get the information that way. Is that - -",
  "So, the police know that they can get around the clear prohibition of their questioning without Miranda warnings by pretending to be a jailbird?",
  "No, I am assuming we are not in the area where the jail mate is simply passive. In this case, the jail mate made a statement that encouraged the defendant. He wasn't just passive. He was encouraging the defendant to speak.",
  "Anyway, your answer is the police officer could affirmatively elicit testimony?",
  "And for your -- you are talking about impeachment only. We are not talking about the case in chief. So if the police -- he can't -- outside, when he questions the defendant and gives no Miranda warnings, that is inadmissible, right?",
  "You are making no distinction, then, between the Fifth and Sixth Amendment?",
  "What about the argument that essentially this is like taking a pretrial deposition, only one side isn't represented?",
  "Is that internal discipline verifiable? Do police officers who engage snitches, do they get disciplined, especially if they are then able to accomplish what was accomplished here? That is, the -- the testimony -- the snitch is then able to testify after the defendant testifies.",
  "On the Federal level is there anything one way or another, any manual that instructs a U.S. Attorney about the use of snitches to extract confessions?",
  "But we do know that unlike the police giving Miranda warnings, there's no warning here at all. I mean, he thinks he is talking to a cellmate. Nobody tells him, \"remember you've got a right to be represented by counsel,\" and he's essentially giving a statement without the Miranda warnings.",
  "But the other side says well, practically, the defendant is much more likely to say something that's really involuntary when he is confronting police officers, that the reason that we exclude in the case of a police officer is this intimidating setting, when the defendant is in the police station or in the cell and there are these police officers. Now he thinks he's just with a cellmate, so there isn't -- there isn't the coercive atmosphere that there is when the police do the questioning.",
  "You urged a -- a fall-back, and you said at least that there may -- there should be a determination by the judge that the defendant intentionally testified falsely. And I was wondering how that would operate. You are here in the -- the heat of the trial, and the prosecutor says, I want to call snitch so-and-so. And then what do we do, just interrupt the trial and have kind of a mini trial to test the credibility of the -- the informant?",
  "How many years ago was the automatic stay eliminated? When did this -- the current law come into effect?",
  "How can that be?",
  "When you say \"equities,\" is the fact that he has applied or his wife has applied for adjustment of his status, is that an equity?",
  "It was changing conditions.",
  "Alleged changing conditions.",
  "That case -- this case could come out the same. If we remand and we say that it's the traditional standards, this case might well come out the same way. The -- the court might say, well, it doesn't make it under the traditional -- it hasn't shown a likelihood of success on the merits.",
  "But the standard is probable success on the merits, and that's not an easy standard. Irreparable harm and probable success on the merits, both.",
  "And you would expect the standard to be in the (b)(3)(B) provision. It says that no automatic stay unless the court otherwise orders, period. That's the end of it. So one wonders whether this would think that the normal standard for a stay would apply. And then (f)(2) is separated by several pages and (f)(1) is dealing with something where we understand it. It says no mass injunctions against the enforcement of a provision. But (2) is really puzzling what it relates to, is it supposed to have some relationship to (1)? 1 says you can't enjoin the enforcement of a provision of the law.",
  "May I ask just a technical point?",
  "One of the -- the motion to reopen was based on changed circumstances in the Cameroon. But there was also this independent application for adjustment of his status, which was turned down because it was a successive motion.",
  "My understanding is that that adjustment could not have been asked for earlier because his wife didn't come with -- until after.",
  "Yes, but now he would qualify, except that it's a successive motion. So it seems earlier he was premature and now he's too late.",
  "May I just ask a question?",
  "This person is married to a citizen, has an American citizen child. Is there any way that his status could be adjusted? It can't in this procedural situation because it is a successive motion.",
  "But the standard you think should apply under (b)(3)(B) is a standard that describes as applicable to temporary injunctions. The word -- there is substantial likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm -- that is the standard preliminary injunction, not preliminary stay. The preliminary injunction standard. So the two words certainly overlap.",
  "But the question - -",
  "But the question presented, General Kneedler, was limited to IMLA, to the Mineral Leasing Act.",
  "That was the government's question presented.",
  "General Kneedler, the last time -- the last time around, we remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion. Would you advocate a different bottom line this time?",
  "But, Mr. Phillips, I'm looking at the last paragraph, and it says: We have no warrant from any relevant statute or regulation, et cetera. So it wasn't limited to IMLA. Do you think that was just carelessness on the Court's part?",
  "With respect to that - -",
  "-- the opinion in the last time around not only contained the statement that I read before, that is, any relevant statute, but in the very beginning it says, \"We hold the tribe's claim for compensation from the federal government failed,\" and there is a well known distinction between a claim at issue and attributing to the Court that kind of carelessness for saying that the claim is barred as distinguished from an issue, the issue being IMLA. I think the Court was conscious of that distinction when it used the word that the claim failed, not just the issue.",
  "So did you, Mr. Phillips. Last time around you acknowledged that the Peabody lease was governed only by IMLA. That -- those words were from your brief last time around.",
  "But I thought -- you are really saying that you were wrong in make that concession.",
  "In -- IMLA - -",
  "But it is the statute that seems most closely on point, because it's the only one that talks about mineral leases exclusively.",
  "Are you putting -- are you equating this with a biased judge? The -- the category of structural error has been kept very narrow by this Court. And it seems to me that a juror who is perfectly qualified, who it is conceded -- it is conceded could not have been dismissed for cause, is quite a different matter than a judge who -- who has taken a bribe or who has a monetary stake in the case. It -- it seems quite a stretch to apply those decisions to -- to the case of a juror who was qualified, and it was just a judge who was overexuberant in denying a peremptory challenge.",
  "But no -- no constitutional right, no constitutional right to the peremptory challenge.",
  "But you are not - - suggesting, because you conceded there was no basis for a for-cause challenge, you are not -- you are not saying that Gomez was unqualified or that she was biased. If she was biased, you had a basis for that, she could be excused for cause.",
  "But she was an administrator. She wasn't a nurse. She didn't deal with people who had gunshot wounds.",
  "But the -- well, first, how many peremptories does Illinois law allow?",
  "Well, suppose a State allowed only three peremptory challenges. There would be nothing in the least unconstitutional about that, right?",
  "This was number four, was it?",
  "The challenge to Gomez was the number four peremptory?",
  "And so, if the State had only three which it could do, there would be no basis for removing Gomez from the array. That is, the defense would have already exercised three peremptory challenges, she's number four, too bad. That would be the end of it, right? She would sit on the jury.",
  "But there is something unseemly about saying because the State is generous in its peremptories, you have a grand constitutional argument to make, even though there is no constitutional right to any peremptory challenge?",
  "But we had an actual jury. It's not as though you had no jury verdict and then the court would say -- the court would say, we think that this defendant was as guilty as they come; but you had a jury with jurors who met all the State law qualifications, already made the determination of guilt. So that's a little different from the case where, say, a judge would attempt the equivalent of a directed verdict.",
  "Then -- then you would have no objection to a remand that says, Illinois Supreme Court, you can't blame it on Federal law. It's up to you as a matter of State law. And now answer the question that you didn't answer; that is, what is the consequence under State law of an erroneous denial of a peremptory? You would have no objection to such a remand?",
  "But what about the - -",
  "Mr. Roberts, if you do get to harmless error, how do you deal with the question that was raised by the Chief Justice, that is, there is no way in the world that you can tell whether this was harmless or not? You would have to imagine another juror being on the panel, that juror could have swung the case, could have had no influence, there is just no way of knowing what would happen.",
  "Isn't there something odd about saying if it's really fundamental like the presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction, that is not reviewable? It's not disputed, right? That if the district court says, I lack subject matter jurisdiction over, let's say, the RICO claim, as wrong as that might be, that would not be reviewable, right?",
  "Though that could be a very grave error and yet, on a matter of discretion, that that would be reviewable. And I appreciate your statutory argument, but it just seems odd to think that Congress would want to be firm that if the remand is for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, wrong or right, no review, but it was a discretionary exercise, I could keep this, but I choose not to, that that is reviewable. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to say the judge could keep it or remand it, that that action is reviewable, but the action of saying I don't have jurisdiction, when indeed the court did have jurisdiction, is just totally immune from review.",
  "But wouldn't it be - - here the district judge said: I got rid of the RICO claim; all that's left are State law claims, and there's no Federal interest in this case any more. They're all State law claims, they belong to State court, good-bye. I could keep it, I choose not to, because it isn't a sound use of the resources of the Federal court. Now, even if you're right that this is a discretionary decision, so you can't say no jurisdiction because the discretion implies that there is power, isn't it 99 cases out of 100 that the court of appeals, assuming reviewability, will say, we should defer to the district judge about questions of this nature, the district judge's decision that this isn't worth the time of the Federal court?",
  "But wouldn't you -- as a practical judgment, the Federal claim is gone, there is pending jurisdiction or now supplemental jurisdiction over the State claim, but the district court is told by Congress: It's your call; it's a matter of discretion. And the judge gives one of the reasons that's enumerated, that reason being that the State claims are overwhelming in this case, the RICO claim is dismissed, thinking it was worthless, so it's a State case. Why would a court of appeals overturn such a judgment?",
  "But that was because we would have to retread the same ground in the State court that had already been covered in the Federal court, but that's not the kind of case that was presented here. I know the case has lingered for a long time, but there was no processing of those State law claims. The judge concentrated on RICO, threw it out, and said \"the rest of the claims I'm not interested in.\" So it's not a case like the Fifth Circuit where there was a large investment of Federal court energy and time and sending it back would mean going over once again what had already transpired in the Federal court.",
  "Could you explain why that is a Federal question? It's a dispute over the ownership of this invention, right? So it's not a question of the validity of a patent or infringement of a patent? It's just the invention is like any res, and two parties are disputing about ownership. Why is - - why does that become a Federal case?",
  "But the - -",
  "How could we do that in light of Thermtron? Thermtron went against the clear text of the statute that says remands are not reviewable, period; and in Thermtron the Court said, yes they are sometimes, if we think it's so outrageous for a district judge to say: Yeah, I've got jurisdiction over this case, but my docket is so crowded, and this is a - - this is a small-change case; it belongs in State court. The court, I think, was outraged by a district court thinking that it could dump a case simply because it was too busy with more important things. That was the setting of Thermtron, and to reach the result that the court reached, the court had to go against the language of the statute when read in absolute terms. But anyway, the court did that, and then they gave a rationale for what the new test was going to be. It was no longer going to be remands are no longer -- remands are not reviewable; it's going to be -- that applies only to the cases where -- what was it, subsections (c) and (d) of 1447? The -- it -- the court read the statute to say less than it in fact did. That's what Thermtron did.",
  "Well, one clear way to do it would be to overrule Thermtron, but neither party has asked for that. You haven't asked for it and the other side hasn't asked for it.",
  "But your concern is what was the Court's reasoning, and you could apply the Court's reasoning, its interpretation of 1447.",
  "But that was a dissenting opinion, and that was how many years ago? How many years?",
  "But you have a majority rationale that says, although 1447(d) reads in absolute terms, in fact the only remands that it covers are those based on a defect in the removal or lack of subject matter jurisdiction. So you can't say, well, Thermtron had a result that we can limit to Thermtron's own unusual facts because the court gave a rationale. I mean, courts give reasons for what they do. And the court drastically limited 1447(d) when it said 1447(d) has to be read consonant with 1447(c), and 1447(c) deals with only two kinds of remands, one for defective removal and the other for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.",
  "What in addition to the civil rights provision?",
  "Then that's a specific statute that would prevail over the general provision.",
  "But Things Remembered, I think, was raised very carefully, such to say that the question that's before the Court now has not been decided before, the precise question here - -",
  "-- discretionary remand?",
  "So -- and I think, I looked again at Things Remembered, and it turned out to be just as I remembered it - -",
  "-- that it was neutral, colorless. It just said we haven't been confronted with this issue. And I think Powerex said the same thing, although it said it in more definite terms, it is far from clear.",
  "Maybe the district judge didn't say that. Maybe you can point me to the place where it did. But if it did say it, it's flatly wrong, because there is -- that's what supplemental jurisdiction is. It's says you have jurisdiction, it's a huge difference between you have no jurisdiction, you are powerless, and you have power, but it's up to you to exercise it or not.",
  "It wasn't a discretionary decision about RICO. RICO -- there was no Federal claims stated. That's out of it.",
  "What the district court has jurisdiction over are the supplemental claims, which it can choose not to exercise, but it can say, \"I don't have jurisdiction,\" because Congress has given supplemental jurisdiction, but then left it to the court to remand on stated conditions. But you -- you seem to conflate the absence of subject matter jurisdiction with a discretionary decision not to exercise subject matter jurisdiction that the court undoubtedly has.",
  "Then -- when what you are doing is that you are using the label \"subject manager jurisdiction\" in a way that seems to me, that -- there are many categories that -- could be ambiguous at the edges, but not subject matter jurisdiction. Subject matter jurisdiction means court, you have no power, period. There's no diversity, there's no Federal question, there's no other basis for the Federal Court to exercise jurisdiction; and to say, \"Well, we can extend the label subject matter jurisdiction to include a case where the district court chooses not to hear several claims, even though it has jurisdiction over them.\" I think is a -- is a -- a misapplication of the notion subject matter jurisdiction.",
  "Yes, but not subject matter jurisdiction. Jurisdiction -- personal jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction. When I did in -- what I did in -- Arbaugh was explain that all kinds of things like time limits on when you can sue, have been labeled jurisdictional and mandatory, when they are not. They are simply statutes of limitation.",
  "Why is it only technical? It says court, you can exercise power. Subject matter jurisdiction is defined as the court has to hear a given controversy, and under supplemental jurisdiction, there is undoubted power in the district court to hear those claims.",
  "You put it in terms in your brief, if I understood your position correctly, yes, there is subject matter jurisdiction over supplemental claims, but once the district court chooses not to exercise that jurisdiction, it -- and these were the words you used -- it divests itself of jurisdiction.",
  "The discretionary decision is that it chooses not to hear the case. It's not that -- there is no discretion there. There's nothing discretionary about saying we have no jurisdiction. \"We have no jurisdiction\" means we have no power. So the -- the two are just at odds with each other. No power, yes power, but we choose not to exercise it.",
  "Well, that would argue for a highly deferential standard of review, respecting the district judge's determination that it's not what - - it hasn't invested any time in these questions, and it shouldn't because they are purely state-law questions. That's -- but that's something quite different from - - from a -- the -- the terminology that you used is troublesome because a court doesn't have power to divest itself of jurisdiction. If Congress conferred jurisdiction, it has it, and the Court can't divest itself of that. It can, if Congress permits it, decline to exercise jurisdiction, but a court is not capable of divesting itself of jurisdiction.",
  "Ms. Sullivan, would it be altogether different if, instead of the FOB destination term, Shell continued as owner of the product until it had gone from the hose or whatever delivers it, so that there is no transfer of ownership until the delivery is complete?",
  "The problem I have with that line you're pursuing is the FOB destination term is an eminently fixable connection, and CERCLA is -- can be a punishing statute, but the one thing that was not intended was for the parties to arrange themselves out of arranger liability by providing neatly that the moment the product reaches a destination there's no continuing responsibility on the part of the seller.",
  "Well, one benefit would be avoiding CERCLA liability through a means other than what I call the fixable connection. Is this the first occasion on which Shell because of its sales of D-D has been charged with CERCLA liability? Is this a case of first impression, or have there been other instances in which Shell did very much the same thing, delivered the D-D FOB destination?",
  "I thought there was as part of this picture that Shell had a manual which told its purchasers how to handle this material, and that Shell was well aware that B&B was not following the precautions laid out in the manual.",
  "This court -- - this court, Ms. Mahoney, didn't deny apportionment. Apportionment was never requested. The court said: \"I'm going to have to figure this out on my own.\" In fact, the court deplored the parties for following what he called a \"scorched-earth tactic.\" So the apportionment is not something that has been denied to the PRPs in this case. It's something that the court thought was proper and fair, but it didn't deny any request made by parties, isn't that so?",
  "Can you point to me the part of the district court opinion that conflicts with the part that I remember so well? He is saying, this is a really tough assignment; I have to figure it out.",
  "Is it -- is it a judge's responsibility, no matter what evidence may be in the record from which one could make a finding, when a finding hasn't been sought?",
  "But that hasn't been - - that hasn't been the position of most courts under CERCLA. I thought they -- I thought that there had been relatively few cases where apportionment, when requested, was even allowed because the theory is the act provides for contribution. One PRP can go after another, but the party who shouldn't be left holding the bag is the public, the innocent victims of the pollution.",
  "I thought -- I thought - - and tell me if my recollection of the facts is incorrect, that the -- the newer parcel that enabled B&B to expand its operation, the waste went into a pond, what was called South, that was on the other side, that was on the original B&B parcel. So you had the waste flowing from one part to the other.",
  "May I -- may I just ask one question about the -- the situation of -- of these two potentially responsible parties? They are the only ones left, right? Because B&B is bankrupt, and there's nobody else that has been identified.",
  "So it's only those two. And one question about the arranger liability -- well, first on the apportionment. Assuming we don't accept your entire position, would a remand so that proof could be put in by both sides focusing on the issue of apportionment be appropriate? You questioned the district, even -- even if apportionment were possible, you questioned how he arrived at it.",
  "And is it true, as Ms. Sullivan said, that there is no other arranger case like this one where the, quote, \"arranger\" is the seller of a product?",
  "That's not normally how -- when -- when someone has a burden of proof, it's a burden of coming forward. And the one thing that we do know from this district judge is he's saying, I was left largely to make it up. What he -- the components of his allocation did not come from -- yes, there is some evidence in the record. But ordinarily when you talk about a party who has a burden of proof, we don't mean they put in a piece here and a piece there and left it to the district judge to figure out.",
  "But, General Bennett, if I understand correctly, looking to your question presented, the only thing before us is the effect of the Apology Resolution. The question presented doesn't say anything about the Admissions Act or the Newlands Resolution. So shouldn't we just stick to the question as you presented it? Whatever the picture is, does the Apology Resolution have any substantive effect?",
  "Why is it necessary? Why isn't it sufficient just to say that this resolution has no substantive effect, period, and then remand to the Hawaii Supreme Court?",
  "There -- there may well be, but then the Hawaii Supreme Court chose its grounds, and it said at one point the resolution dictates the preservation of the ceded lands. At another place it said that Federal law provides the basis for its decision and that State trust law is interwoven with that Federal law. It also said that Federal law grounds the decision and provides the governing legal standards. Now, they could not have been clearer. They repeated at least five times that their decision rested on the resolution, that everything turned on that resolution having substantive effect. That's why they said that their decision was driven by Federal law. And I don't know why we shouldn't take the Hawaii Supreme Court at its word repeated so many times.",
  "We don't - -",
  "And the legislature, if they had wanted to -- as I understand the Admission Act, it lists five purposes to any one purpose. And the legislature, if it so chose, could say, we want this property -- the proceeds from this property to be for the exclusive betterment of the conditions of the Native Hawaiians. They could. It would be up to the legislature to give it all to the Native Hawaiians.",
  "More than significance. I am reading the sentence that immediately follows the one that General Bennett brought to our attention on page 85A. It says, \"Accordingly, the Apology Resolution dictates that the ceded lands should be preserved pending a reconciliation between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people.\" It is very fear language, dictates. And that's why I am really puzzled as how this Court has any business wading into any question other than telling the Hawaii Supreme Court either their right about what the resolution dictates or they are wrong, and they are wrong because it's a nice apology but it's without substantive effect.",
  "Then how to you explain the language, over and over again, I won't repeat it, but they said this resolution of ours is dictated by, compelled by, the Apology Resolution? Without the Apology Resolution it would be an entirely different case. And now you seem to be taking what the Hawaii Supreme Court put as the necessary link, the Apology Resolution, before that this would have been impossible, and you are treating it now as sort of window dressing, icing on the cake, really didn't matter. But we would disrespect the Hawaii Supreme Court if we didn't take them at their word and say - - using words such as \"dictated,\" \"compelled.\" You -- you are treating this as sort of just part of the atmosphere.",
  "That's what you relied on but it's not what the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on, and I would repeat the point I made in the prior argument: what's worrisome about this is they are fastening on a piece of Federal legislation and said, we are compelled to do this because of Federal law. What that does is it removes it from the Hawaii political process. If they left Federal law out of it, and they said truly this decision rests on State law, we think that the title belongs with the Native Hawaiians, then they have to answer to the policy; and here the Hawaii Supreme Court insulates themselves by using the Federal law as a crutch.",
  "If -- if you took Federal law, the Apology Resolution, out of the picture, the Hawaii Supreme Court could reach the result that it reached and then we might have questions about its consistency with the Admissions Act and the Newlands Resolution; but as Justice Breyer said, if we disabuse them of the notion that there is any Federal compulsion here, then the rest is to be sorted out. We wouldn't have to say that they have a claim under State law, just not address it.",
  "And the political process question I think is really bothersome, that the Hawaii Supreme Court chose to use this Federal crutch. It seems a very weak reed.",
  "And do you think - -",
  "Do you think that that resolution is distinguishable in any way from the apology that the United States made to the people of Japanese ancestry who were interned after World War II? The United States did say -- it was -- I think it was an executive order by President Ford that, in no uncertain terms, stated that the United States made a dreadful error and there was never reason for rounding these people up and putting them in interment camps. Did -- is there any difference? And that, as I understand it, had no substantive effect until Congress passed legislation providing for compensation.",
  "The Native Hawaiians - -",
  "The Native Hawaiians - - they do get 20 percent of the proceeds, correct?",
  "And what -- that comes out of Hawaii legislation?",
  "The -- the $5.5 million figure, is that the subject of litigation?",
  "Can I - -",
  "Can I go back to your - - your suggestion that this is a moot case because the government -- because the -- the governor agrees with your position. But wasn't a lot of money already sunk into developing this area of Maui for desperately needed housing?",
  "Mr. Russell, am I correct in understanding that the government goes with you almost all the way, and its only the last three words \"of another person,\" that they agree knowingly applies to \"without lawful authority,\" and that it applies to a means of identification? You have to know that it was -- you were using the means of identification.",
  "If the first -- this alien's first effort to get papers that would qualify for him, if I -- if I remember correctly, the first time around he used an assumed name, not his own name.",

  "-- and -- and that would not have violated. Even in the government's reading that would not have violated - -",
  "-- this statute. But the second time around, your case, he did use his own name. And the question was -- and it turned out that both the Social Security card and the alien registration, they were two different people but they were both live.",
  "So that does make it a crime. But when the number turned out to be that belonged to anybody that does not, you don't get the two-year add-on.",
  "That's not -- that's not this case. In this case he had his own name. And I don't know whether there was a picture on the alien registration card. I don't know -- he used his own name. Did he use his own photograph?",
  "I mean, that would - -",
  "How do these operations work? He went to Chicago to buy false identification papers. Did, the first time he go to the same outfit as the time he used a false name?",
  "These are outfits that specialize in making false identifications?",
  "Do you have any sense of -- because there are any people with false identification papers, how many times it turns out to be the number of a live person, and how many times it turns out like it was in the first instance in this case; it is just a number, a made-up number that doesn't belong to anybody?",
  "What about the government's argument in this case that Congress was really going after people who have false identification because of its concern to protect the victim, that is the person whose number is misused? So the government is urging that we take a victim-centered approach to the statute.",
  "His conduct would amount to identity -- what did it say -- is there a crime of identity fraud?",
  "It would be equally false if the Social Security number were fictitious -- it didn't belong to - -",
  "Mr. Heytens, did the prosecutor give the right answer to Judge Friedman in the district court when Judge Friedman asked: Where I take two people and one of them gets false Social Security cards and it happens that the number belongs to no live person, and another person goes to the same outfit, but the card that he gets does belong to a live person -- he doesn't know in either case -- did the prosecutor give the right answer when he said, when it turns out to be a fictitious number, no two-year add-on, but if it turns out to be a real number, two years' mandatory addition? The prosecutor says, yes, that's the difference. Was that the right answer?",
  "Then what about the - - the even division -- I think it is an even division, 3/3 -- is it a 3/3 split? And if you wanted one indication that this statute is indeed grievously ambiguous, it is that -- that good minds have reached opposite conclusions with well-reasoned decisions on both sides. So it seems to me that this is a very strong argument that this is an ambiguous statute, unusually so. And I factor into that the answer that was given to Judge Friedman's question, which astonished me the first time I read it: That the prosecutor would say, Your Honor, I am saying no different degree of culpability. One happened to get a fictitious number; the other happened to get a real number; two years for the second one. There is no difference at all in the state of mind of -- of the two defendants. That's - - that's why I think the -- the ambiguity argument is strong. Why in the world would Congress want to draw such a line?",
  "You -- you gave earlier the felony murder example of the one who, the gun goes off, he didn't mean to kill anybody. But I thought homicide is -- it's an answer to your argument that this statute was entirely victim-centered, because a person is just as dead if he's the victim of a reckless driver as a premeditated murder, and yet we certainly distinguish the penalties in those cases, no matter that the harm was identical.",
  "There aren't too many 15-year olds who look like they're over 21?",
  "Mr. McCreadie, in this case, why is it necessary to get into that, whether they are punitive damages under FELA and the Jones Act? If we accept, as I think we must, Townsend's allegations to be true, he has said that Atlantic, as a matter of routine, puts in a boilerplate complaint for declaratory relief, reciting all the reasons why somebody could not get maintenance and cure, even though that is patently false, the allegation for example that he deserted his post. He says it's false. He said the allegation that he falsified his application for employment is false. Accepting the -- that to be true at this stage, isn't there some kind of punitive measure to be taken against a litigant who abuses the court process in that way?",
  "Yes, but -- but now we're at the pretrial stage, and we're supposed to assume the truth of the allegations in Townsend's complaint. We're assuming -- they may well turn out to be false; but at the threshold under 12(b)6 we accept those allegations as true and then determine whether a claim is stated.",
  "But let's take this out of the maintenance and cure spot altogether. Litigation generally, if a court determines that a litigant is abusing the court's process by filing false pleadings, is there a remedy; and if so, what is it?",
  "I thought that all that was at stake there was whether the employer wrongfully withheld maintenance and cure that was owing. The allegations made by Townsend go far beyond that they just unreasonably denied him maintenance and cure. They suggest that this litigant, as a matter practice, standard operating procedure, makes false claims before a court. And my question to you is, isn't across the board there a sanction, wholly apart from the particular claim, for a litigant who abuses the court's processes?",
  "How many - -",
  "You said never in the history. I mean, there -- there are examples like the ancient Nancy case, where the damages, where they were called exemplary -- but when you say never has there been before or after punitive awards. But there is precedent, the Nancy case in this Court, cases in lower courts, there have been punitive damages awards in -- in maintenance and cure cases.",
  "Did this Court ever hold that under FELA or under the Jones Act there are no punitive damages? Do we have any holding to that effect?",
  "Mr. McCreadie, there's a question about this case, a troublesome feature of it. That is, you are saying because there are no punitive damages available under FELA and under the Jones Act, then there certainly should not be any under maintenance and cure. But if we have to answer those questions, whether there are punitive damages available under FELA and the Jones Act, in the context of a maintenance and cure claim, then we're deciding a much larger question than are punitive damages available for willful refusal to pay maintenance and cure. We're deciding a question under the Jones Act, a question under the FELA, and there are a lot of people who would be interested -- and the seamen are a sizable group that the law cares about particularly. But there would be a larger interest, a larger interest in the answer in the Jones Act context and FELA. And to decide those questions in a case that doesn't present any claim under FELA or any claim under the Jones Act is troublesome.",
  "I thought there was -- it was on the high seas. They had DOHSA. At the time of Moragne, there was DOHSA, but then it was when you weren't on the high seas that was the gap. Wasn't that the case?",
  "But that's what the common law was. That's why we had Lord Campbell's Act. That was if you die, too bad; if you're injured, you collect. That was fixed by statute on the high seas, DOHSA. Because there was the gap, there was no Lord Campbell's Act, the Court effectively made one up, right? That's what it did in Moragne.",
  "How many of these seamen who seek maintenance and cure are represented? I mean, what is the incidence of representation for maintenance and cure claims as distinguished from Jones Act negligence type claims with the -- the possibility of large recoveries for pain and suffering?",
  "Well, the -- the point you are making is that the recovery under the Jones Act can be very large, and the attorney on a contingent basis would get a piece of that.",
  "Because it would be swelled by the pain and suffering damages which are not available in maintenance and cure.",
  "It hasn't come before this Court under FELA or the Jones Act, either, the punitive damage question?",
  "And that -- that was not argued by anybody. It wasn't raised in the lower court. It wasn't a punitive damages case.",
  "There -- there wouldn't be any maintenance and cure claim if the system worked as it was intended; that is, that if you have a sailor who is injured, the ship owner pays room and board and medical expenses.",
  "Are you -- are you then disputing what your colleague said about lawyers being reluctant to take maintenance and cure claims that are not tied with a Jones Act claim?",
  "Performance we should let the -- let Osborne, Osborne's attorney, address that question, because you're not really equipped to answer for the other side.",
  "There was evidence in - - at his trial at the state of the art at that time. There was whatever the test was.",
  "But when did the current technology become available? When did the testing that he now requests - -",
  "Would you explain that - -",
  "Just to clarify his statement, he said that the State of Alaska provides a means for him to get at this information; but if it did, I think we wouldn't be here. So would you -- Alaska is one of the few States that has no statute.",
  "So what -- you say - - this whole controversy is whether the State is obliged to give him this information; but you're saying it's simply that he picked the wrong procedure. That's what I thought I heard you say just now; that there is a means under Alaska law where he could get this DNA postconviction. So would you please explain what the Alaska procedure is?",
  "Has there been any case in Alaska where a defendant postconviction was, in fact, able to get DNA testing under the procedure you just described?",
  "But you said something significant. You said that he would have to allege his actual innocence, which he hasn't done. So if he continues not to -- not to put in a sworn statement that, I am actually innocent, under your current procedure he still couldn't get the DNA.",
  "You gave the one case in which in the habeas in Alaska the court granted access to DNA, but the evidence wasn't there. On how many occasions when postconviction someone moved for the DNA evidence did the Alaska courts deny the request?",
  "Well, you told us it was granted in one case. What happened in the other six?",
  "What were the two confessions? I know the one before the parole authorities. What was the other one?",
  "Under oath? Under oath so that he would be subject to penalty for perjury?",
  "Well, we can ask your opposite, opposing counsel. We can put it to him point blank. That's what I thought he said, and we -- we certainly will clarify that. But there's another possible impediment here to your claim. If we assume that there is this constitutional right, and it's available in 1983, this trial was in 1993. He brings the 1983 action in 2003. Counsel told us that this better method of testing has been available since the late nineties. With any constitutional right, there's an obligation of due diligence on the part of the claimant. You can't come in 10 years later, for example, and say -- say there was a tainted juror or something like that. It was -- it -- when you're claiming even evidence that wasn't available at the trial, you have to make the application with due diligence.",
  "How about - -",
  "But you -- you referred to the civil rules, and in discovery, in criminal cases as in civil cases, it -- ordinarily you have to prove that you have a basis for a claim. Like you don't get on the civil side discovery before you can pass the 12(b)(6) threshold that you have stated a claim. Are you giving that up here? Because he's seeking the discovery but he hasn't established that he has a tenable claim.",
  "Before you leave the text, it says as you -- \"referable to arbitration under an agreement,\" but then it says \"shall on application of one of the parties.\" How do we know whether that is parties to the litigation or parties to the arbitration agreement?",
  "In practice, are there decisions in which -- and I'm assuming that you are right on the jurisdictional question -- in which a nonparty to the arbitration agreement but a party to the litigation has, in fact, succeeded in getting a stay under section 3? I mean, one question is -- and that's the question on the merits -- assuming that a -- that a party to the litigation, not a party to the arbitration agreement, can come to court and say, court, stay the action pending arbitration. Have there been cases in which section 3 stays have been issued on the request of someone who is not party to the arbitration agreement but is a litigant in the case?",
  "Well, the question - - ability is one thing. It means they -- they have the capacity to apply under section 3. I was just wondering how in practice -- I mean, here's a case where you have three parties together counseling a certain tax shelter. One of them enters an arbitration agreement with the enterprise that they are advising. The other two, sophisticated players, do not. My question is, conceding jurisdiction, it seems to me unlikely that a court would listen to two such people who were perfectly equipped to get an arbitration agreement themselves and didn't.",
  "Do we have any situation -- and this one is really peculiar because the one party who has the arbitration agreement with Carlisle is now out of it, and is not going to get back in, because -- is it Bricolage -- is bankrupt, so there is an automatic stay of any litigation against Bricolage. The one party that has the arbitration agreement is out of the picture, so you have an arbitration agreement effectively with no one, that two parties who have no arbitration agreement are trying to enforce: The difference between parties to the litigation joining in an ongoing arbitration brought by either party to the arbitration agreement, and relying on an arbitration agreement effectively without two parties to it.",
  "But if you have a party to the agreement who is no longer in the picture, doesn't that change things?",
  "But if you read section 3, if you interpret, as you do, the word \"parties\" to mean parties to the litigation, then for purposes of jurisdiction the only thing is, is this person a party to the litigation? Yes. End of case; they can move for a stay. Then whether they're entitled to one because of this equitable estoppel theory which is determined by the State law is a merits question. You are making a more complex jurisdictional argument than I understand. What's wrong with the simple argument that section 3 says parties; that means parties to the litigation; the -- the Petitioners here are parties to the litigation. Therefore, they can move for a stay of the arbitration. And then we go to the merits and say, do they have a good reason for staying the arbitration? But you're presenting a more complex argument on the jurisdictional point which I don't quite understand.",
  "First, is there jurisdiction -- yes, appellate jurisdiction. If you - - if there's an application to stay, is that appealable? Why isn't -- why isn't the answer clearly yes?",
  "But your step -- you seem to be involving some merits question of State law in that question.",
  "You shouldn't do that. You should tell us, this is the jurisdictional argument. If we pass that threshold, then we get to the merits.",
  "Good.",
  "May I ask -- may I ask? Suppose it's somebody who has interest in the litigation but is not a party either to the arbitration agreement or to the litigation?",
  "I'm asking of somebody who is not a litigant, who can -- if somebody who is an interested spectator moves for a stay of litigation to which that person is not a party, and the court says of course not. Would that be reviewable on appeal?",
  "That's your jurisdictional argument.",
  "And you're saying that's all that's before us because it was thrown out - -",
  "Then you might say that they haven't stated a claim on which relief can be granted, but that is the merits question. We are supposed to be dealing with the question of whether the denial of the stay -- there was a denial of a stay -- is appealable under section 16. And to decide that question I don't think you get into how meritorious their claim was for the stay.",
  "You -- you just told us that section 3 was ambiguous. You don't know if the reference to \"parties\" means parties to the arbitration agreement or parties in the litigation. So how can we take it -- we take it seriously, yes, and say there's an ambiguity. We don't know from the text which is the proper reference, parties to the agreement or parties to the litigation.",
  "But you would recognize that there is some appeal possibility, because you already said or at least you said in your brief that the 12 might -- let's get this question settled about the equitable estoppel and going to arbitration; That the district court in its discretion that could give a 1292(b) order and say I want to get this issue settled on appeal before I go on with the case.",
  "That would be all right.",
  "Well -- the district judge could say, I'm going to treat this as a 1292(b) issue, and I'm going to grant the stay so that the court of appeals can tell -- can tell me what the law is?",
  "Bricolage did move to compel, it did move for a stay, did make a section 3 application; and then it -- it became bankrupt and got the benefit of the automatic stay in bankruptcy.",
  "But I take it that Andersen and Curtis are saying we have a right to be substituted for Bricolage. That's - -",
  "Does it mean the same thing as likelihood of bias?",
  "To what - -",
  "To what extent do you rely on -- and this is a very unusual situation -- that you have a defendant in the ongoing litigation who is in fact a prime culprit from the point of view of the plaintiff? That is, Blankenship, who made all these contributions, is charged with driving Caperton out of business. So he is not simply the CEO of the company that's named as the defendant, but he is targeted as the perpetrator. So that's an -- an additional factor. Is that just one of a laundry list, or is that central to your view that there is really an appearance of impropriety here?",
  "How is it -- is it - - this Court's decision in the Republican Party of Minnesota said that judges could say anything, just as a legislator. Are you extending that notion that an election is an election to this area of the appearance of impropriety? I mean, is it your position that the judge is elected just like a legislator is elected, and legislators all the time are beholden to interest groups?",
  "Why - -",
  "What about the view that Benjamin should not be the judge of his own cause? Wasn't -- wasn't it -- it was either Massey, the company, or Blankenship that brought a 1983 action insisting on that very point, that in recusal matter - - -",
  "-- it wasn't -- well, maybe you can tell me what that 1983 suit was. It was a charge - -",
  "But it was the position that Blankenship took?",
  "Would you please clarify that? Because I was taking appearance, likelihood, probability as all synonyms, and I think of Justice Marshall's decision in Peters and Kiff, involving a grand jury, and he said that due process is denied in circumstances creating the likelihood or the appearance of bias. And there are other decisions, too, that use those terms interchangeably. So I don't know that probability of bias, likelihood of bias, appearance - - that -- those seem to me synonyms.",
  "May I ask you -- I mean, there were a few recusal motions in this case. Judge, I think it was Matthew, moved to disqualify Judge Starcher, and Justice Starcher did indeed recuse himself. He had spoken out against what went on here. If he had refused to recuse after speaking out as he did, would that be compatible with due process, the due process owed to the Massey Company?",
  "I thought the animosity was directed at Judge Benjamin?",
  "So you think the Constitution might have been violated if Starcher -- you think due process might have been violated if that judge had remained on the bench?",
  "We don't deal with an abstract setting. We have the setting of elections, of elections of judges and millions of dollars spent on them. That's the context in which this case arises.",
  "Can you be specific about who those persons would be? You say not a misdemeanant drug user. So who would be caught in the 843(b)?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, I would like to - - who does this target? The girlfriend is a good law school exam type question, but in the real world who is covered?",
  "This statute doesn't - - it doesn't differentiate between buyer and seller in terms of who makes the call. I gather the purchaser for his or her own use would be just as susceptible to this statute if the dealer called and said: I've got a gram of cocaine; I know you're interested in having it.",
  "That was changed in 1970, wasn't it? Wasn't the text \"offense\" originally, and then Congress changed it to \"felony\"?",
  "You didn't -- I haven't heard you question so far the government's rationale, the reason Congress did this is it's more difficult to detect a drug deal when it's by telephone than if it were an encounter on the street or in an apartment. You have not questioned that?",
  "But if he leaves a message?",
  "In this case we have two separate episodes, each involving one gram of cocaine?",
  "And there were a total of seven phone calls?",
  "So that would be an exposure - -",
  "24 years for the one gram of cocaine on two occasions. Do you agree that it doesn't make any difference who initiates the call? That is, if the seller says -- seller calls the buyer, and says, I understand that you are in the market for one gram of cocaine, I'll sell it to you, is the buyer similarly subject to this statute?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, we are assuming the purchase is made in either case.",
  "So what you're saying is it doesn't matter who initiates the call?",
  "But we do know that - - that Congress drew a line it hadn't drawn before between the own-purpose users and people who were in the trafficking business, and it expressed sympathy for the -- or leniency, a policy of leniency. But the difference between the classification felony and misdemeanor is huge in terms of consequences for a person's life. So let's take the defendant in this case. If he becomes a felon rather than a misdemeanant, even if it's his first time and it's only one gram, he loses a lot of rights, doesn't he?",
  "Yes, but I'm speaking about the post consequences.",
  "Like -- let's take a young person. It has an effect on student loans, government loans?",
  "And it may be that in certain States voting rights are removed, and there is on this person's record forever that he is a felon. It just seems odd that Congress would have at one and the same time, the same statute, say, we want these -- to give these people a chance and if they are in a rehabilitation program and they make it they won't even get any charge, not even a misdemeanor charge, and then say, but a whole group of them are going to be treated just like traffickers if they use a telephone. It's hard -- these two would seem to be working at odds with each other. So mustn't the Court then try to reach some accommodation, some harmonization of these two provisions? And it's suggested that we do that by saying facilitation, causing in this context means the same thing as aiding and abetting, then we have the buyer-seller rule for the aider and abettor, and then we have made these two provisions harmonious.",
  "What about the -- the statement that in the manual -- maybe this is incorrect -- but that the charging policy of the Department of Justice instructs prosecutors to charge the most serious offense supported by the facts? And if that's true, then the Assistant U.S. Attorney would have no choice. The most serious offense is not misdemeanor simple possession, but it is the violation of 843(b).",
  "Ordinarily - -",
  "Is that the policy, first of all? It says that they're supposed to charge the most serious offense supported by the facts?",
  "So that means in every one of these cases, whether the dealer picks up the phone or the buyer picks up the phone for a transaction for one gram of cocaine, the prosecutor has no choice but to indict under 843(b)?",
  "I'm talking about the choice between misdemeanor, simple possession misdemeanor, or 843 -- adding on this 843(b). The prosecutor -- if what I read is correct -- has no discretion, has to if he makes the charge. He cannot make a simple misdemeanor charge. He has to charge the felony.",
  "How does it work? I mean, I know your overall rationale about the ease of detection -- easier to detect face to face encounter on the streets. But here, I mean, we know that the government tapped the dealer's phone, and that's how the government got the list of the people who bought from the dealer. How common is it that -- the either the buyer or the seller is the subject of a telephone tap?",
  "But what had to be met in this case in order to put this tap on the dealer's phone?",
  "Well, you would interpret Congress -- now we're getting away from '56, when simple possession was a felony, to '70, when simple possession becomes a misdemeanor. And you're saying that Congress meant to relegate the simple possessor to misdemeanor status, but only if the encounter was face to face. So you're reading into the -- what Congress did to sharply distinguish between traffickers and users, and say but that was only taking 843(b) into account. That benefit -- that you're not going to be a felon; you're going to be a misdemeanant -- is only for face-to-face transactions.",
  "But I'm talking about this context, the purchase of one gram of cocaine on one occasion, nothing more.",
  "So Congress's design was we treat as a less grave offender the buyer for his own use, but only if he buys in a face-to-face encounter. That's what -- what you would have to read -- you would have to limit the line Congress drew between traffickers, on the one hand, and possessors for their own use, on the other, that it applies only to drugs purchased in face-to-face encounters.",
  "But I mean, practically --",
  "-- the difference between being labeled a misdemeanant and being labeled a felon is an enormous difference.",
  "But it could be a -- a separate crime, the use of a machine gun in facilitating -- in facilitating a crime, any crime. That could be - -",
  "Mr. Forster, there are three levels under this: Possession, brandishing, and if the gun is discharged. You don't quarrel with the notion that Dean at least brandished this gun?",
  "So we're talking about a three-year difference between brandishing and if the gun is discharged?",
  "But it doesn't say -- it says, \"if the gun is discharged.\" And I think on the government's reading it would cover the police officer who is trying to apprehend a robber and fires a gun.",
  "But it's the police officer who snatches the gun.",
  "So it's using the robber's gun, but by the police officer who is apprehending him. In other words, as I understand the government's view, it doesn't matter whether it's the police officer. It has to be the gun of the robber, but it doesn't matter whether it's the robber or the police officer who discharges it.",
  "It has very specific - - what are the words that define what is brandishing?",
  "I -- I didn't think the government or anybody was reading the definition of brandishing to include a police officer.",
  "Right.",
  "Isn't it part of the background here that it was proposed at the time these enhancements came into the law, it was proposed that there be a specific state of mind requirement for the discharge of the gun, and that was not enacted?",
  "I thought that part of the legislative history was that there were proposals -- I mean, there is a rather sharp difference between \"possess\" -- yes, you have to have a knowledge, intent element -- \"brandishing,\" very clear, for purposes of intimidation -- then \"discharge\" has no -- it's just that the gun is discharged. Weren't there proposals to include something like what was included for the other two, that is, that there be an intent requirement?",
  "Well, there's accidents and accidents. And couldn't one say, looking at this that, well, we will -- the State will find that the culpability that we will attribute to this statute is reckless? If recklessness were the requirement certainly the facts in this case would fit, would they not?",
  "You accept that - -",
  "You say reckless is not enough, it has to be knowing. This is not a mere accident. It's -- this -- the gun was loaded, it wasn't locked, and he's raking in money with one hand, holding the gun with the other. The teller is crouching down. I mean, there was -- there was a pretty substantial risk of something going wrong, right?",
  "The -- the \"use or carry\" certainly has to be in relation -- during and in relation to, but that's step one. So he already is using and carrying or carrying in relation to the bank robbery. And then -- so that's the starting premise. That excludes all your things about years before or years after he carried -- he carried a gun. You -- step one narrows it to the person who uses or carries a gun in connection with a bank robbery.",
  "Why -- you say that this background -- that there has to be a state of mind element. And we can accept that that's a general principle, but here we have a provision that does require a state of mind -- specifically requires a state of mind for the possession, for the brandishing, intent to intimidate, but here is this other one that suddenly doesn't. So wouldn't the text of this statute say - - the third one, discharging a gun, they didn't mean to have any element because -- any element of mens rea - - because they had it in number 1 and 2, and 3 leaves it out.",
  "It would be the same - - you would give the same answer if the teller grabbed the gun from the robber and it went off?",
  "But your alternate position would apply to the teller as well as the police officer?",
  "Is there a difference, a practical difference, between the two formulations?",
  "But Ashe is quite a different case. Ashe is a seriatim prosecution. It was one event, a robbery. There were six victims. Victim number one, the charge relating to victim number one, was an acquittal. That necessarily decided that the defendant was not among the robbers. So that is quite a different situation from what we have here.",
  "You're not contending that double jeopardy itself was at issue? In other words, claim preclusion. There would be no claim preclusion, so we're talking only about issue preclusion?",
  "That means it was necessarily, the issue was necessarily decided?",
  "So the hung counts are equivalent, equivalent to an acquittal?",
  "Why not, when considering what the government did on its second chance? It trimmed 5 -- if there were 20 insider trading, on the new indictment, there were 5. There were 99 counts of laundering, which were trimmed to 8, something within the jury's ken. But isn't the most likely thing in this case that the jury was simply exhausted?",
  "Well, you qualify it in your statement of the facts. Is there any insider information with relation to the insider information charges that is different in any respect from the insider information in connection with the substantive challenge?",
  "Was that -- was that established? I thought that the record was hardly made of the contributors to this film. I think there was something like $200,000 accounted for, and the film cost -- to get the Channel '08, whatever it was, to put it on cost over a million dollars?",
  "Mr. Olson, I thought you conceded in the -- at least as I read your reply brief, that you were no longer saying this is about an issue unrelated to any election. I thought you said that this was a 90-minute movie \"concerning the qualifications, character, and fitness of a candidate for the Nation's highest office.\" And that's just what Wisconsin Right to Life was not. It was not about the character, qualifications, and fitness of either of the Senators.",
  "But didn't the Court there say this is not about character, qualifications, and fitness?",
  "But, Mr. Olson, this is -- I think you were right in conceding at the beginning, this is not like the speech involved in Wisconsin Right to Life. This is targeted to a specific candidate for a specific office to be shown on a channel that says Election '08, that tells the viewer over and over again what, just for example, it concludes with these are things worth remembering before you go in potentially to vote for Hillary Clinton. Now, if that isn't an appeal to voters, I can't imagine what is.",
  "This film has been compared to \"Fahrenheit 911,\" which had the pervasive message that President Bush was unsuited to be President. And so if that film had been financed out of corporate -- corporations' general treasury funds and put on an election channel, that would similarly be banned by the statute.",
  "Was -- was this issue aired before the three-judge court, the distinction between, say, putting something on network TV and putting something on View On Demand that the listener has to opt into?",
  "Mr. Shah, how does that differ from the general rule that a judgment becomes final and has preclusive effect once the appellate route has been exhausted or the time to pursue it has expired? It seems to me that Article 76 simply codifies the rule that applies ordinarily in criminal cases, in civil cases, stating when a judgment becomes final for preclusion purposes.",
  "Where in your view, in that the government is putting forward, can this -- can Denedo go? He said, I was misinformed by my counsel. I never would have entered a plea if I had known I would be subject to deportation. And he said, I never found out about it until what, 8 years later, when the government -- 8 years after his conviction, the government said, you're subject to deportation. Where can he go with that plea?",
  "We're assuming now, because we haven't gone any further than his plea, that he was so misinformed and he didn't lack diligence in failing to bring it earlier, that he was surprised by the government's action, so he was unaware and, therefore, unable to make this plea any earlier. You have given us the answer that it's too bad, he's just out of any court.",
  "Mr. Shah, you just said something about -- you answered my question and Justice Stevens' question: This person is out because it's too late for him. He was convicted in what, was it - -",
  "Yes. And the government never said anything about deportation until 2006? And they went through -- he twice applied for naturalization, is that correct?",
  "And he was turned down on grounds that had nothing to do with deportation. The government never alerted him to the possibility that he would be deportable. They turned down his application with no hint of that, and you say that he is -- he's out of time, but nothing counts against the government because of that 8-year lapse?",
  "Is it available to someone who enters a guilty plea?",
  "But I thought the Morgan case said that coram nobis was not dependent on any independent basis of jurisdiction. Didn't the Court say that a coram nobis application challenging a conviction is a step in the criminal case and not like habeas, where relief is sought in a separate case and record, the beginning of a separate proceeding?",
  "But you are making -- I thought that the core of your argument is that the All Writs Act applies to all courts established by Congress, the military courts are included in that definition, and there is nothing in the All Writs Act that says it doesn't apply to the military. But the All Writs Act requires that the writ be in aid of the court's jurisdiction. So if you would spell out how the writ here is in aid of the military court's jurisdiction.",
  "Where? Colorable - -",
  "But was -- that question wasn't resolved, was it? I thought we were just talking about the authority of the military courts to issue this writ, and the question that Justice Breyer has raised, well, is this ineffective assistance of counsel adequate grounds to issue the writ? I thought that question was certainly not raised before this Court.",
  "Military courts now since 1950 have quite a record of saying coram nobis is available in these courts. However, they have routinely thrown out the cases on the merits. Is there any case within the military where the military has said anything like inadequate assistance of counsel qualifies as a reason to grant the writ?",
  "Do I understand correctly that since 1989 there were a total of 30 coram nobis petitions filed, and of those only 4 were granted?",
  "Yes.",
  "But this Court has never held that the military courts have habeas jurisdiction?",
  "In what case?",
  "But that was - -",
  "The - -",
  "The quote you referred to from Goldsmith says: \"And a servicemember in custody.\" So I think Goldsmith, in that footnote that you're citing, is presenting a service member still in custody, having exhausted all other areas, can come to a Federal district court and seek habeas. It's not talking about someone who is out of the military.",
  "Well, what am I missing? I thought that the footnote reads once a criminal conviction has been finally reviewed within the military system a service member, having exhausted all other areas, can petition in a Federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus. I don't see anything that talks about someone who is no longer a service member.",
  "Mr. Ostrager, you have characterized the Second Circuit's decision in a way the Second Circuit did not. The Second Circuit said: The confirmation of the 1986 order stands, but that order did not encompass what was added in 2004; that is, that order dealt with the debtor, with Manville and the insurer's obligation to cover Manville's liability. The Second Circuit said: Now, this 2004 order, which concerns independent actions against insurers for their own wrong, was never encompassed in the order that they affirmed. So I think it's quite unfair to say it's a collateral attack on the 1986 order.",
  "At the time of the 1986 order, had these independent actions started? I thought at the time of the 1986 order the concerns were suits involving Manville's liability and the insurers' derivative obligation to cover.",
  "The insurers, to the extent of the insurance proceeds. That's what created the pot that made the settlement fund. But what I'm trying to get at is this extra piece, because the only information we have is that Manville -- there was the conversation that's reported in the Chubb brief. This question came up, well, what about actions against the insurers for their own wrongs? And the answer was, oh, those aren't covered.",
  "The Second Circuit's view was that the bankruptcy court has no authority, no subject matter jurisdiction, when the debtor -- debtor's liability is not in question. The Second Circuit thought, rightly or wrongly, that when the liability is between two- the question is between two nondebtors, Travelers on the one hand, the claimants on the other, Manville is not in the picture. That's what the Second Circuit said, it falls outside the domain of the bankruptcy court, and that could be wrong or it could be right. But in the Second Circuit's view the bankruptcy court lacked authority to deal with the nondebtors' liability to the claimants.",
  "The direct actions against Travelers.",
  "These were cases in the State courts and, as I understand it, so far none of them have succeeded.",
  "How could you say they ignored it when they had several pages devoted to 524, and they said it was -- it didn't cover these so-called direct actions, which really aren't what we generally call direct actions. But the Second Circuit did address what Congress did to codify essentially the Manville device.",
  "May I interrupt you there? Because you told me that the Second Circuit ignored 524(g), and I'm looking at page 33a of the petition for cert and the Second Circuit addresses 524(g), and its discussion continues for a couple pages. I don't see how that's ignoring the issue.",
  "And may I -- may I have an answer to my question about the Second Circuit ignoring 524(g) when they devoted two and a half pages to it?",
  "Another mystery in this most mysterious case: If it was so clear that the original order, the 1986 order, insured Travelers that it would have no liability for asbestos claims, period, then why did it put up $400 million, much more than it had put up originally, in order to settle with people who were bringing precisely that kind of claim?",
  "What was the difference between the release that you say flowed from the 1986 order and the releases that were obtained with the $400 million?",
  "So, specifically what was not included in the 1986 release that was included as a result of the settlement negotiations?",
  "But I would like to know the difference. What would -- what would Travelers be liable for under the 1986 order as you read it, that they got freedom from as a result of this settlement?",
  "So then -- so that the 2000 clarification order did exonerate them from traffic accidents?",
  "I have one question before you reserve the rest of your time. That is, you said this is -- this is a sweeping release that Travelers got in settlement for the claims of many parties. But some people were not there and those are the people who still want to bring their claims.",
  "I haven't asked my question.",
  "I would like to know what -- what notice did the people who were left out of the settlement, who were not part of the settlement, who say, so we want our day in court -- what notice did they have and what opportunity to be heard?",
  "How can it be successive when they didn't even get their -- I mean they -- these people haven't had a day in court. They may have a claim that's no good. All State courts so far have said their claim is no good. But they have a right - -",
  "The rule -- the particular rule that I am asking you about is that people who have not had their day in court can be precluded - -",
  "-- on the basis of newspaper notice and radio announcements?",
  "That was the best possible notice, which included regular mail notice.",
  "Can you answer the question practically, the insurers would not have settled, there would have been no 1986 order, if they didn't have this broader liability? They say without global protections they never would have contributed to the trust fund. And I would like you to answer that question.",
  "Yes, in the -- at the time of 1986, there were many claims against Manville, of course, for Manville's liability. These later suits in State court about the insurance company's independent obligation -- I asked this to counsel on the other side -- to what extent was there such litigation in 1986?",
  "That was the dissenting opinion.",
  "But there are two decisions of this Court, Abcam and Ortiz, that reject that position.",
  "Is there a variety of views among the circuits on what Justice O'Connor meant by the term \"direct evidence\"? It wasn't defined in Price Waterhouse either.",
  "So there is a range of views on what it means, starting from direct versus circumstantial, to something like strong evidence.",
  "And it was the view of only one justice, Justice O'Connor alone. She did make the fifth vote, but no one else accepted a direct evidence test.",
  "Well, would you urge that we should count Justice white's decision as the controlling decision rather than Justice O'Connor's?",
  "But, Mr. Schnapper, there is a difference -- and I think it's critical to your case -- between what is called the prima facia case that the plaintiff would make under the McDonnell Douglas test and proving by a preponderance of the evidence that in this case age discrimination was a motivating factor. I think you must concede that in order to fit within this double motive frame you must show not simply a prima facia case, but by a preponderance of the evidence that the discriminatory factor was a motivating factor.",
  "Can -- can one know if you've met that burden before the case goes to the jury? That is, when -- when the case starts out, it's unknown whether you have established by a preponderance of the evidence that age discrimination was a motivating factor.",
  "Couldn't -- couldn't any Title VII case be presented in either framework?",
  "As I understand the court of appeals, it said that Justice O'Connor's opinion was the controlling opinion, it was the decision on the narrowest ground; therefore, the lower courts ought to take that decision as the law made by Price Waterhouse. Then there's a question of what did she mean by direct evidence? But I think the Eighth Circuit certainly did say Justice O'Connor's opinion states the law of Price Waterhouse, and that was the basis on which their decision turned.",
  "Justice O'Connor.",
  "Yes.",
  "But Price Waterhouse deviated -- that was - -",
  "We have these two regimes out there. You are reciting McDonnell Douglas and say everything should follow that pattern, but to do that you have to overrule Price Waterhouse, which gave recognition to the mixed motive framework that comes out of Mt. Healthy.",
  "Mr. Schnapper recognized when I asked this question, how does this differ from the prima facie case that you make under McDonnell Douglas and -- he said: We don't have to just make a preliminary showing; we have to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the prohibited discrimination was a motivating factor.",
  "But that question -- I think it can't be before us. We would certainly want to know what the government's position is on it. And Ms. Blatt was very clear that the government is not taking a position on that issue today. Your brief in opposition did not so much as mention McDonnell Douglas. So how is anybody to think that was at stake, that that regime, which you later clarify in your Respondent's brief, you think should be the sole test? How could that come into this case when it's not in the brief in opposition and, therefore, it's not in the Petitioner's brief and it's not in the government's brief?",
  "But your line is following that same formula. All those cases are following that litany: prima facie case, discriminatory reason - -",
  "But those weren't - - those weren't thought of in the mixed motive framework. And what you want to do is get rid of the mixed motive and say in a discrimination case there should be only one regime, and the plaintiff should have the burden of persuasion from start to finish. But that's not what McDonnell Douglas did. It's not what the Eighth Circuit did, which you acknowledge by not even bringing this up until the brief on the merits. So -- and you also said that Title VII is out of it. The statute has taken care of it in 1991. Ms. Blatt, I heard her say distinctly that -- that Title VII would be affected. She urges us not to touch this question.",
  "And I assume -- and I assume the government, because it would certainly be informative to know what the agency responsible for the administration of Title VII thinks of this question.",
  "There are other vessels, too. It's the -- it's the oil tankers, and there are a few other vessels that were included?",
  "How many days.",
  "And you don't dispute that in light of the benefits provided by Valdez to the shipowners, that they could be a legitimate tax on these vessels?",
  "So could you describe what tax authority you think Valdez has?",
  "How much property -- you said if they -- if they taxed all moveables, that would be okay. Could they have some exemptions and still - -",
  "But that's -- the train is going to be some place throughout its trip, unlike the ship that's going to be on the high seas.",
  "Who can tax for the time on the high seas?",
  "And the domicile here is Texas. Is that right?",
  "In either case, no ships berth in either Delaware or Texas. Is that right?",
  "So the home port might have had in the old days the notion that's really where the vessel is berthed. But, nowadays, Delaware has very little to do with where the vessels are berthing and where they are being serviced?",
  "But the people's homes only if they are affixed to the property and they - -",
  "Yes.",
  "But Wheeling -- Wheeling was, it was a general property tax. And as I read the case, it said if you are going to tax property, you can include vessels. This statute, and I think the Alaska Supreme Court treated it discretely, is a tax on one kind of property only, these vessels. I don't know of any other property tax that is confined to just one type of property. Is there another? Is there a comparable tax that is focused on a single category of property?",
  "But is it -- do you -- do you contest the point that was made in the reply brief that back at the end of the 18th century, tonnage was considered a proxy for value, that it was the customary mode of measuring the value of a ship?",
  "So as long as you are taxing on the basis of the value of the ship, then you have no Tonnage Clause problem. Is that your -- the Tonnage Clause was a specific type of measure, and if you're taxing based on the assessed value of the property, it isn't a Tonnage Clause. Is that your - -",
  "But we have said - -",
  "Mr. Olson, we -- we have said it's not just tonnage. It said that the clause bars states, we said, from imposing a charge even if not measured by a vessel's tonnage, for the privilege of entering, trading in or lying in a port. So we have ruled out the position that it's got to be an old-fashioned tonnage charge, and can't be based on the assessed value of the property.",
  "But -- but in all of those cases the vessels were being taxed as one item of property in a general moveable property, personal property tax. I asked you before, I think, is there any other tax like this, that -- an ad valorem tax that is applied to one single category of property?",
  "This statute deals with one category of property. Is there another statute like this one?",
  "That was the other, the State taxes were no part of the Alaska Supreme Court's decision in this case.",
  "And on what else? In that -- in that tax that was before the port. What else did Wheeling tax?",
  "Mr. Franklin, even if you are right about that, the legislation was an emergency measure with a sunset. It was revived for 1 year, but then no more. So, didn't this suspension of Iraq's lack of immunity -- didn't the immunity come back? Didn't the bar to immunity come back again once the emergency law sunsetted?",
  "Including -- including the provision that repealed 1605(a)(7). So that would be revived?",
  "Do we have any other instance in which a jurisdictional provision is withdrawn applicable to pending cases without Congress having mentioned the jurisdictional provision at all?",
  "Were there judgments, outstanding judgments that had become final -- judgments outstanding against Iraq, that were not challenged on appeal?",
  "And you're not claiming that those could be reopened?",
  "I thought we were just told that because there -- of the limitations on enforcement, the -- there would be no realistic threat to the Iraqi assets in the United States because the judgment creditor wouldn't have access to them.",
  "Is -- is all of this -- I won't say academic, but it ultimately doesn't matter if the D.C. Circuit was right in the Acree case in saying, well, 1605(a)(7) allowed suit against Iraq, but there's no cause of action.",
  "Where the wrong occurred would have been Iraq.",
  "Wouldn't any such settlement have to take into account that Iraqi -- the Iraqi people themselves were the most numerous and probably the worst victims of the terror?",
  "You said that there should be deference to what the executive did because of his role in foreign affairs. But in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, Congress deliberately withdrew what had been the executive's traditional authority and said: President, no more; we are going to set rules of how sovereign immunity will operate.",
  "But this statute specifically short-circuits that process. It says the President may at once make inapplicable. The very purpose of it is that the normal process is going to take time, and therefore it's being replaced with an emergency measure that becomes effective immediately.",
  "But why -- why shouldn't we treat this -- yes, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act said Congress is setting the rules. But why doesn't this emergency measure effectively restore to the President under these special circumstances the power that he once had? Congress ceding back to the President back to the President for the purposes of dealing with Iraq, the authority -- the control authority he once had?",
  "But, Mr. Goldstein, before you finish your argument, I'd like to know what you think about the claim for relief. The D.C. Circuit said this is a mere jurisdictional provision, and it doesn't provide a private right of action; the new statute does, but that doesn't apply to Iraq. So, what was the source of the claim -- what is the source of these plaintiffs' claim for relief?",
  "Which -- which State law?",
  "So that -- by that reasoning, people all over the world could sue the United States in their courts alleging that the United States has engaged in cruel and inhuman treatment with respect to their nationals. The same theory would apply -- use the law of the state where the national comes from. So, it could be Iraq, could be Belgium, could be Yemen -- any place. So -- but the claim you are saying exists would be a kind of universal one, if it's -- the United States could use it, any other place in the world could, too.",
  "No. Looking to their own law.",
  "I did, and you can - -",
  "You can go back to your jurisdiction argument.",
  "Congress could pass a law.",
  "What was the year, Mr. Starr, the year of that change to the SEI from the bilingual education? What was the year of that?",
  "And yet the district court kept renewing his instruction, provide funding that reasonably relates to the cost, many, many times after the SEI became effective. And we -- we have the original decree which was, what, a declaratory judgment in 2000. Then he issues a series of order. None -- and none of them are ever appealed.",
  "Mr. Starr, can I take you back to the beginning of the 60(b) motion, because you seem to have shifted ground? The 60(b) motion as presented to the district court said that this new law passed by the Arizona legislature, 2064 -- \"2064 creates a plan for adequate funding of programs for the ELL students.\" That was the whole basis for the 60(b) motion, whether the new law was supplied adequate funding, and the Speaker of the House and the Senate intervened specifically for the purpose of defending the new law. Your current argument is detached from the new law.",
  "But that was the basis for the 64(b) motion, that 2064 provided adequate funding.",
  "Do we -- do we have the -- the intervention application in the papers before us and the 60(b) motion?",
  "Well, what is it -- No Child Left Behind I thought has a specific saving clause, \"Nothing in this part shall be construed in a manner inconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a civil right.\" And the EEOA is such a law.",
  "That was the fault of the Arizona attorney general, who told the court: You cannot deal with Nogales alone because under the Arizona Constitution the -- all -- all the school districts have to be treated equally. So, it wasn't the plaintiffs that initiated that move to make it statewide; it was in fact the Arizona attorney general.",
  "But that came in in 2000 and this case was going on for, what, eight, nine years before there was ever an argument. I mean in all of these orders that were not appealed, don't those judgments, unappealed judgments, settle anything?",
  "I didn't think there was in the district judge's declaratory judgment, spend this much on teachers aides, that much on the other. It was: You need a plan and you have to figure out how much it costs, and then you have to appropriate money that matches the cost. But the district court -- I may be wrong about this, but I thought that the original declaratory judgment didn't try to tell them what the components of that plan had to be.",
  "But he was speaking alone for years and years, and 60(b) -- and it has been said over and over again -- is not a substitute for appeal. What wasn't appealed was that Arizona is required by Federal law to determine the cost and adequately fund a statewide system of English acquisition programming.",
  "That's the new plan that we're talking about, is 20 -- there have been references -- well, now they have a new plan. Does everybody agree at least that the new plan is 2064?",
  "But couldn't the district court give them the relief to which they were entitled even if it was less than what they sought?",
  "But the district -- the district judge said that that 2064 did not have enough, it raised it to 450 or whatever. And the district court said there are three things wrong with it, the two years, using the federal funds to -- to supplant not supplement, and that the $450 figure wasn't enough. And the only way that $450 figure was going to get changed was through legislation, right?",
  "Was there - -",
  "Was there prior experience in this particular school? Were there prior occasions on which students had been strip-searched and contraband found?",
  "But you -- I thought your answer to Justice Scalia was that in the -- in the school's experience, children do hide contraband in their underwear but not in their body cavities.",
  "What was - -",
  "What was -- what was the drug involved in that case?",
  "But it certainly was not ibuprofen?",
  "You said it was a prescription drug.",
  "Yes, but he -- he was not the one who identified Redding. It was her classmate.",
  "And on that classmate's say-so -- was the classmate ever asked, well, when did you get this pill? Where did she give it to you?",
  "I mean, what place. I mean, the child is caught with the pills. She blames it on her classmate. She says: She gave them to me. Did the school ever bother to ask when in time she gave them, where in location she gave them?",
  "But it's contemporaneous with the -- with the student who blamed the other child. I'm asking if there's any link other than one child caught with the pills blurts out that it was someone else? The tip from the young man had nothing to do with Redding; it had to do with Glines.",
  "Maybe it becomes reliable as to her, but it has nothing to do with Redding.",
  "In the case, this case, the school nurse -- the pills were given to the school nurse and she identified what they were.",
  "But there has to be -- I mean, some -- the stark difference between this case and T.L.O., in addition to the intrusiveness of the search, was there was a teacher said: I caught those girls; they were smoking in the bathroom. Here we have nothing but this Glines identifying her classmate. And nothing is done to check her veracity, nothing is done to follow up on it at all. And the search is quite different from the search of a purse that doesn't touch the child's person.",
  "But an official could follow up to see whether this child -- whether there is a basis for what she said. But there were no questions asked at all.",
  "There's one aspect of this considering the reasonableness of the school administrator's behavior. In addition to not following up with Glines, after Redding was searched and nothing was found, she was put in a chair outside the vice principal's office for over 2 hours and her mother wasn't called. What was the reason for that humiliating, putting her in that humiliating situation?",
  "But how were they investigating her when they did nothing but put her in a chair outside the vice principal's office?",
  "What would be, Mr. O'Neil, the basis for the Monell claim? That would be against the school district?",
  "What would the plaintiff have to show to establish a claim under Monell?",
  "Mr. Wolf, one thing should be clarified. I don't think there's any dispute what was done in the case of both of these girls. It wasn't just that they were stripped to their underwear. They were asked to shake their bra out, to -- to shake, stretch the top of their pants and shake that out. There's no dispute, factual dispute about that, is there?",
  "There was no dispute that they asked her to shake her pants and her bra. Nobody said that they touched -- the school officials didn't touch her, that's a given. But they did ask her to shake out her underwear.",
  "Do you agree with Mr. O'Neil when he said if the drug had been cocaine, and it's well known that cocaine is carried in underwear, that then this would not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment? He gave an example of a drug where there was a custom of carrying it in a certain way.",
  "It has to be that student. It can't be that it's customary among students?",
  "But - -",
  "But wouldn't the police - -",
  "Did the Ninth Circuit - -",
  "Did the Ninth Circuit treat this as a jury question? I'm looking at page 38a. They were quite definite that that was a Fourth Amendment violation.",
  "Yes, there would. There's a Monell claim against the school district because there is no qualified immunity.",
  "Yes.",
  "Why at the start? Why isn't the time the end, when we can -- the notice of appeal is to be filed after there is a judgment. Why isn't the proper time to determine number of days to appeal when the judgment is entered? And at that point, one can see that the government has done nothing, absolutely nothing in the case. At the inception, I agree with you, we don't know what, if anything, the government is going to do. But by the time judgment is entered, we surely know.",
  "But we hear the government did nothing, not one thing.",
  "The test is -- I don't know what you mean by \"active participation\" as opposed to just plain participation. If the rule is at the time judgment is entered to determine how much time you have to file your notice of appeal, the question is, has the government done anything? And if the government has done nothing at all, then you have 30 days.",
  "Is there any advantage? I mean, a notice of appeal is the easiest document, so it's not a question that there's any labor involved in doing this. But is there any advantage to filing -- to taking the 60 days instead of the 30 days? Why would counsel want to take advantage of the extra 30 days? It isn't a question of a labor, having to write, like having to write a brief. What advantage would there be to taking the additional 30 days?",
  "How would the -- how would you know at the time of filing of the notice of appeal whether the government is thereafter going to file an amicus brief?",
  "The government is not saying it doesn't need the 60 days. It's saying you don't qualify for the 60 days, you are not the government. I don't think the government is arguing that its own time can be shortened.",
  "Can the government appeal without having intervened in the district court?",
  "Do you think that everyone -- you are relying on the government, that the government is in the caption and it's a real party in interest. Is every real party in interest a party for this purpose?",
  "There is something odd about -- plaintiffs come to the court seeking something. Defendants are -- are stuck. They're being sued. And here the United States is an involuntary plaintiff. It didn't commence this lawsuit, and I think there must be many cases where the government will say, we don't want anything to do with this.",
  "Why would the judgment have to be vacated? Even a jurisdictional issue becomes subject to preclusion once you have gone the appeal route - -",
  "So even the jurisdictional base can be precluded and not raised on collateral attack.",
  "But there are certain things the government can do, you concede, without intervening?",
  "If the government did decide to take over, the qui tam plaintiff would remain a party - -",
  "So why shouldn't it work the other way? When the government stays out, it's a party -- when the government isn't conducting the litigation, it's a party just as a qui tam plaintiff would be a party.",
  "That was pursuant to - - to an affirmative action plan, and here we're dealing with this concept under Title VII of disparate impact. And let's take for one example a test that's given by a police department, a fire department, and it -- it's a physical fitness test, and it disproportionately excludes female applicants. And when the results come in and there are no women on the eligibility list, the department reconsiders. It thinks there is something wrong with this test. It can probably test for the necessary skills in a way that will not achieve those results. Would it be similarly impermissible, similarly based on an impermissible criterion, if the department said: We're not going to -- we have got the results of that test. We're going to throw it out and substitute another that will not have those skewed results.",
  "Not more women on the force, but this test that we're giving has the effect of excluding most women, just as the high school diploma had the effect, a disproportionate effect, on one race.",
  "So they would have to go -- I take it from what you said they would have to go as far as proving a Title VII disparate impact case against themselves. They couldn't do anything short of that to prevail when it is the majority race that is complaining about discrimination.",
  "It wasn't my - -",
  "Well, that can't be right if they -- if what you just answered to Justice Kennedy is -- is right. Suppose they had very strong evidence that the test that they had given that had these results, just as my physical fitness test that excluded all women -- that had it those results, it wasn't job-related, and there was a better test available, they wouldn't have any vested right in getting the promotions under those circumstances, would they?",
  "Then why did they have the testimony before the Civil Service Board, about - - somebody from another testing company said this is a multiple choice test; it tests rote memory; we could have come up with a test that would better test the skills needed to be -- nothing about the localization, but something about command presence. There was a term used, assessment centers; that this test didn't effectively test the skills that you needed on the job, and others did.",
  "But I thought the whole idea of disparate impact is it's unintentional, that's the assumption, disparate treatment, intentional discrimination, disparate impact, unintentional, but it has askewed racial results.",
  "How do we know whether something is discriminatory or just that it will have a certain effect? Because it's in spite of. For example, the Greek standard, the employer wants everybody to have a high school diploma, he wants an upgraded working staff, was told by this Court you can't do that because you would disproportionately exclude one race.",
  "How does that - -",
  "I know you said that in your brief when you made a distinction between mere good faith and reasonable belief. So how does one determine whether the concern that the employer is expressing is really in good faith or is reasonable? What are the indicia of reasonableness?",
  "Can you be - -",
  "Can you be specific about what facts you think should be tried on remand? Because you do distance yourself from the Respondents. You are not urging affirmance of the summary judgment. You say there are or may be genuine issues of fact. So what are they?",
  "When -- when I asked that you question, you said that one issue of fact was whether the board was acting in response to improper influence, to racial politics.",
  "What -- what has New Haven done in fact? This certification was requested in March of 2004; we're now 2009. What has New Haven done in order to get lieutenants and captains in the fire department?",
  "When you say \"take away barriers,\" one thing is not a hundred percent clear. Your position is we have to do this in order to avoid Title VII disparate impact liability. Are you not reciting as a justification either the diversity in police -- policing firefighting or still overcoming a legacy of the past where fire departments were among the most notorious excluders on the basis of race? You are not -- you are not saying rectification of past discrimination? You are not saying diversity?",
  "What do you mean by - -",
  "But if it were shown that, in fact, this test was not job-related and, in fact, the majority of fire departments scotched this test years ago and substituted what most agree is a better test, even so you would say it would violate the rights of the plaintiffs you represent, even - -",
  "Even if there's strong evidence that it's not job-related and that there's a better test that doesn't produce these skewed results?",
  "But what -- what would that do to the civil service merit system that says if you pass the test you should be certified?",
  "In this - -",
  "In this case, how many of the defendants were alien? You're -- the jury is given a charge that covers all of the defendants. They're all charged with the same crime. How many of them were aliens?",
  "Then the judge wouldn't distinguish -- it would not be relevant for the -- for the defendants who were not aliens because it would have no consequences for them. So why should the judge - - even if the question could be asked, why should the judge -- the judge takes a position: It's not an element of the crime. Therefore, I'm not going to charge it, and I'm not going to confuse the jury by saying as to the defendants who are aliens, you have to find the amount.",
  "But before you go on to that, we're talking about (M)(i). It's coupled with another provision that's an offense that is described in section 21 -- 7201 of Title 26 -- that's tax evasion - - in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds 10,000. So it's the same \"in which\" construction, and there's no requirement -- to convict someone of tax evasion, the jury does not have to find the deficiency.",
  "A deficiency, but not the amount of the deficiency.",
  "But is the amount - - there's a deficiency. The jury has to find in order to find tax evasion there is a deficiency. Does it have to find that the revenue loss to the government exceeds",
  "But the problem is that there's no pattern to it, The point that Justice Souter made. If we take your position that there are a number of statutes that mention amount, some as an element, some by this, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to when the amount is there and when it isn't, and then you have these unequal results within the Federal system and in the States, so when you think -- would it make any sense for Congress to have drawn the line that way if the State happens to make -- to have the \"in which\" or if it just has fraud and deceit with no amount?",
  "But it's treating people who do the identical thing differently.",
  "But what you're saying is you're not denying that people who commit the identical theft or deceit or fraud will be treated differently depending on whether the statute under which they're convicted has this \"in which\" clause?",
  "Can we go back to my question, which I don't think you've fully answered? And that's the tax evasion situation. For any tax -- a person who is charged with tax evasion who goes to trial and is convicted, that person would not be deportable, as I understand it under your reading, because the jury is not asked to determine the amount of the deficiency.",
  "I know. You told me that most of them admit it at the plea stage. But going to trial, these are parallel provisions, and it seems to me they are meant to operate the same way.",
  "But this -- but this defendant did ask, didn't -- he asked the judge.",
  "Does the judge, when he arrives at the restitution amount, have discretion to say, as to this particular defendant, he was just an accountant with the company that was committing the fraud, he didn't put anything into his own pocket except the salary they paid him, so I'm going to exclude him from the restitution order?",
  "So in -- in my very hypothetical - -",
  "Even -- even though this defendant did not pocket any gain?",
  "What about the defendant's argument that at least as far as his admission for sentencing purposes, he did that only because otherwise the government wouldn't ask for a downward departure?",
  "But the appropriate burden of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt. That is in the second proceeding, the recidivist, the multiple offender proceeding - -",
  "-- the relationship, domestic relationship had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, which is not the standard that the BIA used.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "That's what you're talking about, the alien who is convicted of a qualifying crime, an aggravating felony, then tries - - then comes back illegally. The difference between two years and 20 years, you admit there you would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt?",
  "But they all agreed that he was mentally retarded, and that was a mitigator. They all agreed to that. But assuming you're right on issue preclusion, what more -- the State says, yes, we recognize \"mental retardation\" means you can't administer the death penalty. But what would the State show at an Atkins hearing that is not already in the record of this case? I mean why do it again?",
  "May I ask how it worked pre-Atkins when mental retardation was a mitigator? We are told that the appellate courts independently reviewed. We have a finding at the trial level that, yes, there is a mitigator mental retardation, but it doesn't overcome the aggravator, so the jury comes in with a death sentence. Then at the appellate level, is there a continuing adversary contest about whether retardation exists and, therefore, is a mitigator, or is it just the -- the judge, the appellate judge, looking over the record that has been made at trial?",
  "So -- so that the prosecutor could still argue that was unreasonable for them to find mental retardation, so there shouldn't be that mitigator?",
  "If they didn't make a finding on mental retardation, how -- how could the appellate court determine that it was a mitigator but overwhelmed by the aggravating -- what did the judge charge the jury about mitigators and aggravators?",
  "First go back to the jury. How do we know that the jury found mental retardation as a mitigator?",
  "And the Ohio Supreme Court acting years before Atkins.",
  "The -- wasn't the Ohio Supreme Court decision in this case pre-Atkins?",
  "And it was dealing with retardation as a mitigator, not retardation as conclusive that there can be no death penalty.",
  "But before you get to whether -- anything like that, you are urging issue preclusion against the winner. It was a death sentence in this case. And I am not aware of issue preclusion operating against a judgment winner. Issue preclusion is for the party who fought this out and won. Here we have a death sentence. So there - - the ultimate determination, whatever intermediate determinations might have been made on the way, like mental retardation exists and was a mitigator, the ultimate judgment is death. And I am not aware of, in all of issue preclusion, where a judgment winner is precluded.",
  "But the question is what is the issue, and an intermediate finding, say mitigation, on the way to the ultimate conclusion, life or death, is not the same issue as if retardation is found, no death penalty. It's -- it's the ultimate issue in the case that was before the Ohio Supreme Court is, do the aggravators outweigh the mitigators? That's the ultimate determination, and that's what would have preclusive effect, not the many intermediate findings that may have been made on the way to the ultimate determination of death.",
  "How do you say you have -- you don't find that in the cases when you said to me, and I think frankly you were right, that issue preclusion -- and there are many, many cases on issue preclusion -- is something that a judgment winner uses, not a judgment loser, and here the Ohio -- yes, they weighed and they found retardation, but they also found overwhelmed by the aggravating circumstances. So the ultimate determination of that, of all the courts, is death? I don't see how you get to elevate an intermediate determination -- there are many; some go for one party, some go for the other -- to become the outcome determinative factor. The outcome determinative factor is that the aggregators outweighed whatever mitigators there were.",
  "But Ashe is about somebody who was acquitted. He won. There was no doubt that he won.",
  "It didn't say anything about, well, suppose he didn't win.",
  "We have the factor that you would preclude Ohio from doing, when we expressly said that here is the rule: You can't execute the mentally retarded. However, we are going to leave it to the State to shape the procedure, and what are the elements of retardation? You would take all that away from Ohio because in a different context, the context of weighing mitigators against aggravators, the Ohio Supreme Court said there was retardation, it is mitigating; however, it was overwhelmed by the aggravators. It's an entirely different operation than, States, here's the rule; the procedure for doing it is up to you. Ohio didn't have a procedure for doing Atkins. It couldn't until Atkins was decided. And now you're saying, oh, Ohio, because you, in the context of weighing mitigators against aggravators, found this mitigator, you cannot shape the Atkins procedure as every other State can.",
  "But the incentive is vastly different, which is an important factor in issue preclusion. That is, if the prosecutor thinks that there's overwhelming evidence of the aggravators, the nature of the crime, the prosecutor is not going to care so much about, so there is mental retardation as a mitigator; but when it's a difference, when the prosecutor wants to go for the death penalty and it thinks that it's got a secure case on the atrocious matter in which the crime was committed, there isn't the same incentive to litigate as there is when it is the ultimate question, not an issue on the way to reaching the ultimate judgment.",
  "Did they admit that as a finding of fact, or did they say that mental retardation had been found as a mitigator by the Ohio Supreme Court?",
  "It was an admission; it couldn't have been a finding of fact. You said that that's what the State claimed. Where is the admission of the State in this State postconviction proceeding that Mr. Bies is mentally retarded?",
  "You told me that this - - that State conceded that the defendant was mentally retarded, and I'm -- that's what I asked you.",
  "The very next sentence is as a matter of law -- the law as it was then -- such a person may be punished by execution. So, again, it's - - the stakes are quite different.",
  "But that must have been, the page you called my attention to must have been pre-Atkins.",
  "No, no, we're back - - what you called my attention to was pre-Atkins. It was the application made to the State court before Atkins which put two sentences together. One was the record reveals defendant to be mildly mentally regarded with an IQ of about 69. As a matter of law, such a person may be punished by execution. This is all pre-Atkins. So one statement has to be read in the light of what was its significance, and it wasn't the conclusive factor at the time of that motion.",
  "Since Atkins, we're talking about - -",
  "Mr. Feinerman, but the - - the first provision that you read, sub (i), says that there will be no reimbursement if the agency has made a free appropriate public education available to the child and the parents elected to place the child in private school. But that \"if\" -- if the agency made a free appropriate public education -- and here, as I understand it, the school district said that this child was ineligible for special education.",
  "So if the child was entitled to a free appropriate public education and didn't get it, then under this sub (i), wouldn't the parents be entitled to tuition reimbursement?",
  "Well, that's your - -",
  "That's your construction. But couldn't this be read to say no reimbursement if - - the word is \"if\" -- the agency, not -- so the implication is if the agency did not make a free appropriate public education available, then - -",
  "Then -- then what happens in a case which I think is like this one, where the child doesn't receive special education because the school has determined that the child is not eligible? So the child isn't getting public education, and in the parents' view, confirmed by experts, the child is in need of special education, can't get it from the public schools, because they declared the child ineligible. What is such a parent to do?",
  "But if you can explain what the process is - -",
  "-- because Justice Scalia said the parents just went away. The school at an earlier point said this child was ineligible for special education, isn't that so? I think - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Is that hearing - -",
  "Is that hearing on eligible or not, or is it on what the IEP should be?",
  "When the school said not eligible, is there -- is that question resolved first before we ever get to the IEP?",
  "Well, wouldn't the school say, we -- we have no obligation to get up an IEP until the question of eligibility is determined?",
  "The IEP -- they did the IEP after the hearing officer was finished?",
  "Isn't it also plausible that the district will say, ten days is not a fair trial for this system, this is a child with severe learning disabilities and to give this IEP a fair chance we need ten months?",
  "How have -- how have hearing officers been proceeding? I mean, here we had a case that went to a hearing officer. There is no IEP when the hearing officer begins the process. In the - - on the eligibility or not, do hearing officers give deference to the school district and then -- so that's eligibility. At the IEP stage, do they give deference to the student?",
  "No, the hearing officer. The hearing officer is the first-level decisionmaker. And the school board gives its reasons why it thinks the child is ineligible; the parent, the reasons that the child is eligible. That's the threshold determination. On that threshold determination of eligibility, do hearing officers presume in favor of the school district?",
  "Mr. Salmons, I thought that the -- the courts, the district court, will not provide for tuition reimbursement, unless at least two things are shown. One is that the school district did not provide an adequate education for this child. And two, that the private school did, and then there are equitable considerations.",
  "So you must find both, not just that the private school was a good place, but that the school district did not offer an adequate education for the child.",
  "But procedurally we -- we know that there is a provision addressed to a court for equitable relief. The question was put before: Where does the hearing officer get the authority to order tuition reimbursement? Because the statute on which you rely for the court speaks only to the court's authority.",
  "I thought in 2001 even the parents agreed that he didn't -- that they didn't want to put him in special education?",
  "But we are talking about two different things. I think the Chief was talking about putting the child in special education, and keeping the child there for 10 days. You are talking about the school district that says \"no special education; this child is not eligible.\"",
  "And the parents -- I think you agree that the parents would have the burden of showing both that the school did not provide an adequate education, an appropriate education, and that the private school does?",
  "The district court doesn't get into the act until the hearing officer is done.",
  "And so it would be odd to have a presumption applicable in court that isn't also applicable to the hearing officer, because the court is reviewing a decision by the hearing officer.",
  "Is the department - -",
  "Does the -- does the department have a regulation that says the hearing officer may order the private school -- the parents to be reimbursed for private school tuition? Because it's not in the statute.",
  "Or there could be, I suppose, an order that any tuition in excess of a certain amount would be the parents' responsibility.",
  "Where are you reading this?",
  "But to some extent, would you concede that interpretation; that is, not only the attorney general under New York's law, but the superintendent of banks as well, has authority over mortgage lending? Would -- would you agree that the part about the bank superintendent's enforcement could not be enforced against national banks?",
  "But there is -- the provision that you are talking about, 296(a), concerns the authority of the bank superintendent as well as the authority of the attorney general; isn't that so?",
  "Just with respect to the same issue on mortgage lending where there's a concern about racial discrimination?",
  "Anything? And you agree to that?",
  "Even if the New York statute - -",
  "May we clarify one thing about the 50 jurisdictions? The attorney general from New York is not asserting authority over bank lending in Hawaii. So for each institution, I assume it's going to be two sovereigns, the OCC and the State attorney general, not 50 descending on the single -- single bank with respect to particular loans?",
  "But we come to the New York Attorney General. I see your argument that there's a certain incongruity between saying private attorneys general okay, but no public attorney general. But on the other hand, the attorney general starts out by asking for bank books and records. And high on the list of visitorial powers is the authority to demand the bank's books and records. So why isn't that -- his preliminary investigation at least, why doesn't that fit within the visitorial power bundle?",
  "But I thought it is a given in this case -- and tell me if I am wrong on this -- that the State substantive law is not pre-empted. You refer, I think, to enforcement pre-emption; that is, the State law is governing law. But the only enforcer is Federal authority; and if that's so, is there any other -- in all of Federal-State relations, any other law where the State as sovereign can prescribe but cannot enforce?",
  "But that's because - - because it's picking a rate. It's not saying there is the Federal law and it has this rate, and the State law that has that rate. Here, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, a Federal Act, undoubtedly applies. And that is proper Federal -- Federal law enforced by the Federal authorities. The State law, as this picture is drawn for us, is applicable. It's substantive law applicable to these banks, but only the Federal authority can enforce it. That seems passing strange. And do you have an example outside the -- the two you gave us in the National Bank Act where the State prescribes but the Federal authorities enforce?",
  "So do you think the same answer whether -- Justice Stevens mentioned employment discrimination. The State has reason to believe the bank is discriminating in its employment policies, and it wants to examine certain employment records in that connection. Would you say also that, although New York can prescribe its antidiscrimination in employment law, it can't enforce it?",
  "Mr. Waxman, your mention of Watters, which has been mentioned in the briefs, I think is an inaccurate description of what that opinion held. Watters dealt with a regime that was indisputably visitorial. It was a registration regime, where annual fees were paid, annual reports were filed with the State financial agency, and the State monitor could go into a lending organization any time for any reason without any suspicion of wrongdoing. The only -- so everyone agreed that was a visitorial regime. The sole question was whether the banks - - the national bank's operating subsidiary was to be equated with a division of the national bank. That was the only question provided the Court.",
  "And that was in the context of a State law that says, mortgage lending institution, you may not lend unless you register and do all the rest. That was the context of Watters. And I do not think that excerpts from that opinion should be taken out of that context, which was: You can't be in this business unless you register with us.",
  "So one could say, yes, the Federal authorities have visitorial powers, and they can go to court. But we have here that the State can prescribe, not a supervisory regime, but -- fair lending. And the State wants to go into court and say the bank is violating the State substantive law, which is applicable.",
  "Mr. Waxman, you are talking about lending. And like depositing, those are core banking activities, but today national banks have a lot of incidental -- they have authority to do things incidental to banking. Does your restriction of State enforcement extend to those matters incidental to banking?",
  "Bailout wasn't involved in those cases. And what do you do with a statute that has three categories -- the State, political subdivision, and then there's \"governmental unit\"? The district qualifies as a governmental unit. Why would Congress add that third category if the district came within \"political subdivision\"?",
  "Yes, but the -- but the statute does use the term \"governmental unit\" to encompass districts. And if they were also subdivisions, why would Congress need to add an additional category?",
  "It appears in the statute twice, suggesting that Congress had in mind three categories.",
  "There is -- the district court had some assistance from the legislative development of this latest extension. There was a proposal, was there not, to allow governmental units to bail out -- to allow anyone who was required to preclear to bail out?",
  "And what was the reason that it was resisted?",
  "The Department of Justice has -- does it -- does it not have a regulation that contradicts your reading? And hasn't that been out there -- wasn't it out there before the 2006 extension?",
  "What was the last time the district applied for preclearance, the last year?",
  "And so 2004 is the last year. So between 2004 and 2009 the district has not sought preclearance?",
  "You don't challenge -- if you have bailout, say we accept your reading of the statute, you are not contesting the constitutionality of the act if it matched your obligation to preclear with the right to bail out.",
  "But I -- I thought I just heard you say even if you got the bailout the extension for another 25 years would still be unconstitutional. Is that -- or are you saying that the accommodation, the modification, would suffice to make the statute constitutional?",
  "But there was -- but there was -- Congress fastened on that issue and it referred to second generation discrimination, which is a frequent pattern with discrimination. You start with the blatant overt discrimination, and then in time people recognize that that's -- that won't go any more, so the discrimination becomes more subtle, less easy to smoke out. But it doesn't go from blatant overt discrimination to everything is equal.",
  "But if you take the multiple devices -- take the one as simple as moving the election day so that it will coincide with the -- with the holiday of a predominantly minority college. To go after every change of that order with a section 2 lawsuit -- of the two devices, surely section 5 is more effective to smoke that out.",
  "Perhaps they -- perhaps they wouldn't if the only tool in the arsenal were section 2, if everything had to be a Federal lawsuit.",
  "What kind of coverage formula would be adequate? You are attacking Congress' preservation of the same coverage formula. But what other coverage formula could it come up with?",
  "There was -- and maybe the government will refer to it -- I thought, quite a bit of evidence comparing covered and noncovered in this record.",
  "Well, you said all that there was was a number of section 2 suits, but I think there was quite a bit more than that.",
  "In your -- in your answer you said if they used the 2004 the only State would be Hawaii. But I asked you what formula would pass if Congress wants to get at -- wants to protect the gains that have been made but are still fragile against backsliding? If that's its objective, what can it cover?",
  "We have -- we have before us the representations of the county in which the district is located, and of several of the covered jurisdictions, that they don't seek bailout because they think that the benefits, many of which have nothing to do with districting, outweigh whatever burden preclearance puts on them. It's first, bringing minority groups into the discussion of what the change will be in the first place, and then warding off the kind of examples that appear in the -- in the Louis -- I think we -- we can't impugn their integrity by saying that that host of reasons, having nothing to do with redistricting, is why they are not asking for bailout.",
  "Why - -",
  "And the number is 18 now?",
  "But the question is, do you agree that this is unlike access to buildings by people who are in wheelchairs? There has to come a point where it will end, and perhaps Congress was just picking up on what this court said a few years before in the University of Michigan law school case, this court came up with a 25-year figure so maybe Congress thought this court thinks 25 years is about right, must be about right.",
  "Well, this Court said - - -- it was not 1982, it was two thousand something. This Court thought from two thousand something 25 years was a reasonable period.",
  "The district will -- the district will never be involved in racial bloc voting for districting purposes because it doesn't -- it's boundaries don't change.",
  "Why wouldn't one construing the Act as it was passed in 2006, say, well, Congress obviously had in mind that this would be enforced consistent with this Court's decision in Shaw, this Court's decision in Miller?",
  "Mr. Olson, are you taking the position that there is no difference in the First Amendment rights of an individual? A corporation, after all, is not endowed by its creator with inalienable rights. So is there any distinction that Congress could draw between corporations and natural human beings for purposes of campaign finance?",
  "Would that include - -",
  "Would that include today's mega-corporations, where many of the investors may be foreign individuals or entities?",
  "Own many shares?",
  "Nowadays there are foreign interests, even foreign governments, that own not one share but a goodly number of shares.",
  "Could they in your view, in the view that you are putting forth, that there is no distinction between an individual and a corporation for First Amendment purposes, then any mega-corporation, even -- even if most of the investors are from abroad, Congress could not limit their spending?",
  "But what are the -- you have used the word \"prohibition,\" Mr. Olson. One answer to that is that no entity is being prohibited, that it is a question of not whether corporations can contribute but how. They can use PACs and that way we assure that the people who contribute are really supportive of the issue, of the candidate. But so the -- the corporation can give, but it has to use a PAC.",
  "Who is the \"you\"? I mean do you -- you -- those are the directors, the CEO, not the shareholders? We don't know what they think.",
  "But what about the district court's finding? Wasn't there a finding before the three-judge court that Federal officials know of and feel indebted to corporations or unions who finance ads urging their election or the defeat of their opponent? There was a finding of fact to that effect, was there not?",
  "So if -- so if they just covered large corporations, so you take out the mom and pop single shareholder - -",
  "Not 97 percent of the contributions. I mean, the contributions that count are the ones from the corporations that can amass these huge sums in their treasuries.",
  "Mr. Abrams, Times v. Sullivan was not -- did not involve overruling precedents of this Court that had been followed by this Court and others. So, I think the situation is quite different.",
  "There was no -- there was no decision of this Court, I mean - -",
  "We do tend to adhere to our precedents - -",
  "-- especially a case like Austin which was repeating the business about amassing large funds in corporate treasuries. It was not a new idea in Austin, and it was repeated after -- after Austin. But there was -- so Times v. Sullivan I think is quite distinct. The question that was posed here is, is it a proper way to resolve this case, to overrule one precedent in full and another in part?",
  "But what the Court said in Austin it also said in the NRWC case, which was I think 8 years before Austin. So Austin was not a new invention.",
  "But there have been limits on corporate spending in aid of a political campaign since the turn of the 20th century.",
  "So - -",
  "In that respect, it's unlike the union, because the -- the worker who does not want to affiliate with a union cannot have funds from his own pocket devoted to political causes. But there is no comparable check for corporations.",
  "Does that mean that unions should be taken out, because there isn't the same -- the shareholder protection interest doesn't - - there is no parallel for the union?",
  "May I ask you one question that was highlighted in the prior argument, and that was if Congress could say no TV and radio ads, could it also say no newspaper ads, no campaign biographies? Last time the answer was, yes, Congress could, but it didn't. Is that -- is that still the government's answer?",
  "But this -- this statute doesn't cover. It doesn't cover books.",
  "But that's not -- the - - the statute that we are involved in, in this case does not cover those.",
  "Justice Marshall said that he was not trying to equalize all voices in the political process. He has a sentence that says, well, that's not what the rationale of this case is.",
  "Mr. Allen, you used a term before, and I think you were right in using it - - you said, \"interlocutory review,\" but Cohen v. Beneficial is a narrow exception and it -- the theory is, it is a final judgment. It's not interlocutory. And, nowadays, the courts have 1292(b). They can certify a question, if they think it's sufficiently important and they need an answer, without pretending that it's a final judgment in the case. So, given 1292(b), shouldn't we be particularly reluctant to extend Cohen v. Beneficial to include a case of a privilege that maybe was wrongfully denied?",
  "And that's what 1292(b) was meant to deal with.",
  "It's not -- it's not a rule of efficiency. It's a firm final judgment rule that we have in the Federal system. And we are talking about a narrow exception. The exception was first declared in Cohen v. Beneficial. The question there was security for costs, yes or no? Does that -- that is a pure question of law. It doesn't depend on the variety of factual circumstances. Attorney-client is quite different because it can often be fact-bound. It depends upon this particular case. Cohen v. Beneficial was meant for the kind of question that doesn't get you into the facts. Otherwise, once you get into -- once it's a fact-bound question, you are really eroding the final judgment rule.",
  "But you are carving out an area, attorney-client privilege, as opposed to the kind of situation Cohen v. Beneficial dealt with. Here's a rule that a State has. You have to put up security for costs before you go ahead with a class action. The answer to that is either yes or no, that it either requires it or it doesn't require it. No facts at all. You just have a class action, you need security for costs. Maybe this particular case doesn't involve many facts, but there will be attorney-client privileges cases, waiver cases that surely do. So we can't take that category, attorney-client privilege, and equate it to what was the kind of question at issue in Cohen.",
  "Because those are cases that say your right is not to be tried, your right is not to be exposed to trial at all.",
  "Mr. Allen, one of the purposes, one of the -- the underpinnings of Cohen v. Beneficial is that this kind of question is not going to come up very often, but attorney-client privilege, once you say that that's open to - - everything stops while you go to the court of appeals to get that. And if you -- and if we hold the way you want us to, then a lawyer will be obligated every time she thinks that she has a valid claim to the privilege or that it hasn't been waived, she would be obligated to take an appeal which you are urging would be an appeal of right.",
  "Is there any sensible line between an invocation of the privilege, denied, and a holding that the privilege has been waived? I know in your reply brief you -- you draw some kind of a distinction between waiver of the privilege and the existence of the privilege. I didn't follow it.",
  "There is another. You are stressing the importance of the attorney-client relationship, the work of the attorney. Do you extend your position to work product? It's not privileged.",
  "But it's certainly - - it's certainly protected against disclosure.",
  "Mr. Allen has told us that there are very few cases, in fact 11 cases in I don't know how many years, in the Third Circuit.",
  "But are you suggesting that -- that Cohen itself wouldn't come out the same way today if the question of security for costs, whether State or Federal, hadn't been settled?",
  "But that is only in egregious cases.",
  "And how -- how is it - - unless the judge cooperates, it has to be criminal contempt. It wouldn't be civil contempt. The judge says, I'm not going to hold you, and - -",
  "But mandamus is supposed -- not supposed to be a run about the final judgment rule, and if -- and if Cohen v. Beneficial is available, then mandamus would not lie, right?",
  "Well, you could -- you could seek an interlocutory appeal under 1292(b).",
  "Mr. Kneedler, I think I have this right, but correct me if I am wrong. I thought in Cohen v. Beneficial, it wasn't just a question that we would like to get this legal question settled, but, in fact, for many plaintiffs if security for costs was something that the Plaintiff has to put up up front, that would be the end of the lawsuit. It would be the practical end of the lawsuit. Unlike in an attorney-client privilege, the suit goes on. So Cohen v. Beneficial wasn't simply that this was an important question unsettled under Erie, it is the practical reality that plaintiffs who had to put up security costs would be out of - -",
  "But if the defendant goes home, he can contact a lawyer. In prison he can't do that. So, if the whole idea is to protect his right to counsel, then it makes a big difference whether he's at home or in prison.",
  "In those cases, was there a considerable interval between - -",
  "It was just the break in custody? A week - -",
  "-- was enough?",
  "Suppose it's the same officer. Does -- you said in your brief and just now it was a different officer. Suppose it was the same officer?",
  "Well, you could limit it to the same police department, the same investigation, so you are not covering the waterfront of every interrogation about any crime, any place.",
  "In this -- in this case it's two years and seven months. Why should the Court take that -- a period of that length and say, well, we are going to now rule for all future cases it should be, say, six months.",
  "It would make a difference? Does it make a difference? If -- we can limit it to the same case. But here, the reason that the police came back is that they had additional evidence, and so they wanted to ask him, confront him with the new evidence. It's not the same situation that it was when he was initially questioned.",
  "Why wouldn't he think, I invoked my right to remain silent without a lawyer two years and seven months ago, I will do it again; they will have to stop questioning? Why wouldn't that be the most likely mindset of the defendant? He knew that it worked the first time. Why should it not work the second time?",
  "And that's -- you say that's Federal law. Would it make a difference if, contra what Florida held in the Hearns case, a State had typed a battery statute as a crime of violence?",
  "No, no, no. It's exactly the -- it's exactly the statute Florida has. And somebody has a plea, and we don't know from the record what the conduct was. But the State, unlike Florida, says, our battery statute for our State law purposes is a crime of violence; therefore, for our State law enhancements the person who pleads guilty to a battery offense will be deemed one who has committed a crime of violence, if that's the State law.",
  "Suppose we knew -- knew what happened. It's the same statute, and it would be possible to have a conviction for a rude touching under it. But this man, instead of pleading guilty, in fact went to trial, and we know that he beat somebody badly. If -- if that were the case, if we knew what the facts were, then would the ACCA enhancement be in order? The statute covers the waterfront from a rude touching to beating somebody to a bloody pulp. But we know, because there's been a trial, exactly what this person does, and what he does would fall under the aggressive violence, capable of doing physical injury to another.",
  "Would you just clarify an answer that you gave. You described Florida as unique, but I thought there were many States that had a codification of common law battery that would include both touching and more aggressive behavior. I thought Florida was not alone in having that kind of statute.",
  "But there have been rude touchings where there is no danger of physical injuries to the person. There have been prosecutions in Florida, I understand, for what would be considered a rude touching as opposed to an aggressive use of force that would risk physical injury.",
  "Not for recidivism. Not for recidivism purposes.",
  "But are you saying that suppose to Florida split this statute, and some states do, so one crime is a rude touching crime, and the other is the use of physical -- aggressive physical force that endangers the physical safety of another. If you have both of those statutes, I take it that you would say either one of them would fit under ACCA as a crime that has the use of physical force, because you are saying the rude touching is physical force? Even if you split off the touching from the striking, you would say that the touching falls under ACCA?",
  "And what Congress was trying to get at the worse of the worst in ACCA, the Armed Career, whatever -- that they meant to get after people who go around poking other people in a rude manner?",
  "But there are no provisions that would include domestic violence and the gun possession provision.",
  "That would allow the prosecutor's time to be excluded, right? On your theory that it starts -- the trigger is the filing of the motion, and it ends when the motion is disposed of. So the prosecutor might say, I need additional time, and that would be included in the suspension period, right?",
  "But I'm - -",
  "Yes.",
  "But the clock -- the clock would run, on your theory, during the preparation time of the defendant. It would not run during the preparation time of the prosecutor. So I don't think they are being treated the same.",
  "Right.",
  "No, no. I'm talking about the prosecutor's answer to the defense motion.",
  "One point that I would like you to clarify. I -- I understand you to take the position that the interest of justice would be the route to take, where the judge would have to stop and make a finding. In your view, would it be appropriate, assuming your interpretation of (B)(i) holds, for us to send the case back, or is it too late, because the interest of justice finding was never made?",
  "But you think it could be found. If it doesn't have to be found on the spot by the judge, when is the latest time the judge could make the interest of justice filing?",
  "So the result in your case would be that the case is dismissed, period.",
  "That would certainly encourage judges who don't want to get involved with making findings, which you have to do to satisfy interest of justice, to just say: Motion denied; I'm sorry, I'm not going to let you have the clock run while you -- you are asking me for a favor. You want time to prepare, and the clock is going to run in the meantime. Forget it. You are not going to get the extension.",
  "What must the judge - - the judge must make a finding orally or in writing. Can it just say, okay, I'm giving it to you in the interest of justice?",
  "Is -- is there any indication in the circuits that follow what seems to be the majority rule -- that is that the clock is stopped during preparation time -- that there have been excessive delays, in comparison to the -- what is it, two circuits who go the other way?",
  "What was -- what was the second point you just made, Mr. Roberts? That, even if the clock is running, you would still have an argument that you come within the 70 days because?",

  "Mr. Katyal, the Court summarily dealt with a case some years ago, American Booksellers v. Hudnut, where cities attempted to make not even a criminal offense, but the subject of a civil suit, a violent depiction -- depictions of women as sexual objects enjoying pain and humiliation and degradation. The Seventh Circuit said that that was a blatant violation of the First Amendment, to go after purveyors who show these women in the shocking, degrading photographs, and I believe we summarily affirmed.",
  "But what is a -- what is \"and the like\"? How about cockfighting? What is the difference between -- perhaps I missed something a few moments ago -- between bullfighting, cockfighting, dogfighting? You say dogfighting is included, but bullfighting -- and I don't know where you put cockfighting.",
  "But what about bullfighting? Isn't that illegal in - -",
  "Can we -- have we finished with the category of fights?",
  "What's the - -",
  "But it isn't -- it isn't -- illegal in Japan, and part of the video here were dog fights in Japan; legal where it occurred, no different from bull fighting.",
  "But that wasn't - -",
  "Mr. Katyal, there is something quite different between Ferber, because the abuse of a child is occurring at the very time. As I understand it, Mr. Stevens was not a promoter of dog fights. He was just filming them. And so the -- the - - the simultaneous abuse of the child, it occurs only because the picture is being taken. The dog fight goes on whether Mr. Stevens is there with his camera or not.",
  "Where it was legal for him to do that.",
  "It even -- what I would like you to confront is that the very taking of the picture is the offense. That's the abuse of the child. The abuse of the dog and the promotion of the fight is separate from the filming of it.",
  "Does this -- would this record support any ban? I mean, there was a real concentration on crush videos. So there is that. Is there anything else in the current record other than the crush videos?",
  "I think the government does. It says that is how you dry up the market.",
  "Is there any indication that there has been any dry-up of the market for dog fights as a result of this statute?",
  "Justice Alito suggested that until the Third Circuit's decision, that there were fewer crush videos produced. But with respect to dog fights, animal fights, is there any indication that there has been -- there have been fewer animal fights as a result of this statute?",
  "So that goes with snuff movies -- snuff movies. I don't know if they really exist, but they have been described.",
  "How many prosecutions have there been for crush videos?",
  "Do you agree with the - - with the government that it's mandatory for the district court but prohibited to the court of appeals? The government has this hybrid where, because of the public purposes served by registration, not only can but the district court should raise the failure to register on its own, but then the government says once you have a final judgment in district court, it's no longer open for the court of appeals to raise it on its own. Do you agree with that or do you say it's for the defendants to raise, and if they don't raise it, too bad?",
  "Mr. Sims, it has been pointed out that you have taken inconsistent positions. That is, back in the district court before there was a settlement, you urged before the district court that 411(a) was a jurisdictional bar and that that precluded certifying a class that included the non-registered copyright holders. You did make that argument in the district court, and now you are saying -- you are confessing error, that was wrong?",
  "The argument - -",
  "But still it's a statute and didn't this Court say in Bowles that a statutory qualification on the right to sue is generally jurisdictional?",
  "But I thought they made a distinction to distinguish the other cases, the one -- I forgot -- the one involving Criminal Rule 33, on the ground, well, that's a court rule, but when Congress makes the qualification then it's jurisdictional.",
  "I thought the Court said it was mandatory. I don't remember when they used the word \"jurisdictional.\"",
  "It'S Form 19.",
  "And that -- that, certainly, would be open. If you are correct that the Second Circuit shouldn't have cut this off at the threshold by saying it's jurisdictional, the question of the fairness of the settlement is what you were contending.",
  "So your position is that the district court really should have dismissed this case at the outset?",
  "You were candid to say that this is in a hybrid category, that the government was taking an intermediate position. Do you know of any other provision where the district court has an obligation to raise the question on its own motion that is yet not jurisdictional?",
  "Very, very limited. I think Arizona didn't say any time there's -- there's a preclusion plea, the Court can raise it on its own.",
  "What about the congressional reaction to the Second Circuit's decision? It provided that the -- there was to be no jurisdictional bar in criminal matters. Didn't -- it didn't affect jurisdiction in criminal matters, but it didn't say anything about civil matters. So isn't that some kind of reflected acceptance that in some of the civil -- in civil cases, it would be jurisdictional?",
  "In -- aren't there statutes that have exhaustion requirements, or like the EEOC filing requirement, that say, you can't sue until you have gone to X administrative agency? And those are not considered jurisdictional.",
  "I thought that -- that last sentence is just relating to the court can -- has authority to decide this particular issue, copyrightability, even though the registrant has chosen not to enter the suit. The sentence simply says, court, you have authority to decide this question.",
  "Isn't it true, though, that -- that most copyright holders, most people who write articles, freelance articles, even if it's only $65, it's not -- it's not worth it because they really don't expect to get -- they don't think anybody is going to infringe, in the first place, and if they did what establishes to be, just wouldn't be economically worthwhile? So I think it's a fact that most copyrights are not registered, isn't it?",
  "Do they -- if they are just suing, not for money but for an injunction, do they have to register before bringing an injunction suit?",
  "The -- so mingle -- rule. I think Ms. Anders answered that question. In this situation it would be appropriate for the judge to accept the waiver.",
  "If we -- if we are talking about the ordinary case, and someone sued for infringement apart from this settlement in the context that we are in, certainly it's not going to raise that question whether it's mandatory, optional or whatever. What defendant who is sued for infringement wouldn't say, judge, I'm relying on 411(a); they haven't registered their copyright; they can't sue me? I can't imagine a defendant in an ordinary copyright case who wouldn't raise it.",
  "Then let's switch to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff is in it for money, for real money, for damages, the plaintiff's going to register because then the stakes are such that $65 is well worth it, if the plaintiff thinks it can get a large infringement award.",
  "So the rulemakers got it wrong in Form 19, when they did not write 411(a) as jurisdictional. They say copy the 1331, 1338, that is jurisdictional, and then they put the certificate requirement below the line -- below the jurisdictional line. So that was -- well, that was wrong, in your judgment.",
  "I suppose, if you picked up any copyright complaint, you will see the jurisdictional allegation will say 1331, 1338, and nothing about 411.",
  "General Kagan, just as a factual matter, is there any other national memorial that consists of a solitary cross, just that one symbol and no other?",
  "Well, I was just curious as a factual matter whether this lone cross, if -- if there was any other memorial like that, and your answer is no, but there could be other religiously oriented memorials?",
  "Is the -- is the private property owner who has this designation free to destroy it after it's been designated a national memorial?",
  "Could they then substitute whatever other memorial they chose?",
  "Or would there have to be some government approval?",
  "But it wouldn't automatically require acquire a national memorial status, would it, when the government hasn't seen it, hasn't -- I thought that to get national memorial status, the government has to approve what you put up.",
  "I thought the Respondents asked to have the injunction enforced. It is typical, you get an injunction -- and I'm glad that the government has recognized that that was indeed a final decision because you appealed it to the Ninth Circuit under 1291 as a final decision. Then the question is, are you complying with the injunction. One side says, the winner -- who by the way has unquestioned standing to enforce the injunction that is now final that that party obtained -- the winner says: Court, please enforce the injunction. They are not asking for a new injunction. They say this injunction, as Justice Breyer just explained, says, do not permit the cross. The party comes in and says: Here's my injunction; court, all I want you to do is enforce it.",
  "Do you know, General Kagan, any case in which there has been a permanent injunction ordered, final, no more appeals are possible, where -- and standing was in question, raised, litigated, and decided, and then when the party who won the injunction comes to the court and says, court, please enforce the injunction, that you can say, now we can go back to square one and argue again about standing? I don't see how you can revive what has been determined by a final judgment.",
  "Well, we know it isn't that because, as I think you pointed out, the same docket number. This wasn't a new complaint. This was a motion to enforce the judgment.",
  "Yes, but the standing issue was independently important to the government, because the government can face this kind of question again, and if you right -- if you were right on the standing point -- I mean, I don't understand why the government would not have had a strong incentive to say, we want to get rid of these cases on the standing ground, we think the Court was wrong on standing. But in any case, you didn't do that, and I think that you started your argument this morning in the right place when you said, let's talk about this law. Congress said, accepting arguendo that the Court was right, here's a law that cures the constitutional defect. And that's where you were -- that's where you started your argument. Maybe you can pick up with that. But - -",
  "Who would see it, General Kagan? Who would see it? I mean, the Seventh Circuit case, it was -- it was on level ground, lots of people used the area, and I think the Seventh Circuit required a fence and a sign. But here, this cross is high on a cliff in a desolate area. And if you had a little sign, who would be -- you would have to climb up to it.",
  "Mr. Eliasberg, I thought that the Ninth Circuit the first time around had taken meticulous care to make certain that the issue of the validity of the statute would not be before the Court in the first round. Judge Kozinski wrote: \"We express no view as to whether a transfer completed under Section 8121 would pass constitutional muster, but leave this question for another day.\" That's on page 104a of the petition. And then the district judge said: Yes, I recognize the Ninth Circuit didn't touch the validity of that statute, left it for another day. The day has come. So it is for the first time that the Court is deciding the question of whether section 8121 passes constitutional muster.",
  "I think -- I think General Kagan agreed that they -- the Veterans couldn't substitute some other memorial, if it's going to be a national monument it has to have the government's approval. And the only one that has the government's approval is the cross.",
  "What about the government's argument that suppose the government took down the cross, gave it back to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, sold them the land in exchange for land of equal value, and then the Veterans said, fine, the cross was ours to begin with. Now the land is ours, so we just put it back. If that would be consistent with the injunction? The government now has nothing to do with the cross. It's all the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and it can't be regarded a sham because it was originally the Veterans of Foreign Wars who put it up, the government didn't put it up.",
  "Then we are talking about something that is rather formal rather than substantial. If -- if all the government would have to do is say, Congress, you didn't get it right. You should have just made the land swap. And then the government would take down the cross in compliance with the injunction, and then it goes right back the next day.",
  "I think General Kagan recognized that there isn't an example of a final injunction, where, after it's final as it can be, you can come back and say, but, now, I want to reargue the standing question that's already been determined. But there was something that I did want to ask you about, Judge O'Scanlon's opinion. He said, if -- if you prevail and you are right, what happens in Arlington Cemetery, where there's the Argonne Cross Memorial and the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, both right here in Arlington, what happens to them?",
  "But you didn't contest it in two. Two cases, you concede that there was in fact a conference.",
  "Yes, but the board can make rules of procedure. It can't make rules of jurisdiction. The dismissal of all these petitions was for want of jurisdiction. Now, if the board has no authority to set its jurisdiction -- and I think that's plain; Congress has that authority, not the board -- then it is required to exercise the jurisdiction that Congress gave it. So why isn't that the very first question that this Court should deal with? The board threw these cases out for want of jurisdiction. Whatever the failing was, it was not and could not be jurisdictional because the board has no authority to describe its own jurisdiction.",
  "So you say this is just a mistaken use of words, rather than -- than the board saying, under our rules, we don't have power to handle this?",
  "Do you -- do you dispute what your opponent tells us, that some panels of the board, even when there has been no conference, let alone no proof of a conference, but some panels have stayed proceedings to allow the conference to occur, and then the board will pick up?",
  "I am looking at the decision and they are all identical in this respect. The board said it has no jurisdiction to consider any of the remaining procedural or substantive issues associated with this claim. \"No jurisdiction,\" that sounds like they are saying: We have no authority to consider anything about this case; we must toss it out because there is no proof of the conference.",
  "And it's going against another panel that says, not only you don't have to have the proof, even if you didn't have the conference we are not going to throw you out. Now, there is different panels, but it is the same board. Why shouldn't the grievants here say, we don't understand this? It's conceded there was a conference, at least in two of the cases. Our buddies didn't even have a conference and this same board, a different panel, allowed them to cure it. And I can't cure it now. That is the height of arbitrary behavior by the board, it seems to me.",
  "I'm not -- I'm not talking about due process. I'm talking about conformity with the act, the act's requirement. I - -",
  "So does the board as a whole apparently, because I am looking at the instruction about joint exhibits and it tells the parties, when you are going to make a submission don't include unnecessary documents, and among things don't include things that aren't in dispute - -",
  "-- like letters requesting conferences.",
  "Then the board is telling people, I will go back a sentence: \"Representatives may wish to omit documents that are unimportant and/or irrelevant to the disposition of the dispute.\" I mean that -- that seems to me is trapping people, if the board says, please don't dump on us unnecessary paper.",
  "Then if -- then a person following this is obliged not to pay heed to this advice because if you don't put in every document, if you don't put in enough evidence of conferencing, you are going to be out and never have your grievance heard.",
  "They are not relying on it as applicable in this case. They are relying on it as the board's indication that it's sound to tell the parties, don't dump on us unnecessary paper.",
  "Some panels of the board. Other panels think this is an eminently curable defect.",
  "That's a decision on the merits. Here we are talking about a threshold barrier to even get your case heard. And that is being decided differently by different panels.",
  "And in two cases you concede that that condition was met, that there was a conference?",
  "So we are not even talking about a conference requirement. We are talking about a pleading rule, how you plead. Everybody concedes that the conference occurred in two cases.",
  "It's how you plead that.",
  "You said, on that point in your brief, that, normally, the carrier will raise the absence of conferencing as an impediment at the time the union files its notice of intent to file a submission. What is -- what is the basis? You didn't give any citation for that. You say, ordinarily, that's what the -- the carrier will -- would do, and then you are tipped off, and then you put in your evidence about conferencing. What -- what makes you -- what backs up this statement that, normally, carrier raises the absence of conferencing as an impediment at the time the union files its notice of intent?",
  "I thought your position was -- at least I thought I heard you say earlier, that these individual panels do not have rulemaking authority for the board. I'm looking at something that says, \"National Railway Adjustment Board, Uniform Rules of Procedure, Revised June 23rd.\" That's put out by the - - the board, the one that you said that is - -",
  "And I thought that your -- because there's nothing in this statute, nothing in any regulation, that gives an individual panel the right to proscribe rules of procedure that all parties to these disputes are obliged to follow.",
  "That -- that authority is vested only in the board, not in the panels.",
  "You did -- you did make an offer of proof as to - -",
  "In fact, the panel invited it and you have made it; and then the panel said sorry, it's too late, you have to do it at the time you make your initial filing.",
  "How do you decide which of the many consequences your rule would cover? I mean, you are now talking about a narrow ground, misadvice. But you are also urging that when the lawyer is silent on a matter that he should inform the defendant, that, too, is covered. But whichever way you do it, how do you -- you say certainly deportation is a consequence that the defendant should be told about. What about -- how do you distinguish that from, say, you'll lose your driver's license, you'll lose your right to vote? How do we distinguish the consequences that count and those that don't?",
  "But even -- even if we accept that, wouldn't a competent counsel, after telling him the deportation consequences, then say: But this is a case where the evidence is so strong against you, I advise you to take the plea rather than go to trial. If you go to trial, you are likely to lose and you will get a longer sentence. So does it matter in the end if competent counsel would have said, this is a good plea, take it?",
  "You were about to say that in many States the trial judge does inform a defendant who is an alien of immigration consequences.",
  "And that would be what in this case?",
  "How do you -- how do you know that? In this case, Mr. Kinnaird told us the defendant might have preferred to go to trial because he had this defense that he didn't know what was in the packages.",
  "Mr. Long, you said that this is a collateral consequence; therefore, the lawyer has no obligation to advise the client. But what was remarkable about the case that you rely on, Hill v. Lockwood, is the Eighth Circuit used the distinction between “direct” and “collateral.” In this Court, the opinion said nothing about “direct” or “collateral”; it just asked the question under Strickland, and it held that Strickland does apply to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel. But it -- staring the Court in the face was this direct versus collateral, and the Court was totally silent on that. It didn't consider it relevant to its determination.",
  "We are talking on a highly general level, but what's facing us -- this case, is there are certain crimes -- an increased number of crimes that are classified as aggravated felonies, where the rule is, if you are convicted of an aggravated felony, you are out of the country after you serve your time. There’s nothing mysterious about that. There’s nothing intricate about making that determination. So why wouldn't a lawyer whose client is an alien have an obligation, when there is an aggravated felony as the charge, to say this will be the consequence?",
  "You keep insisting on the collateral, although you recognized that in Hill v. Lockhart, the Court did not draw that line.",
  "Well, the defendant might say: I have been in the United States for 40 years. I have a family. I’d rather take my chances with a jury and get put away for a longer time because at least I'll be in prison where my children can visit me.",
  "General Cordray, under the charge that was given, what happens if there is a juror who thinks that the aggravating circumstances don't outweigh the mitigating circumstances? Under Ohio's current instruction that means no death penalty. But under the instruction that was given here, that all 12 must agree on -- on the aggravators outweighing the mitigators, what is the consequence of a failure of the jurors to agree on that question?",
  "Yes.",
  "It would be -- under the charge that was given in this case, you say it would be -- then the judge would be obliged to give one of the two life sentences. It would not be a deadlock requiring a resentencing hearing.",
  "General Cordray -­",
  "-- in reading that closing argument, it is disjointed. It goes off on tangents that have nothing to do with the sentence that the defendant is getting. I mean, it really is quite a stream of consciousness. And what's remarkable about it is at no point did counsel say, give him a life sentence. He said that either one would be acceptable, either death or life would be acceptable.",
  "Mr. Benza, do you know of any case where ineffective assistance was found on the basis of a closing argument alone? General Cordray pointed out that this lawyer had put on a number of witnesses to testify to the defendant's mental illness, and that he did play that theme in the closing. Do you know of any case where the closing, not tied to the way the case was presented at trial, was held sufficient to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel?",
  "You just told me that, under Strickland, under anything, there has been no case in which there has been a decision for the defendant, based on the inadequacy of the closing argument alone. So you are asking us to take a new tact and inviting arguments focused exclusively on the closing argument, to see if it meets the Strickland standard.",
  "Why -- why isn't it the Strickland analysis that you read the charge in the context of the case that was presented at trial, and, here, the case was. The only thing going for the defendant were the witnesses to his mental illness and whether, eloquently or not, that theme was played to the jury. This is a mentally ill man.",
  "How many -- how many issues were before the Ohio Supreme Court?",
  "So the Ohio Supreme Court, faced with 67 issues, would have to write at least a per curiam opinion on each of the 67 to insulate itself against being overturned on federal habeas?",
  "Mr. Benza, you might want to use what time is remaining to deal with the other issue, which we haven't talked about at all.",
  "How does that work? The instruction was all 12 must agree that the aggravators outweigh the mitigators before death is imposed.",
  "Mr. Frederick, if this were an ordinary civil case, we would be guided by the rule on permissive intervention, and appellate courts in dealing with that rule give a healthy measure of respect to the trial judge's determination. So even though the civil rules are not binding in original jurisdiction cases, isn't that a sound approach that we should adopt? Just as a court of appeals would defer to a district judge's decision, so we should give a healthy measure of deference to the Special Master's evaluation that this will be useful.",
  "Mr. Frederick, can we go back a little? I think you just said there was no special master's recommendation in Maryland v. Louisiana, but I'm looking at page 745. In the footnote 21, it said: \"The master recommended that we grant the motion of 17 pipeline companies to intervene as plaintiffs.\" And then it says: \"It is not unusual to permit intervention of private parties in original actions.\"",
  "Well, here the complaint was South Carolina's complaint, and these are intervenors on North Carolina's -- on North Carolina's side.",
  "And as representing the position of the United States, would you address the FERC license that Duke Energy is raising?",
  "But even in the New Jersey v. New York decision, the dissenters there that would have allowed the intervention did say that in general it is unwise to encumber original jurisdiction cases with non-State parties. That was even the dissenters. So you start out with in general it's not wise to let these people come in. And following up on the Chief's question, a State can't be sued without its consent. And it's true here that South Carolina is initiating the action, but it's initiating the action against a sister State. The Special Master's recommendation would require the State to have as its direct adversary three parties who are not a sister State, and that kind of dilutes the notion of original jurisdiction. It's a controversy between two States.",
  "That's because the State chose to sue it as a party defendant.",
  "The intervenors -- the intervenors are users of the water from the river?",
  "They -- because they use a lot of water. And my question is: How do we decide once we say -- beyond the Special Master can let these people in with party status -- what users can come in where, obviously, we are not going to allow all users of the river water to come in, so which ones can and which ones can't?",
  "Let's go back to the question of couldn't the Special Master receive the information she wants if these three entities come in as amici? Coming in as intervenors, they have full party status. They can engage in discovery. They can protract the case. They can appeal any adverse judgment. Why isn't the most reasonable accommodation to say, well, we will listen to you, but we are not going to give you full party status?",
  "Mr. Castiglione, you have been asked to address the mootness question -- both counsel.",
  "Have forfeiture proceedings occurred in the plaintiffs' cases? Is there any lingering question concerning the status of the property?",
  "Have concluded?",
  "There were no damage claims when the final judgment was entered in the district court?",
  "So it was a final judgment, and it went up on appeal. And at what point did they seek to -- I mean, while the case was in the court of appeals, the final judgment dismissing the case, there was nothing for the district judge to do.",
  "But --",
  "They did not ask for damages originally.",
  "So as the case comes to us, we have a district court final judgment dismissing the case. The case was only for injunctive relief. It goes to the Seventh Circuit. It's in that shape. We are taking the case from the Seventh Circuit.",
  "If it been there originally, but the problem is it wasn't there. The case comes to us on a complaint that is simply for injunctive relief. And that is moot.",
  "And the plaintiffs -- the plaintiffs didn't appeal the denial of certification.",
  "Well, maybe we should -- we should ask the plaintiffs about that. But you're saying that the two cases that were defaulted are not moot? Isn't a default the end of it?",
  "You said in your opening that there is just the one proceeding, and that's the petition for forfeiture. But in your brief you suggested that there is a means that these plaintiffs could get back their property pending the ultimate forfeiture proceeding. You mentioned a Slocum type hearing, a petition for return of their property. So I don't understand your argument that there's one and only procedure, the forfeiture procedure, when on the other hand you are telling us that there is a means.",
  "How do you get an expedited hearing? I thought -- I thought for property under 20,000, the State -- the time before the forfeiture proceeding could be 187 days.",
  "And the bond is for costs, not to get your car back.",
  "Is there -- is there any procedure for putting up a bond for the car so you can get the car back, for the full value of the car?",
  "There is no -- there’s no hardship under the Illinois statute? There is no provision comparable to the Federal legislation for hardship, is there?",
  "Mr. Peters, I think the Court in Geraghty said it split the interests. And they said his interests in challenging the denial of class action status continued even though he was no longer incarcerated. So they were concentrating on his right to appeal the denial of class action certification. And that's what you don't have here. And that’s what distinguishes this case from Geraghty.",
  "But we must take it as it came into the Seventh Circuit, which is no appeal from the denial of class certification. So we have individual plaintiffs who are seeking to overturn the denial of injunctive relief. And that's all that's before the Seventh Circuit.",
  "I thought that -- I thought the government said it doesn't apply to cash. So that -- which we are told is 85 percent of the seizures involved.",
  "Right.",
  "Isn't that one of the problems with the Seventh Circuit decision? That it covers the waterfront. It covers cash, as well as any property. It’s not concentrated on cars. And what your complaint asks for -- you said it was as applied, but you are asking for a declaration that defendants must hold a post-seizure probable cause hearing within 10 business days, and you are asking the Court to enjoin the defendant’s current practice of seizing property and retaining custody without a judicial determination of probable cause. That sounds, to me, like a facial challenge to this statute, and you are asking for a declaration that the statute is invalid, not as applied to any particular person.",
  "Where -- where does the Seventh Circuit --",
  "But where you said –- you said that --",
  "-- the Seventh Circuit -- your complaint, you say, is -- you asked for the universe, every kind of property of due process hearing within 10 days or a short period. But you said the Seventh Circuit narrowed the relief. And I'm looking at the Seventh Circuit decision, and I really don't see what was narrowed. I think they left everything open for the district Court.",
  "Where -- where is there any narrowing?",
  "Mr. Cohen, I thought this judge, Judge Shoob, said: These lawyers were amazingly good; I have never seen a better performance. So don't we take him at his word? I mean, he certainly talked about the quality of the performance of these lawyers.",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Cohen, you said in your brief that, in such a case, the prevailing party could argue that counsel should obtain a higher hourly rate in the litigation than the customary rate he or she charges in other cases, and that's the situation Justice Sotomayor inquired about. But that sounds to me -- you take the second-year associate, pay him at the rate of the top partner because her performance was so outstanding. That’s an enhancement, but it isn't as transparent as the one that Judge Shoob gave. But you -- this suggestion -- maybe you are going to retreat from it -- that it would be appropriate to take the second-year associate and pay at a higher hourly rate than the customary rate for that associate.",
  "But not necessarily –-",
  "But we are going back to the judge, who did say that this was the best performance he ever saw. So I can't credit just that it was just contingency. But, first, you have clarified that what you said in your brief meant only the top range for a lawyer of this, period. So this is more limited than -- than one might take it to be. In some circuits, like the D.C. Circuit, the rate is set by the number of years that the person is out of law school, and there isn't any flexibility. I mean, you give the 1-year associate so much, the 5-year associate so much. So how in a system like that could you take into account quality at all?",
  "Is -- is there another example? I mean, you -- you are saying the rule isn't never; it is sometimes. And you have given us one sometime. Is there any other illustration?",
  "How about a downward adjustment? You have the hourly rate, the number of hours, and the judge, after trimming the hours, then says: This has been a case, even though they prevailed, the lawyer wasn't prepared; I am not going to give the hourly rate. Can a judge adjust the lodestar down for poor performance?",
  "Hensley is you lost on an issue, so you don't get paid for what you’ve done.",
  "But the plaintiff -- the plaintiff prevailed on everything. It’s just that the judge said this was a really poor -- poor performance.",
  "But Mr. Cohen said that that would be a very limited adjustment. He wasn't contemplating in his suggestion in his brief that you could go outside what the associate would get; you just go to the top. Let's say it could be 200 to 400, you give him 400, but you don't give him 500. Justice Alito asked -- he was concerned about standard list enhancements, so one question is when do you enhance? Another is, in this case it was 75 percent. How do you know what's the right multiplier? That -- the concern is you are going to have variations from district judge to district judge in how good the performance was, in what is the appropriate multiplier. Are there any handles that would prevent this from becoming just random, just rudderless?",
  "But this is a procedural standard that has a manifestly substantive purpose, which is to restrict recoveries of penalties. In that sense, it's like a cap on damages. And if you're right, then the purpose that New York had would be completely undermined, because what lawyer would bring a $500 case in State court when she could bring a $5 million case in Federal court?",
  "They didn't want to have class actions.",
  "And how is it different from Cohen v. Beneficial, the security for costs? Procedural in one sense, but with a definite substantive purpose in mind; that is, to restrict derivative actions.",
  "You could say just as well here that the question isn't addressed by the Federal rules. If New York wants to say this kind of claim can be brought only as an individual action, not as a class action, why shouldn't the Federal court say that's perfectly fine; this class of cases can't be brought as a class action; we respect the State's position on that. Why should we as a Federal court in a diversity case create a claim that the –- that the State never created?",
  "This Court in its recent decisions has been sensitive to not overriding State limitations, and so has read the Federal rule to avoid the conflict. Gasperini is one such case with regard to Rule 59, interpreted so that you do not collide with the State policy, and the same thing with Semtek with Rule 41(b). The Federal rule is interpreted so as not to conflict with the State policy.",
  "But there wasn't a cap on damages in Gasperini. It wasn't a cap. It was --",
  "It was that we want the courts to exercise a role in checking these damages so they won't be excessive.",
  "So suppose in this case the New York legislature, instead of having a statute that covered penalties generally, minimum recoveries generally, wrote into each statute, each penalty statute, each minimal recovery statute, that this suit must -- may not be brought as a class action -- instead of having an encompassing statute that covered all of them, wrote into each individual statute that limitation.",
  "So you -- are you telling me that even if New York had provided for a specific penalty for a specific matter, the Federal court could disregard that and make it a class action, even if the State that created the right said, this is a right for an individual only?",
  "Are you saying that even if it -- then you are telling me it doesn't make any difference whether they do it across the board, as they did here, or in each penalty statute it says no class action.",
  "Well, does it or not? I mean, it presented you -- here's a case that says: You can sue for this penalty but only in an individual action.",
  "So you are saying that even if New York didn't use this shorthand, even if they incorporated it into each penalty statute, your answer would be the same --",
  "There is no New York Court of Appeals decision to that effect?",
  "It depends upon the persuasiveness of the reasoning of the court.",
  "Because the statute may put forth both a substantive policy and a procedural policy. I'll give you a concrete example. New York establishes a claim and says in the statute: But this sort of claim has to be brought within 1 year. Then New York gets a similar claim under another State's law, and it says, even though we applied our -- even though our statute applies to our own law in a substantive way -- that is, it says you have no action after a certain amount of time –- we don't want our courts to be cluttered with claims from out of State when we wouldn't entertain similar claims in our own State. That is certainly the way statutes of limitations have been interpreted by a number of States as having both a procedural aspect and a substantive aspect.",
  "Well, that is not altogether true, because there was always recognition that a so-called built-in statute of limitations was substantive.",
  "I thought Byrd turned on the characteristics of a Federal court and that is the judge/jury relationship.",
  "Well, it wouldn't matter what the answer to that was, with the Seventh Amendment looming over that case.",
  "How is it different from security for costs? I mean, that's what I started with. That's -- there's nothing in the Federal rules that say security for costs.",
  "Without the bond, the remedy would be -- I don't -- this is a plaintiff that had to put up security for costs.",
  "New York doesn't have -- as the -- the question that Justice Sotomayor asked and that Justice Stevens asked -- doesn't have any anti-class action as a procedural policy. It has picked out a particular kind of action, one for a penalty, one where there’s -- what is it -- minimum recovery, and said that category, we have -- we're not anti-class action in general, but these penalties that we created, we don't want those brought as class actions.",
  "One -- one question that was raised by the other side is, well, if you're saying this kind of restriction -- restriction on class action -- applies in a diversity case, why not a State that says we love class actions and we want class actions to be -- not to be hemmed in by all of the Rule 23 requirements?",
  "But it could be -- it could be, as I -- the example of the statute of limitations. We create a claim. It has a certain life. It's dead after that time. That's New York law. A sister State may say, we create the same claim, but we think it has a longer life. New York would say, that's fine. Bring that claim in your own State. Don't clutter up our courts with out-of-State claims when we would not hear the identical claim under our own law. There are policies that do operate as procedural limitations and have a substantive thrust.",
  "New York might well say, look, we don't hear in New York penalty cases, and so we are not going to entertain the sister State claim for any -- when we wouldn't entertain our own. We are not frustrating the sister State. They could bring the class action there, but not in -- not in our courts.",
  "Well, they -- they bring up the Class Action Fairness Act, which allows a plaintiff -- they allow a defendant to remove a class action from a State court to a Federal court, but they also allow a plaintiff to initiate an action in the Federal court.",
  "There -- when you are dealing with a Federal statute, there’s a -- there’s a factor that doesn't come up when you are dealing with sister States, and that is the Supremacy Clause. If Congress has made a judgment -- let's say 1983 -- I don't think the State that says, for our comparable claims, we don't allow class action could -- could apply that --",
  "I can't see how that's so when they limit just a particular remedy or penalty. If they were saying, well, across the board we don't want class actions, I could follow your argument much better. But when New York singles out penalties, it seems to be talking not about the efficiency and fairness of proceedings, but that it doesn't want penalty claims to be magnified.",
  "But it didn't say that about Rule 59, and it didn't say that about Rule 41(b).",
  "But there was in this record, was there not, a submission by the adviser comparing what mutual funds this fund was charged, what institutional funds were charged, but explaining the differential in terms of the services provided, that more services were provided to the fund and less services were provided to the institutional investors.",
  "Who would have the burden? You said that is an issue that has not been decided, it's a disputed issue of fact, appropriate for remand. Who -- would you have the burden if they came forward and said, look, this is what our situation is. These are the services. Would you have the burden to show that in fact they were comparable and the differences did not warrant the differences in the fee?",
  "You would have the burden?",
  "Has it filed any?",
  "Mr. Gannon, the -- all the circumstances, that comes from the Second Circuit's Gartenberg case?",
  "But in -- in that case, at least there was a footnote that seemed to say, you don't have to engage in a -- in the comparison with what institutional investors are paid.",
  "But the -- the fund adviser here -- I mean, the investment adviser did disclose -- that's in the record -- did disclose the difference between what were charged mutual funds, what were charged institutional investors, and then explained that the services were different and that justified the difference. But they weren't trying to think, no, we don't have to come forward with this information.",
  "But did -- but in the Seventh Circuit, Judge Easterbrook said, mainly you have to look to see if there was full disclosure, and then there might be cases where it's so out of line. And he said the comparison would be to other mutual funds. He excluded the comparison with institutional investors. So to that extent, was the Second Circuit wrong, saying this is not a relevant factor; what other mutual funds pay investment advisors may be a relevant factor?",
  "What about the petitioners' allegation that the investment adviser did not provide full and accurate information? And they mention particularly concerning economies of scale, profitability, and several other matters, that what everybody agrees is necessary, full disclosure, had not occurred. Is that a disputed issue of fact or of further inquiry?",
  "I didn't understand the Third Circuit rule to equate discretion with inadequacy. I thought their position was -- the assertion was that the rule was mandatory; that is, if you are fugitives, you are out forever. But in fact, at the time that Kindler fled, the rule was discretionary, so the mandatory rule hadn't been firmly established. That's what I thought the Third Circuit held. It did not equate discretion with inadequacy.",
  "But the fugitive - forfeiture rule that they were talking about was the - - the mandatory rule wasn't firmly established.",
  "You mean that the defendant might not have escaped if he knew that the rule wasn't - -",
  "But the question that you present -- I mean, you state it forthrightly in your brief, and I'm reading from page 7, you say: \"The court of appeals interpreted this Court's precedent to compel a finding of inadequacy for any State procedural rule that permits the State courts to exercise a degree of discretion. Any discretion is inadequate.\" That's what you say the court of appeals interpreted this Court's precedent to say: Discretion, inadequate. Well, I'm looking first at the petition appendix page 62, which describes the district court's understanding, which the Third Circuit affirmed. It says: \"An occasional act of grace by a State court in excusing or disregarding a State procedural rule does not render the rule inadequate to procedurally bar advancing a habeas claim in district court.\" Well, that's saying, yes, you can have a rule with discretion, not to follow the rule woodenly, and that doesn't make it inadequate.",
  "Well, do you want to modify then what you said? You said that the court of appeals said that any -- any degree of discretion means that the rule is inadequate.",
  "But what makes -- makes this particularly puzzling is you are attributing a rule to the Third Circuit that that very circuit in Campbell v. Burris said was not a tool. In the -- in Campbell v. Burris, the Third Circuit said a State procedural rule can't be, cannot be rendered per se inadequate merely because it allows for some exercise of discretion.",
  "Well, it would be really odd, considering that one member of the panel was on both cases, Stapleton, and these cases are in the same year, for at least that judge not to think that what he said in the one case was in no conflict with what he said in the other.",
  "Well, what's the interest in not applying this in this case? As you say, that's a fine rule. If you are a fugitive, you are out. You say that wasn't the rule at the time he escaped. But you are not asserting any reliance interest by the escapee, that, gee, if I knew that the rule was going to be mandatory, I wouldn't have a chance to appeal to the discretion, I wouldn't have escaped. There is no -- there is no absence of notice that -- that matters. I mean, if he had notice he would have still escaped, I assume.",
  "But you just said that it would be okay to have a rule going forward that if you are a fugitive, you are out.",
  "There is a certain irony that the case you're relying on on the merits is Mills, where if he hadn't escaped he would have gone through the whole process before Mills was decided.",
  "Mr. Goldblatt, I thought that what she said -- I'm looking at Schedule C, property claimed as exempt. She lists, as property claimed as exempt, \"See attached list of business equipment.\" And then we have an inventory going for several handwritten pages of all these items of kitchen equipment. And that's what she says is the property claimed as exempt.",
  "But she -- in her inventory, she gives figures, and they add up to the amount that she's claiming, so she evidently thinks that those numbers will cover all of her business equipment.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Goldblatt, this is -- this is really my concern. It seems what she wants is her cooking equipment, not the money equivalent. And if the trustee had objected, she could have said: Well, if they think that this cooking equipment is worth more than the value that I put down, I'll cut out the coffee maker, I'll cut out the microwave; but what I want is the equipment, not the dollar -- dollars for it.",
  "Then you're going through all the administrative expenses of having an auction where if the trustee had tipped her off, it would be like amending your pleading.",
  "And she was so -- so upset, she said: I'll get out of the bankruptcy; I want my cooking equipment.",
  "It was very clear that that's what the debtor wanted.",
  "The question is whether -- the question is whether the trustee had to make an objection, when it seemed really as clear as could be that what she was seeking was to keep her equipment, not to get the -- some monetary equivalent for it.",
  "Well, then she has -- on your reading, her claim is improper because she's claiming more than she's entitled to. If her claim is improper, then the trustee has an obligation to object to it.",
  "Can you -- can you -- that was -- what you've just said, no requirement that the trustee object to valuation, one of the briefs -- it may have been wrong, but it's the NACBA brief at page 27 -- said \"Challenges to valuation are the most common types of objections to exemptions.\"",
  "My concern is keeping it simple, giving fair notice to people. She's got the same amount under exempt -- the last two columns. A rule is proposed. It says when the two columns have the same amount, that's a clue to the trustee that the debtor is claiming all of the -- that particular property. That's a nice, simple rule. It tells the trustee when he has to object, and the end of the matter.",
  "But it's not in kind in the sense that she keeps the asset no matter what.",
  "She is contending that she would like to keep her cooking equipment and she was entitled to notice before it's going to be sold at an auction.",
  "Then -- then her claim is wrong, her claim is objectionable, and the trustee should have made an objection.",
  "If it's not the asset itself and it's just about money, here I have a piece of property and it wouldn't matter whether it was a case of widgets or my grandmother's diamond ring. But Congress -- this is a peculiar list it has. It has personal jewelry, tools of trade. It sounds like -- even though those have a dollar cap, it sounds like Congress said these are the kinds of things a debtor would want to keep in kind.",
  "What she did do, she said: That unsettles me so much that I'm going to withdraw from this bankruptcy proceeding; beyond anything, I want to keep that -- that property.",
  "But the -- but the Bankruptcy Court did that simultaneously with saying: And I'm going to deny the trustee's motion to have an auction.",
  "What she could have done is trimmed some items from the list.",
  "That's much less informative than if she said -- I mean, here she -- she has one list that’s showing what she paid for it. She makes her best guess. It's -- you're suggesting that she would be entitled to the notice if she put down \"unknown,\" \"value unknown\" or \"value 100 percent.\" So your -- on your theory, in order to do what she obviously wants to do, preserve her kitchen equipment, she has to give no information or inaccurate information. If she said -- I think what you're saying is if she said a 100 percent, instead of saying what she thought was the -- the value, or if she said unknown, she would be entitled to notice from -- to an objection from the trustee. But because she has tried her best to put down what the form calls for, she doesn't get any objection from the trustee.",
  "Would she --",
  "Now, can you elaborate on this additional -- she -- you said she could have listed something that came to a higher number. Are you talking about the part of the leftover of the wildcard exemption that she -- she used it for food, didn't she?",
  "Do we know what -- what’s --",
  "Here I thought that the trustee got the appraisal before the creditors’ meeting, because at the creditors’ meeting he said to her, you put down, what, 10,000; I have an estimate that says",
  "Mr. Brunstad, do we know what is the division among bankruptcy judges on this issue? I mean, you are urging that when those columns 3 and 4 match, that's a tip-off that the debtor is claiming the entire property is exempt. Do we know what is the lay of the land among bankruptcy judges?",
  "But this debtor did know at the creditors’ meeting -- she certainly knew that the trustee was claiming the property was worth more than what she listed it as being worth. She could have, at that point -- so she had the notice of what he was thinking. She could have, at that point, said, I will remove as many items as necessary to bring me safely within the limit. She didn't do that.",
  "Mr. Lamken, you're not a challenger?",
  "Yes. I think --",
  "-- the question relates to the other side --",
  "-- not to his side --",
  "Of course, there is. What's -- what’s really lurking behind this case is whether this is a contract rate, and there FERC disagrees with you, I take it. You were talking about that the rate that emerges from a contract between two people –- nobody else is party to it, but you say the rate stands; FERC cannot abrogate the rate; nobody can ask FERC to abrogate that bilateral contract rate. But here we're not talking about a bilateral contract, where how many people were involved in the settlement? Well over a hundred.",
  "So that's quite a different picture than the bilateral contracts that were at issue in Sierra and Mobile.",
  "The court of appeals never got to what FERC thinks is the heart of the case, whether this is a contract rate, whether -- you say it is not -- and whether FERC has the authority nonetheless to apply the public interest standard. But none of those have been addressed by the D.C. Circuit.",
  "But that's what the court of appeals decided. Their simple question was Mobile-Sierra binds the contracting parties, and it doesn't -- the rate doesn't stick for anybody else. That's all they decided. And the question that you're asking certainly is looming over this whole case, but it isn't presented to us because it wasn't even dealt with in any way, shape, or manner by the D.C. Circuit.",
  "But I thought one large difference -- I thought Justice Scalia suggested that the rate negotiated by -- in that bilateral agreement, that that rate would not be subject to just and reasonable attack by anyone, that the public interest standard attaches to that rate and FERC can't abrogate it. It's a rate that's set, it's binding on FERC, and FERC presumably, because it has no authority to abrogate it, could not entertain any complaint that would ask to have it abrogated.",
  "I didn't -- I didn’t follow. I didn't think there was -- was there a Memphis clause in this settlement?",
  "Why shouldn’t we tell them that, and then they can pick it up from there?",
  "Because what they did say could be -- have heavy consequences. We know that that has already happened. FERC has revised a number of contracts to conform to the D.C. Circuit's idea that it's the parties to the -- to the contract, not the rate that's sheltered by Mobile-Sierra. That's a very consequential decision, and so we would tell the D.C. Circuit, if we agreed with FERC and the Petitioners on that: D.C. Circuit, you've got that wrong. Now, there may be other matters, other issues like the ones that you would like us to decide as a matter of first view, but as Justice Scalia has pointed out more than once, we have a question. It is the very question that the D.C. Circuit decided. Why should we go beyond that?",
  "That's a third standard between just and reasonable and public interest? You want us to add another tier?",
  "But you are defending the D.C. Circuit's decision? I mean, you are up here saying that was the right judgment, Sierra-Mobile -- Mobile-Sierra has to do with the two contracting parties. It doesn't, as the counterargument goes, shelter the rate from any attack by anyone, including FERC. It's put in terms of FERC cannot abrogate that rate. But your -- you are defending the position that it's just as between the contracting parties; it's not the rate itself that is sheltered by Mobile-Sierra, because that's what the D.C. Circuit decided?",
  "It didn't say that.",
  "I thought the status of taxes owing for wire fraud purposes was settled in Pasquantino. There it was a question of alcohol taxes owed to Canada. There were taxes due, but not paid. So why doesn't Pasquantino settle at least the property question that taxes owed to a sovereign qualify as property?",
  "Well, there are certainly differences from this case, and it wasn't a RICO case, either. But why would the determination of what - - whether an amount owed to a government qualifies as property, why wouldn't -- why would that answer differ?",
  "There was no assessment by Canada in the Pasquantino case.",
  "They said the -- the defendant was smuggling liquor into Canada and getting it there without paying the Canadians' exorbitant taxes.",
  "But we're talking about -- only about property, not standing or anything else. And in Pasquantino, the Court said that a scheme aimed -- aimed at depriving Canada of money to which it was entitled by law qualifies as property for wire fraud purposes.",
  "It was injured because it couldn't find its citizens because it didn't know who they were. And that was the whole idea of the Jenkins Act, was to help States find the people who were evading the payment of the use tax on the cigarettes.",
  "Can you go back to the question I had asked you and was not finished getting your position on. Jenkins requires report to the State. You say the city was not within the zone of interest. But from the point of view of the sellers, the out-of-state sellers of cigarettes, my goodness, would they really want not only to have the burden of sending a list of names to the State, but to every county and municipality? Isn't it the -- just as it is in New York, there is a working relationship. The State gets all the names, and then it sends the names to the cities. You -- you -- I -- you're suggesting that it would be okay if the Jenkins Act had made it even more burdensome to the cigarette sellers by saying not only do you have to disclose to the State but also to any municipality that independently taxes cigarettes?",
  "Is it -- we're told that New York City and New York State have a tax information - sharing agreement pursuant to which the State does share this information with the city.",
  "How many people who buy cigarettes out of State come back to their home State and voluntarily pay the use tax?",
  "But it needs the names so it can collect anything. Otherwise, how is it -- how - - how would it ever know?",
  "And they don't.",
  "Do we know if these Jenkins Act lists -- are they in fact maintained by the State?",
  "Yes, but Congress said - - we were just told by counsel for the Petitioner, Congress said you can only -- only the Federal prosecutor can sue for violations of Jenkins - -",
  "-- not New York City, not New York State - -",
  "-- and it's a misdemeanor.",
  "And now you -- you are saying the Jenkins Act gives you a basis to go after what are basically aiders and abettors of use tax violations?",
  "But do you know -- do we know that? Do we know whether the Petitioner has in fact filed the Jenkins Act report with New York State?",
  "Do we know -- you gave an instance in your brief or two instances of successful attempts to recoup from the taxpayer, that is the cigarette buyer. Did those come about because the city received the Jenkins Act list from the State? How did the city get - -",
  "Why is what they're doing any different from what out-of-State mail order houses have done in -- they set -- they set up in States without a sales tax, they ship into a State that has a compensating use tax, that, apart from automobiles, I don't know is ever collected.",
  "Judge Winter in the Second Circuit said the State appears uninterested in enforcing the Jenkins Act and may not collate or maintain accurate records of reports from out-of-State vendors. What -- what was the basis for his statement that the State appears uninterested?",
  "Does that mean that, even if we were dealing with police officers who did what the prosecutors were alleged to have done at the investigation stage, no prosecutor, only police investigators, the fact that a trial and a conviction had occurred would mean that the police officers were not liable, either?",
  "I'm not sure that I fully grasp your answer to my first question and to Justice Kennedy's, that is, yes or no, if everything that happened was alleged to have happened, but it was done by a police officer or a different prosecutor, nonetheless, the trial went on, the fabricated evidence was introduced, without any participation by the actual prosecutor in that fabrication, does a conviction - - does the -- do the police officers or the prosecutors that was not involved in the trial get absolute -- are they -- are they no more liable, not because they have absolute immunity, but because the trial and conviction at which the evidence was used overtakes what liability they might have had, absent the trial? Is that your position?",
  "But it's strange to say you can have a prosecutor, who wasn't involved in the trial, would have liability, but as long as the prosecutor, in effect, turns the investigatory stage material over to himself, rather than to another prosecutor, then there's absolute immunity.",
  "No, but the -- the question is not at trial, nothing about trial. It's the pretrial conduct.",
  "But you said that there -- that there would be liability, as long as it wasn't the same person involved in the investigation and the trial. Even though there had been a trial, you say -- you answered Justice Scalia, that those people separated from the trial would be liable, even though there was a trial, and it's at issue.",
  "What about the view that Judge Fairchild expressed very simply. He said if this fabrication had not occurred, there never would have been any trial.",
  "Was there no injury in the period before? Let's leave out the trial for a moment. There was a deprivation of liberty during the investigatory stage.",
  "I want, before you're finished, to get a clear picture of your view of the dimensions of the claim because you rely heavily on the trial part. Everything proceeds as it was alleged to have proceeded in this case, except that just before the trial begins, Harris comes forward and said it was all a pack of lies, and so there is no trial.",
  "Is anyone in this picture liable? The defendants have been incarcerated for some time, but when it blows up, they're let out. No trial, but everything else, the same.",
  "You said -- I think your position is that due process begins when trial is underway, and before that due process doesn't enter the picture?",
  "When did that come up? I thought that the facts as the Eleventh Circuit presented them is that the senior lawyer first said: We want Dr. Kirkland's report not simply on the question of insanity and incompetence to stand trial, but also to give us leads to mitigating evidence. So mitigation is in his mind about looking into this mental question. He reads Kirkland's report and, for whatever reason, decides this isn't worth pursuing; this is not going to help us. I thought that that's what the Eleventh Circuit said was the picture, that whether it was an incompetent, ineffective decision is a separate question, but as to what happened, why did the investigation stop, because the senior lawyer said: Yes, it's relevant to mitigation, but I looked at the report and I think it's not wise for us to pursue mitigation.",
  "Where is that? 56?",
  "I'm sorry that I don't have that appendix with me now, but as I recall the Eleventh Circuit was not making any independent determination of its own, but it was reporting what the senior lawyer -- his view of it. They were not making a fact-finding as a tribunal.",
  "That, what you said so far, leaves out one thing; that is, I thought that Dozier had said: We need, we have to get this Kirkland report, and it's of interest to us for three purposes, the two that were relevant to the guilt phase and the one, mitigation, that was relevant to the penalty phase. That suggests that in his mind, in Dozier's mind from the start, was both phases, the guilt phase and with respect to mitigation. And then he looked in the report and, having said, we should see if there's any leads to mitigation, then he next says, we're not going forward with this.",
  "Now this case, for me at least, is terribly confusing, because I thought, reading the cert position, that the Court granted cert to deal with a legal question that has confused the lower courts, that is, what is the relationship between (d)(2) and (e)(1) of AEDPA?",
  "Now I read your brief and I hear what you're saying so far. It seems to be that you have a solid case under (d)(1); that is, that these counsel were ineffective because they did not pursue mental state mitigation. But that would be a much different -- that would be a fact-bound case tied to this record, as apart from the legal question: What does unreasonable -- the (d)(2) unreasonableness, how does it relate to the (e)(1) presumed correct, clear and convincing evidence? I thought that that legal question was why we granted cert.",
  "And that's -- that's what the Ninth Circuit position developed by Judge Kozinski.",
  "The only problem with that, it would shrink the province of (e)(1) very considerably, because overwhelmingly Federal habeas petitioners do not get evidentiary hearings in Federal court. So, if we accept the Ninth Circuit's view of it, then (e) -- (e)(1) applies to a rather small category of cases; i.e., cases in which there is an evidentiary hearing in the Federal habeas proceeding.",
  "I'm -- I'm not talking about (d)(2) now. We're talking about two provisions, trying to make sense how do they relate to each other.",
  "And one very well-presented position is the Ninth Circuit's in Judge Kozinski's opinion. My only question is am I right to say that his view, which is your view, would leave very little work for (e)(1) to do if (e)(1) applies only when there's new evidence coming in; it's not just the -- the record that was made in the State court, but new evidence coming in in the Federal habeas.",
  "There are not -- not many cases.",
  "What you're saying is (d)(2) is a vigorous standard, but, yes, your description, unlike the opposing description of the relationship between these two - -",
  "-- does leave for (e)(1) this maybe 10 percent of the cases, not more.",
  "I -- I didn't - -",
  "I just want -- I just described the Ninth Circuit decision. I didn't say it was wrong.",
  "I don't understand that. I thought that your -- your position in this case or at least one of your positions is there was no unreasonable determination of fact. Period.",
  "If you're right about that then you win, and there's no reason in the world to go on to (e)(1), that this case in your view should be totally governed by (d)(2), that is, the determinations of fact were reasonable. End of case.",
  "Somebody said it was put in his mouth, the question was on cross-examination.",
  "Are you urging that in all cases, including homicide cases? Or are you drawing the line at homicide?",
  "Is it a fact that --",
  "That’s the other case.",
  "Is there any difference in the terms of incarceration making this harsher than otherwise? I think you suggested in -- in your brief that educational and vocational training is not given to people who are in for life without parole because they will never be out on the street so they don't need to be transitioned back.",
  "My question is, first, you say that they are not available.",
  "Is that -- that’s so?",
  "So what are the terms of incarceration? They just stay in their cells and –-",
  "Is there -- is there disproportionality review generally in Florida and particularly for juvenile offenders?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, that's what I meant, whether you'd have to create a -- a procedure that does not exist in Florida for proportionality review.",
  "But there is a problem with that argument in this case, because the sentencing judge made it quite plain that he was treating Graham as a recidivist, not as a first-time offender. He said -- Graham got a very light sentence, just 12 months in detention and then 3 years' probation, and the judge said: Now, you better toe the line or else you could be put away for a long time. And then he committed -- it really was –- the sentence was for the later activities, even though they weren't proved beyond a reasonable doubt. I think that Graham admitted to a couple of -- to more armed robberies. Isn't that so?",
  "Did that --",
  "That's -- that's one of the problems, is the individual sentencing judge might think that Graham is a very bad individual, but the prosecutor had a different judgment of it. And Florida doesn't have any kind of proportionality review, doesn't have any review -- appellate review of the sentences.",
  "This judge, I think, surprised everyone in the courtroom with the -- with the sentence. Certainly it was far beyond what the prosecutor recommended.",
  "You have no one? What was your answer?",
  "Do we know why the co-perpetrators got so -- their sentences were dramatically lower. Do we know why that was so?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Because he assisted the prosecutor.",
  "I didn't think he --",
  "For this very offense, this home invasion, I didn't think that anyone other than Graham had gotten life without parole.",
  "Did he -- how do you answer the argument that unlike an adult, because of the immaturity, you can't really judge a person -- judge a teenager at the point of sentencing? That it's only after a period of time has gone by, and you see, has this person overcome those youthful disabilities? That's why a proportionality review on the spot doesn't accommodate the -- what is the driving force of the -- your -- the Petitioner's argument is that you can't make a judgment until years later to see how that person has -- has done.",
  "But Florida does -- and every State -- recognize the difference between an adult and a minor. And you have to make the line. We have it at 18. But think of the teenager can't drink, can't drive, can't marry. There are so many limitations on children just because they are children.",
  "But they don't make it on a case-by-case basis. They say no juvenile can drink -- no juvenile.",
  "I thought the question is: Will the difference between life with parole and life without parole deter anybody? I mean any -- that -- that's what we are talking about. And I don't think you really were urging that that difference will deter the teenager so he might think, oh, if I commit this violent crime, then I will have life without parole.",
  "I thought that there was a parole system still functioning, so -- although it will be phased out over time, but for people who were incarcerated under the old regime -- and I think the suggestion was that that system would take care of the handful of people, not more than that, that this decision would involve.",
  "Mr. Stevenson, there’s a serious question before we get to the particulars of this case. Justice Kennedy suggested it in the last argument. This -- the time ran out for postconviction relief in 1993, and this petition is brought in 2007. There’s a 2-year statute of limitations. Florida said there’s a procedural bar; we don't get to the merits of this case.",
  "They said there's a question whether that means an illegal sentence, like the judge gave more than the maximum punishment. Do you have any indication in Florida law that correcting a sentence any time overtakes the limitation on postconviction relief?",
  "Let me -- let me --",
  "But this judge said: Yes, there’s a Federal question in this case: Does Roper render unconstitutional life without parole for juveniles? He answered that question: no. And then he said: There is no other Federal question in the case; I do not reach the question that you are raising, that is, life without parole being cruel and unusual. All -- the only Federal question that, under our rules, I reach is, does Roper cover this case? No. Anything else is procedurally barred. What was wrong with that?",
  "I thought -- I thought Simmons got life without parole. I thought that Simmons's sentence was life without parole.",
  "Then that would completely overtake the specific provision. I mean, if you say the catchall illegal sentence, open to challenge at any time, then there’s nothing left to the specific provision that says 2-year statute of limitations, unless three things.",
  "But that would leave out Graham, then? Your rule, you say under the age of 14, so you are distinguishing your case from Graham's? You are not saying all juveniles, just -- you are setting the line at 14?",
  "Why not Thompson, where the line was 16?",
  "What -- what about a homicide, a 13-year-old?",
  "But you -- you are differentiating your position based on young age from Graham's counsel, who said for murder, even in the case of a youthful offender, life without parole is an appropriate -- is an available sentence?",
  "Maybe if you raise the -- raise the lectern a bit -- no, the other way.",
  "I'm sorry, which one?",
  "Can you tell -- tell us something about that catchall that says an illegal sentence can be reopened at any time, illegal sentence? What -- Mr. Stevenson said that is not limited to just -- the maximum is 15 years and the defendant got 20.",
  "Now, what -- during the -- during the time, the postconviction period, would he -- he had an appointed lawyer at trial. Then we know that he has a lawyer in 2007. In between, was counsel available to Sullivan?",
  "No, I mean -- I mean, he does -- he had representation in 2007. He didn't for his first postconviction motion. I'm not asking as a matter of right, but did he, in fact, have counsel during this stage, this --",
  "You did say in -- in your brief that if Graham should prevail in his petition, that Sullivan would get the benefit of that decision. How, if we -- if we say -- just say there was an adequate independent State ground and we have no authority to do anything more, how would -- how would Sullivan get the benefit of the --",
  "A new -- a new postconviction motion?",
  "Well, if it's not consistently applied, then it's not an adequate ground. If so -- if the citations are correct and Florida sometimes treats it as rigid and sometimes doesn't, then it's not a consistently applied -- not an adequate State ground.",
  "I thought that in your cert petition, which I don't have with me, you raised the question of the adequate State ground in the second question.",
  "But there was a question that you raised, and then your opening brief doesn't discuss it at all. Your reply brief responds to the State and then brings up something in a footnote that the State doesn't have a chance to answer. That doesn't seem, to me, a very sound way to approach a question that you, yourself, raised.",
  "But just so you would say tax avoidance methods are covered, just as the process here is covered. So an estate plan, tax avoidance, how to resist a corporate takeover, how to choose a jury, all of those are patentable?",
  "Isn't that the basis on which the patent law rests in Europe, in other countries? They do not permit business method patents. It has to be tied to technology, to science or technology. So if other systems are able to work with the notion of technology-based, why not ours?",
  "But I was talking about -- you said that technology-based, that wouldn't work because there are so many definitions. I'm simply asking you the question: Does it work in these other systems? That they -- they exclude business methods, they include technology-based innovations.",
  "Mr. Stewart, did you -- did the government put forward this machine-or-transformation test? Was that your test, or was it the Federal Circuit's on its own?",
  "Tell me what your --",
  "You did -- and if you read Judge Mayer's opinion, it has a simplicity to it. It says, if it's technology, then its within the realm of patent, and if it's not technology, it isn't. If it’s based on science or technology -- and that seems to be what is used in other places.",
  "But this case could be decided without making any bold step --",
  "But even the Federal Circuit didn't say it was the test. It said it is for now. We know that things that we haven't yet contemplated may be around the corner, and when they happen, we will deal with them.",
  "But your case doesn't call for that judgment, because you have a multistate corporation, and it -- I assume you would be satisfied with saying that when a corporation has dispersed operations, it doesn't have its business center or its headquarters -- doesn't have its business center dominant in any one State, that it's dispersed, then you take the headquarters, because there's no way to pick among -- choose all the others, and it certainly isn't worth the labor to try to do that. So you could have a rule that says, dispersed across many States, you pick headquarters. And that -- you don't have to urge anything further.",
  "You would never get to California's thing about State. If you say multistate, you pick the place. The headquarters is the place, it's within a State.",
  "Why did the others all go through some through total, totality of the factors test? I mean, obviously, you could pick the headquarters. You'd say Congress wanted one place; headquarters is a logical choice, end of -- but most circuits have made it more complicated than that. The Seventh Circuit is the only one who said, keep it simple, as you urge -- headquarters. Why are the other circuits resistant to the solution that you are proposing.",
  "But is it -- they -- they do it in different ways.",
  "Some say business operations, some say headquarters.",
  "How does -- how do the bankruptcy courts do it? I mean, you brought out that \"principal place of business\" was -- was a term that the bankruptcy courts had been using before the amendment of 1332, 1958. But I -- I don't think that the -- that it is inevitably headquarters for the bankruptcy courts. I mean, there's -- sometimes it is in other places, isn't it?",
  "In the case -- this is purely hypothetical, but suppose Hertz were to be bankrupt, file a petition in bankruptcy, where -- New Jersey would be the place, on your -- or the assets are dominantly someplace else, so it would be another place?",
  "I know, but didn't Congress pick \"a principal place of business\"? And we know that they looked at the bankruptcy courts. There are lots of expressions in other statutes. Some say \"headquarters.\" Some say -- well, there are a variety of things, but Congress picked this particular term, \"principal place of business.\" And I was thinking, when you gave the example of Texas, that the idea of diversity is you are not going to get a Federal forum where you are at home. And so one would think, well, if Wal-Mart is doing so much in Texas, it's really no stranger in Texas. Why shouldn't there be diversity in Texas?",
  "It rejected it, yes.",
  "What about her argument that -- that Hertz has this New Jersey headquarters, but its reservation center is in Oklahoma?",
  "Even -- even when the direct -- the -- even subject-matter jurisdiction is precluded after final -- final judgment after direct - - so that's nothing new. It is the same example you gave.",
  "Not any point in the direct -- up to denial of cert on direct review. After that it's precluded, even subject-matter jurisdiction. You can't collaterally attack on that basis.",
  "Yes.",
  "The problem with your - - your approach -- and California is unique in this respect, is -- California is a very large State, lots of business, and you are comparing to the next State that has the next number of employees -- you know, Florida. If I were entertaining your approach, I would think, well, you would compare California against the whole rest of the nation and not pick for a dispersed -- a corporation that is widely dispersed. California is going to be the big winner in this. It's going to be able to keep all those cases in its State court because so many multi-State corporations, I imagine, would come out, just the way Hertz does. Am I right, that, under your analysis, the one place where, if you say, we don't want Federal courts to be dealing with corporations that are at home in the State, but in the State of New Jersey, under your view of things, a New Jersey citizen could sue Hertz in Federal court in New Jersey, right?",
  "And why do you say, well -- why is it that the Ninth Circuit's method, California versus Florida, instead of California and let's see what the rest of the business is -- is, in the whole United States?",
  "But they cannot be advised by the State court in New Jersey either. The - - you correctly pointed out that Congress said place of business. It didn't even do as it did with -- it didn't do as it did with -- with corporate citizenship, that is you could be a citizenship of as many States as you incorporate in. But if it's got to be one place, so why not just keep it simple and say presumptively it's the business headquarters, in a particular case you could show otherwise.",
  "But that would be a phony headquarters. But nobody is suggesting that -- that the headquarters of Hertz in New Jersey, that that's a sham set-up.",
  "Is that phenomenon? I mean, I can see that as a hypothetical, but does it happen in the real world, that a corporation moves its headquarters in order to escape the Federal courts in a particular State?",
  "But why would they move simply to avoid a Federal court or to gain access to the Federal court in a particular State?",
  "But we are not talking about all. I mean, that would be -- that's why you make it a presumption, the headquarters is a presumption which could be rebutted. But you are not talking about all business. You are talking about California where there is a sizeable amount of business, simply because it's the size of the State, the population of the State. And I would understand your position better if you would say, well, we would measure against the entirety of the United States. But California is going to come out the winner much more often than any other State under this test simply because of its size.",
  "Where is -- where is its headquarters.",
  "Two. The -- the key word that is emphasized in this case is it's \"under,\" instead of \"in.\"",
  "It would be clearer if it had said \"in.\"",
  "What was the --",
  "Could you clarify, what is the provision about battered spouses? I thought that that had to do with you could have more than one petition to reopen.",
  "But the rule is you may reopen once and that -- that provision on battered spouses says, but if you are in that category, you can reopen again?",
  "The ones that have been codified by statute -- those prior to the codification were by regulation. Is that -- is that so?",
  "Do we know where the motion -- where -- where did it originate? Where did it -- it was -- we now know it's in the regulations. It's in the statute. But how did motions to reopen BIA decisions originate?",
  "May I ask you, before you sit down: Your response to the briefs that suggests that all of this is beside the point because this was a -- a second motion to reopen, and the statute allows only one?",
  "But on a motion to reopen, there is -- Seventh Circuit stands alone, doesn't it?",
  "And how many circuits are on the other side?",
  "Was there any -- ever a decision in any of those six circuits that went the way the Seventh Circuit went on the motion to reopen?",
  "Is there any rhyme or reason why some universe of things that could be reviewed in court, Congress put some of the them in the statute and left others out?",
  "Well, it's -- the question isn't whether the Attorney General or the BIA exercises discretion. In all of these, the Attorney General exercises discretion. The question is immunity from court review, and ordinarily that's done by statute. And I do not know of another instance, perhaps you do, where the decision whether a matter that the agency rules on will be exempt from judicial review is made by the agency itself -- the very agency that makes the decision, rather than by the legislature.",
  "And -- and I'm not questioning the discretion. The Attorney General can be given discretion to rule on the matter, but the question is: Does that mean that the exercise of discretion will be immune from judicial review? Congress might well say: Agency, you decide what’s within your discretion. But not say: And, Agency, we delegate to you, too, the matter whether the court will -- will review your exercise of discretion.",
  "If -- if your interpretation of \"under\" is right.",
  "Do you have other examples where -- “under” is commonly used -- statute and regulations thereunder -- but in the appendix that you have given us, it says, \"under regulations.\" “Under” is always coupled with “regulations,” and you want us to transpose that to a statute that conspicuously does not say, \"regulations.\"",
  "And it's also the original source, if -- if the relator is the original source of the information.",
  "But what about the argument that Congress wanted to, in its most recent provisions, wanted to expand qui tam availability and this would -- if you would -- if you include State and local reports, that will shrink the availability?",
  "When you say \"twice,\" you mean in the first clause that says \"in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing\"?",
  "But there is a redundancy there if the statute means what you say it does; it says \"administrative hearing\" in both the first clause and the second clause.",
  "Is this particular audit report we are talking about, this is the audit report was done by an independent accountant? Is that - -",
  "Is that -- is that audit on file with the Department of Agriculture?",
  "Let's begin at the beginning, and that is with the first phrase with the, what is it, \"civil, criminal, administrative hearing.\" Do you as the government -- do you agree with the government that you have to insert \"Federal\" there, too? Or does that phrase - -",
  "-- include States?",
  "Suppose -- suppose it isn't? Suppose the general \"civil, criminal, administrative\" is read to mean -- include State. Why shouldn't the second, if it we are picking Latin phrases, be read in pari materia?",
  "Why -- what was the reason for that be, given that there are so many joint Federal-State grant programs, like the one that's involved here? Why wouldn't a State report be as much of a public disclosure as a Federal report? I mean, we are told that this particular report was filed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
  "This audit report is required by Federal law, isn't it?",
  "Let me go back to the other Latin phrase. If you begin at the beginning and you begin with a phrase that you have no reason to say is modified by Federal, \"civil, criminal or administrative proceeding,\" why shouldn't that drive the statute, what's in the first phrase?",
  "Well, it's a lot hard to say you have to put a caret mark and say -- vidi - - means Federal civil, criminal and administrative hearings.",
  "There was an explanation for it in the opposing brief, that Congress in -- what was it -- 1986 didn't think that the legislature was generating reports, audits, as distinguished from administrative agencies.",
  "Well that -- that doesn't follow like the night the day. It could be, as it was explained, they didn't include State legislatures because they didn't think they would be generating relevant material.",
  "I think the question was has the Department of Justice, recognizing that there's a circuit split this very question recommended that Congress amend the statute in this particular - -",
  "Do you think that the - - when a -- when State employees want to immunize themselves from fraud, they are going to say, okay, we will disclose it where anybody --a prosecutor could pick it up, but we will take care of the qui tam obligation.",
  "But there's lots of disclosures -- there's lots of disclosures in Federal reports that the government isn't pursuing.",
  "But how could --",
  "How -- how could that -- let's descend from the abstract to the concrete that is this case. The story that was being put out is, yes, this drug may produce heart attacks, but there’s no indication that it does so -- that the other drug that it's comparing with may have an anti-heart attack element. And that's accepted. We could -- it could be one explanation; it could be the other. How would the most diligent plaintiff have gone about finding out whether Merck really had no good faith belief in this so-called naproxen hypothesis?",
  "But it didn't stop it. Didn't -- didn't Merck submit a curative label, whatever, and the FDA said that was okay? And that -- that submission continued to give the naproxen hypothesis? Not the -- the reason that we are seeing this heart attack thing showing up is that the other drug has a -- has a clotting inhibitor.",
  "How when -- when there were -- doctors across the country were continuing to write prescriptions for this, when the market apparently accepted this -- it may be one thing, it may be another -- but there were not signals from the market itself, and the medical profession seemed to be going on and writing -- lots of doctors were writing prescriptions for this?",
  "Very brief.",
  "There was a brief drop, but it came right back up again.",
  "Why not say that because of one -- one element of the claim is scienter, that there’s no inquiry notice based on -- there may have been a misrepresentation, whether it was innocent or deliberate, we have no way of knowing. Why not say because scienter is an element of the claim, and you can't get your foot in the door in the court unless you can plead that with particularity, that it's only when you have that indication that you have what you call inquiry notice?",
  "But it's inquiry -- it's notice of what? And -- the law is that one element that must be pleaded with particularity. If you don't have that, you have no claim.",
  "But when does the –- when does the 5-year -- what is the trigger for the 5-year period?",
  "Well, what is the violation?",
  "But you -- you say that you did -- you did begin this action even before that point was reached because you -- you attribute this to the disclosure of the internal e-mails in the Wall Street Journal article? So you -- you say, well, we sued even earlier than -- than the point at which we had evidence of scienter.",
  "But Judge Sloviter used the so-called Harvard study, it seems, in her opinion. She thought that that was the point at which you had enough to suspect scienter.",
  "Mr. Frederick, before you -- you've finished, there’s something puzzling about the Third Circuit decision, and it's that Judge Sloviter says at the end, in summary, \"We conclude that the district court acted prematurely.\" She doesn't seem to close off a statute of limitations defense. It's -- and the same thing on page 48a, footnote 17. She says, this -- her conclusion is, \"At this stage of the evidence\" -- she doesn't say that the district court was wrong in saying that the limitation period -- in its judgment about the limitation period having expired. She just said it was premature. What -- what did she mean by that?",
  "And, Mr. Stewart, the -- you said -- the phrase that you used were “facts constituting the alleged violation,” and the other side says, well, look at the Court's Tellabs opinion: That described as discrete (1) facts constituting an alleged violation -- which you say is the test -- and (2) facts evidencing scienter.",
  "As long as the stock price was holding, how was the plaintiff injured?",
  "If it's true that everything was locked up internally at Merck, all the reasonable diligence in the world would not have uncovered what eventually came out.",
  "But there's already in the statute an -- a required attestation from the lawyer who signs a bankruptcy petition that the petition does not constitute an abuse. This is 707(b).",
  "And the words are something like \"does not constitute an abuse.\" So apparently it has meaning there. Why doesn't -- why don't we say, well, whatever it means in 707(b), it also means in 5, whatever it is.",
  "What are the words in 707(b)? I mean, they are both in the statute. What the lawyer has to attest to is required by statute.",
  "You want to -- I mean, your first point is -- and we never get to that question because lawyers shouldn't be under this act at all. They shouldn't be labelled debt relief agencies.",
  "How is it any different from including lawyers within the category \"debt collectors,\" which lawyers objected to in this Court unsuccessfully?",
  "I thought that in the legislative history there were examples of lawyers overreaching, that the conduct that Congress was aiming at was engaged in by lawyers, as well as others.",
  "They don't want to be - - lawyers don't want to be called debt collectors either, and in this, the Fair Debt Collection Act, it says that -- that communication must say the communication is from a debt collector, except that formal pleadings are not -- you don't have to identify. It seems to me that that -- that would be a harder thing for a lawyer to do, to identify herself in an advertisement as, I am a debt collector, than I am a debt relief agency.",
  "What about the provision that says the directors, employees, are not included?",
  "What about an associate?",
  "Well, let's take some of the examples that were in the amicus brief. One of them was the debtor is just told by her doctor that she has a serious cancer that needs operation and radiation, and she is at the end of the line on resources. She has her trade tools, which she could sell to get some money, but then she won't be able to carry on her business. And she could also borrow money, but incurring that debt - - since she's on the brink of the bankruptcy, she's incurring the debt knowing that she's on the brink of bankruptcy. Could the lawyer say, you don't have to sell your -- the lawyer could say: Sell your equipment. That wouldn't be a problem. But could the lawyer say, incur the debt?",
  "Well, take this circumstance. There is no other -- the person is on a brink of bankruptcy, has no resources, can get money by selling assets or by borrowing.",
  "Suppose she doesn't have a home equity loan. Suppose she's a renter?",
  "One thing that lawyers who render services for money want -- is to be sure that they will get paid, and one part of this provision, this 526(a)(4), talks about incurring debt to pay an attorney for representing the debtor. So what can a lawyer say safely about the lawyer's getting paid?",
  "You said that one of the aspects of this that makes it horrible is that they are not limited to saying, \"We are debt relief agencies; we help people file for bankruptcy.\" They can say anything else. But there's no screening -- there is no administrator that a law firm can go to and say, \"This is what I think is substantially similar. Is it okay?\"",
  "Before -- before we get to that, the Ninth Circuit did say, now, bankruptcy judges, we don't want you to -- to intermeddle in this. So -- so the first step -- it wasn't clear to the Ninth Circuit that bankruptcy judges should not say, now, I am not going to let you do this until you prove hardship.",
  "Yes.",
  "Can a -- can a creditor say, oh, skip it, I know this bankrupt is going to be able to prove hardship, why go through unnecessary expense? Can a -- can a creditor waive the hardship determination?",
  "So he can't -- he can't stipulate to -- he will say: I want the deal that is being proposed; I think I am better off getting the principal, skipping the interest. I can't make that deal? We have to go through this hardship procedure, whether the creditor wants it or not?",
  "That’s this case. The creditor was there. The creditor put in a proof of claim. The creditor knew that the plan gave the creditor less than the proof of claim.",
  "But why -- why should it be void, looking at 1327? We have a confirmed plan. You ­ - you have -- 1328 does include -- except 523(a), as you pointed out. But 1327 says \"Effect of confirmation,\" and that says, \"The provisions of a confirmed plan\" -- the provision here is you get 13,000, not 17,000 -- \"bind the debtor and each creditor, whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan\" -- which it wasn't in full here -- \"and whether or not such creditor has objected to or has accepted or rejected the plan.\" That seems to say at the end of the line, you get that final determination confirmed, that's it. That's as final as you come and whatever mistakes were made on the way there, you can't look behind at the confirmation.",
  "And the only way to do it is to go through an adversary hearing with full notice, and every -- and nobody wants to incur that expense. This is a bankruptcy. You are trying to save assets. The bankruptcy judge thinks this makes no sense. The creditor says, okay. But you -- you agree with your colleague that, under this 523 whatever, you must have the full adversary hearing, notice, complaint, the works?",
  "It was the only debt. This -- there was no other debt.",
  "Do --",
  "So I take it that you do think the Ninth Circuit was wrong when they said: bankruptcy judges, don't stand in the middle of these arrangements. Because you -- your answer was you think the bankruptcy judge does have the obligation to bring out this requirement that -- of a hardship showing?",
  "But did you -- the net effect of this is if you have taken a debt that is non-dischargeable and put it into the category that it is dischargeable unless the creditor objects.",
  "The -- the code puts the onus on the debtor to raise the hardship question. Your reading is, even if the debtor is silent, totally silent, says nothing about hardship, unless the creditor objects, then the discharge will be proper; the plan can be confirmed. So you are taking a burden that Congress has put on the debtor and switching it to the creditor.",
  "But it’s in a category that’s labeled “non-dischargeable.” There were other items in that -- that category, so let's take it that -- the child support arrears --",
  "The debtor says, look, I'll pay half of what I owe, and the spouse says, I need something for the children, I'll take it. And then the plan is confirmed, with only half of the child support; and then the caretaker spouse has a second thought and says, 2 years later, I need that money, I'm going to go after the debtor for the rest.",
  "But let’s suppose -- this is my hypothetical. It's right in there, and the -- the creditor haven’t gotten all the notices -- I want what I can get right now. So I'll make this deal.",
  "Well, there are supposed to be additional notices here. There’s supposed to be a summons and complaint and all that. And let's go down the list of the others. How about taxes?",
  "So you’re saying any of these things that are listed as non-dischargeable can become dischargeable unless the creditor --",
  "-- objects?",
  "So then, why do we have this third category, then? Nothing is non­ dischargeable.",
  "But your answer to me was that if the creditor doesn't object, even to a non-dischargeable debt -- if the creditor doesn't object, it's discharged. That's what you answered, I thought.",
  "And it doesn't matter whether it's child support, taxes, or student loans, right? Anything in the category -- you’re saying the creditor must object; otherwise it's covered by the discharge.",
  "But that's not -- their position is that 528(a)(8) -- or 523(a)(8) makes this -- it puts it outside the discharge order. The discharge order does not cover this kind of debt. It doesn't discharge student -- student loans absent a hardship determination. So, what they are saying is the discharge discharged other things, but it could not discharge this particular debt, so it's not discharged.",
  "And I'd like him to answer the question that I asked him first.",
  "I thought your basic position in the litigation in Florida was that the Florida legislation violated the takings protection, and so it's kind of strange to switch your target from the legislature, which enacted this measure, and then say, because the judiciary upheld it, the judiciary somehow is complicit in this violation by the legislature implemented by the administrative offices.",
  "Applied in a new situation. It was never the kind of situation involved here with the beach restoration project. The -- the precedent did not involve the kind of situation that this case presents.",
  "Well, can you -- can you explain something that's unclear to me from the briefs and the records? That is, there -- this -- what is referred to as “the foreshore,” was that wet all the time? I thought the suggestion was that that was in effect beach, public beach, that people could walk on, not swim in.",
  "And the -- and the public -- what -- what was the situation here? Was there a strip of dry land that the public has been using?",
  "Who owns that land? I mean, when it was submerged it belonged to the State. And is it your position that the owners in your organization, that they have title to that land that was once owned by the State?",
  "No, I mean -- I mean, without condemning it, you say the title is held by the private owners even though the title was held by the State when the land was submerged.",
  "But what happened? There were a succession of hurricanes, I thought.",
  "Do you know the answer to the question that was asked of your colleague? That is, here we have an organization representing several landowners. Is there any indication about how these beachfront owners in these communities -- what their view is, that they are benefited, that they are harmed? Is there any indication of that?",
  "And this statute provides --",
  "This very statute says if -- if what happens is a taking, then there's compensation.",
  "Why did they drop out?",
  "I don't understand why isn't it -- it is equally an addition to the private property owners' rights when they had a narrow beach and now they're claiming that -- that it's all theirs, the full 75 feet.",
  "They have, under your theory, much more property than they had before. They have a wider beach that's theirs, so they have gained property, but that doesn't count?",
  "But you agree that it -- suppose we accept your position and the case is remanded. The Florida Supreme Court could say: Well, that's very nice, but we have a Florida Constitution with a counterpart to the Fifth Amendment, so we're just going to have the same opinion, but we are putting it under -- squarely under the Florida Constitution. They could do that?",
  "Yes, that's what I meant. They could do it on State grounds.",
  "Did Miranda itself -- I mean, it set out the four requirements, but there was a charge -- I mean there was a warning involved, am I not right? Well, didn't they cite the then-FBI warning? It has been improved considerably, but there was an FBI warning cited in Miranda itself, was there not?",
  "It also said you have a right to keep silent.",
  "It -- it used it in determining -- in -- in stating the obligation of the State, but it didn't use those words in setting out the warning that the FBI then gave.",
  "It said, this is what -- States, this is what your obligation is, what you must say to the defendant is. And I think the Florida court is the same way. It said: You are entitled to the help of a lawyer. Then it spells it out in that opinion, but -- but what it said had to be communicated was not the -- the full range. Just you're entitled, I think it was, to the help of a lawyer. So there’s -- there’s a confusion, I think, between what Miranda spells out and many other cases spell out as the State’s obligation, what the State must do, and the statement that must be made to the defendant to communicate that.",
  "The -- the warning that Justice Breyer has just referred to -- that’s long after Miranda itself, and it was not the warning that the FBI gave at the time of Miranda.",
  "What about the danger that Tampa, if you should prevail, will go back to the old way? Now, it has a clearer form -- whether this form was adequate is one thing. But now, it has the form that the -- like the one the FBI currently uses. If you prevail, then Tampa can go back to what it had before?",
  "Well, how about the reasonable defendant in this very case? Powell's lawyer questioned him and asked him: \"You waived the right to have an attorney present during your questioning by the detectives?\" Answer: \"Yes.\" This is at appendix page 80. So, apparently, counsel understood the warning to have conveyed the right to have an attorney present during questioning by the -- by the detectives. Counsel understood that?",
  "Did she ever --",
  "Was she asking her client a legal question? You waived the right to have an attorney present during your questioning by detectives, is that what you are telling the jury?",
  "But do --",
  "Do you think that a suspect would think, now, I'm in this custodial room, they want me to stay put, that they’re going to have me hopping in and out of the room to talk to my lawyer? Wouldn't the assumption be, I'm stuck in this room, they are holding me here, and if I have a right to talk to a lawyer, it's got to be there and not my walking in and out of the holding room.",
  "What do you do with the -- the Court’s decisions in Prysock and Duckworth that dealt with the right to appointed counsel and the suspect was not explicitly told that he had a right to appointed counsel at the pre-arraignment stage. It said something about a court would give you --",
  "You wouldn't have to have any additional information; you just tell them, you have a right to have a -- have counsel now. That would be fewer words.",
  "Didn't one of them say \"court,\" and the suspect was not in court at the time?",
  "Yes. That the court will appoint counsel for you.",
  "Well, they are -- they are free to do that. I mean, politically, they might consider it risky, but if we say that the charge was good enough, the Florida court could say, but it's not good enough under our Constitution.",
  "I think --",
  "But they did say over and over again -- one was the certified question; another was the issue before the court is whether the failure to provide express advice of the right to the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation violates the principles espoused in Miranda, with the citation. I mean, they said many, many times that the question was -- what did Miranda mean was the issue, not what -- what did Florida's extension of Miranda.",
  "I think you would have had a much weightier argument if it hadn't been for Michigan v. Long. If you could have said --",
  "We could have then remanded to ask the Florida Supreme Court: Was it independently ruling under its constitution?",
  "Why do you call it an independent regulatory agency? I mean, Congress wanted it to be independent of the profession. That much is clear. It didn't want it to be independent of the SEC, so why are you characterizing it as an independent regulatory agency?",
  "But the --",
  "The SEC doesn't have another overseer. I mean, the SEC is set up like the FCC, the other independent regulatory commissions, but this is a board that has a relationship with the SEC, where it can't do anything that doesn't have the SEC's approval.",
  "It can't even issue a subpoena without the SEC's approval.",
  "So the SEC really could stop anything?",
  "What happened to the Petitioners here? I think, if you were challenging what happened to the Petitioners here, certainly it would be a question of how you would have to do that. You ordinarily go through the internal proceedings. But here you are bringing a facial challenge and you say, never mind any particular proceedings; the whole thing is no good.",
  "I thought that both sides --",
  "I thought that both sides agreed that there is no statute, everybody agrees to that. But I thought that the government, just as your side, agreed that the President could dismiss an SEC commissioner for cause.",
  "Even though there's no statute that says anything either way.",
  "For cause would be short of the 5-year term.",
  "Does that mean, Mr. Carvin, that the SEC cannot appoint heads of -- heads of its divisions? I assume that they would fit within the characterization \"inferior officers.\"",
  "So -- but if the SEC can't appoint --",
  "Yes, so what are -- so what are the heads of the various divisions of the SEC?",
  "Aren't there -- aren't there people within the independent regulatory commissions that have jobs comparable to people who are in the departments --",
  "-- that the head of the department can appoint? So who can appoint such people in the FEC, the FTC, the FCC, and so on?",
  "So this whole thing would be constitutional if, instead of giving the appointing power to the commission, they had given it to the chairman?",
  "Isn't that a highly unlikely scenario? I mean, this thing won't work unless these two are working in harmony.",
  "General Kagan, I thought that -- the Chief asked a question, he posed a sanction, and I thought that any sanction the board wants to impose has to be approved by the SEC?",
  "But there is -- there is -- it was working okay with the Stock Exchange. It wasn't working okay with the accountants. And there’s a problem. There’s a problem that Congress had to solve. It wanted to tighten the oversight of the auditing function. And they wanted to have people who were not beholden to the profession, but who were knowledgeable and could command high salaries to be doing this job.",
  "How about if they -- would it work if the board members were proposed by the SEC, by SEC commissioners, subject to the approval of the President? Would that be --",
  "But the nominee would be -- by a nomination. The names would be presented.",
  "So, you --",
  "You were -- I'm sorry, then. I interrupted you, but I wanted you to give me your full picture of how this could be done, how Congress could accomplish its goal of having a strong, effective oversight body?",
  "So it would be totally separate. Then you would -- you’d say it would have to be a totally separate independent regulatory agency. It could not be put under the wing of the SEC.",
  "We don't know -- we don't know what's fictional and what is not here, because you came in, and you don't have a particular case.",
  "Do you have another instance where Congress set up a scheme, and without having a particular case of an individual who has been hurt, you come in and say: We might sometime be hurt by this, so we want the whole thing knocked down in the absence of any concrete case.",
  "If we took away -- I mean, one big point was the double for-cause. So let's say we have said that the SEC could fire board members, period. Then that would remove the double for-cause. Would this statute then be constitutional?",
  "So, it’s not the double for -- the double for-cause isn't, in your judgment, what sinks this statute?",
  "The real problem with your approach, which I take it is you have to find these duties in State law, is that some States will classify the same conduct as a felony that another will classify as a misdemeanor. So that line won't work. And then some States will make something criminal that other States won't. So you’re going to have, depending on geography, people potentially subject to a 20-year term because of the particularities of -- of a -- the State law.",
  "But you are asking us to say State law is the reference.",
  "But you have no objection to what they call the quid pro quo theory; that is, I -- I want you to hire me after I leave the legislature, and in return, I'm going to see what I can do to keep the tax level low on the --",
  "But then I don't understand your question presented. I thought the question presented is: Must the government prove the defendant violated a disclosure duty imposed by State law? What you've been arguing isn't in sync with what I thought the question presented was: Must you look for the duty to State law?",
  "But you are asking for a State law reference, and that brings up the problem of the variety of State law. And we do have in the mail fraud property area a decision, the Cleveland decision --",
  "-- that says: Don't look to how the States define property.",
  "There should be a uniform Federal definition. Why -- if we have done that, the mail fraud statute in -- in connection with property, why shouldn't we do it also with honest services?",
  "Before we do that, Mr. Dreeben --",
  "Mr. Dreeben, I would like to ask you about this case particularly: One thing that the prosecutor did, one thing that the Ninth Circuit did. So before we get to your larger theory of anything, we have a particular case to deal with. We have an Assistant U.S. Attorney who came to the judge and said, we have alternate theories of this case. One is the quid pro quo theory; the other -- and I am reading from 42 of the appendix -- is that \"a public official can be found guilty of honest services fraud, irrespective of whether the public official took any act thereafter.\" Just the bare nondisclosure. That was what the Assistant U.S. Attorney was asking for.",
  "Then you must agree that the Ninth Circuit was wrong, at least in this particular -- this -- I'm now reading from 19a. One is bribe, and that's -- everyone seems to agree that that could come within the statute. The second is (2) nondisclosure of material information. Period. That's got to be wrong.",
  "But this is an opinion that’s going to govern district judges in the Ninth Circuit. So I take it that your answer is that nondisclosure of material information certainly is not enough --",
  "The problem is that -- that, even if the U.S. attorney got it right in the end, if the U.S. attorney could think that all that's involved is nondisclosure, even if no action is taken thereafter, the U.S. attorney could write that down twice, that suggests that this statute is open to a high degree of interpretation.",
  "But it's not your -- it's not within your test, as I understand it. Your test is, there has to be economic harm to the person owed the duty of loyalty. Now, you could have a bribe or a kickback that will line the pockets of the person who takes it, doesn't deceive the person who is giving it, and doesn't harm the company to whom a duty of loyalty is owed. So it seems to me that the bribe and kickback, which I think is heartland McNally, would not be included in yours. It must be economic harm, actual or contemplated, to the person owed the duty of loyalty.",
  "How could it have been a term of art when the courts -- the lower courts were massively confused?",
  "Well, there wasn't even a uniform terminology in the lower courts. They didn't all use - -",
  "Excuse me, may I ask you to put -- in terms of your brief, you said your definition of materiality -- you said materiality is related to but different from what Mr. Estrada is urging the Court to adopt: economic harm to the victim. So can you tell us how materiality is related to economic harm to the victim and how it is different from economic harm to the victim?",
  "Now, kickbacks and -- and bribes is clear. Sometimes, the government just talks about conflict of interest. Sometimes, it says, \"taking action under conflict of interest.\" Well, action is quite broad. And that's -- what do you include concretely within this self-dealing category? Taking or taking action on the basis of undisclosed information?",
  "Where was that in the charge?",
  "The charge -- the judge charged the jury in terms of Delaware law?",
  "Mr. Waxman, there’s a preliminary question in this case, and that is: There was one agreement, undoubtedly signed by both sides, and that was the one to submit to the arbitrator the question whether the arbitration clause permitted class treatment. The arbitrators answered that question, which they were given authority to do so by both sides, and the Second Circuit said that the arbitrators answered within the ballpark. If we agree with that, then there's nothing else to consider in this case.",
  "Where did the arbitrators say that?",
  "Mr. Waxman, may I ask you -- because your time is running and we are spending all of your time on this preliminary question. There is one fundamental flaw, it seems to me, in your argument, and I’d like you to answer it. And you can call it “the vanishing class action.” AnimalFeeds wanted to be in court, not in arbitration.",
  "You said -- and they wanted to bring a class action. You persuaded the Second Circuit they belong in arbitration. So now they are in arbitration. You say: The only thing we consented to is a one-on-one claim. Fine. AnimalFeeds can then say: Fine, well, we didn't consent to anything more than the one-on-one. We had a class action. We had -- we were in court. We could have proceeded in an individual action or a class action. Now we are in arbitration, and under the agreement, as you read it, we can't have the class action in arbitration. That doesn't mean it vanishes, because if it does, then the arbitration clause is not merely saying what the arbitrator can decide, but it is shrinking drastically the dimensions of AnimalFeeds' claim.",
  "But that's what it was doing in court.",
  "And -- and the court said this goes to arbitration. What is the \"this\"? If it's only a one-on-one claim, how do they lose the larger claim that they had in court?",
  "But they never -- they never gave up.",
  "If -- if the -- if you would regard arbitration as a change in forum, like a forum selection clause, it says where you go, but it doesn't change, if you have to go to another forum, what your claim is.",
  "Well, is that what's on 56a of the joint appendix, Construction of the Arbitration Clause? That's what Mr. Waxman referred us to?",
  "\"Upon appointment, the arbitrator shall determine, as a threshold matter.\"",
  "Yes. 56a.",
  "May I -- may I ask you this question? Let's assume that you prevail in this case. I -- I would assume that the tankers are now going to add to their contract, as many contracts do, a provision saying no class action -- you cannot proceed in a class action. If the arbitration agreement says agreed to arbitrate any and all disputes, but you may not proceed on behalf of a class, would that preclude you from bringing a class action any place?",
  "There are many, many contracts -- and pick up your average credit card agreement -- that will say you may not bring this as a class.",
  "But then you won't get -- you win this case, but then all the future AnimalFeeds lose because they’ll just put in the arbitration agreement you can't proceed on class.",
  "Mr. Friedman, one of the problems that has been brought up is that this is an inordinate expense, and you're wasting the time of the analyst. Do you recognize any economy -- for example, that the analyst could testify from the lab, have video conferencing, and so the analyst, while the prosecutor must call her, can testify from the lab instead of coming down to the courthouse?",
  "But, in your view, it wouldn't satisfy the Confrontation Clause if, say, the supervisor shows up and said that this is -- this is the way the analysts operate and describes the procedures.",
  "But it doesn't have to happen in the prosecutor's case. In other words, the prosecutor puts in the reports and rests. And the defendant says, there wasn't sufficient evidence; I move to dismiss the case. It couldn't be dismissed at that point. The prosecutor would prove its case by the affidavit alone.",
  "So is the proper solution to grant, vacate, and remand in light of Melendez-Diaz?",
  "Mr. Phillips, the point that North Carolina makes is it would be throwing away the taxpayers' money to no purpose. That is, what is the point of continuing to pursue a license when North Carolina does not have the funding to continue the process and to open the disposal facility? So North Carolina's point of view is: What does it mean to continue to seek the license when they are not going to have the money to get to the end of the line?",
  "But the --",
  "So your argument is then that they acted 2 years too late. When they gave notice that they were not able to go forward, but they were going to keep this thing going, so if the funds should somehow become available, they would have the -- they would have things still in place. They wouldn't have terminated the effort.",
  "So if they had done everything the same --",
  "But they told you what ­ - it was totally up-front. They said: Look, we can't go forward with this. We haven't got the money. We’ll let everything sit, to see if someone will come up with the money. That's -- it's -- you paint a picture of repudiating the contract, when North Carolina gave notice in '97 that it would have to fold if it didn't get the money.",
  "What were the benefits that North Carolina was getting by paying whatever it was -- 400-odd thousand dollars -- to keep it going for another 2 years?",
  "At what point did South Carolina withdraw?",
  "And so they -- by 1997, they didn't have any access to Barnwell anymore.",
  "But in -- but in the --",
  "-- case of this compact and the other ones, as I -- do I understand correctly, Mr. Phillips, that none of these -- none of these compacts that were negotiated around the same time, none of them yielded a disposal -- an operative disposal facility?",
  "But they also -- you said -- you said in your brief that the -- in 1997, the Commission came forward with some kind of additional funding proposal, which North Carolina came down -- turned down.",
  "What -- what was that?",
  "Why did -- why did North Carolina turn it down?",
  "But you say there was a package, that there was a -- an offer in place where the Commission would pay X and the generators would kick in an additional amount as well.",
  "And that was -- that -- everybody had signed -- everybody who was part of that offer had signed onto it?",
  "Do we have -- Mr. Kneedler --",
  "Mr. Kneedler, do we have any decision that deals with the standing of a commission to sue a State in its own right? Or this is a novel question?",
  "Are you relying on the caption to article 7 -- “Eligible Parties; Withdrawal; Revocation; Entry into Force; Termination”? The caption to article 7?",
  "Mr. Dellinger, what of ­ - what of Mr. Phillips's argument that that $80 million gave North Carolina a leg up, should there ever be any revival of the development of a disposal facility; North Carolina is much better situated than anyone else to do this, because they have already sunk $80,000 into pursuing a license?",
  "In this case -- in this case, how did it come about that the right to withdraw any time until the second plant was operable, was that -- that was North Carolina's proposal after it was designated to be the site?",
  "Mr. Dellinger, your brief makes -- I think the reply brief made some reference to North Carolina's attempting to get funding from another source after Barnwell -- the revenues from Barnwell were no longer available to it. I think, in -- in your reply brief, you make some reference to an effort on North Carolina's part to get -- what -- what was that effort?",
  "What about the offer -- what about the offer that Mr. Phillips brought up, said Commission was ready to pay another $21 million, and there was going to be loans from the generators?",
  "But that was in -- Hess came up in a different posture. It wasn't -- I think -- it was an attempt to sue the authority, wasn't it?",
  "So I don't think that they are at all comparable. This is a case of does the -- does the authority have standing or -- to bring the claim.",
  "Why -- why not? I mean, if it’s totally a creature of States -- that’s all it’s -- there’s no other shareholders, nobody in the picture, just -- they are all States that create it?",
  "They create it, though. They -- the States create the --",
  "How can -- how could they not be, Mr. Dellinger? There’s only one complaint, and that complaint is on behalf of all the Plaintiffs, not --",
  "But there’s no discrete claim made by the Commission as distinguished from South Carolina.",
  "What was the experience under 4246? You pointed out that that has been on the books for some time, and there efforts must be made to have the State take the person. When the civil commitment is used following the end of a term -- let's say someone is insane -- how often does it end up that the State takes responsibility and how often is it that the person stays in Federal custody?",
  "But the likelihood is that the person will stay in Federal custody?",
  "Are you saying that as far as those limitations, the question that Justice Sotomayor was asking, the limitations on the Federal Government would be the same as they are on the States? But that’s a different question from whether the Federal Government has any power at all.",
  "So, is the prisoner --",
  "Is it -- is it a prisoner who has served his time in, say, a Federal penitentiary in Ohio but is a domiciliary of Arizona, what happens when the prisoner is released, say, after 10 years? Released to Ohio, sent back to Arizona? What?",
  "Was it -- was that a consideration? You mentioned that this originated, 4246, with a -- with a committee of judges who said, we have a problem. Did they --",
  "Do you -- Mr. DuBois, do you take that same position with respect to not guilty by reason of insanity? Someone is convicted, say, in the District of Columbia -- say, John Hinckley is found by the jury to be not guilty by reason of insanity, must he then be allowed out of Federal custody, and it depends if his home State or any other State wants to pick him up?",
  "And so what's the power that the Federal Government is exercising when it commits someone who has been found not guilty by reason of insanity?",
  "It's more than the question of good idea. You’re talking about endangering the health and safety of people, so it's ­ -",
  "The government has some responsibility, doesn't it?",
  "Yes, but you say, if the State is unwilling to take the person, and apparently, that is the problem that precipitated 4246 and, now, 4248, and that -- you -- the Federal government is just helpless short of passing a spending measure and saying, State, if you do this, we’ll give you the money.",
  "Yes, that's one of the things that you mention in your brief. You said you could vary the conditions of supervised release, but you were not at all specific about that. You said the Federal Government -- the person has gotten out, they know the person is dangerous, so what -- what are the measures that they would take to do what you said in the brief the Federal Government could do; that is, set the terms of supervised release in order to account for sexual dangerousness?",
  "Well, what would the modification be?",
  "What about someone who is incompetent to stand trial? I take it you think that that’s a perfectly proper application of 4246?",
  "Does it matter that the person who has been found incompetent to stand trial has now been in custody for three times longer than the maximum sentence?",
  "Even though it may be purely imaginary; that is, that this particular person, all of the experts agree, will never be competent to stand trial.",
  "You would be on absolutely sound ground if this were a convention on the mutual recognition of jurisdiction and judgment, but it's not. You -- you said the whole question is deferring to the courts of habitual residence, but this statute is not raised in terms of court jurisdiction. It's in terms of the right of a custodial parent.",
  "You’re not relying on the order; you’re just relying on the statute?",
  "What happens to the woman who, now she has abducted the child to Texas, and she says to the Texas court: If you send me back, I am going to be beaten by this man who has a history of being a batterer?",
  "You are saying that the court -- the court that’s asked to give effect to the convention is helpless, that it's automatic that if there is a custody right, the court in the state to which the child has been taken must order that the child be returned?",
  "Do you know --",
  "Ms. Howe, wasn't the -- the problem that gave rise to this Abduction Convention just the situation that Justice Breyer brought up? That is, the parent that has visitation rights snatches the child, takes it to that parent's home country, and then you are relying on only the court order. That's why we have the Hague Convention on the Abduction of Children. It wasn't for the -- I mean, this -- this case is not the usual case. The usual case is the noncustodial parent takes the child out of the country where the custodial parent lives. And, internationally, there was a huge problem of getting the child back, and that's why we have the Hague Convention on Abduction, because courts weren't enforcing foreign court orders.",
  "Well, what is the -- what is the significance of their breaking down the two categories? One is the rights of custody, and the other is rights of access. Because I take it that under your view of the Chilean law, given that the noncustodial parent will always have this right to block taking the child out of the country, then there's really no difference between the two categories, because every, say, father with the right of access -- not custody, just access -- would automatically by virtue of the law of Chile have this one custodial right; that is, to block taking the child out of the country.",
  "You don't question what the representative of the mother has said in this case, that the emphasis -- when this Hague Convention was before Congress, the emphasis was on the custodial parent -- that is, the person in the situation of the mother here -- that what Congress was told was the urgent problem was the noncustodial parent taking the child away from the custodial parent. That was the -- the major thing that drove this convention and that's what the State Department told Congress; isn't that so?",
  "Well, you could say -- you can say that the mother did not have full custodial rights. One custodial right is certainly to determine where the child will live. And the mother did not have that right with respect to taking the child out of the country.",
  "It's a provision --",
  "If he has the right to say no, don't take the child out of the country, then he has something more than a right of access. You -- you are talking, well, she has the rights of custody. But because he -- it's not just the court, because it's his consent in the first instance. He has a right to determine that the child shall not live outside the country of habitual residence. That is not a right of access.",
  "I thought the statute says the consent of the -- of the other parent.",
  "Well, that’s true of custody decrees generally. We get them modified by a court in the best interests of the child. So it -- but in the first instance, it says -- it’s he has the consent or withholding consent. And my question to you is, whatever that is, it isn't a right of access?",
  "It just says that the right of access is the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child's habitual residence. There’s nothing about procedure or substance in this; it says this is what right to custody is, and this is what right of access is.",
  "Not according to the -- what is it, the Chilean central authority, you know, the letter that was sent to the Second Circuit, I think in the Duran case. The -- the authority within Chile that is responsible for the implementation of this Hague Convention said that it regarded that statute to create a custody right for purposes of the Hague Convention.",
  "I thought there was a sentence in there -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- that said that the statute, under Chilean law, amounted to a right of joint custody.",
  "You have -- you have a lady --",
  "-- Elizabeth Butler-Sloss in the Court of Appeal in England, and that was a square holding.",
  "Which are dicta.",
  "All right. Well, you can take the German constitutional court.",
  "And your example of that couldn't happen, because if you were calling debtors, you should certainly check what time of evening the call is. So you get over the first problem, but then on the second problem, the second -- how could that possibly be careful procedure, if you don't even check to see what time zone the person is in?",
  "Do you know why when Congress codified that law errors don't count, codified that for the Truth in Lending Act purposes, it didn't make the corresponding change in the others?",
  "It also makes it hard to use the safe harbor to get the -- to get advice from the FTC.",
  "That -- that if you have -- you can -- you are home free if you ask the FTC, right?",
  "But that's the only - - only way you -- under your reading that you are home free?",
  "Do we know what the time interval was? You said there were seven requests for affirmative responses. How long did it take from when the request was made until the FTC responded?",
  "And also saying -- and then this sentence is what I would like to have your response on, that there is no statute -- Federal statute that makes mistake of law a defense. So this would be highly extraordinary, and if that's what Congress meant to do, to make something that ordinarily is no defense a defense, we would expect Congress to do so expressly.",
  "Could we do that in the context of this case? Because we are talking on a highly abstract level. This is a statute that required a validation notice, and for the most part the validation notice that was sent to the debtor is exactly the words of the statute. But the lawyer added two words that are not in this statute, \"in writing.\" Where did that come from? We are told this was not the model form that was used by the debt collectors' association.",
  "It says you \"should\" - -",
  "Rather than \"may\"?",
  "But why doesn't that just mean that Congress wants to confirm that the judges - - the majority of judges who -- who had held that it didn't -- that errors of law were not a defense, that they were right, it's not changing -- changing anything. It's just confirming that the majority view is right.",
  "Well, why wouldn't one say, now, Congress has confirmed that the word in the Truth and Lending Act means thus and so, Congress has said that's what those words mean, and then go back to the other statutes and say the same language was used, so it means the same thing, the same thing that Congress has just confirmed?",
  "Didn't Mr. Jay tell us there were seven requests? Are you disputing that?",
  "This isn't -- this is a class action, wasn't it? It was brought as a class action?",
  "Does that cover everything that the NFLA does? Because everything is subject to agreement. It's all concerted action. So, is everything under the Sherman Act, and then it goes to rule of reason analysis? Or are there some things that escape, entirely, antitrust analysis?",
  "Mr. Nager, I think you answered my question originally: Yes, everything. Because they are separate entities, they agree on everything. There’s agreement in every case. So there’s nothing that you would take outside, and you put everything under the rule of reason analysis.",
  "One -- one concern in the litigation is, you know, if it doesn't come under the Sherman Act at all, they go home after the case is dismissed on the -- on the pleadings. But once you say no, it's got to be a rule of reason analysis, then you have discovery, which can be costly. And I thought that that was a feature of this case, that the -- that the plaintiff wanted more discovery, and the court said: You've had enough.",
  "Is your point that your client wasn't hurt until they dealt exclusively with one manufacturer?",
  "So you have nothing -- you had no damages before?",
  "May -- may I ask you to go back just one step? Because you seem to treat this as though the NFLP was formed in 1963 and that was the end of it, but another description is: Well, it was formed, but then there were some teams that were not in it until later, and there were some other parts, that it has expanded. What it does has expanded since 1963. So it wasn't one point in time where there was formation, and then if you didn't -- if you’re not challenging that, everything else is okay.",
  "But why is there -- is there anything, any question about formation, given that there is a contract? The contract is retroactive to May, so if the contract is retroactive to May, then certainly a contract was formed and that issue is -- is academic, but --",
  "But why does it matter? Why does it matter if we have a contract? A contract has been formed; everybody agrees about that. And everybody agrees that the effective date is May.",
  "If the contract had read, not simply \"claims arising under this contract,\" but in addition said \"including the formation or breach thereof,\" if the -- if the arbitration clause had included formation, then you would have no argument.",
  "It would go to the arbitrator.",
  "I thought that the union's initial position was that there was no agreement, and it refused to arbitrate. Isn't that what -- wasn't the union's refusal to arbitrate what precipitated this case?",
  "I thought that at that time the union refused to arbitrate.",
  "But, at least now that we have had the NLRB's -- the NLRB has weighed in and said that there was a contract as of July 2nd, why isn't that conclusive?",
  "Well, perhaps you can clarify one thing for me. I thought that these two go together -- two things that go together: One is the no-strike clause, and one is the arbitration clause.",
  "And you are trying to uncouple them, and so, even though one is quid pro quo for the other, you would say the union wants to keep what favors it, that is the arbitration clause, but reject what favors the employer, that is the no-strike clause. It seems to me that if you have one, you have the other, but you can't say, oh, yes, we have the arbitration clause, but we don't have the no­ strike clause.",
  "If it's true -- if it's true, which we can take for purposes -- for the current purpose, that the international really did induce the local to continue the strike, you said there's no action in State court because that's pre­ empted. Unfair labor practice proceedings is against the local, not the -- not the international. So there's nothing. It is in your view, you -- you said, well, there’s relief against the local, but there’s no remedy at all against the international, even if the allegation is true that this strike would never have occurred if it hadn't been for the pressure from the international.",
  "But that -- on that point, the government differs with you. The government says, as Justice Scalia suggested, there can be such a thing as constructive termination, and you must terminate.",
  "Your position is that the franchisor has to be the one to terminate?",
  "So that the franchisor can do outrageous things -- triple the rent, double the price of the fuel -- and you would say, even so, there’s -- that doesn't count as a termination because the franchisor hasn't terminated?",
  "And could you, Mr. Lamken, straighten out what happened in the district court? Because I take it there was an award for breach of contract as well as one for termination and they were in an identical amount. So what happened to the breach of contract?",
  "The award?",
  "That's a rather significant difference.",
  "Mr. O'Neil, I thought that there were some cases, landlord-tenant cases, where the tenant is not required to leave the premises because, as awful as the situation is, the tenant has no place to go.",
  "Is there -- is there any area of the law, other than this one, if you are right, in which a termination includes a non-termination; that is, where a constructive termination includes situations where the operation continues?",
  "And you didn't -- you didn't -- well, you sought an injunction, but Judge Zobel thought it was -- it came much too late.",
  "Can you explain to me -- the question I brought up before -- what was the difference of the elements between the recovery that the jury gave for constructive termination and for breach of contract?",
  "I think your point was that Duren was quite different in the numbers --",
  "-- starting out with women 54 percent of the population, and then dwindled to 14.5 percent of the -- of the jurors, available jurors.",
  "But you -- but your test is 10 percent. And if you have a minority, what is it here? 7 point -- whatever it is. 7 --",
  "It's under 10 percent. That would mean that a district is free to just disregard all the people who are under 10 percent of the population.",
  "Didn't the Michigan Supreme Court do essentially what Justice Alito suggested, that they said: We’ll give you the benefit of the doubt, go on to the third. But on that third, it seems to me there’s nothing that shows us what was the representation in the district before they made the change vis-à-vis the circuit courts, was there?",
  "That -- that's in the -- in the circuit court. Do we know what the figures were just for the district court?",
  "And then they would not have -- have gone on to the systemic issue, because the disparity was so marked, just on the -- just on the numbers?",
  "One point of information: What is the Michigan ID?",
  "Yes, but there you were dealing with an express exemption. There was an exemption for a woman, and also in the record was that the jury clerk was sending out notices saying: Women, if you do not wish to serve, return the summons to the judge named on the reverse side as quickly as possible. And then, further -- systematic -- if the card was not returned, if a card sent to a woman was not returned, it was automatically assumed that she did not wish to serve. There was no follow-up. So there was all kinds of evidence of systematic problems in Duren that are not present here.",
  "Where did the Court say that?",
  "Oh, that was after -- that was after showing the systematic factors. It was the plaintiff's burden -- or the defendant in the case, Duren -- burden to show there was a systematic factor. That was the automatic exception for a woman and how it worked in practice. After all of that, then Justice White tells us, the State could still come back and say yes, that's true, but there were other reasons why women didn't show up. Maybe they were disproportionately elderly, or maybe they were involved with child care. That's what -- that's what Duren said, that the -- showing a systematic factor was the plaintiff's burden, and then the State could justify why the numbers came out that way.",
  "Where does it say that?",
  "Where does it say that?",
  "May I stop you there for a moment? Because one of the things that was in the Duren opinion was that a child care excuse would be okay. I think Justice White said at the end, now, I'm not touching the typical hardship excuses, and one of them was child care, and that is -- certainly, in the early '70s, was going to disproportionately affect women. You have far fewer women if you give a child care exemption.",
  "But this -- he wasn't talking about individual cases.",
  "Is there -- is there a Federal district that corresponds to this Kent County? Is there a Federal district court that would be calling jurors in -- in the same geographical area?",
  "But you don't have -- you don't have comparable -- comparable records for what was going on in the -- in the district court?",
  "Yes.",
  "Can we go back to your point about -- that there was a big change when the draw came from the circuit first, before the districts. I thought it was agreed that, before, there was an 18 percent, on average, comparative difference and, after, 15 percent. That doesn't sound like a big change.",
  "That was a question of what was permitted. Here you’re trying to say this is required. The school’s case was, these are measures the district could take if it wanted to. But you are saying these are measures the district must take because the Constitution requires it. They are quite different settings.",
  "Mr. Long, we’re talking in the abstract --",
  "-- referring to Scott, but -- that this case -- what I took away from the Second Circuit's opinion was the flaw here was not that the method was no good if you had adequate notice; the flaw was the people affected were not told in what is the language of ERISA, in plain, simple language, what their entitlement was. And that's -- that's the problem, not that this method wasn't perfectly satisfactory if you gave everybody notice. But the Second Circuit said, you didn't give them notice. Either it said nothing or it was totally ambiguous.",
  "But if -- if there were information, but the -- the ERISA provision says that you are supposed to give the summary description of the plan “in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant.”",
  "And all that the 1989 statement said was the amount the employees received may be reduced, if they previously left the company and received a distribution at that time.",
  "But where is it -- what -- what was in the summary plan description on this point between 1980 and 1990, where is that?",
  "Right. So there was no description of this in the summary plan description?",
  "So is it -- but what period? Between 1980 and 1990 or the 3-month period ­ -",
  "-- you’re talking about?",
  "But you seem to be rearguing the -- I thought that the -- I thought that you had surrendered on -- what is it called? Frommert I. That -- that the Second Circuit said: What you had was no good, because it violated the notice provision and it violated the anti-cutback provision. So that's what they call a phantom --",
  "-- account. It's out.",
  "It’s out. But you seem to now be telling us that was really a wrong decision on the Second Circuit's part, that there was -- that it was perfectly good, that it was described in the plan itself, although not in the summary plan description.",
  "How does it -- how does it hurt the current employees?",
  "You say they -- they don't get this --",
  "So some kind of equal protection, that another worker will say: I didn't get that boon that my --",
  "But there's no -- no -- nothing -- no deduction from the current workforce. They’re getting what the plan said all along is the right calculation of benefits.",
  "Mr. Roberts, I thought you said in this -- in this case -- and we're only dealing with this case -- there was the same basic problem, the same flaw in the second interpretation. And you said in both cases, they wouldn't satisfy ERISA's notice requirement.",
  "Is it -- is it -- Mr. Roberts, is it a remedy? So that’s -- one thing is you can view this as the district court as substitute interpreter of the plan, or another way you can look at it is to say, the -- the benefit determination was wrong, we reject it, the court rejects it. So, now, there is a remedy for that wrongful determination. So is this, what’s going on in the district court, an interpretation of the plan or a remedy for a wrongful determination?",
  "Mr. Long, would you -- would you explain your position on the picture we were given of these people who were rehired and -- and they get, periodically, a statement that says, you are going to get 2,000-some-odd dollars; and then, 5 years later, they get a statement that says, no, it's only $5.18, or something like that.",
  "And not even about why -- why it was $5. It's why did he get notices that gave him the perception he was going to get over 2,000 when it was so much less?",
  "What would happen in the case -- in case it is a prisoner who is this prevailing party? Would the -- would the attorney fee be paid to the prisoner? And if not, to whom would it be paid?",
  "Where is the agreement between the party and the attorney? The Equal Access to Justice Act provides that fees will be paid to the prevailing party. Where does the prevailing party have a contract with the attorney to turn the fees over?",
  "You said that pursuant -- maybe I misunderstood you, but I thought you said that there is a contract between the prevailing party and the attorney. And where is -- how does that contract come about if it's simply a case that the lawyer is representing pro bono a plaintiff?",
  "That sounds like you're -- you have -- the client has an agreement to pay the lawyer or the client has paid the lawyer. It would make sense if the client has paid the lawyer and then there is reimbursement under EAJA that what -- what you're describing would make sense in that situation. But in most of these situations, the client doesn't have the wherewithal to pay the attorney upfront, of course.",
  "Is it --",
  "And does that mean --",
  "The award goes to the prevailing party. So, therefore, the attorney's fee is income to the client --",
  "-- is taxable income to the client?",
  "Like pain and suffering, but that's not --",
  "And then, in turn, income to the attorney when -- if the client --",
  "In exchange for getting 25 percent of the recovery?",
  "My understanding is that the ordinary payment to the lawyer for Social Security benefits gained for the client is 25 percent of the recovery to the client paid directly to the lawyer.",
  "So that, just as a background in this case, did Ms. Ratliff get that 25 percent?",
  "And that was because it was too small to be bothered with? What was the reason?",
  "And she could keep only one from the --",
  "She could keep only the larger of the two.",
  "One of the difficulties with your position is that Congress did exempt a number of Federal payments from the offset, but it didn't exempt Equal Access to Justice fees.",
  "In what percent of the Social Security cases where the claimant prevails is there an EAJA fee?",
  "Because there was no offset in the picture because the government wasn't offsetting.",
  "But Congress has provided in some statutes, the Social Security Act itself, 406, that you quoted, for the fee to be paid directly to the attorney. Here it used different language; it said pay the prevailing party.",
  "What would that be in this case? What was the -- the amount?",
  "If it -- if it stopped using it, it might be vulnerable to a Rizzo-type suit from the people who were benefiting.",
  "I thought in Ricci that was New Haven's position, that they thought that the test was unlawful because of the disparate impact.",
  "How long does the City's exposure persist? Let's say that the -- in the tenth round, someone is selected for the job from the qualified group. And then there's a cutback, and there are going to be layoffs. So the last hired is the first fired. Could -- would there be a Title VII suit when that last hired is laid off, on the ground that if Chicago had done what it was supposed to do, this person would have had the job long ago and would be higher up on the seniority list?",
  "I think you had a footnote in your reply brief that said that if your position prevails there would need to be an adjustment in the relief granted by the district court --",
  "-- wasn’t it?",
  "Suppose there were no list, but each time there was a hiring round the City just took from the top -- from the top score down. There’s no list, but each time the City uses the test results and hires the people with the top scores.",
  "No, my -- my hypothetical was there’s no list at all.",
  "They just go back to the raw scores, and each time they picked the top people.",
  "Well, what is -- what is the list, other than an administratively convenient way to use the scores?",
  "So even though there is a clear case on the merits of disparate impact, unless the suit is commenced within 30 days of the announcement, then it's as though it were lawful. That's your position.",
  "Is that -- is that -- there's a free pass. You don't sue within 30 days of the compilation of the list and the notice of the list; you sue 420 days later. The discriminatory practice gets frozen, the status quo gets frozen forever. That's -- that is your position, is it not?",
  "But this is not exactly a title -- a statute of limitations. It's a time you have to file your charge. It's a charge filing.",
  "There’s also a 2-year statute of limitations in Title VII. You can't get back pay, I think, for more than 2 years.",
  "You -- you don't have one case, I think, certainly not from this Court, of disparate impact. All the cases that you cite are disparate treatment cases.",
  "And let's add to that, that it was adopted 10 years ago --",
  "-- and Duke Power announced to the world that it was going to use a high school diploma. Indeed, it listed in the county all of the high school graduates and said: This is the list.",
  "Can we put that in concrete terms? It was the 89 percent cutoff, so that anybody who got below 89 percent on the test was never going to be considered until all the first people who got 89 to 98.",
  "You didn't have to take the list down. You simply could have said: Anyone who got a passing score, anyone who is qualified -- we’re not going to make the distinction between qualified and unqualified.",
  "You didn't have to throw out the list.",
  "You didn't have to throw out the test.",
  "I thought the expert said -- the test devisor said he didn't make up that 89 percent cutoff. That was Chicago that made that -- that decision.",
  "But you -- you've lost -- you've lost on that.",
  "No, but -- but going to 65, opening up the classification, is not adjusting the scores; it's not taking the list down; it's just saying anyone who passes the test can proceed to the next step.",
  "That was a disparate treatment case.",
  "And the -- the argument here is disparate impact is different because there’s no need to show intent of disparate impact.",
  "But if you can't travel there -- suppose you want to travel there so that you can meet with and discuss lawful activities with people there. If you can't get there, you can't speak.",
  "Mr. Cole, as I remember, Scales upheld a conviction, wasn’t --",
  "Mr. Cole, would you distinguish -- I think this came up in the court of appeals. There are a lot of groups on the list. I think the Al-Qaeda was one instance that was mentioned, and, at least according to the briefs, you conceded that if you wanted to do just what you describe with respect to the Kurdish group or the Tamil group, the ban would be permissible, if the group -- if the group were Al-Qaeda, and I’ll throw in the Taliban.",
  "Well, then -- then as -- suppose the group is not the two that we have here --",
  "-- but Al-Qaeda and the Taliban?",
  "Do you want to give an answer to the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda?",
  "But it isn't--",
  "-- whatever way they wish. They’re making clear that it's only in connection with lawful activity of the group, and indeed it's to train them in using lawful means to achieve their end. And I thought you went further than saying there has to be strictly independent advocacy. You recognized in your brief that they could meet with members of these terrorist organizations. They could meet and communicate with them, but they can't communicate advice on how to pursue their goals through lawful means?",
  "But you -- but you --",
  "You say that the -- not only the membership, but they can meet and they can discuss. And I don't understand the line between meeting with these terrorist organizations, discussing things with them, and instructing them on how they can pursue their goals through lawful means.",
  "What's involved here -- I think they said that they want to train them how to do lawful things, how to pursue their goals in a lawful, rather than a terrorist, way. And that is speech. It is not conduct. They want to engage in advocacy of peaceful means of achieving the goals of these groups.",
  "But they want to communicate, and you say they can communicate. And I still am having trouble with the line of what they can communicate and what they can't.",
  "The answer on the other side is: All we want to do is speak about lawful activities. We’re not supplying any guns, any communication equipment. We just want to speak about lawful activities. And I go back to my failure to understand your line between, yes, you can communicate with these people, but you can't communicate about going about their aims through peaceful means.",
  "So you can -- you can communicate, but the communications are censored. That’s -- you said you can meet with -- you can be a member, you can attend meetings, you can discuss things, but there are only -- there’s a certain point at which the discussion must stop, right?",
  "Does this -- what -- what these plaintiffs are seeking to do -- does it have any resemblance to the 150 prosecutions that you have brought under this Act? It was my understanding that those were for supplying weapons, supplying other equipment. Are there any prosecutions that are -- that aim at training to pursue the organization's aims through peaceful means?",
  "Is the life part of the --",
  "-- what the substantive crime was? Is it the attempted robbery or whatever it was? Is that -- because this is -- you're -- you’re saying this is an add-on to an underlying offense.",
  "Well, then -- then you wouldn't be relying on what might be a life sentence for the underlying crime.",
  "Yes, but where do you get the maximum? You say, oh, these are just minimums.",
  "But where is -- where is the maximum?",
  "Why can't we just say, as Judge Boudin did, they weren't -- this revision was on the books before Castillo was decided, so obviously Congress wasn't trying to adjust the statute in response to Castillo. And they -- they made it read more easily. We know the one thing Congress was concerned with was adding possession, which was not there before. So they added possession. They made it more readable. Some of the concerns that were expressed in Castillo are certainly present here. There is a huge jump from a 5-year add-on to a 30-year add-on for -- for the machinegun. So why don't we just say, well, this statute has been revised, but it wasn't in response to Castillo? It's not all that different.",
  "How about the short -- what is it, the one that gets 10 years, the short-barreled rifle? That's -- that's -- those two are together in the statute, and you said that it would be startling because of the difference between 10 years and the 30 years, but the short-barreled rifle is the same amount of time in discharging, and discharging is a sentencing factor.",
  "Now, they have to because that's what Harris said, brandished --",
  "-- brandished is a sentencing factor.",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, would you clarify one thing? You’re not questioning the Attorney General's determination that the underlying sex offense can have occurred pre-SORNA?",
  "Do you think part of it is there was a -- SORNA requires a lot more information than was required under the State statutes?",
  "Can you clarify --",
  "Can you clarify what you mean by “the statute comes into effect”? Because if I understand correctly, there’s only one State and one Indian tribe that are in compliance.",
  "But that would be what their --",
  "-- what their old law was. It wouldn't be -- you have -- SORNA is in effect, but what the State is implementing is the pre-SORNA State law, right?",
  "Are there errors that are -- that are so basic that they would call for an automatic new trial? You say this -- this is not such a -- such an error.",
  "What do you mean by “structural”?",
  "Yes, but if you can be concrete, other than a reasonable doubt charge, what else would be structural?",
  "What about the argument that was made that in the pre-enactment period the Web site was created, and that's when the -- that was the really hard labor, as compared to just keeping it up to date?",
  "Convicted, but not -- there was a possibility, but not a reasonable possibility. That is, it's conceivable, but the government also is urging the reasonable possibility that it is not likely, given the character of the evidence in the post-enactment period.",
  "Justice Kennedy suggested that, even though the conduct was pre-enactment, it would have come in to show pattern, scheme. So it's one -- one thing is to say the evidence, the jury would not have seen that evidence, would not have heard the evidence, and another to say the judge should have charged them: Now, you cannot use this evidence that you've heard for another purpose. You cannot use it to determine his guilt or innocence.",
  "What is your position that two concurring judges said that evidence should not have been -- not that it shouldn't have come in, but the jury should have been told you can convict only on post -- whatever the date was? But they also pointed out that one of the most severe incidents fell in the post-enactment period. It was in April of 2001. It was -- and that was vivid evidence properly -- properly used by the jury to determine guilt or innocence.",
  "So your position is, essentially, plain error doesn't apply in this area; it's just error because it involved evidence pre-enactment? That error is enough; it doesn't have to meet --",
  "It doesn’t have to meet the standard for plain error?",
  "But he did -- he did give time for counsel to ask additional questions, trial counsel.",
  "He asked both sides if they had additional questions.",
  "You made a change of venue motion at the outset, right?",
  "And I'm unaware of any case in which we have said a change is mandatory when what's involved is money rather than life or limb. Life or limb obviously was involved in the McVeigh case.",
  "Well, what was remarkable about some of those questionnaires, there were a lot of people didn't read the newspapers. There were a lot of people who indicated they really didn't know anything about this case.",
  "But there was some follow-up to that.",
  "Was there a challenge for cause against her?",
  "And I thought part of the government's theory was not --",
  "-- wasn't limited to the compensation. It was essentially Skilling owned shares, and he had information that those shares were inflated. Shareholders owned shares. They didn't have that information. Skilling then sold those shares at a great profit to himself. And the shareholders were left without that information. And then when the stock price plummeted, they all lost out. I thought that the government was not limiting the -- its position to the compensation, but was also dealing with the share price.",
  "May I -- I just don't -- because I'm looking at page 50. I thought this discussion goes from 50 to 52, and that the part on 52 certainly homes in on the share -- the shares.",
  "Why -- why do you put in the \"i.e.\"? Additional personal benefits could be both.",
  "I think we’ll ask the government to do that.",
  "What was -- Mr. Dreeben, what was the jury told when this honest services count was given to the jury? What was -- what were they told was the definition --",
  "Mr. Dreeben, would you clarify the issue that came up: Is the government's theory focused simply on the compensation or does it involve the sale of shares?",
  "But he didn't -- he didn't waive them. And quite unlike Butler -- Butler, if I have it right, said, \"I'll talk to you.\" So that was a statement --",
  "-- that he was waiving the right to remain silent. He volunteered to talk. Here there was no such indication that there was a waiver of his right to remain silent.",
  "We didn't say -- we don't have any decision that says the police are home free for 2 and a quarter hours. You said that that this was not lengthy interrogation.",
  "But we -- we have no decision that says that the police, faced with a silent suspect, goes after that suspect, questioning him incessantly for 2 and -- 2 hours and 15 minutes, that that is not lengthy.",
  "He said \"yeah,\" \"no,\" and \"I don't know.\"",
  "Then you’re saying then that the defendant has to -- never has to invoke his right? That --",
  "Was the Miranda warning adequate in this case? He got the four warnings, but then, unlike some police forms that then ask the defendant, do you waive your rights, this form never asked, did you waive your rights? It just said: Do you acknowledge that we have informed you of your rights?",
  "What page is --",
  "How many circuits have said that there is equitable tolling?",
  "Then it's a question of what are exceptional circumstances and whether it has to be something deliberate, which is what the -- as I understand it, the Michigan Court of Appeals said -- yes, if it was bad faith -- if it was a lie, a deception --",
  "So they’re drawing the line between intentional and -- and without intending but just being careless.",
  "Mr. Scher, one point that you didn't mention, but you did I thought stress it in your brief, was that counsel here said: Oh, the deadline had run even before I was engaged, even before I was appointed to represent this man, so there was nothing that I could do for him, because the time had already expired.",
  "But he never asked -- he wrote to the clerk, but he never asked to be informed when the judgment came down.",
  "Then you are -- you seem, from what you just said, to be relying on a distinction between paid counsel, who is just as careless, and court-appointed counsel, because in the one case the client had picked that attorney, and in the other case, the client was given this attorney by the State. So I think you’re suggesting that the State has some responsibility when it provides the counsel. But before you said, no, your answer would be the same if you were not making a distinction between court-appointed and paid counsel.",
  "The State -- the State has no responsibility even though it made this appointment? So you agree there's no difference, whether it was paid counsel, somebody that the -- that the defendant picked to represent him, and someone that he just had to take because it's what the State gave him?",
  "Under -- on direct appeal, if counsel conducted himself this way, the State would -- he’d have to get relief because the State would have the burden, but not -- not on collateral? Is that what you're saying?",
  "But you would say -- it is -- you could categorically excuse ordinary negligence as opposed to gross negligence?",
  "Are you saying that the rights -- if you could clarify your conception of privileges and immunities. Am I right in thinking that to keep and bear arms would be included even if we had no Second Amendment, as you envision privileges and immunities?",
  "But -- just tell us the dimensions of what it is. I mean, we have the eight amendments, so I know you say that's included. Keep and bear arms would be included even absent the Second Amendment. What unenumerated rights would we be declaring privileges and immunities under your conception of it?",
  "But that -- that court does not have the prerogative to overturn any of this Court's decisions, and I think it said -- said as much. So it was kind of a pass-through in the court of appeals. But I really would like you to answer the question that you didn't have an opportunity to finish answering, and that is: What other enumerated rights? What does the privileges and immunities of United States citizenship embrace?",
  "Yes.",
  "Even though -- even though a large portion of the population at that time didn't have those rights?",
  "No, throughout -- throughout the nation at the time.",
  "Did married women at that time across the nation have the right to contract, to hold property, to sue and be sued?",
  "Does it work just one way? I mean, if the notion is that these are principles that any free society would adopt, well, a lot of free societies have rejected the right to keep and bear arms.",
  "But this -- then it's not one expression of this unenumerated rights, natural rights, or the rights that any free society -- basic to a free society. So you -- you have to trim your definition. It's not basic to any free society.",
  "I thought that Heller -- Heller allowed for reasonable regulation.",
  "I thought that the Heller decision allowed for reasonable regulation, and it gave a few examples, as Justice Scalia mentioned.",
  "So you are saying that under -- under your view, every State would have to use a grand jury to bring criminal charges; no more information. And that every State would have to have a civil jury, if any party in the case requested it. Is that --",
  "That's a criminal case; that's quite different.",
  "What are the immunities set forth in the Westfall Act? I thought that they were -- they applied to all Federal employees?",
  "Including the Public Health Service.",
  "And that's a -- there’s a ceiling, because the Tort Claims Act refers to the law of the place where the act or omission occurred. In this case it's California?",
  "Which would put a lid on the damages, since this is a death case, of 250,000?",
  "Mr. Shah, is that -- is that the same -- in all the statutes that Carlson cites on page 20, when they say that Congress follows the practice of explicitly stating what it means to make the FTCA an exclusive remedy, there's this -- the Gonzalez Act and there’s 233(a), and then there is the swine flu. Are they all -- are all those provisions, provisions like 233(a), that say \"any civil action\"?",
  "Could the -- could the plaintiff contest the certification that this was within the scope -- and say it was so egregious, it was outside the scope, and, therefore, it doesn't come -- come within 233(a) or anything else, and so we have a straight claim against the defendants?",
  "Or they would lose their argument against the -- I mean, they would lose their claim against the government if they were taking that position?",
  "Now, that's quite a surprising statement for you to make, when the very first statute that Carlson mentions is 233(a).",
  "Yes.",
  "That's just (a). We’re just talking about (a).",
  "What -- what says \"entire subject\" -- 233(a), where does that say anything other than -- I mean, it reads like it's immunity from any civil action. That's -- those are the words I think that you have to overcome. It says: Plaintiff has a substitute remedy against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and the employee is immune from any civil action. And then you say, but any civil action doesn't include Bivens actions. And you must be saying that the later Act shrinks the former Act.",
  "It amended 233(a) --",
  "-- without mentioning it?",
  "So the Gonzalez Act is after Bivens.",
  "But you say the same thing -- even though Bivens was before Congress -- and even though the Gonzalez Act doesn't have an exception for Bivens claims, you read one into the Gonzalez Act?",
  "The Westfall Act could be read to say we’re now covering all these people who did not have, who were not sheltered by immunity before, but this amendment saves out Bivens claims. One could read that as self-contained and not touching other statutes that existed independently before.",
  "If you are right about that -- I guess it would be the same under the Alien Tort Statute -- then the Filartiga case -- if the -- if there had been a quest -- request to dismiss because Filartiga was a former officer, and the same thing in Karadzic, none of those could have gone forward?",
  "Is there -- is there any Alien Tort Statute or the torture statute that would have survived, under your view, because your view is it's no exception under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, end of case?",
  "Yes, but that doesn't -- that's not going to happen.",
  "Well, when you -- going back to where you started -- you started saying the officer must go together with the state, because in reality it's the same thing; it's a suit against the state. But this is a case seeking money out of the pocket of Samantar and no money from the treasury of Somalia, so why is the suit against the officer here equivalent to a suit against the state?",
  "Well, that sounds like you're -- you're talking about an “act of state” doctrine, not that the suit against one is the equivalent of a suit against the other.",
  "I'm not sure that I followed your distinction of the domestic law, per se, because say, the Federal Tort Claims Act, to come within that Act and to have the government cover it, the officer has to be acting within the scope of her employment, however careless or reckless she may be.",
  "How can you maintain that position when the Department of State takes the position that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act applies to a state and agencies and instrumentalities, but it doesn't apply to officers? If it was all that certain that they didn't even have to put it in, then is -- the State Department is being recalcitrant?",
  "Ms. Millett --",
  "-- I thought your point is, if the relief is against the state, it doesn't matter who you name as the plaintiff.",
  "Whether it's injunctive relief or money relief, if the relief is against the state, obviously, you can't dodge it by naming the officer instead.",
  "Ms. Millett, do you agree with the --",
  "Do you agree with the government that it's the government's advice -- the government said, in the old days, the Tate letters went out in all these cases. Now, they no longer go out when we’re dealing with a state itself or a state agency, but we still -- the Executive -- basically, as I read the government's position, the government is saying: The Executive Branch decides. We tell the court. And if we don't tell the court that this person can be sued, then the person can't be sued. Are you in sync with the government in that we are now back to the Executive -- essentially, the Executive decides, not the court?",
  "Mr. Kneedler --",
  "This is -- it's now many years, and we still don't -- the State Department has said in effect: We decide. Can you tell the Court, is this defendant amenable to suit or is there an immunity that would cover him?",
  "How does this case --",
  "How does this very case establish a rule of law for the foreign state? The Act is aimed at torturers. The remedy comes out of the private pocket. How does this establish -- if the thing plays out and the plaintiffs prevail, there will a remedy against an individual actor; there will be no relief awarded against any government. How would it set a rule for the foreign government?",
  "Never mind that this person has long lived in the United States, in Virginia. It will have no effect -- will have no effect whatever on the government of Somalia?",
  "Which means -- which means what? What is the consequence of that? You concede that on the strict application of the 6 months she -- her income is much too high for her possibly to pay the creditors. So what happens to her?",
  "That's -- can you explain that? It seems very odd. It says she can do that if she doesn't do what the statute requires her to do. I mean, she's supposed to file that schedule. She's required, the statute says, to file it. But she gets an advantage if she doesn't do what she's instructed to do?",
  "Moveable to where? What -- what would be -- you say -- this time period, the statutory -- the 6-month lookback, she has these 2 extraordinary months. So now she's going to say: Court, please change the period. Change it to what? Anything she wants?",
  "But you already told us that there could be a deviation through this 101(10A)(ii). And why, if that was all that needed to be done, did the trustee recommend, did the trustee say, bankruptcy judge, let's move the period, let's use this provision and we will get another period that doesn't have those 2 months with the extraordinary income?",
  "Well, it could have been suggested to the debtor: You can accomplish what you want by using this provision.",
  "But let me just stop you there, because then the answer you gave to the Chief and to Justice Scalia doesn't fit. Chief -- you can not -­ the bankruptcy judge is not going to confirm the plan was she has to pay over $1,000 a month, because she could never do that. So you are not going to get that confirmed plan which could be amended later.",
  "Well, what in addition to -- you brought up the 101 solution that she doesn't do what the statute tells her to do, so she's able to move it if the judge agrees. And you said she has other options.",
  "But then the creditors would have been a lot worse off, would they not have been?",
  "Well, why would -- why would the trustee be urging the possibility that it would be okay for her to file under Chapter 7, in which case the unsecured creditors would get very little, but it's not okay for her to use chapter 13 with a plan that would give the unsecured creditors substantial payments?",
  "Isn't that -- wouldn't that amount to just a -- a waste of everybody's time, to dismiss it and then refile it, and then she gets a time period that doesn't -- why -- why not just drop out those 2 months that are not representative of her income?",
  "But the thing is -- but you have explained, your number one solution for her is this 101 route, which is -- gives lots of discretion in the court.",
  "Yes.",
  "How do you deal with the Petitioner's -- the two arguments Petitioner makes? One is that on the expense side, Congress provided for special circumstances, exceptions, and it didn't on the income side?",
  "What about the argument that this is a simple thing; she didn't have to file the plan -- she didn't have to file the petition at a time when those two months would be in the 6-month lookback. She could have waited.",
  "It wasn't brought up -­ comity wasn't brought up in Hibbs because if the -- if there was an alleged constitutional violation, then there was only one way to go. The parochial -- the payments to the parochial schools could not be -- had to be eliminated, so there was no question of abstention versus invalidation or doing something else that was fancy. That's -- that's why this case is nothing like that, because there was only one way -- only one cure. But you mentioned here there were various things. What -- the Federal court could -- is -- is being asked to increase somebody else's taxes. That's a very strange notion. But what could the State court do? The same case in State court -- and let's assume there is a constitutional violation, either the Commerce Clause or the equal protection. What could the State court do that a Federal court couldn't?",
  "Where is -- the cases running up to Hibbs, those were all cases that involved racial discrimination, and they were in the Federal courts.",
  "Suppose the answer -­ suppose the answer -­",
  "Well, there's another little problem. Do you know of any case where a benefit that A enjoys is taken away from A in a suit where A is not a party? I mean, you are fighting the Ohio tax commissioner. You want to take a benefit away from these LDCs, but they are not in the suit. Don't -­ isn't there a little due process problem with that?",
  "What was that argument? That you're taking a benefit -- you're saying: The only relief we want is to take this benefit away from people who are not in the lawsuit?",
  "Why should -- why should the Federal court make that choice? I mean, in the -­ in the Federal cases where extension versus invalidation has come up, those were all Federal laws and the court said in the interim, we are going to extend the benefit, we are not going to take away benefits from anyone. Every one of those cases they extended a benefit until -- unless and until Congress acts, but there was some comfort there because they were dealing -- the Federal court is dealing with Federal legislation. It seems to me that -- that there is that choice, the State courts are much better equipped to say what should happen in the interim until the legislature acts.",
  "The State court could.",
  "But that's because there was only one way to go. Either the benefit is removed or it's not. There wasn't the other possibility of decreasing the taxes on your client. There wasn't an extension versus invalidation. It was if the constitutional claim was good, it had to be invalidated, the credit had to be invalidated.",
  "It is not up to you to make that decision, if the State can go either way. I mean in the extension versus invalidation cases this Court made it very clear, you could go one way or the other, and that was a decision for the court to make, not the litigant.",
  "But the other view was the Federal court should abstain. Abstention doctrines are not the most easy to grant, so -- but they did bring up abstention.",
  "But here the court of appeals said that the Act does two things. First, it said that the full board can delegate full powers to any three-member group. That was step one, and that was done here. And then it says there's this rule that a quorum is three, but then it said: Except as to one of these three-member groups that has been designated, except, and there the quorum is two. So why doesn't the statute answer the question that, yes, a quorum is three, except when it's two?",
  "But it's not an agent of the board because the three-member group that has a quorum of two has the full powers of the board. So the statute doesn't say anything about a three-member group that has a quorum of two being an agent of the board.",
  "But where does the statute make that three-member group with a quorum of two, a quorum of two, an agent? It says they may be designated to exercise any and all powers?",
  "The D.C. Circuit I think was the source of your opening argument because they said when the number drops below three there is no board, and I guess that's what your opening argument was based on.",
  "There have been situations before where the board dwindled to two members. Is this the first time that the board has continued to adjudicate the cases that they can, or when there were prior periods with only two did the board continue to adjudicate?",
  "Heard an initial -- an initial decision. But just -- the review of the panel is in the court of appeals, right?",
  "So you could have initially a panel of five, but that would not be reviewing the panel of three?",
  "Is this different from the practice that some courts of appeals follow of circulating a panel decision to the full court some days before it's issued to the public? That doesn't put the non-panel members on the panel. Is this practice that you are describing the same or is it different?",
  "But that's quite different from the court of appeals sitting en banc. The practice of circulating the opinion does not put all of the members of the court on the panel.",
  "Is your point that official acts done stay in effect even though the official is gone, until the official's successor in office is appointed and that successor can remand the instruction?",
  "How -- how has it -- how has it worked? And I understand that they are not dealing with controversial decisions. How many decisions are there now?",
  "There are -- there are two nominees, are there not?",
  "Three?",
  "Except that it said \"except.\"",
  "At all times \"except.\"",
  "I thought the government told us in this -- in that case that Carmack wasn't in the case because it was either waived or something. But the case was considered on the basis of, on the one hand, COGSA and, on the other, the law of 50 States.",
  "Yes, but uniformity is one thing when you’re talking about 50 States and another when it's just two Federal statutes.",
  "Where -- we’re looking where, now?",
  "Mr. Fisher -­",
  "-- you -- you say -- you present this argument that it is a second petition and you say that's the only issue before us and there is no other way that the new proceeding would be cut off under There was in this case, in the first -- when the -- the sentence was set -- set aside, an order by the district judge; and it said: Magwood, I want you now to bring out all conceivable -- all conceivable claims on pain of forfeiture. Why doesn't that alone -- this is an order by the court: I don't want you to engage in seriatim litigation; I want you to bring forward all conceivable claims. And that was an order and it was made on pain of forfeiture. Why isn't that dispositive of this case?",
  "Yes, but what he's bringing up now was a conceivable claim that he could have brought up then.",
  "But the issue is the same. The issue is that he didn't qualify for the death penalty because at the time he committed this offense, there had to be, in addition to the eligible offense, at least one aggravator.",
  "So why doesn't preclusion result from the court's order that says: Bring up all conceivable claims?",
  "Mr. Fisher -- Mr. Fisher, to get -- I get your \"second, it's a new judgment.\" But thinking in terms of what AEDPA was attempting to do, we have two claims, one after the other. The second claim is one that would take away the death penalty forever, that would be it, because he said the only sentence I can get is life without parole. He brings instead, first, one that doesn't make him -- that still leaves him exposed to the death penalty. So the court has been put upon twice. If he had brought the first claim and he is right about that, he's not death eligible. Instead, he brings a claim that still leaves him death eligible, and the court has been burdened twice, when easily he could have brought, as the district judge instructed him to do, everything the first time.",
  "And Mr. Fisher uses the word \"claim\" as -- differently.",
  "He makes a distinction between \"issue\" and \"claim.\" Yes, it's the same issue; could have been -- the issue could have been raised earlier, but, he says, it's not the same claim. And the statute uses the word \"claim.\"",
  "I thought your answer to Justice Scalia's point: Suppose it was raised but the Court didn't decide it.",
  "Your test, I take it, is that he must have one full and fair opportunity to litigate the question; that means to raise it, to have it aired, and to have it decided.",
  "Why wouldn't that simply be going through the motions? The Second Circuit put the wrong label on it, but everything it said could have been plugged into: Our decision is under Rule 12(b)(6) rather than 12(b)(1)?",
  "How could they come down on your side if they say there is no private right of action?",
  "Mr. Dubbs, you said something that I thought quite revealing in this -- in your brief. I mean, this case is Australian plaintiff, Australian defendant, shares purchased in Australia. It has \"Australia\" written all over it. And in your reply brief you said: \"If the Plaintiff is a foreign securities purchaser as this one is, Sinochem makes it clear that forum non conveniens may dictate dismissal of an action brought in the U.S.\" And taking that, why not -- of the applicable laws to this transaction, to this alleged fraud, isn't the most appropriate choice the law of Australia rather than the law of the United States?",
  "Not just a question of proper forum, but the proper law?",
  "If all that were done and it were never communicated, there wouldn't be any violation.",
  "And the communication was done in Australia by the Australian bank.",
  "Let's -- let's go back to the question that I asked you about the appropriate forum. You -- you seem to give this very case -- the plaintiff is a foreign securities purchaser. When the plaintiff's choice is not -- is not its home forum, the presumption in the plaintiff's favor applies with less force, et cetera. But you have an Australian plaintiff suing in the United States based on shares purchased in Australia and the lead defendant is the Australian bank. So what -- what did you mean when you were referring to Sinochem and forum non conveniens?",
  "If we had only HomeSide's conduct, nothing else, there wouldn't be any violation of 10(b); is that right?",
  "But nothing has happened. Suppose it had been caught by the Australian bank, and they didn't act on it?",
  "Now, I concede your argument that a big component of this fraud was what went on in Florida, but it needed to be disclosed to the public. It needed to be put out there. And that wasn't done in Florida by the Florida defendants.",
  "Not if it's decided here, unless you want to say, the Australian court to say, the United States taking this case is so outrageous that we will not respect its judgment. And that's a factor, too. It's -- what conflict of laws is all about is you have two jurisdictions, both with an interest in applying their own law, but sometimes one defers to the other.",
  "I thought Morrison -­",
  "Mr. Dubbs, Morrison, the first-named plaintiff, was a derivative holder.",
  "But do you have -- you have two classes of plaintiffs, one the Australians, who bought their shares in Australia; then you have Morrison, who has an ADR, and who is dismissed because he wasn't able to show damages.",
  "So what U.S. investor was harmed?",
  "What about the -­",
  "Purchased -- purchased or sold?",
  "On the -- on the extraterritorial presumption against it, your colleague on the other side tells us that in all the cases where the presumption applied, all of the conduct was someplace else, and they give the Aramco case and say that was an employee hired in -- was it Saudi Arabia -­",
  "-- and everything happened outside the country.",
  "Here, I mean, you have to concede that a component of the alleged fraud occurred in Florida.",
  "Mr. Roberts -­",
  "Mr. Roberts, because your time is running out, there is a basic question here. You are asking us to make a distinction between what the SEC can sue for and what a private party can sue for. Congress did that with respect to aiders and abettors. Is there any other instance in which we have made a distinction, yes, the SEC has a claim but the private litigant doesn't?",
  "Because the foreperson at first hesitated. When the court asked the question, \"Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not,\" then there's no response. And then the court says, \"Yes or no?\" And only at that second point does the foreperson say \"no.\" So it was a reluctant \"no.\"",
  "And that's another factor in this. We have the transcript. Are you urging that, because the trial court judge was there on the spot, saw the jury, worked with the jury, that that's something that deserves a special measure of respect?",
  "There was no -- there was no pause, you agree, between the foreperson's report and the court then said immediately afterward: The jury is dismissed. So there was no interval for an objection?",
  "But what is the status of the -- the Allen charge in Michigan? Has Michigan taken a position on whether that's a good thing, a permissible thing for a trial court to do?",
  "And that wasn't requested, either?",
  "She.",
  "Mr. McGormley, do we have any indication how long this trial judge was on the bench when this trial came up?",
  "Yes.",
  "I thought your -- your position was that everybody agrees on what the law is: If there is a deadlock, a new trial is appropriate. So there is no question about that statement of the law. It's the fact question, was this a deadlock, and up until now we have been talking about this, including Justice Scalia, under the fact problem of AEDPA; that is, have you shown by clear and convincing evidence.",
  "What does he have to lose at that point? She has made the ruling and that's that there is going to be a mistrial. The lawyer at that point can say: Your Honor, I object, and moreover, I would like you to give the Michigan version of the Allen charge. Nothing stopped the lawyer from doing that.",
  "That's a little shaky as precedent for -- that -- that was a case that said: The trial judge did right and no double jeopardy for a new trial. But in passing, to get there, the Court said: Well, this case didn't involve that. But the Court isn't passing on anything other than the trial judge in that case didn't violate defendant's right.",
  "Mr. McGormley, you have stressed throughout that it's not -- not the question that Justice Breyer put, but there are two -- you have emphasized the two screens. This comes to us after we have the trial court ruling and the Michigan Supreme Court ruling. So the case isn't all that easy, without making the judgment as though it were coming up in the Federal system.",
  "Mr. Sady, you -- you said something about 15 percent or 85 percent is a more workable system than -- was it 12.9 percent? Do we have any information on, (A), the number of Federal prisoners who get good time and in that universe, the ones who get good time, how many get the full credit and how many get something less than the full 54 days?",
  "Mr. Wall, the -- if we consider both methods plausible, the number comes out at 15 percent -- 85 percent, 15 percent. It's a more workable number, and there are some hints in the legislative history that Congress thought 85 percent, not 87.2 or whatever it is. So in choosing between those two methods, why not take the easier number to work with?",
  "Do you disagree with your colleague that that is the case most of the time, that most Federal prisoners get good time credit, and of the ones who get credit, most of them get the full 54 days?",
  "But the argument -- one of the arguments is it is not punishment at all. This is a reward; this is a reward for good behavior.",
  "Ms. Freeland --",
  "Ms. Freeland --",
  "May I take you on another path, not the question of the difference between the two -- two sections. We have a large prison population, and then Booker comes down, and then the guidelines change only as to crack cocaine, nothing else. All of the others whose sentence has become final cannot get into the court's door because they don't have the entering wedge. In what system -- what fair system would say, aha, because the crack cocaine guideline was reduced -- the disparity was reduced -- these people are now going to overcome the finality bar, but all of the others who are identically situated with respect to all other factors, they don't get their sentences revised?",
  "But why should, bearing in mind that entire prison population similarly situated, the courts say it’s -- the finality bar is lifted only to the extent that the crack cocaine guideline disparity has been reduced?",
  "If you -- if you are right that this benefit goes to -- only to the class that can get in the door, wouldn't that be a powerful motive to the Sentencing Commission not to make its guidelines reductions retroactive?",
  "Ms. Freeland, what would happen if the -- the motion is made with respect to the crack cocaine, and the judge said, I'm -- I'm not going to -- I deny the motion? Would the judge then have to go on and consider Booker and say, now, on this piece, I deny the motion, but now I can just do whatever I want with the rest of it?",
  "Well, if -- suppose Congress and the Sentencing Commission had made it crystal clear that they are authorizing a reopening but only with respect to one piece. You say -- you say no matter how clear it is, as a matter of constitutional law, because Booker has been decided, the whole sentence is up for --",
  "-- consideration?",
  "Does that extend to -- which was part of this case -- the court notices that there was a technical error; it was a calculation error the first time, and the judge says, well, I’ll fix that up, too. That was an arithmetic error.",
  "Have there been other guidelines ranges that have been reduced, and, if so, were those also retroactive?",
  "I think you told me -- I asked you that question, and you told me it could not be corrected, because everything was final.",
  "Can I get you to go back to -- you said something that only the executive can grant clemency or ought. What -- what about a program where a district judge says I'm going to have this person undergo a course -- a drug addiction course, and if the defendant successfully passes the course, then I’ll give a lighter sentence? That -- that --",
  "Did your answer exclude that -- that possibility?",
  "Is this law unique to the District or do other States -- I mean, the problem that they are trying to get a handle on is domestic violence. And the prosecutors are busy prosecuting drug crimes and the rest. So the District's solution is, we will allow the abused person to initiate this criminal contempt. Are there other States that have the same procedure?",
  "I -- I mean, however you describe it in practical terms, are there other places that say, abused person, you can initiate this and you can have your lawyer present it, whether it's on behalf of the State or -- but just the practical of how you go through the motions; are there other States that allow the victim?",
  "Well, we can ask the government.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, as a threshold question, is there a mootness problem here, because, as I understand it, the Petitioner came back to the country illegally and committed another minor crime? But his coming back illegally and being turned away again, as I understand the law, means that he cannot get any dispensation as a result of the illegal entry. So even if we were to hold in your favor now, I take it that he could not -- he would not have any hope of getting any cancellation of removal or any other dispensation. Is that so?",
  "I -- I -- I think also in the picture is that he never contested removability. The only thing was the grace: Would -- would he qualify for discretionary relief by the Attorney General? So the -- the removal order itself, I take it, would stand.",
  "Ms. Saharsky, do we take into account at all -- I mean, in Lopez as I understand it, the petitioner prevailed because it would not have been a felony under the Federal law. Is that right?",
  "Here we’re talking about two crimes. One is a small amount of marijuana. He gets 20 days in jail. The other is a pill that I never heard of, a Xan-something, and then he gets, what, 10 days in jail for that. If you could just present this scenario to an intelligent person who didn't go to law school, as you're going to not only remove him from this country, but say never, ever darken our doors again because of one marijuana cigarette and one Xan-something pill -- it -- it just seems to me that if there’s a way of reading the statute that would not lead to that absurd result, you would want to read the statute. If you are forced to read it because there’s no other way -- but maybe there is another way.",
  "I thought if it’s in the Federal court, and the -- they are going to use it as a recidivist offense, (a) the defendant is notified of that, and (b) is given an opportunity to say there’s something infirm about that first conviction. That's totally absent from this picture. You say, oh, well, that's just a matter of procedure, so he doesn't have to get that anyplace. I think that Congress is requiring that. It's certainly an element of fundamental due process fairness, notice and opportunity to say, no, the first conviction shouldn't count.",
  "But my point is that if it all happened in the Federal court, if these two possession offenses all happened in the Federal court, at the time of the second one the -- the defendant would have gotten the notice and the opportunity to knock it out. I'm not talking about immigration, but just -- and he doesn't have that opportunity the way you treat it. He doesn't -- didn't get that in the State court because nobody thought that this was a recidivist offense in the State court.",
  "Do we know practically, both on the State side and on the Federal side, do prosecutors presented with a simple possession case, do they -- do we ever see in real life this combination that somebody's going to be convicted as a recidivist when it's one marijuana cigarette on one time and one pill on another? Do prosecutors, Federal or State, do that?",
  "May I ask you --",
  "-- because your time is running out. I take it your answer would be the same -- at least these two misdemeanors were committed a year apart, but if they were 10 years apart, your answer would still be the same?",
  "There was another crime, I thought a more serious crime, though still a misdemeanor, in this picture, but the Texas prosecutor didn't make anything of that. Remind me of what that was, but I thought it was a -- a more grave offense.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes --",
  "So we respect that judgment on the part of the prosecutor, not to make it a -- a ground for a recidivist charge, but we don't respect the prosecutor -- Texas prosecutor saying I'm just going to treat this like it's a first-time misdemeanor; that's it.",
  "In addition to -- that was said at the meeting -- and Lieutenant Duke, who was the same one who later says: I'm not going to monitor as long as you pay the difference. There was the statement at the meeting by that same person. Wasn't there something in writing by the police chief to follow up after that meeting?",
  "Then, according to what you just said, the jury determination was superfluous. If there was no reasonable expectation of privacy because the officers were told this is just -- we treat this just like e-mails, it can be monitored, it can be made public, then there would be no reasonable expectation of privacy and there would be no question to go to the jury.",
  "If we take it that the Stored Communications Act does say that the provider may not give out the transcripts, if we take that as given, then how can the department lawfully use the transcripts?",
  "Why is -- why is that so? I mean, it did say associated equipment. And -- and if an employee is told now e-mails aren't private, so we’re warning you, we can monitor them, wouldn't such an employee expect the same thing to apply to the pager?",
  "But my question is, an employee reads this policy and says, oh, my e-mails are going to be subject to being monitored --",
  "Wouldn't that employee expect that the policy would carry over to pagers? I mean, would -- when you think of what's the reason why they want to look at the e-mails, wouldn't the same reason apply?",
  "I thought that he said -- he was saying: But as far as billing is concerned, I'm not going to look at these; if you use more than 25,000 characters, you pay the extra, and that will be the end of it. If you contest that, then I’ll look to see whether those in excess of 25,000 characters were for work purposes or private purposes. And so he's talking about the billing. He hasn't retracted what was said at the meeting about -- that these text messages are subject to audit.",
  "Did he say \"we\"? He -- even Quon didn't say that. Duke said he wouldn't do it. But earlier, the -- at the meeting, the statement was made that these are open to audit. Didn't say only by Lieutenant Duke.",
  "I thought the policy was limited personal use.",
  "But the -- the notice was we’re going to treat these just like e-mails, and e-mails were limited personal use.",
  "But, Mr. McConnell, Justice Scalia had just made the point that the all-comers policy overwhelms the other, so that I would like you to deal up front with the all-comers policy that the dean in her deposition said, loud and clear: \"Our policy is all-comers. Yes, Republicans have to be admitted to the Democratic group and vice versa.\" So unless you are challenging the veracity of the dean after stipulating, as you did, that all-comers is the policy, I don't see how we can listen to your argument about the so-called written policy.",
  "But, Mr. McConnell, here is a statement, a stipulation. It's a stipulation for summary judgment. It says: District Judge, you take this to be the fact: Hastings requires that registered student organizations allow any student to participate, become a member, seek leadership positions in the organization. That is not qualified. It says: District Judge, here are the facts that we stipulate. It doesn't say this is what the dean says, but it's not really enforced. It's not qualified at all.",
  "And is --",
  "And Hastings takes the position that it's all in favor of diversity, not only among the groups but within the groups. So --",
  "It is that they --",
  "They say, yes, we believe in diversity among groups, but we also believe in diversity within the group; that's a good thing. They are not backing off from: We think diversity among groups is fine.",
  "It may be --",
  "It may be an ill-advised policy, but the school says: It's our policy. It's working fine, and all the -- the hypotheticals about sabotage, takeover, they haven't happened.",
  "Mr. McConnell, let's say it is the belief of this group, based on their reading of the Bible, that only white men can lead the Bible studies, can become officers of the group, and that's based on their fundamental belief that that's what the Bible instructs. On your view, must Hastings give this organization status as a recognized student organization?",
  "But the belief is -- this is the belief.",
  "So, they -- they would have to negate their belief in their practice. They could believe this, but they couldn't implement it?",
  "But you -- Mr. Garre, you did say that the evidence is the dean's deposition. There’s no prior evidence. But there are schools, including law schools, that have this policy. Is that not so?",
  "It's also the --",
  "-- the university's across-the-board rules for all student conduct against disruption, against incivility. The list would certainly carry over.",
  "That was the predecessor group.",
  "Is -- was there any proof in this record? I mean, there’s a stipulation for summary judgment. Was there any proof showing that it wasn't evenly applied?",
  "Mr. Garre, the -- the so-called written policy, that has a -- that list has a correspondence to the State's law, doesn't it?",
  "The categories that are listed there are the categories that under California law are proscribed bases for discrimination?",
  "Mr. McConnell --",
  "Mr. McConnell, you don't challenge that there are universities, including four law schools, that have an all-comers policy?",
  "There are private universities.",
  "It can say 90 days. It can say 90 days.",
  "This is a -- this is, in one respect, Ms. Karlan, a technical argument, is it not? Because it's true that this defendant, from the probation officer's report, knew within the 90 days what restitution was going to be recommended.",
  "But, functionally, isn't it a substitute for the remedy that the victim of a crime might have? Wasn't what Congress was trying to do was to spare the victim the necessity of suing the defendant and having his kind of civil restitution tacked onto the criminal proceeding?",
  "Is there no -- is there no possibility that a judge could say: I want to make this analogous to 54(b) under the civil rules; that is, I don't want to delay the time that the defendant can appeal from the -- from the -- from the sentence. So this order is final, and 3 months later, I’ll take up the question of restitution when all the information is in. The court is prevented from doing that?",
  "So the judge -- but the judge could say -- once she thinks she needs -- that they need time for more information: I'm going to defer the whole sentencing. So, Defendant, you’ll have to wait 3 months to find out how much time you’re going to serve. That would be all right. You could use the 90-day period to extend the time for imposing the sentence. Well, in effect, you’re saying the sentence isn't final, so she could change it any time within the 90 days?",
  "And if he misses --",
  "Mr. Heytens, one problem with the -- we have said that notice of appeal -- that that time limit is jurisdictional, which means if the defendant misses that deadline, no appeal. And we’re leaving this in a nebulous state if the judge says, within -- this is -- this is a judgment of conviction and sentence, but I'm still thinking about the restitution. The defendant has to know at that point, must I appeal that first judgment? Because if I don't, I'll never be able to appeal it. But on your reading, the defendant can't wait. When the judge imposes a sentence, the defendant must meet the time clock for notice of appeal from the sentence.",
  "But that -- that would mean even if the judge says, I’m going to impose the restitution order 10 days from now, defendant's time clock for notice of appeal would begin at -- at the time the sentence is imposed, not 10 days later when restitution is --",
  "So this then becomes a goal, not a time line -- a deadline?",
  "Well, that’s rather theoretical because if that -- I mean, the -- the judge surely would have acted before he could process an appeal.",
  "Do you know, Mr. Bendure, what exactly the corporate relationship was between the two?",
  "Thank you.",
  "What was the first -- when was your first notice of that? I mean, it was on the first page of the ticket, but the answer came after the statute of limitations. Was that your first notice that there was this different entity, or did you know that earlier?",
  "Did the -- did the name show up any place other than page 1 of the general conditions of passage?",
  "That's -- and this is what? An 11-page, very small print --",
  "Mr. Bendure, would you explain one factual matter to me? I might have gotten this wrong, but I thought the answer was filed after the 1 year had run.",
  "So when the answer was filed it was too late for you to come within the statute of limitations.",
  "And I thought that would be the answer that you would give to Justice Sotomayor, because when you got the answer -- which was filed after how many days?",
  "If you had gotten that a few days earlier, you could have amended, and then we wouldn't be here.",
  "But the basic point is the answer didn't come in until you were already out under the statute of limitations.",
  "So from their point of view, nothing else matters; you were out when they filed their answer, and you could do nothing to cure that.",
  "Mr. Bendure, in addition to the mailing of the ticket -- the mailing of the ticket came; it said \"Costa Cruise\" -- were there any other connections between the plaintiff passenger and Costa Cruise beyond the ticket coming in an envelope that says \"Costa Cruise\"?",
  "Mr. Glazier --",
  "Is there any other than that one page on the ticket, that against the mailing envelopes that she got that say \"Costa Cruise\" -- is there anything in the entire record other than that definition page that includes carrier, that includes steward, anything else that tips her off that this is a different corporation?",
  "What is the relationship between those corporations?",
  "But are they -- are they sister corporations, a parent-sub --",
  "-- or what?",
  "And if you went to --",
  "If you went to the Web site, which was mentioned, for Costa Cruise, there would be a tab that says \"Our ships\" \"Our ships\" -- and one of those ships is Costa Magica, whatever.",
  "\"Our ships,\" and it identifies Costa Cruise as the cruise operator. That's the information that's given to passengers in the United States who are going to book on these ships. It says Costa Cruise, our ships, Costa Cruise is the operator. That's what was being put forth to the public.",
  "So it shouldn't matter that this confusion was caused in large part by this entity that advertises in English under the name \"Costa Cruise\" and identifies Costa Cruise as the operator. \"The largest European cruise operator\" is how Costa Cruise is -- is identified in -- in the advertising.",
  "And the answer is filed conveniently after the 1-year period has run.",
  "Did the answer say the statute -- the 1-year period has run? Was that raised as a defense in the answer?",
  "When was it raised as a defense?",
  "But that -- the Rule 4(m) period concerns when you can serve. It doesn't say that the statute of limitations is any more than what was the term of the -- of the passage, was 1 year.",
  "Where -- where is the defense -- I mean, the ticket says suit must be filed within 1 year of the date of any alleged injury. And where is the -- that defense stated? You said it comes up 10 weeks --",
  "But we -- let's clarify that point now. I am looking at 3a, which is the court of appeals opinion, and it says that \"Costa Crociere moved to dismiss, arguing that it had been sued after the 1-year ticket period allowed for claims set forth\" -- as set forth in the ticket. Then the rule tells us that you have this much time to serve, and then the complaint will -- the -- the amendment will relate back to the date of the original filing. It doesn't change your statement, your defense. The 1-year statute of limitations isn't affected. What is affected is the complaint will relate back if there’s an amendment filed. But the 1-year statute of limitations remains, and you didn't bother to answer until the -- that time had run.",
  "Yes, but the relation back is different from the point at which the statute has run. The statute runs after 1 year. Then, if she does what the rules say, it can relate back to the date of the original filing. The fact remains that you didn't file your answer until after the limitation period had run.",
  "Are you saying that in Hanrahan there was no prod at all from the court, and here there is?",
  "In Hanrahan, there was no prod from the court; the court didn't say anything that -- it was the filing of the complaint that led to the action, wasn't it?",
  "Suppose now, in response to \"Do it right,\" Reliance on a complete record and very careful review finds that total disability was not proved. Then there would be no fees, right?",
  "What about the footnote that was mentioned in Ruckelshaus that said: \"Congress found it necessary to explicitly state that the term 'appropriate' extended to suits that forced defendants to abandon illegal conduct\" -- illegal conduct was found here -- \"although without a formal court order\"?",
  "This is not merely a catalyst. In Buckhannon, the catalyst theory was rejected. Here the court said: If I were to decide right now -- the district court said: I am inclined to rule for Hardt, but I'm going to give Reliance an opportunity to respond. So the court had evaluated the evidence at that point as favoring Hardt. To that extent, it wasn't a purely procedural ruling. It says: As things stand now, Hardt should get fees; but I'm leaving the door open. So it wasn't just a procedural decision. It was an evaluation of the evidence up to that point, wasn't it?",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose the complaint was: I asked for a turnover of certain documents; they refused without reason. And the court says: You’re right; you’re entitled to those documents. It's interlocutory; there is no decision; but the only thing that the plaintiff asked for the plaintiff got, that is entitlement to the documents. The court said: You are entitled to the documents. And then it goes back, and the documents are turned over because the court has ordered that. Under your theory, because there was no determination of benefits, even that ruling which was a total victory for the plaintiff doesn't open the door to fees.",
  "So that would fall -- even if in the end of the -- at the end of the day no -- no award is made? No benefits are awarded?",
  "But you -- but you say -- you called it purely procedural and you said yes, but that's the only thing that she asked for. So she got it. So she qualifies for fees. Even though you just characterized it as purely procedural, it's a purely procedural ruling, but it's all she asked for --",
  "-- so she gets benefits.",
  "Well, I'm not dealing with something obscure. If the -- the plaintiff says, I have asked for certain documents, they withheld those documents with no good cause at all, and the court said: You’re right; turn over documents. It's that hypothetical. It's just -- that's the situation. There is a final order: Turn over the documents. But it's a procedural order, right?",
  "But, nonetheless, benefits would be -- nonetheless, fees would be available?",
  "You’re changing -- you’re changing the answer. The answer that you first gave me was it's a discrete issue -- final judgment, yes, qualifies for fees. Now you’re saying no, no fees?",
  "Suppose the claim were: They're just not processing my application. So, Court, order them to process my application. Right; they’re not doing anything; we order then to go process the application. End of case in the district court. Fee entitlement?",
  "But if -- if fraud in the inducement, I take it, is considered -- even if you have a very broad arbitration clause, as we do here, fraud in the inducement is considered a question for the court, not the arbitrator; is that right?",
  "So why should unconscionability be treated differently?",
  "What about the specific examples he gave, that the -- just take that the -- that the employee must bear all the costs of the arbitration, win or lose, that's the provision. Would that provision be enough to make the issue one for the court rather than the arbitrator?",
  "But is it? We don't need the \"if.\" Tell me whether you think a provision saying the employee under any and all circumstances pays all costs -- would that provision make this question of unconscionability one for the court rather than the arbitrator?",
  "But all of the arbitration agreement, not the employment contract as a whole.",
  "Mr. Friedman, this contract is -- is unusual in that, as Judge Hall said, it was more employee-friendly than most. It had a clause -- it had a provision for back-end review with the court. The review -- at the end of the line, there was to be court review, and as the parties said, it should be just like review of a district court decision, a much -- much more focused review than would be in the case of an arbitration agreement. Now, that clause comes out because of our decision in Hall. That leaves the -- the arbitration agreement in -- in an imbalance. There was court review assured at the back end. So why isn't it reasonable to say the parties contemplated vigorous court review; if it can't be had at the back end, it should be had at the front end?",
  "But it was very limited review. But the parties to this agreement put in a clause that provided for the standard review, not the very limited review that the Arbitration Act calls for.",
  "How could it be in the district court? We didn't decide Hall Street until after the district court was finished in this case.",
  "I thought you were making, in answer to Justice Scalia, the question -- he said, well, they didn't raise it. They didn't raise that with this provision out, it was an essential provision, so the contract was void. They had no reason to make that in the district court because Hall Street was not yet decided.",
  "Why is that -- why is that a big concession, because I thought, as the First Circuit said, if argument is the -- the contract is illusory, that goes to the court, but here the only claim is unconscionability. That's a question of fairness. It doesn't go to the court.",
  "But if they -- if they made that concession, so what, under the First Circuit's reading?",
  "Mr. Silverberg, the section 2 on which you place much emphasis just says that agreements are enforceable save on such grounds as exist in law or equity for revocation of a contract. But the section 2 doesn't say any -- anything about who decides that question.",
  "Mr. Silverberg --",
  "-- on that, underlying your whole case I think is the notion that this is an adhesion contract; it's a take-it-or-leave-it contract, very common in consumer, credit card agreements, in employment contracts, that one party has no say except to sign or not to sign. Are all those contracts subject to the unconscionability argument that you’re making or only some of them? And if only some, which ones?",
  "Well, this --",
  "This clause is not of that kind, and you’ve singled out three things that made it unconscionable. One, the fee provision, the splitting fees, that the court rejected. So the only two left is the one-sided aspect of it and the limited discovery. It seemed to me that the limited discovery clause, that that was quite common to say we’re not -- we don't want to get involved in the massive discovery you can get in a -- in a civil proceeding. Is there something unusual about limiting discovery to documents?",
  "But Winter didn't involve something -- as I understand, the -- the decision vacated the deregulation order. You are not challenging that. Well, it seems to me if there’s no deregulation decision in place, then we’re back to the Plant Protection Act, and there’s no authorization for the planting of these crops. So as long as you haven't challenged the vacation of the deregulation decision, I don't see how there's anything for us to deal with.",
  "I’m looking at --",
  "I'm looking at page 58a. Maybe that -- you referred to what as the district court's --",
  "Because I thought that the only purpose of this injunctive provision was to spare the people who had already purchased seeds, allowing those to be planted until March 30, 2007.",
  "Well, then --",
  "Mr. Garre, I'm looking at the injunction, and it says that the deregulation decision is vacated and Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a regulated article. We could simply say as far as it goes, that's all right; anything else is surplusage. We take it to be the judgment that Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a regulated article, period.",
  "Well, but I thought --",
  "I thought that was just a dispensation to people who had already bought the seeds. That was recognizing that they had incurred an expense, that they were all ready to plant. That -- that was the only exception. It goes back to the status of a regulated article with this one exception.",
  "Would you explain, Mr. Garre, why that's so, because I thought that the Federal law is before the agency engages in an action that requires an EIS, it has to do the EIS? So this unit of the Department of Agriculture violated Federal law by deregulating prior to the completion of an EIS.",
  "Can -- when you -- can you stop right there, because I thought the law was, government agency, before you engage on a major activity, EIS first, and then you can have a deregulation order?",
  "Yes, that's what I thought.",
  "But as far as the court is concerned, it's conceded that NEPA was violated, an EIS was required. And then the district court vacates the deregulation decision. I thought that, under the APA, at that point, the court is obliged to say, well, the agency engaged in conduct that was not in accord with law, and so we send it back.",
  "Do you agree -- would you agree that if the district court had just said the deregulating decision is vacated and Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a regulated article, period, that would be okay? And you would have no basis to prevent this from going straight back to the agency?",
  "And all, it seems to me, that the district court did do in addition to that is to say that alfalfa seeds may be planted -- alfalfa seeds that are -- that have already been purchased may be planted prior to March 30, 2007.",
  "It’s the only exception.",
  "Mr. Robbins, is it -- is it relevant to that, that in the case of other genetically engineered crops -- sugar beets, for example, soybeans -- that the plantings became overwhelmingly the genetically engineered, rather than the organic or natural?",
  "I mean, in response to Justice Scalia's point of how many now, how many at this moment? But you projected that there would be an enormous increase, and that was not just pulled out of thin air. I assume it had something to do with what happened to other crops.",
  "Mr. Robbins, but if, as is likely -- I think the government told us that the EIS is about a year away, but that the EIS is going to say deregulate --",
  "-- is going to recommend a deregulation decision. So we’re talking about the -- whatever the farmers of organic or conventional -- they’re only a year away from, so they will have to accept that there are other planters who want to do the genetically engineered crop.",
  "But I think you yourself told us how it came out with other crops, that the genetically engineered crop was very popular and took over.",
  "But wouldn't it be the same problem for the farmers if we had only the deregulation decision vacated? They can't do anything until the agency then gives them permission to do something.",
  "And that's going to take time.",
  "I mean, it's going to take time, and you have the EIS on track within a year. So are you going to do this other operation in 6 months?",
  "But -- but don't you have -- I thought we were dealing with count 1 of the complaint.",
  "Count 2 would be the counterpart to the exception that’s made from the disclosure requirement with regard to contributions with certain organizations whose members might be harassed.",
  "That's -- that's not -- that would still be open if you lose the first part of this case. So going back to the question you were asked, how does this differ -- that Justice Scalia asked -- how does this differ from the contributor who says, well, I might be harassed? The contributor would have an opportunity to show that.",
  "So, that's why I’m asking you why, on the first part, should it be any different, as long as you have the door open to show that if you were going to suffer reprisals, harassment, that an exception would have to be made?",
  "May I -- may I ask you one -- something that was not in your brief, but was in the Secretary's brief. Is this list available to Project Marriage? And specifically on page 34 of Secretary Reed's brief, the statement is made that the lists. They use them for fundraising purposes. So that would be the end of a person's privacy, at least on one side. Is that true, that the initiative sponsor uses these lists?",
  "Yes?",
  "They don't say: Now, I agree you can use my name for fundraising purposes. But that's -- it's implicit, you say, in their signing the petition that the --",
  "-- signature collector can sell the names, use them for its own fundraising purposes?",
  "I don't think that's -- that's true of Buckley II. What was -- what this Court said could not be done is that the solicitor could not be made to wear a badge that says \"I am a paid solicitor,\" but that the solicitor's name had to be identified for the State. Certainly, the solicitor -- there was an affidavit, and there was the filings with whatever was the State agency. So what was -- what this Court said could not be done was this kind of in-your-face big button that says \"I am a paid solicitor,\" but the solicitor's name and address certainly had to be disclosed.",
  "But -- just -- MR. BOPP -- subjects you to the boycott.",
  "Let me stop you there, because I think your -- your own brief, I think you said twice that you cannot tell anything about the signer's belief from the mere signature. You said it could be support for -- for the proposition or it could be just support for letting the people decide.",
  "Or it could even be, you say, that this solicitor is pesky, and in order to placate the solicitor, to get rid of the solicitor, we’ll just sign. So you -- you have said that -- that the signing itself is ambiguous. You don't know what the reason is. It doesn't necessarily mean that the person is a supporter of the proposition.",
  "May I call your attention to page 20 of your reply brief? Because I don't think that your response was correct. You say: Do petition signers support the repeal, simply indicate they would like public election to be held, or simply sign to avoid any further discussion with the petition circulator?",
  "They did that. It wasn't due to Buckley II, because as you just acknowledged, under Buckley II, the solicitor is disclosed.",
  "Mr. Bopp, this is not a peculiar thing to the State of Washington; that's correct, isn't it? Aren't there about 20-odd States that require disclosure of the names of signers to initiatives, referenda?",
  "So -- but what you’re saying with respect to Washington would go for most of those other States that have -- that have public disclosure of initiative and referendum petitions.",
  "I thought that there were instances where the State official missed something and a member of the public who had access to the list of signers said: Wait a minute; I know so-and-so was my neighbor who died 5 years ago.",
  "But you mean if -- that was over. It passed the screen of the Secretary of State. It's disclosed to the public. If someone then said you've got a lot of dead souls on these lists, the State would do nothing about it?",
  "Well, we’ll ask -- we’ll ask the --",
  "We’ll ask the Attorney General of Washington.",
  "Why would you involve the court? If the State's -- the executive representative of the State says: Oh, we missed that. Now we're going to have to deal with it. We don't need any court to order us to do it.",
  "No, this is after the observers. This is --",
  "We’re talking about a member of the public noticing that there are people on the list who shouldn't be there.",
  "Why would they ask for Attorney General and saying, look, you -- your people missed it?",
  "Why involve the court?",
  "Well, then that’s --",
  "That's what you’ve just said --",
  "-- that they're -- that they are immediately available on the disk, and so while the checking is going on by the Secretary, the public has the list. Is that what you’ve just said?",
  "And that would --",
  "Does -- is it --",
  "Is that because nobody got to count 2? And the district court -- this whole case in the lower courts was on count 1 alone; wasn't that so?",
  "And count 2 is the one that deals with the harassment.",
  "Is it -- the State has had this procedure now for some time, and there have been controversial ballot initiatives. Is there any history in the State of Washington that signers have been subject to harassment?",
  "You did say something about this category of speech. You said, well, this is in the category that -- it's like O'Brien. It has speech elements and non-speech elements. And I was trying to figure out which -- what is it in the signature that speaks and what is it in the signature that doesn't speak?",
  "But that's out of the case up till now. That's count 2. You put it in your pleading, but it wasn't reached by the court.",
  "So everybody agrees that that's still in the case.",
  "The court did not rule on whether there was a risk of harassment here.",
  "It dealt only with count 1.",
  "So that means there would be no punishment, added punishment, at all for the possession of the gun; that is, you have the -- the possession with intent to distribute, no gun involved, and you get 10 years mandatory minimum for that. That automatically would wipe out any add-on for the gun, under your reading.",
  "Yes. I think you weren't finished answering my question.",
  "But that is not mandatory?",
  "So you're saying that the gun possession can be accounted for by the judge as a matter of discretion using guidelines, but there's no mandatory at all?",
  "Don't most crimes of violence and drug trafficking carry more than a 5-year sentence?",
  "Mr. Ryan, I thought that you had three positions, and now you're talking about the second one, which is any greater minimum sentence arising from the same criminal episode. But I thought your first position was any greater minimum sentence applicable to the defendant at sentencing.",
  "But you have offered three different readings, so one can't say that this statutory text has a clear meaning, which I think is your first argument -- that it has a clear meaning. And yet, we have Mr. Gould's reading and then the two readings that you've offered us, same episode and same gun.",
  "How do you answer Mr. Ryan's argument that you can read it this way, you can read it that way; therefore, he wins under the rule of lenity?",
  "Doesn't the chart say \"ownership costs\"?",
  "And you would read that to mean non-costs as well? I mean, if the -- if the table is called ownership costs, then why not use the IRS's definition of what costs are, and that definition says, what, loan payments and lease payments?",
  "Mr. Burke, before you respond to that question, isn't it so that in the event that Justice Scalia just proposed, the trustee could propose an amendment to the plan to reflect that that cost is no longer being incurred?",
  "My question is: In the situation that Justice Scalia proposed, it's not automatic that the $471 gets deducted because there could be proposed an amendment of the plan to reflect that that -- there's no longer any expense for ownership.",
  "But it isn't -- it isn't automatic that because there's one payment, then forever, the rest of the 5 years, he gets to deduct the $471.",
  "Yes, I was.",
  "Why not just -- it says you are supposed to look at the form; it says ownership costs. So the only thing you'd look at the IRS for is -- the manual -- is to define ownership costs. And they say ownership costs means those two things.",
  "I don't follow that. If the simple thing is to just -- what does the word \"costs\" mean? And then you look to the IRS manual, and it tells you that \"costs\" means loan or lease payments.",
  "Mr. Burke, the -- it's unusual to allow a deduction for the purpose of calculating disposable income although you don't have any expense. I understand how you get to that conclusion with respect to car ownership. Is there any other provision that in -- in calculating disposable income, you are allowed a deduction for an expense that you don't incur?",
  "No. The question -- is there anything else that works like this? You don't have the expense, nonetheless you have the deduction? Any -- I mean, there are a whole list of deductions, expenses. Is there any other one that works this way? It doesn't matter whether you have the expense, in fact.",
  "You may want to save the rest of your time for rebuttal.",
  "I thought the -- the general position was you get either the actual payment or the 471, of whichever is higher.",
  "Mr. Burke, would you explain one facet of this case to me? Given the deduction, the $471 deduction, disposable -- projected disposable income comes down to $210?",
  "As opposed to -- it would be 600 some dollars if you didn't count the $471?",
  "Even though the disposable income figure was $210, the debtor was willing -- the debtor proposed paying $500. Why did the debtor come up with a $500 figure when projected disposable income without the car ownership would be -­ if he gets the car ownership, would only be $210?",
  "How do we -­",
  "How do we tell that? Because it seems to me, here, if you want to know what happened, you'd ask the very same questions. You're saying the questions are relevant also to securing the situation. But what -- what different questions would you ask if you wanted to find out what happened? What was the past -- what were the past events? I mean, I'm trying to understand how you take these questions and say we can put a label on them here that says, well, this is to control an emergency situation versus we want to know what happened historically.",
  "Suppose he had -- suppose he had survived. Suppose Covington had survived -­",
  "-- instead of died. And then the prosecutor says, I want to introduce this evidence against Bryant. Would you say that, yes, it's nontestimonial, so it comes in?",
  "But why, if it's nontestimonial?",
  "If you said -- you said it's -- you're typing it nontestimonial. It goes to emergency situations. So I'm saying: Would that carry over to the man survives and the prosecutor says, I don't need to put him on the stand so he can be cross-examined; I've got nontestimonial evidence that I can put in? Would it become testimonial, then, if he survived?",
  "But then -- then your answer is that if we typed it as nontestimonial in my trial scenario, it would be nontestimonial; it comes in.",
  "So are you saying that the rule would be that whenever the perpetrator may be in the vicinity, then the police are pursuing an urgent emergency situation, rather than trying to find out what had -- the nature of the crime?",
  "In the -- if you had the benefit of hindsight, and this trial occurred before Davis, and so the prosecutor went on excited utterance, would you have instead tried to make a case that this was a dying declaration?",
  "Well, how do you know that? Because they would ask the same very questions if what they wanted was testimonial evidence. So you can -- you can characterize that set of questions either way. What would lead us to pick one rather than the other?",
  "Do we look to the specific situation? I mean, one of the officers zeroed in on the victim. No one was looking around to see if anybody was lurking in the bushes. Then, as far as protecting the public, do we take into account that this was between 3:30 and 4:00 in the morning when there are not likely to be many members of the public around? Or do we just say you find someone who looks like he has been the victim of a violent crime, doesn't matter whether the public is around or not, we -- that's enough, the victim of a violent crime can be asked these questions?",
  "Well, why not?",
  "Let's go back to this case.",
  "Excited utterance was -­ the prosecutor thought that was his best shot, and he -­ and he prevailed, except that the -- Davis intervened. I asked Ms. Palmer, suppose we were back there at the trial and the prosecutor knew that excited utterance wouldn't work. Could he have raised dying declaration? She said absolutely yes. So my question to you is: Just assume that we should hold the Confrontation Clause is applicable. Shouldn't the prosecutor then have a chance to say, well, if I realized that, I could have made a dying declaration plea here. So it would only be fair to allow the prosecutor to try to establish that this testimony was a dying declaration?",
  "Then she did argue dying declaration.",
  "And that -- that was in the pre-Davis world. But do you think the prosecutor had abandoned that effort had he been informed about Davis?",
  "My question was based on it's an open question because we have said maybe a dying declaration.",
  "And it wasn't -- and it wasn't in Giles. It wasn't in -­",
  "Whether we -- whether you agree or not, we said it was an open question.",
  "But there was no objection on the part of the State. The State was to pay the lion's share of the fees, I think 90 percent, right?",
  "And the State is not contesting.",
  "Who is the \"they\" who would do this?",
  "This -- this is getting further removed from the situation that we're dealing with, because the State has already admitted liability and not has contested that its fees -- it owes fees. So, what is the relief that is left? If the -- if the State has admitted liability, what happens at that point? Shouldn't the record be expunged?",
  "But the State has already conceded. It's been adjudicated a constitutional violator, and the State is now saying, yes, we are not going to contest that anymore. Doesn't the State have to do something?",
  "It's true that all cases that at least have come to us under Monell have involved damages.",
  "That's not what the Ninth Circuit -- the Ninth Circuit said, we're not deciding the Monell question; we're leaving that -- we're leaving that open. But Monell -- we're not deciding because Monell doesn't apply to forward relief -- declaratory relief or injunctive relief. And so the Ninth Circuit has rejected the statement in Monell itself that it applies to all forms of relief. And so that's the question we are confronted with. Because we have had experience in Monell cases only with damage actions, was -- was the Monell decision wrong in saying that that framework applies to declaratory and injunctive relief as well?",
  "You would have liked the Ninth Circuit to have said there is a policy whatever, because the city is on notice and they've done nothing about it; therefore -­",
  "But the -- the Ninth Circuit didn't say that. It said we're not going to decide Monell liability; we are just going to say Monell doesn't apply. And if you were just thinking, well, what's at stake? You say all of our cases involve damages; that's money. What is involved here? Attorneys' fees; that's money. So where do we bracket this? Do we bracket this with the -- with damages, because that's money, and that's what's involved here, attorneys' fees? Then the only thing that's before us is the award of attorneys' fees, right?",
  "General Katyal, why are we getting into this? Because this case, it seems to me, is a challenge -- your challenge to a preliminary injunction which was quite narrow. There was only one question at issue. There is no cross-appeal, is there?",
  "So we have Form 85. The only thing that's in contention there is the question about treatment or counseling. Nothing else. So why are we talking about the universe of what questions might be asked? And on the other form, I take it, it's just the so-called open-ended questions, not everything on the form.",
  "So, what do you think has been -- there hasn't been a formal injunction entered, a preliminary -- a preliminary injunction, has there?",
  "I thought the -- the entire Form 85 was approved, and there's no question you could ask about, have you used drugs within the last year? It's only the question about treatment and counseling that's -- that is at issue, right?",
  "But the -- the circuit precedent, as far as the other questions on Form 85 - - the circuit said that's okay. It's permissible to ask those questions.",
  "The answer to that is obvious. It was raised by the other side. If it's for the good of the employee, make it voluntary.",
  "Where did it come from?",
  "Do you -- do you have a clear idea of how the Form 42 would have to be amended if the Respondents are correct? Form 85, we know, is the excised \"counseling or treatment.\" What in the Form 85 did the Ninth Circuit say -- it said \"open-ended questions,\" but I looked at the form, and it's not clear to me which ones they considered open-ended.",
  "I still don't see why that -- why the universe is before us, because the Ninth Circuit said some of this form is okay; most of Form 85 is okay, and some of Form 42 is okay. I thought it was only the questions under 7 and 8, the open-ended questions. I didn't think the Ninth Circuit had enjoined anything other than those questions.",
  "But isn't that question, that kind of open-ended question, routinely used in employment situations? That is, the employer wants to know is there any adverse information about this person? Doesn't know which question to ask, because there's a whole -- many things that could be relevant. So are you suggesting that that kind of question is off-limits to the Government, although it is routinely used in other employment sectors?",
  "Well, it has a legend on the top. Everything that we are asking you is meant to -- to determine suitability for employment. So they want to find out information relevant to suitability for employment.",
  "Are you then saying that these people have to be grandfathered or grandparented because they worked for 20 years - -",
  "-- without - -",
  "But you are making a - - you said that these people have worked there for 20 years. Are they different from the new employee? Are you suggesting it's okay for the new employee, but not okay - -",
  "-- for the person who is already in the job?",
  "Are you suggesting that this is no good for Government employment? You were dealing with a contractor here, but this form, as I understand it, has been used for -- for many years for standard Government employment. Is it -- are they okay? And for nonsensitive positions, are you -- are you arguing just Government contractor or are you saying even for the Government employee, the person who's hired to work at the snack bar in the Senate, let's say, the Government can't ask these questions?",
  "You are -- you are attacking these forms for all Government employment, not just the contractors?",
  "I'm -- I'm very surprised to hear that. I thought that -- that it -- there were in -- in the private sector similar questions.",
  "Where does it say you have to turn over your medical records?",
  "Can I ask you to clarify your understanding of what has been enjoined? We know it's easy for Form 85. For Form 42, you mentioned the releases. I thought that the Ninth Circuit's order covers parts of question 7 and perhaps question 8. I didn't see -- is there something, maybe I missed it, that says they can ask for release of the records?",
  "But they didn't say, Government, you can't ask for the release.",
  "They said you can't ask open-ended questions.",
  "If somebody is going to be enjoined, I mean, it can't be implicit in the ruling if you are enjoined. Because it has been stayed, you don't have a formal order, but you can't say, well, it's implicit in the, how many page, opinion.",
  "As I understand this process, this is not an oral interview. It's not -- you fill out a form, you meet somebody, and they ask follow-up questions. This is -- this handled on the papers, right?",
  "Yes. But is there -- is there an oral interview in this process?",
  "So then they wouldn't say -- it says here, so I'm going to ask this, that, and the other thing. There's this -- it's a written procedure.",
  "But whatever he asks, we are reviewing a judgment.",
  "And the judgment is not the universe; it's certain questions can be asked.",
  "I don't see how that's so because, at least if you're in the Ninth Circuit, you know that the Ninth Circuit has blessed all the questions on that form but one.",
  "So, I mean, you could raise the question, but you'd be out of court in a minute.",
  "I thought they did in the lower court but abandoned it here, challenge the question about the drug use.",
  "Is that also within the Government itself? I know the Privacy Act says the Government can't disclose, but how about checks -- I mean, we have a vast government -- checks about circulating the information within the Government?",
  "Isn't this something in between? Because in Canton, the hypothetical was one rookie police officer. Here, it wasn't one rogue prosecutor. There were four prosecutors who knew of this blood evidence, and there were multiple opportunities for them to disclose it, but four of them apparently thought it was okay under Brady to keep this quiet. Now, if we were just talking about -- what was his name, Deegan? -- it would be a different case. But we have the three other prosecutors. And so I think it's questionable to characterize this as a single incident.",
  "Life doesn't always come in just two categories, and my suggestion to you is this doesn't fit into a single rookie. You have -- if you have four prosecutors who are not turning over this evidence, then it seems like there's kind of a culture in the office that we don't turn over -- either we don't understand Brady, because one suggestion was -- well, having the blood sample will show you -- you'd have to have the blood sample from Thompson to have it mean anything. So there was misunderstanding about that. But what struck me was that the -- to shoehorn this into a single incident, it doesn't fit. So we have a situation maybe that hasn't -- that we haven't directly confronted before.",
  "Can you tell me -- I think I have a copy.",
  "Is that so? I mean, you are assume that everyone who goes to law school takes a course in criminal procedure, and I think there are many law schools where they don't even have such a course and others where most -- I don't know anywhere it's compulsory to take a course in criminal procedure. So you're assuming that. And, of course, the time is running. There's something I wanted to ask you about Brady, which seems to me unlike others and why you would want special vigilance. And that is, Miranda warnings, you know what was said; search and seizure, you know what the police did. But the problem with Brady -- and this case illustrates it so well -- is you don't know. If the prosecutors don't do what they're supposed to do, there's a very high risk, as there was in this case, that it will never come to light. So, recognizing the legal obligation of the prosecutor and the temptation not to come out with Brady evidence because it doesn't help the State's case, shouldn't there be extra vigilance when we're talking about a Brady claim?",
  "Did you -- did you object to it? To this charge?",
  "With the \"or\" - - difficult choice \"or\" one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling.",
  "So we have - -",
  "And it's something like I was trying to get at before when I said Miranda is out there, you know what was said, you know what was seized, talking about -- but Brady is, if the prosecutor doesn't come out with it, high risk it will never come out. So we have use of force, plus -- that can kill people if you're not properly trained. Brady, because if they don't come up with the information, it could have what almost happened in this case. Anything else on this special list?",
  "The concern was that you don't want to have to give the prosecutors a clinical law school course before you let them do their job.",
  "But what do you do with the Dubelier testimony? Didn't he testify that it was standard operating procedure to turn over all lab reports?",
  "Well, why does he have a -- a claim? As I understand it, after this case arose Maryland passed a statute putting time, place, and manner restrictions. I read that statute, and it seems to me that there was nothing unlawful, nothing out of compliance with that statute, that was done here. It was at considerable distance. There was no importuning anyone going to the funeral. It stopped before the funeral, the service, began. Am I right that, under the current statute, this conduct was not unlawful?",
  "Didn't they -- didn't they stand where the police told them to?",
  "And they were there to the knowledge of the police and with the permission of the police.",
  "But they didn't prohibit it.",
  "Which this the case, which the facts here meet.",
  "You -- you knew just what was going on. Do you suppose -- because this had been done before. In fact, wasn't this the very same day they picketed at Annapolis and at the State Capitol?",
  "So they knew what the signs were going to be. Could they have gotten an injunction, do you suppose, against this protest?",
  "So you could go into court and say the signs were this, that, or the other thing at the State Capitol, the same signs at Annapolis; they're going to use the same signs at this protest.",
  "Did they have the \"Going to Hell\" sign at the State Capitol at Annapolis?",
  "Those particular ones that you mention, did they have those at the other two?",
  "So it sounds like the \"you\" is the whole society, the whole rotten society, in their -- in their view.",
  "Where did -- you said the Fourth Circuit found that those signs targeted the family rather than the whole U.S. society?",
  "Your -- your claim is that Hustler was a -- Falwell was a public figure, and the Snyder family is not. So I think what I got from your brief is you don't fall under that case because you're not dealing with a public figure.",
  "It was or it wasn't?",
  "I thought that -- that when the service itself began, the protesters stopped.",
  "That was defamation, wasn't it?",
  "So - -",
  "We have other instances where conduct is lawful, meets all the terms of the statute that's meant to govern protests at funerals, and yet there's an award of damages permitted.",
  "Well, that was a -- I'm asking you for an example where -- a Federal case where the conduct was permitted by the statute, by the policemen there, and yet there was -- was a damage award.",
  "I'm talking about this intentional infliction of emotional distress claim that you're bringing.",
  "Well, it certainly wouldn't be because of the distance. I mean, you'd have to be a lot closer than the Maryland statute allows to spit in someone's face.",
  "Ms. Phelps, there's no question that these signs and the signs like that we saw during the Vietnam War. But you had the demonstration at the capitol, and you had the demonstration at Annapolis. This is a case about exploiting a private family's grief, and the question is: Why should the First Amendment tolerate exploiting this bereaved family when you have so many other forums for getting - - getting across your message, the very same day you did?",
  "But you gave the answer before about -- you said stalking.",
  "Isn't this comparable to stalking?",
  "The Court has made that a very narrow category, hasn't it? I mean, we have not allowed the fighting words -- you say that to me and I'm immediately going to punch you in the nose, because I have -- it's an instinctive reaction. I think the Court has rejected spreading fighting words beyond that.",
  "I take it that the government is urging that \"unavoidable\" means unavoidable in the vaccine that has gained FDA approval.",
  "And could it be used for all five -- there are five inoculations in this series.",
  "And only one of them was not approved for the first three.",
  "If there is a safer alternative, it must be pursued regardless of cost?",
  "Why was it taken off?",
  "And so didn't the special master find what -- in the compensation proceeding that causation had not been proved?",
  "Well, you -- you say that in court you could prove causation, since you had discovery, although you couldn't prove it before the special master because discovery was very limited?",
  "Anyone could go to the State -- I mean, somebody who won in the vaccine court could go to court on the argument that the amount was insufficient, the amount of compensation. There is -- there is no foreclosure of anyone to come to court; is that right?",
  "In the -- when it was -­ when Tri-Solgen was owned by Lilly and you said that it was approved and marketed, was that one available for all five inoculations?",
  "Ms. Sullivan -- Ms. Sullivan, if Congress had wanted to do that, they could have said simply that no vaccine manufacturer may be held civilly liable if the vaccine is properly prepared and accompanied by proper directions and adequate warnings. That would have been the simplest statement. Congress didn't make that statement. They were asked to amend the statute to make that statement, and they didn't. I mean, if you wanted to make it clear that there is no design defect liability, then say that: No civil liability unless inadequately -- improperly prepared, improper directions, or warnings. What they -- the language that they used is certainly, to say the least, confusing. This unavoidable -- these side effects that were unavoidable. Well, why did they need to put that in there if what they were concerned with was to cut out liability for design defects?",
  "The warning -­",
  "The warning -- the warning claims, the manufacturing claims, those are always avoidable.",
  "But -- so what can be -­ the only thing that can be unavoidable is the design defect.",
  "Well, can you -- can we be concrete and concentrate on this Tri-Solgen, which, according to Mr. Frederick -­",
  "-- Eli was producing, and it was available for all five inoculations. And then Wyeth bought it, and then -­",
  "If Congress were so clear, as you are describing it, then why didn't it adopt the provision that said failure to develop a safer vaccine would not be grounds for liability?",
  "But it also was directed to vaccines.",
  "The failure to develop a safer vaccine would not be grounds for liability, and Congress didn't enact that.",
  "They set up this whole compensation scheme where everybody agrees -- I mean, the manufacturers got this compensation scheme which took most of the cases out of State court. So to say they were left just like they were before, before they were exposed to all these claims -­ now it's only to a very small part of them.",
  "Yes, yes. I got that answer from Mr. Frederick before. But most of them don't, because it's cheaper, faster, and working well.",
  "Mr. Horwich, would you -­ would you explain one feature of this, it was the allegation that there were an unusual number of adverse reactions to the particular lot that this child's third vaccine came from, and that those adverse reactions were not disclosed to the doctors. And the doctors -- the child's doctor said if I had known about the unusual number of adverse reactions, I never would have used this vaccine. Is there any actionable claim for that, for not disclosing that there were a number of adverse -- an unusual number of adverse reactions to this particular lot.",
  "How do -- how do we know that the -- the California court even reached that question? Because there was -- wasn't there a motion to deny review as -- as -- wasn't there a time bar question raised?",
  "But did -­",
  "Well, what would the California Supreme Court do if they all agree that this application should be denied, but two of them think it's for a procedural bar -- timeliness -- and then others think it has no merit, and they say just \"denied,\" but there's no majority for either one?",
  "Even though, in fact, it wasn't?",
  "So we -- so there is that possibility -- even though there is that possibility, we should assume it was on the merits. What about -- I mean, you said this is three decades, but we are told that the California Supreme Court has this pattern of saying merits when it's on the merits; giving a citation, if it's a procedural bar to the -- a procedural fault; and when it says simply \"denied,\" that's most likely that they couldn't all agree on a reason.",
  "But that's what they would say if, in fact, they were divided, right?",
  "If, in fact, the court was divided, all agree that the petition should be denied, but there's no majority for any particular reason, merits or procedure, they -- they would say \"petition denied,\" right?",
  "Mr. Colombo -­",
  "Mr. Colombo, you -- you say in any event, leaving aside the question of whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel, even assuming there was, there would -- there would be no prejudice in this case.",
  "And could you just summarize why you say there would be no prejudice?",
  "What about the -- the pool of blood? There was one expert affidavit that said something about -- that Johnson, standing up, could not have produced that amount of blood.",
  "On the -- on the no prejudice issue, are you relying just on what happened -- what was found at the scene of the crime? I mean, you said it's implausible that Klein would have been moved with no trail of blood at all. So, you say, therefore no prejudice. Any -- anything else that goes into your no prejudice argument?",
  "I thought that the point was that there was no trail from the bed. I mean, the theory was that Klein was removed from the bed to the couch. And I thought that the point that the -­ that counsel for the State emphasized was, did the -- if someone were moved from the bed, taken to the living room couch, you would have expected to see a trail of blood from the bed. And there wasn't that.",
  "Mr. Gardner, what about the argument that all this is beside the point because the argument for prejudice is so weak, given all the other evidence that Mr. Colombo referred to?",
  "What do you do with the ammunition back at Richter's home, that the -- the gun safe is found there and the unlikely story about them going -- having the zeal to clean up their workplace and then coming back?",
  "What is your answer to the -- to -- to the representation that In re Robbins settled that when the California Supreme Court says just denied, it's on the merits?",
  "With this confusion, your version, your colleague's version, when the district court -- the district court denied relief, did you ask the district court, please certify this question of what a silent denial means, certify it to the California Supreme Court so we will have once and for all an answer of what a silent denial means?",
  "But isn't -- isn't Fulminante relevant as -- just for the proposition that a defendant's own confession carries heavy weight, leaving the rest of it -- the statement that -- in Fulminante that when a defendant confesses to the crime, that carries heavy weight?",
  "What about Judge Berzon's test, that seems to be simple and a matter of common sense, that if you get rid of the confession, then you have a better chance of getting a good deal in the plea bargain? The confession certainly -- it -- this serves the defendant to get rid of that as well as weight on the prosecution's side.",
  "Mr. Kroger, from -­ General Kroger -- from everything you said, and I take it -- from your brief, too, that you are not urging the -- that -- that counsel's assistance was adequate? You are not contesting that the confession was involuntary? You seem to be putting everything on the prejudice issue; is that right?",
  "What about his argument that his failure -- the Defendant in the case arising out of this episode, if Salyer did go to trial and he ended up getting that exact same sentence that this Defendant did?",
  "On this -­",
  "Mr. Wax, just to clear out some of the underbrush, the Ninth Circuit did say that Fulminante was really established law controlling this case. I take it that you are not defending that?",
  "Did he say that? Is there a statement in the record that Moore said he would have insisted on going to trial had he been advised that the suppression motion had merit?",
  "I think you -- I think General Kroger brought up that Moore carried the gun. It was cocked, and he shot -- who was it? Roger.",
  "And there wasn't -- he didn't invoke the grievance procedure.",
  "In this case, he didn't invoke the grievance procedure.",
  "So that would keep you out, if that were the test, that you have to formally invoke the grievance procedure. But we are told that every other time the word \"file\" is used in this Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, it refers to a writing. And so you are urging a meaning that deviates from the standard meaning of the term in the very Act at issue.",
  "Is there another provision where the word file is used to mean something other than a writing.",
  "Are you -- you -- are you urging that if you just tell a coworker, that that's enough? I thought the whole idea is to give the employer notice that something is amiss. So, how would telling a coworker serve that purpose?",
  "What did he do? What did he do specifically? I mean, you are saying that -- that the employer has to know that he is making a complaint under the Act. So what -- and you said here are the facts that was clear that he did.",
  "But there is a protection built in, Mr. Phillips, it says it's criminal liability only if it's willful. And on the civil side, the civil liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act, you certainly don't have to prove willful, you just prove a violation.",
  "The question is whether the violation is willful. The willful qualification in the criminal context is are you willfully denying your workers the wages and hours the statute requires?",
  "Nothing to do with retaliation.",
  "Do you know, how common is it to have criminal prosecutions under this section of the Fair Labor Standards Act?",
  "I thought that the whole idea of this statute is to protect the workers, and I would like you to address particularly the amici's point, that this statute in 1938 affected people -- many were illiterate, they couldn't write a complaint, many were immigrants who weren't familiar with the language, for that universe of people, wouldn't Congress have meant that all complaints are okay?",
  "How does it work with respect to the more recent statutes? Title VII, The Age Discrimination Act, Disabilities Act?",
  "Yes. If you have not filed anything with the Government, but you have to your supervisor opposed a practice.",
  "But is it -- so in those cases I think you are quite right, intracorporate complaints count as opposing any practice. Has there been any huge problems about people saying, oh, I made an oral complaint to my supervisor, and supervisor said I never heard of it?",
  "That isn't even brought up in the brief in opposition, right? It -- it's in your brief on the merits.",
  "How would it -- how would it relate to, say, an equal pay complaint? Because equal pay is formally part of the Fair -­",
  "-- Labor Standards Act. But an equal pay complaint could also be brought as a Title VII suit.",
  "So a -- a worker just complains about the denial of equal pay to the supervisor. Does that -- is that -­",
  "And there's been -- you said there was no evidence of the government for 60 years -- but there has been some 30 years or more experience under Title VII of the statutes, with oral complaints to the employer as being sufficient to ground a retaliation claim.",
  "But it really -- it starts in 1970.",
  "It starts in the 1970s.",
  "Just one more question.",
  "It seems to me you are saying the only complaint that counts is the one to the Government. Isn't -- in the work setting that's being regulated, wouldn't there be every reason to want the employee to complain first to the employer rather than making a Federal case out of it by complaining to a Government agency?",
  "May I ask you about -­ Wilkinson was a parole, parole eligibility, so it didn't touch the conviction or the sentence, where this one does. So the cases are distinguishable on that basis.",
  "I understand that argument, but there is the distinction of the type of case of where the -- the one, conviction and sentence were never going to be questioned, only parole eligibility; where here, the discovery that you seek in 1983 is not a destination. The destination is to further litigation that may or may not arise.",
  "Mr. Owen, you're fitting your case into our decisions about the line between 1983 and habeas. But if nobody -- if you didn't know anything about that and you looked at what's presented here in a civil case, it seems as though you are splitting your claim; that is, you want discovery, and if the discovery is favorable, then you ask for relief from the conviction. So it's the -- it's quite unlike I'm complaining about prison conditions. Here, the whole purpose of your seeking this discovery is so that you will be able, if it turns out to be in your favor, to apply for habeas.",
  "Could you have sought habeas? Is it 1983 is the exclusive relief, or could you have sought habeas relief?",
  "Then you are -- you are asking for a modification of the Wilkinson-Dotson formula, because the formula is, I think, quite clear. It says: \"Would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction or the sentence.\" Wouldn't necessarily demonstrate, and the Petitioner is telling us, it may not demonstrate it at all. It may demonstrate that my client was, in fact, guilty. So it wouldn't necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction. And I think to get -- to get -- to say that you should prevail, you would have to say: Court, you were wrong in using that formula, because here we have a petitioner who says, I'm not claiming that what I'm seeking would demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction.",
  "So you are asking for something in addition. You say: Court, don't just look at the words in Wilkinson v. Dotson. This is a different case, as I suggested originally. This does not involve parole. The ultimate destination in this case is the conviction and sentence.",
  "So, then, can you give us your best modified statement of Wilkinson against Dotson? I think you were telling us that that formula fit that type of case, would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction. It's given here that this evidence would not necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction; nonetheless, you say it falls on the habeas side of the line. That does require you to ask for a modification of the Wilkinson v. Dotson formula, and I ask -- if you could say what that would be, what that precise modification would be?",
  "So Mr. Mills, what then is the difference? You point out, quite rightly, summary judgment looks to what evidence there was, and the question for the court is: What could the plaintiff prove? When we get past trial, the issue becomes: What has the plaintiff proved? So, what was brought out at trial? What was the record at trial that was larger than the record at summary judgment? Because if there -- if there was no -- no new fact presentation, no more ample fact presentation, then it wouldn't matter. It would be the same body of evidence, right?",
  "Why is it -- I mean, power -- jurisdiction is power, power to proceed in a case. But we are in an area where there are many, many cases of this Court that distinguish the Rule 50(a), 50(b) from the run-of-the-mine claim processing rule because in the background is the Seventh Amendment Re-examination Clause. That's the whole reason why there is this 50(a)-50(b) litany, why the verdict loser must repeat the 50(a) motion, after -- after the verdict. So I'm surprised that you're using the word \"power.\" You're not referring to any of that history which stems from a constitutional provision, the Seventh Amendment.",
  "What -- are you saying then that if we explain to the Fifth Circuit -- to the Sixth Circuit, that the record they must look at is the trial record, so it's different from the summary judgment stage, if we told them that, then maybe they would look at the evidence differently, even though they purported to look at the trial evidence?",
  "So, if you're right, then there has to be a remand to the Sixth Circuit with instructions to send the case back to the district court to ask the district court what -- whether it thought the evidence was sufficient?",
  "But you -- you prevailed on the summary judgment motion. There was a summary judgment motion, right? And it was denied.",
  "So the -- we know that the district judge thought that, at that point, there was a case to be presented for trial based on the plaintiff's allegations.",
  "But, Mr. Mizer, then you must concede that this opening sentence that Justice Kennedy just quoted is wrong. Courts normally don't review the denial of summary judgment motion after trial on the merits, but when the summary judgment denial is based on qualified immunity, there's an exception.",
  "And, in fact, you did. You did move under 50(a). This whole case is here because apparently -- well, what reason was it that you didn't make the 50(b) motion? You told the court under 50(a), after all the evidence was in but before the case went to the jury, that the jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for Ms. Ortiz. That was -- that was your motion. You were saying: Court, there was no legally sufficient evidentiary basis. Evidentiary basis. That was the motion that you made, recognizing that the judgment -- the question is whether there is a sufficient evidentiary basis.",
  "Well, then what you're saying is you didn't even -- you didn't need to make the 50(a) motion, that that was just an unnecessary touching base with Rule 50(a)? Is that what you're saying?",
  "But didn't they -­",
  "Then explain to me what -- you made a 50(a) motion. Why did you -- was there a reason for making the 50(a) motion and not following it up with a 50(b) motion?",
  "It's -- it's very clear from Rule 50 that 50(a) and 50(b) go together, and the explanation, as I indicated when Petitioner's counsel was speaking, is the Re-examination Clause of the Seventh Amendment. So I think every first year Procedure student learns 50(a), 50(b) go together, and there's a historic reason why you must back up a 50(a) motion with a 50(b) motion. They're not -- they all -­ they all ask the same question. The Rule 56, the Rule 50, 50(b), they all ask: Is there sufficient evidence to warrant a jury finding, whatever. They all ask that, but they ask -- ask it on the basis of a different record: the summary judgment record, the trial record, and the jury verdict.",
  "Do you know of any case holding that you don't have to couple a 50(a) motion with a 50(b) motion depending upon what's in your 50(a) motion?",
  "Well, you -- you refer to Sandin. There are some extra things about the confinement here. She was shackled, she was ill, and nobody attended to her.",
  "Well, is -- on the question of whether this treatment was punitive rather than just protective custody.",
  "Well, wouldn't it be this, the segregated confinement in this case, not at large?",
  "Well, then you're -­ you're saying the category -- the mixed claim -- as Justice Breyer proposed, if it's a purely legal claim, then you're right. If it's a mixed claim, then you're wrong.",
  "The -- the purpose of 50(b) -- Justice Alito brought out that it's not simply the historical background of the Seventh Amendment, but in that same line of cases, the Court gave a practical reason. And the practical reason related to the district court, that if the motion is made after the jury comes in, the district judge would have the opportunity to exercise her discretion to grant a new trial. Let's take -- is it Ms. Bright -- where the Sixth Circuit said that, well, maybe there could have been a retaliation claim, but the plaintiff didn't make it. The district judge, given the chance, might have said: I would exercise my discretion to allow the plaintiff to have a new trial on this retaliation claim. I thought it was before -- before the court and it was a good claim. The Sixth Circuit thought it wasn't. I mean, the purpose is to get the district judge into the picture to exercise the district judge's discretion on the very question.",
  "But you recognize that sequential suits could be brought. So that if the case in the district court went to final judgment, then it would be okay to go to the Court Of Federal Claims.",
  "But you don't have control over how long the district court case is going to take, and there is no mechanism to stop the running of the statute of limitations.",
  "But you couldn't get both. I mean, that's I think Justice Sotomayor's point, about duplication. It's not -- even if you can say, yes, it's a different mode of relief, but you could -­ couldn't get -- I mean, suppose we didn't have 1500 and you prevailed in your suit on the APCA or whatever you call the statute. You could not then turn around and sue the government official, because you have the -- the single claim, you've been compensated.",
  "It's not here -- it's quite different. I mean, one suit is not precluded by the other. You -- you recognize that by saying you could bring the Claims Court suit after the district court suit. That's not so in -- in the cotton cases.",
  "I -- I'm not sure I understand your answer to my question. Assuming you had a recovery under the -- for the -- confiscated cotton, under the one route you had a recovery. You could not sue again under the other route without -- leaving aside 1500, because the claim would be precluded.",
  "But not so, not so here, because of the way Congress has set up the authority of each court. You could never -- what is it, 54(c) or -­",
  "54(c) is the relief to which you were entitled. The only relief to which you were entitled in the one court, the Court of Claims, is compensatory damages. So there isn't a question of some other form of relief. You have to go to another forum to get different relief.",
  "To test that choice -­ it's pretty stark in the Casman case, where Congress said back pay is for the Claims Court, reinstatement for the district court. But your position is that under your reading of Casman -- let's forget about Congress's amendment. Under your reading of the statute, the Casman decision was wrong and the plaintiff had to choose either back pay or reinstatement; there was no way to get both.",
  "The government says the statute is simple. It says you can't have two suits simultaneously, or you can't when the CFC suit is the -­ the second one. And Mr. Yang told me that yes, the government thinks that in the Casman case there was a choice, you can sue for reinstatement in the district court, you can sue for back pay in the claims court, but you cannot get both. And when Congress realized that that's what was happening, Congress did not adopt a two -- didn't bless the two-state -- two court solution. Congress said, there will be one lawsuit. It will all be in the claims court, and they can grant both the back pay and the reinstatement. So the two-suit approach was rejected, I guess, in -- in Congress's response to Casman.",
  "That would be inconsistent with the definition of \"claim\" in the federal rules, I think.",
  "What about the Loveladies situation?",
  "Now, what would it be, Mr. Russell, if there were a suit under RFRA because a Federal penal institution was not allowing for the religious practices that the act protects?",
  "In a suit under RFRA, could there be -- would damages be an appropriate remedy?",
  "Well, could we back up. You are saying you could get them against the Federal Government too, but the government doesn't think so?",
  "Mr. Russell, the State looks at this statute and says, oh, this statute preserves the PLRA, and under the PLRA there are no damages without having a physical injury. So putting the PLRA together with \"appropriate relief,\" PLRA is telling us it's not appropriate relief when there is no physical injury.",
  "But in the prison setting, then, isn't it an academic question, because there are not going to be damages anyway?",
  "But the answer to Justice Alito's question is that in the land use area, zoning for example, those are mostly cases against municipalities or counties?",
  "Not against the State.",
  "But those cases did not involve States, right?",
  "And I think that the -­ the core question here is the State -- and Justice Alito just posed it: the State is being treated with less dignity than the Federal Government, because your position is that the Federal Government is shielded by its sovereign immunity, and you say the State is not.",
  "But the waiver -- I mean, on the State side they can say it says \"appropriate relief.\" All right; we accept that we are going to be vulnerable to an injunction suit. But we're the State and it's our treasury, and it is not appropriate relief. We didn't waive it. It's not -- doesn't say in the Spending Clause legislation that we open up our treasury.",
  "But then you're bracketing the State with counties and municipalities. It really comes down to a question -- who decides whether the state fisc is touched. And why isn't it most appropriate for this Court to say, Congress can call it either way, but our rule is, Congress, if you want to reach the State treasury, you have to say so explicitly. And then there is no doubt when the State enters a contract that it's going to be subject to money damages as well as injunctive relief.",
  "I thought a local government would be subject to damages. We are talking about the state.",
  "What do you do with the practical problem that's been brought up that if a State is sued, it can release the prisoner, it can transfer the prisoner, and then no relief is appropriate? That the only way that the State is going to take its obligation seriously is if it's exposed to compensatory damages?",
  "What's the difference? mean, if you -- if you are supposing a category of violent materials dangerous to children, then how do you cut it off at video games? What about films? What about comic books? Grimms' fairy tales? Why are video games special? Or does your principle extend to all deviant, violent materials in whatever form?",
  "But California doesn't do that. California has in big letters \"18.\" So it's not -- is it okay for a 7-year-old? Is it okay for a 12-year-old? Part of this statute requires labeling these video games in big numbers \"18.\" So it's 18, and California doesn't make any distinctions between 17-year-olds and 4-year-olds.",
  "May I go back to -- to what Justice Breyer was asking? Because this Court, with respect to the fighting words -- Chaplinsky and \"in your face\" and provoke an immediate action -- the Court has been very careful to cordon that off so it doesn't have this spillover potential. So you -- you didn't latch on to fighting words. Your analogy is to obscenity for teenagers, as I understand it.",
  "Does California -­",
  "California has a Ginsberg-type law.",
  "Is there -- you've been asked questions about the vagueness of this and the problem for the seller to know what's good and what's bad. California -- does California have any kind of an advisory opinion, an office that will view these videos and say, yes, this belongs in this -- what did you call it -- deviant violence, and this one is just violent but not deviant? Is there -- is there any kind of opinion that the -- that the seller can get to know which games can be sold to minors and which ones can't?",
  "But the material wasn't obscene. They were girlie magazines. I imagine to today's children they would seem rather tame -­",
  "-- the magazines involved. But they were definitely not obscene with respect to adults.",
  "But on that -- on that score, Mr. Smith, there is a study by the FCC. The question is whether violence can be restricted during the hours when most children are awake, just the way pornography is. I don't remember what -- what are the hours, that -- something like from 10:00 in the evening until -­ I don't -- but -- but didn't the FCC say, yes, we could do the same thing for violence that we're doing for sex, except we don't think we ought to do it; we think Congress should do it?",

What kind of investigation? What -- she looked at his personnel file. What else was the investigation?",
  "When?",
  "This is after he got his pink slip. What -- what point -- when Korenchuk takes him into -- takes Staub into Buck's office, according to his testimony, which the jury could credit, he wasn't asked a thing. She just said: Here's your pink slip; you're fired.",
  "After he was fired.",
  "Did -- did I understand you to say that you do agree with the Seventh Circuit's \"cat's paw\" approach to this?",
  "Can we -- let's look at the statutory factors.",
  "Yes, and where -- where are you reading it from?",

  "But Mrs. Buck never would have made this decision if Korenchuk hadn't come in and said: Here's Staub, he's goofing off; he was told to tell me when he was going to be absent, and he didn't. Korenchuk, who has the animus, is a motivating factor certainly in what happened to Mr. Staub, because if you didn't have Mr. Korenchuk marching Staub into Buck's office he would have retained his job. Wasn't his last -- his most recent performance rating very good?",
  "In any case, there was no indication, apart from Korenchuk's coming in, that Buck would have taken any adverse action against Staub.",
  "Well, your position is -­ and it coincides with the Seventh Circuit, but it is in opposition to the Secretary of Labor's commentary on how this works. The Secretary of Labor's commentary is it's a motivating factor. And if Korenchuk precipitates this whole thing, that's a motivating factor. Do we -- I mean, this is -- the Secretary of Labor administers the statute. Do we give any weight to the government's official position on what a motivating factor means?",

  "Mr. Schnapper, is that your recollection of this record, too, that -- that he was -- he did state his version before he got the pink slip?",

  "That's what the statute calls for, minimum.",

And then I take it that the Court in Geier says it wasn't -- it wasn't a minimum standard, because if a State deviated from it, it would detract; it would be an obstacle to the realization of the Federal standard. But here the -- a minimum standard was adopted, minimal standard, and I think the agency is telling us just the opposite of what it said in Geier; right?",
  "I think what you are saying -- the statute says \"minimal standards\" and the agency says \"no obstacle,\" and that's it, that if there is a preemptive force to the -- to the safety standards, that it is for the government to say that.",
  "Why are we looking to Geier when you have a statute that says common law remedies are safe? I mean, as long as it says that -­ maybe it didn't make a whole lot of sense, but they did it.",
  "Mr. Garre -­",
  "Mr. Garre, in -- in Geier I think it was Justice Breyer who called attention to the agency having informed the Court that if tort suits were to go on, at -- in -- in contradiction to the government's view that there should be both of these -­ that the safety standards that were set there, it would be disturbed. It would be impeded. And the opinion said we assign weight to the Department of Transportation there, to their view that a tort suit there would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the Federal safety standards. And if the Court gives weight to what the agency says in Geier, shouldn't it equally give weight here when NHTSA is telling us there is no conflict? It says its rule sets out what the statute calls for, a minimum standard.",
  "But then the Court -­ what was the Court doing in saying that? Was it -- just wanted the agency to feel good?",
  "But there is no such statement. I mean there was a statement we don't want to impose those costs, but we have the agency in court -- we have the Solicitor General's office in court telling us, the statute says minimum, the statute says the common law isn't displaced, and we are telling the Court that we think this is a situation where it is minimum and so the common law isn't displaced. Shouldn't we assume that the standard that the agency set, that as the agency said is a minimum standard unless the agency tells us that it should be preemptive of tort suits?",

  "Mr. Panner, can you answer Mr. Englert's point what earthly sense would it make to prefer goods that are manufactured abroad over those manufactured in the United States?",
  "Mr. Olson, are -- are all institutions that employ residents schools?",
  "But it might -- it might be relevant, because it would be unseemly, perhaps, to have residents who are not working at, quote, \"schools,\" subject to the FICA tax, and other residents whose training is approximately the same escape the tax.",
  "But you can't give me the reality there. Are all resident programs conducted in schools, or are there resident programs that would not qualify because they take place in institutions that are not schools?",
  "Mr. Olson, why not read that provision -- now we are going to the statute -- if such service is performed by a student, et cetera, as saying, look, there's a student status, and the service is distinct from the student's status? Take the typical work/study program in a college. That would seem to fit this language to a tee. There's a student, and the student is working part time, but you are -- there -- there is no independent significance to the term \"student\" as you read the text; that is, the student and the services are all together. It's not, \"I am a student here and I perform services there.\" It's -- the student is -- the education is the service.",
  "But wouldn't -- wouldn't this fit the work/study student who is studying philosophy and then he's working in the, say, speech department?",
  "The -- it seems to me that -- what came into my mind when I read these words was a work/study program where the student is studying and that's the status of student. The work is separate from that. It's not necessarily to advance the person's education. It's to give the student some money. So that's what I thought -- I thought that this was -- this was describing student status, okay; and the student is also working for some money. But you seem to say that the service -­ that -- that it's -- the student status is not independent from the service.",
  "No, I have in mind the typical work/study program. The -- the student signs up for work/study and may be assigned to work in the administration, helping out with clerical things there. But the student status is one thing; the services are another. Now, that, I assume, would be covered, that the earnings of the student in the work/study program would not be subject to FICA?",
  "Mr. Olson, there has been a concern expressed that if we accept your position that residents are students, it will have ramifications for other areas of the law, notably, the National Labor Relations Act. Suppose the residents wanted to organize and collectively bargain. If they're students, they can't do that. And let's take the Title VII and the other antidiscrimination in employment statutes. If they're not employed, if they're students rather than employees, then they wouldn't be covered by that legislation.",
  "Because they don't work at schools.",
  "But it certainly can if they're a -- if they can be a student in the last year of medical school, and they -- they're doing subintern-level work. That's a clinical program where they would be categorized as students.",
  "Mr. Roberts, do you know the answer to the question I asked Mr. Olson; that is: Are all hospitals with resident programs schools?",
  "Mr. Roberts, the Petitioners' brief says twice that there's some question. Assuming that we hold that the -- the residents are subject to the FICA tax, there's some question whether, even if they had to pay the tax, whether they would be eligible to receive Social Security benefits or, I take it, credit for four quarters in full.",
  "Mr. Olson, you're not taking issue with what Mr. Roberts just said? That is, in practice the -- Social Security looks to see -- they look at the W-2, see if the FICA tax was paid, and if it was, then -- then they get credit for Social Security.",
  "What about the argument that a good deal of mitigation evidence came out during the trial on the guilt?",
  "There's nothing -­",
  "There is nothing that indicates that California's laws are applying a different concept of unconscionability. You haven't come up and said, oh, look what they did here. And in another case they said it has to shock the conscience. Maybe across the board, California is saying: We think that unconscionability should have a broader meaning. Is it unfair to the weaker party to the bargain? Is there really no genuine agreement here? And if that is so, that will fit our definition of unconscionability. You don't have anything that says -- the California court hasn't said: We are applying a special definition of unconscionability to arbitration agreements.",
  "Well, any contract that would have an arbitration clause.",
  "Can we criticize one feature of this? You are not claiming that, vis à vis litigation, arbitration is being disfavored, which was the original concern about arbitration agreements and what prompted the Federal Arbitration Act. The courts didn't like to have their business taken away, and so they were disfavoring arbitration contracts. That is no part of the picture here, as far as I can see, because the rule is the same whether it's litigation or arbitration.",
  "Mr. Pincus, are they necessarily saying that? As I read it, the plaintiff brought a case to court, not to arbitration, and then there was a motion to stay the State court litigation. Why isn't it a proper reading of this case to say: You want -- if you are in the arbitration forum, it's bilateral, but you can't dupe these plaintiffs out of a class action? So if you don't have a class action in arbitration, you can have it in court. That is, the class action is preserved, not necessarily in the arbitration forum, but in the court.",
  "So if we look at the California law and we find other instances of unconscionability that are applying a standard less stringent than \"shock the conscience,\" then we would say okay?",
  "Mr. Gupta, is -- I'd like you to focus on Stolt-Nielsen. In Stolt-Nielsen this Court said that, absent express consent, no class arbitration. If the seller or employer, whoever it is, doesn't want that class arbitration, doesn't have to have it. And here that's surely the case; the ATT has not consented to class arbitration. Then California law says: Well, that's okay; then you will be subject to a class-action suit in court. But the very purpose of the arbitration agreement was that you would be in arbitration and not in court. So why isn't Stolt-Nielsen dispositive of this case?",
  "But here you have an unwilling defendant who doesn't want class arbitration.",
  "I thought the concern was that the interstate actors should not be disadvantaged vis-à-vis the home people, the local businesses, and that was what was achieved. But you're -- you are not complaining about discrimination against a railroad in comparison to local businesses. You -- you are complaining about that you are not getting most-favored-nations treatment vis-à-vis other interstate carriers.",
  "Mr. Phillips, are you saying that the -- the railroads have to be taxed in the very same way as, say, the -- the trucks? Because one answer to your argument is: Well, they haven't created a non-tax situation for the other interstate carriers; they are just subject to a different tax. The motor carriers have to pay motor fuel tax. So are you saying to the State about that, you have to have the same sales tax, use tax, for everyone; you can't have a motor fuel tax for one and sales tax for the other?",
  "Well, why does the course for the court -- taking account of what you said, that the provision about other taxes came out very late in the day -- they had spent a lot of time talking about the property tax. And the property tax, we know, they wanted to preserve the exemptions. So why not take this latecomer of thought or discussion and say: Well, we'll assume that they want to treat that with regard to exemptions the same way that they treated property tax, which was the big-ticket item.",
  "I think Justice Kagan meant to ask, assuming that we say yes, it -- it applies; exemptions don't count -- are included in whether there is discrimination, and the Court finds discrimination between the way the railroad is taxed and the way motor carriers are taxed, what -- what then? What is the remedy?",
  "Without -- without putting on -- I mean, the motor carriers do have the tax.",
  "In all cases, it is true in general, but there are people who don't fit the mold. So a stereotype is true for maybe the majority of cases. It just means that you say: This is the way women are, this is the way men are.",
  "Mr. Hubachek, how do you deal with the argument that, really, this is a classification where the unmarried woman is being favored, because the unmarried father is being bracketed with the married couple? So it's kind of like Matthews v. Heckler: The woman is getting a special favor and the unwed father is treated like most people who married -- couples who have children.",
  "First, can we be clear about what you're saying? I thought your argument was, you are not touching married couples.",
  "So that you are talking about equating the unmarried father to the unmarried mother. Do you have -- is there any notion of how many people we're talking about? I mean, in these extensions versus the normalization, where the Court generally extends when there is a small class to be covered, a small class was left out, and in a large class is already covered. And the reasoning has been: Well, my goodness, Congress wanted to take care of that larger class; it would be most destructive of the legislative will if we said you can't cover that larger class. So as a group of unmarried mothers as against unmarried fathers, do -- do you have any notion of what the numbers would be?",
  "Mr. Hubachek, I think the Chief asked you: If it's an equal protection violation, then the Court just says it violates equal protection, but whether it goes up or down, the Court has to give a temporary solution, because the legislature can't be convened on the spot. And the Court actually did go through that exercise, extension versus invalidation, most conspicuously in Califano -- Westcott, in the Westcott case. It says, yes, that's what we have been doing in all these cases. In Sarah Frontiero's case, we didn't say: You've been discriminated against; Congress, you fix it. We said: You get the quarters' allowance that up until now has been available only in male officers. And in Wiesenthal, the father got the same child and care benefits as the mother. So the Court was making a decision for extension; it recognized it had to do that.",
  "That he is a United States citizen.",
  "And it also said that the remedy can't be complicated, because courts are not set up to do that. I mean, that's what Westcott said. The court can go one way or another way; it can't do any fine-tuning, because it's there as a temporary legislature. The ball goes back to Congress to do what it will, but it's just, in the interim, we need a solution.",
  "But Congress did make at least some change, right? It -- this is -- it's no longer five years; it's only two years, right?",
  "What well established test?",
  "First, in Fiallo we were dealing not with citizens, this is someone, a resident -- could be a resident alien wanting to bring in a parent or a child. So it wasn't -- that case wasn't about who was the citizen at birth.",
  "Congress has passed -­ has passed a statute making certain people citizens and the question is, has it done so in a way that is compatible with equal protection. But remind me too, because it's not in the front of my head, I thought that classification that was dealt with in Fiallo, wasn't it unwed parentage rather than gender?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, if -- if the classification then were that we want to encourage, because it's good for society, father/child relationships, so we are going to give that advantage, that is 1 year for fathers, and we're going to put the mothers together with the married couples, would that be compatible with equal protection?",
  "I told you what the rationale was. The rationale was that we have lots of statutes like the Family Medical and Leave Act that attempt to encourage fathers to have a relationship with their children, to be a legal parent, so that's the rationale of this classification. They want to encourage the father/child relationship, therefore, they gave this 1 year is enough for the -- for the father. And everything else is the same, except it's the father who gets the 1 year, and the mother who gets the -- what is it, 10 years -­",
  "Well, it would you, in fact, acting on the basis of what hasn't been the general pattern but what is becoming the new pattern.",
  "So there is, even though we are still dealing with citizenship, you recognize that there are categorizations that would run afoul of equal protection?",
  "The same as in the Family Medical Leave Act, we are making it a parental leave instead as if it had been historically a maternity.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, in answering the question that way, I know you are familiar with the Wiesenfeld, case, and the question was, this was a father who was denied benefits to take care of a -- a child whose mother died at childbirth. And the Court came out a unanimous judgment but split three ways on why. And one of the members of the Court said, this is discrimination against the child, even though the classification was -- it's called a mother's benefit -­ it's discrimination against the child because it should make no difference at all whether the missing parent is female or male, that that was utterly irrational. That was the Chief -- that was then Justice Rehnquist's concurring opinion in Wiesenfeld. So he seemed to think that the discrimination was against the child and that that counted for equal protection purposes.",
  "Well, that's what -- Steven Wiesenfeld, the father was the plaintiff, but the Court -- at least one justice's rationale was that the discrimination is really against the child, but the father can raise him -­",
  "That's a case where mother versus father. But here it's a single parent. This is not a case where the father is doing something that the mother regards as disadvantageous. That was in the Lehr case.",
  "And you said something about -- this has nothing to do with stereotypes, this is the way the law was? But wasn't the law shaped because of the vision of the world of being divided into married couples, where the father is what counted, and unwed mothers, where she was -- they say both father and mother, because the law didn't regard him as having any kind of obligation?",
  "In Nguyen, I thought that this Court relied on the biological factor, which is not so here. I mean, here there is no question that this is the -- the natural parent of the child.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, in answer to the Chief's question, you know -- I mean, there have been a number of cases raising this extension versus nullification, and in every one of them the Court did make a choice. It didn't say well, we can't make any choice. Even in the one, which is Matthews v. Heckler -­",
  "-- the Court did make a choice then. It was the rare case where the Court equalized down. But I don't know any one of them -­",
  "What were the criminal cases where there was -- where the defendant was permitted to raise -­",
  "But, Mr. Weisman, the phrase is \"post-conviction or other\" -- \"or other collateral review.\" And certainly the Rule 25 -- 35 motion is postconviction. So it's postconviction. It's not direct review. Why isn't that responsive?",
  "\"Or\" usually means it's something in addition.",
  "Can you go back to the -­ you said -- you said \"prior to.\" I thought the Rule 35 motion is made after the conviction.",
  "And the current Federal rule -­",
  "-- provides for -- it's Rule 35 also, but it doesn't have the pure leniency? That's Rhode Island's?",
  "Can you read the -- the relevant provision of the Rule 35? I mean, there are two categories, the ones about legal challenges, at least as I read the rule, and -­",
  "Read the relevant part of Rule 35.",
  "So you're talking about reducing -­",
  "Justice Scalia's suggestion -­",
  "-- that perhaps the -­ the leniency review is -- is not review of the conviction or sentence. But you didn't -- you didn't do anything with that. You didn't argue that the kind of review that's involved with leniency is really not review of the sentence for legal error.",
  "So what -- is it something in between? It's not direct and it's not collateral?",
  "You can challenge only the conviction, not the sentence, on direct review?",
  "Do -­",
  "Do you agree that Rule 35 is not something that the prisoner must exhaust before seeking Federal habeas?",
  "But this is the whole purpose of allowing tolling of the 1-year Federal statute, the purpose to give the petitioner an opportunity to exhaust what he must exhaust?",
  "If you look at 2255 -­ that's the Federal postconviction review, and it also has a 1-year statute of limitations. That limitation would not be tolled for a Federal Rule 35 motion. So why should it be tolled for State?",
  "You think it doesn't matter that -- I mean, a Rule 35 motion is a motion made in the original criminal proceeding, not to the side of it. So isn't a collateral attack a sort of -- another proceeding to the side of the main proceeding, but the Rule 35 motion is filed in the criminal proceeding itself?",
  "Well, what about the charge that, yes, we can agree with you that in general 5 years seems like a long time, but we have a brief from the Habeas Corpus Resource Center that says that in the 5- to 6-year delay category, 62 percent are dismissed on the merits, and that you can't tell; sometimes they do it on the merits, sometimes they do it as time-barred, and there's no rationale to when they do one or the other.",
  "Would they have to -­ would they have to justify the delay first? I thought there was something about, well, if the time question is more difficult and the merits are easy, there's no merit, so we just decide this.",
  "And in California, if it just says \"denied,\" then the presumption is it's denied on the merits; is that it?",
  "And -- and if -- so if it's going to be denied on time bar grounds, there has to be something to indicate that it's for that reason? Otherwise we assume it's on the merits?",
  "There -- this was taken over by California from capital cases, but in the capital case context, there -- they have a 90-day presumption of timeliness. And when they extended the capital framework to non-capital cases, they left out the presumption that within 90 days is timely. Was there reason for that?",
  "Was there reason for and then saying, well, in the capital context, we're going to make it clear that 90 days -- 90 days is timely. Why didn't they add that to the original rule?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, why would it be different in the capital context? What was the reason for adding the 90 days there?",
  "Well, your -­",
  "And suppose -- suppose California had a rule that said that you have to file within 1 year of the finality of the conviction, absent good cause for the delay. If that were the rule that California had, your client certainly would be untimely and you wouldn't have a leg to stand on, right?",
  "Would -­",
  "But if there is a requirement of prompt -- as promptly as circumstances permit, wouldn't a person know that 5 years is not as prompt as circumstances permitted?",
  "But didn't this come about because it was returned? This was not -- I'm thinking about -- he didn't -- he didn't make any claim that he was -- he was diligent.",
  "He didn't make any claim that he was diligent in filing it 5 years late.",
  "Well, why can't you take the brackets of -- what was it, 5 months is reasonable time; 18 months is not a reasonable time? Mr. Martin falls outside of the 18 months.",
  "I thought there was a decision that said 18 months is too long.",
  "There was a decision that said 18 months is too long.",
  "One case, Mr. Phillips, is pending for 20 years; is that not so?",
  "So it seems to me -- and there were something like 70 orders from the district court, the single-judge district court in that case.",
  "And no -- no change. So how much longer do we have to wait? Another 20 years? Longer than that?",
  "Is there in fact less overcrowding? Because I thought that the -- what this case was all about was the receiver has said, the special master has said, we can't make any progress at all until there are fewer people; we have no place to put clinics. The first step, not the last step, but given the -- given what we're dealing with here, the essential first step is that we have fewer people so there is more room for these health facilities, more room for staff to operate.",
  "Yes, but you can't -- you can't provide construction when the State doesn't supply the money for it.",
  "Then if you -- then if there -- if there are these great changes in circumstances so that now they -- medical care can be administered in something approaching a decent way, you could go back to the single-judge district court and say: I'm moving under 60(b). Circumstances have changed; it's no longer the case that it's impossible to render decent health care.",
  "What -- do we have information about that substantial reduction? I mean, in this record, it just seems to be that it's -- no matter how many efforts have been made, the population goes up. And now you say that the population has gone down. From what point in time and how much has it gone down?",
  "But I thought that officer himself said: I can't do this without as a first step reducing the population; nothing else is going to work until we reduce the population to the point where there is room for clinics, room for medical personnel to operate. I mean, that was the view of the district judge, the special master in one case, the receiver in the other case. Everybody -- they all agreed reducing the population is not going to cure it, not going to make everything perfect, but without doing that as a first step, nothing -- there will be no cure.",
  "I don't get the class thing, because what -- you can't have a remedy just limited to the class. The class wants to have clinics. They want to have personnel who function someplace outside of a broom closet. So you can't deal with this problem by just dealing with the mentally ill and the people with medical problems. You have to provide space for facilities.",
  "I thought the -- the -­ that brief was filed because the -- there were -- in your presentations, there were representations about the special master, and he filed that brief to say: You must understand this in context; I was making a speech at the club. So he wanted to put in context what you had used. You had quoted his statements.",
  "That's one piece of it. You said something about the 2.35 million. They didn't come up with the 8 million, but they did come up with 2.35 billion. And then I'm just looking at this brief for the receiver, and there's a footnote, page 11, footnote 3, that says: No, that money isn't there; it's dependent upon several approvals that have not yet been secured, and such approvals ultimately may not be forthcoming.",
  "But not the -­",
  "Not the 2.35 -­",
  "I mean, I think you did say earlier that this was a done deal, 2.35 billion. But this is a note telling us it's not so.",
  "On one project, the joint legislative budget committee said, no, we're not going to give you money for that.",
  "Can you explain me something about that? It was confusing in the briefs, Mr. Phillips. I thought that the State had said: We don't want the plaintiffs to tour these facilities anymore. We don't want to have discovery go beyond -­ what was it -- some date in 2008. I thought that it was the State that was urging: We don't need any more discovery, we don't want any more inspection tours. So how could -- how could the plaintiffs submit more than they did when the State said it's enough, 2008 should be the cutoff?",
  "But then don't you have the burden? If -- if you have -- you concede that you have been in constitutional violation, then it seems to me you have the burden of showing that's no longer the case. That's generally so in -- in -­",
  "Well, maybe -- you're talking about one of the cases, but the other one -- and it's the newer one, instituted in 2001. But what about the one that started out in 1990?",
  "Mr. Specter, there -­ there has been at least two significant changes. One is the good time credit. The California legislature did pass the law that upped the good time credits and also addressing the probationers and the parolees -­",
  "-- and the technical violators to divert them from the system. Do you have any information about what effect that legislation that was passed January?",
  "So, do we -- do we know at all what effect it has had?",
  "Is -- is there any other case where the prison reduction has been done under the PLRA, or is this the first -- the first one?",
  "Mr. Olson, when you say the employees had no choice, but the district court found, didn't it, that the reason for this plan summary being misleading was that the employer, Cigna, feared that there might be a backlash on the part of the employees if they found out, if they were told the truth about this plan; that is, that it was less favorable, that they would not have the same benefits that they had under the prior plan?",
  "I thought that what the district court said was that they would treat the plan as containing what the summary said, not that -- that it was part of the plan itself, not an amendment, amendment. I thought that was what the district court said.",
  "But they can't do that because the statute requires the summary to be understandable and not prolix.",
  "But wasn't the -- wasn't the meaning of \"likely harm\" simply that they were promised one thing in the plan document, and so what likely harm is, is we have to do away with what they call, what is it, \"the wear-away effect\"? So that's the harm, the wear-away effect, and we have to remedy that. And the way to remedy it is to treat this as, what is it, instead of (a) or (b), (a) plus (b)?",
  "Yes.",
  "But it couldn't be --",
  "But it couldn't be brought as a class action, and isn't that a large piece of this picture, that proceeding as they did they can proceed as a class? Proceeding under detrimental reliance, it would be hard to get a class because it would be an individual case of detrimental reliance.",
  "Then the question is, under the -- under the section that the district court proceeded under, not the one that you say is proper, a class action would be appropriate.",
  "But there's -- I think the brief -- the Petitioners' brief pointed out, it governs the plan only when it's more favorable to the participants, because you wouldn't say, if the plan were more favorable and the summary would show fewer benefits, that the summary would then govern.",
  "So where does the rule come from, then?",
  "Mr. Kneedler -­",

And I was a little puzzled why you were so intent on rejecting so-called High 2, because after all, in this very case, Judge Fletcher, dissenting -- it's true -- but he said he accepts Crooker, he accepts High 2, and he still thinks you win. So you don't need to reject Crooker to prevail.",
  "Are you interpreting -­",
  "As I -- as I read the D.C. Circuit decision, you -- you are assuming or you're suggesting that the D.C. Circuit saw a gap that Congress hadn't provided for, and it filled that gap. And now the add-on that the D.C. Circuit made is no longer necessary, so we lop it off. But the judges on that en banc court thought that they were interpreting the statute going through all of the steps that you outlined. Language is rarely so plain that there's no room for a different interpretation. And then Judge Edwards looked to the legislative history to see how that might inform the decision, but -- but really, to suggest that Crooker was just sort of a stopgap until Congress amended the statute I think is not fair to that decision.",

And if you can give me an example, this is what the APA shielded that would not be shielded under section 2, maybe I would -­",
  "Mr. Galanter, if we can go back to get what this -- this entity was. The Federal legislation gives the States a choice. They can do it either in a State agency or a private entity. The specification that the State agency has to be independent is in the Federal statute, isn't it?",
  "It's not -- it's not up to the State to want to put it into an independent regulatory agency. And is it -- and this VOPA -- is that an entity that was created just to carry out this Federal program or was it a pre-existing agency?",
  "And does it do anything else other than administer the Federal program?",
  "Ms. Anders, I understand that most States that -- that are taking advantage of this program do it through a private entity, not a State; is that -- is that right?",
  "Doesn't -- doesn't the Federal statute say, Virginia, if you want to do this through a State agency, that State agency has to be an independent agency and have the authority to sue?",
  "It's not a waiver; it's -- the Federal statute is clear. It says: State, you can do this in one of two ways. If you go with a government agency, then that agency has to have independence and it has to be able to sue. So if the State is given a choice, it has -­ it can do it through private entity; it can do it through, as in this case, an agency that was set up for this very purpose and no other, right?",
  "So the choice is, if it's not in -- you certainly agree that this State agency has taken on the obligations of the Federal program, and if it doesn't turn over records as the Federal statute requires it to do, it has to be amenable to suit somewhere. We know if it were a private entity administering this program, it would be suable in -- in Federal court. So this State agency is doing the exact same thing, because Virginia chose to do it that way. Where is it -- where -- a very simple thing, the Federal statute says turn over records to the agency, and the State hospital says no, we're not going to turn over the records. Where does the agency, whether private or public, that's administering the Federal program go to enforce the Federal right?",
  "If you -- is that -- I mean, I want to make sure I understood what your position is on that. It's not that you go into the court that you ordinarily go to when you want to get documentary discovery; you go to the State's supreme court, and you -- you apply for the extraordinary writ of mandamus? That's it?",
  "I'm asking you what is the forum? We have a simple problem. An agency, whether private or public, wants records. A Federal statute says you're entitled to the records. And I would like to know now, Virginia having chosen to give this newly created independent State agency the authority, rather than picking a 501(c)(3) organization to do it -- simple, we want records of these three people, the hospital has them, the hospital doesn't give them to us. The only way under Virginia law is to petition the highest court of the State for a writ of mandamus?",
  "But which office has said it has to go to -- to the State supreme court on mandamus? You said that the office has taken that position previously.",
  "Do you know -- do you know of any other statute in which there is an independent State agency that exists for the sole purpose of administering a Federal program?",
  "You couldn't give any example of a Federal program that says: State, you can do it through a private agency; you can do it through a public agency -- public agency created to implement this Federal program, that is its sole business. I don't really know of any such.",
  "The bottom line, then, is to -- to restrict Congress's choice. Congress wants to have an entity superintend this program for disabled people. So the instruction we would like to give Congress is: Congress, if you want Federal courts to be able to enforce the Federal right, then you have to set it up as an agency, as a private agency. You can't give -- Congress, you can't give the States a choice whether they'd rather do it through private or public organizations.",
  "Ms. Blatt, you do have a substantial hurdle to contend with in this Court's decision in Bowles v. Russell, which seemed to say if you have a time limit and it's statutory, it is mandatory and jurisdictional. So here, we have a time limit set by statute, not by rule, and why doesn't -- why isn't that dispositive?",
  "And that is jurisdictional, 7292?",
  "How much time does 7292 give to go from the Veterans Court to the Federal Circuit?",
  "Ms. Blatt, you are making -- you said that the closest comparison is in the Social Security, because there's disability benefits in both cases. Apart from that we -- one is commenced by a complaint filed in the district court, the other, a notice of appeal, is there any difference in the brand of review? That is -- as I understand it, Social Security review, although it's by the district court, is also on the administrative record.",
  "Earlier, Ms. Blatt, you said that they wouldn't even know.",
  "Because they don't get notice; only the veterans -­",
  "Ms. Blatt, are you -- are you -- we have in Bowles itself -- it was from the district court to the court of appeals, and then we have from the court of appeals to this Court. Those two provisions were cited in Bowles, the 2107. And what is the provision for -- for cert?",
  "2101. Those -- those, as far as I remember, were the only provisions that were cited.",
  "And that was -­",
  "That was the Federal Circuit's position until Bowles, right? But this was an en banc decision, and it overruled two prior cases -­",
  "It didn't mention -- Bowles didn't mention anything like an appeal from an agency where the district court is -- is sitting, essentially, as an appellate court. But Bowles really was dealing with court-to-court, because it mentioned 2107 and 2101, and I don't recall that it mentioned any -- anything other than court-to-court situations.",
  "Except that -- that one is an adversarial proceeding, the immigration proceeding, and the veterans' is supposed to be claimant-friendly. But I think that the -- the -- just as Bowles is -- is a challenge for Ms. Blatt, so for you is the Social Security context, because it seems to me the quality of review is the same; that is, what the district court does in a Social Security disability case is the same thing that the Veterans Court does in a veteran's disability case.",
  "But it is -- it is an appellate review, isn't it? I mean, the district court goes on the record before the agency.",
  "What is -­",
  "But what happened in this case? Was there -- was there a registered representative?",
  "You made a point earlier that, well, this is -- the Social Security, there are many resemblances, but one is started by complaint and the other by notice of appeal. It could be that Congress, having been so kind to veterans, thought: Why should we burden this pro se, or at least lawyer-less, veteran with writing out a complaint? The notice of appeal is just a simple one-line document. So could that explain why Congress said you begin with a notice of appeal instead of a formal complaint?",
  "But there's no -- been no determination on the merits whether this claimant should prevail.",
  "That hasn't been aired because the Veterans Court said it had no jurisdiction, and the Federal Circuit said that's right. So we don't know if this is a good or bad claim.",
  "So Congress couldn't just award money because there has to be an adjudication.",
  "Justice Scalia just asked you: Could this be -- if Congress decided that this was a harsh result, could it be made retroactive? But for Congress to say, well, just -- what is it going to rely on to say whether it gives compensation or not? I mean, the Government's position was he wasn't entitled to compensation for home care, which is what he was seeking.",
  "On the length of time, which is, you said, 120 days -- yes, that's a long time, but isn't it on cert? It's 90 days plus 60, right? So it's even more.",
  "But the total number of days would exceed 120, assuming that the application is made -­",
  "Application to extend is timely.",
  "That's really the only thing that counsels your result, because in Reed you took -- the Government took the position that a statutory provision is non-jurisdictional if it does not speak in jurisdictional terms and doesn't address the power of the court. I understand that was the Government's position in Reed. Today you're saying that the only thing that counsels your result is the fact that Congress used the words \"notice of appeal.\" Is that correct?",
  "Is there any -- any statute on the time to appeal? Has any statute been held, quote, \"jurisdictional\" when there is no safety valve of any kind written into it; that is, that -- on 2107, that extensions are possible? Is -- is there a, quote, \"jurisdictional\" statute that says 121 days or whatever, and that's it; no extension, no matter what the circumstances are?",
  "Why wouldn't it be a bright, clear line if we said, court to court, Bowles controls; agency to court, Bowles does not control? That would be a clear line.",
  "If the law of the case -­",
  "If the law in the case is left to the district court, then the district court can say, well, the law of the case -- that's what that other judge said, but it was a question of what's a reasonable time, and I'm -- I appraise it differently. The -- the judgment has been vacated, the sentence has been vacated, so how does the law of the case survive? I mean, is -- the judgment is no longer -­",
  "Can a district judge say later on in the process: I made a ruling earlier in the case; I've since done a lot of research, and I now think that that ruling was wrong?",
  "Well, what do you do with 3742(g)(2)?",
  "Has the Sentencing -­",
  "Is the Sentencing Commission -- it still has that guideline that you can -- you can depart -- you can lower within the guideline, but not beyond it?",
  "Yes. Is it -­",
  "But as far as the Sentencing Commission itself is concerned, its position is still that postconviction behavior does not warrant a below-the-guideline sentence?",
  "That -­",
  "It's true that -- that in all of the briefing in Booker, 3742(g) was not mentioned by any party.",
  "So it wasn't a question of the Court overlooking it. The Court didn't say anything one way or the other about it because it wasn't presented as one of the statutes that would have to be overruled.",
  "But doesn't it conflict with 3553(a)(2), that is, the overriding provision that a sentence should be sufficient but not greater than necessary to deter criminal conduct? And the judge is looking at this defendant and says -- a criminal -- to deter criminal conduct and protect public against future crimes: Well, this person has turned out to be a model citizen, and we don't have to keep him in for a longer time to protect the public against future crimes. So if I were to apply 3742(g)(2), I would give him a sentence that is unnecessary to protect the public against future crimes.",
  "She's married to him.",
  "Because you start with somebody who is -- who is unlike the shareholders. There's no Title VII violation as to them. Regalado is complaining of sex discrimination, and then she said, because I made a complaint, they retaliated against me. Shareholders are not in that position, because there was no initial charge there.",
  "What -- what do you do with the argument that says there's a middle step? You can -- you have the sex discrimination complaint, and then you have Thompson, who is aggrieved in the sense that he was hurt, he was injured. But they say there's no cause of action, there's no statutory cause of action, for Thompson.",
  "You're not taking the position that she could not have sued for retaliation? It would be awkward because he is -- it's his injury that requires compensation. But are you saying that she could not have brought a retaliation suit?",
  "Let me -- because your time is running -- the Americans with Disabilities Act has an explicit provision that allows suits by adversely affected close relatives. You are essentially asking us to read that provision, which is stated expressly in the",
  "But that's different from the -- the point that you were first making, I thought, was these are lay people; they don't have a lawyer; they would naturally think that the person who was hurt would be the one to sue.",
  "But EEOC thinks he's the right person.",
  "Can we go back to basics? First, you agree that it is unlawful to retaliate -- to retaliate against a person who filed a complaint, under Title VII, by dismissing a close relative? It is an unlawful employment practice; is it not?",
  "This is not -- this is not an altogether novel question, because it has come up under some other statutes. You are suggesting that this is carrying \"a person aggrieved\" to new heights, but we have both the NLRB and we have OSHA, and both of those agencies have said that to take adverse action against a close relative is an unfair employment practice, and they've done that for some time; have they not?",
  "But it's not -- it's not 100 percent clear he does. He thought there might be an Article III impediment. But in -- in your brief, I think you suggested that the EEOC doesn't get a whole lot of deference, and you -- but the other agencies that I mentioned, where there is this claim that can be brought by a close relative, the NLRB gets a lot of deference; the Department of Labor, when we're dealing with Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the mine safety -- those agencies get a fair degree of deference, and they've come to the same conclusion.",
  "But this is a -- an interpretation of the substantive meaning of the statute.",
  "It doesn't have to do with the evidence in a particular hearing. Can a person who is a close relative sue on the grounds that he was injured, deliberately so, in order to retaliate against his spouse or his fiancée?",
  "Mr. Schnapper, in the points that you're making, would you have an answer to this point that was made about the burden of proof? The argument was that you wouldn't have McDonnell Douglas anymore, and you wouldn't know how to proceed on this third-party claim.",
  "Well, somebody deviated from what was the announced policy, that there was to be no market timers investing in this -- in these Janus funds. Somebody made the decision that certain hedge funds would be allowed to engage in that activity. Who was that somebody?",
  "Well, the statement that's alleged to have been -- the conduct that is alleged to have been in opposition to the announced policy, that is attributable squarely to -- what you -­ this is the entity you called JCM?",
  "So it made the decision that violated the policy?",
  "Nonetheless, it's not a primary actor?",
  "Mr. Perry, you -- you said that it was the fund's lawyers who drafted the prospectus, but, in fact, it was JCM's lawyers, the lawyers -- they were in-house lawyers for JCM. And they served -- and they served the funds in doing this prospectus, but they were on the payroll of JCM, and they were JCM's legal department.",
  "I thought they were in-house lawyers?",
  "But the law firm that -­ the lawyers who drafted the prospectus were in-house counsel for JCM on JCM's payroll.",
  "But they weren't the independent outside lawyers who were representing the board or the funds; they were the in-house counsel?",
  "I guess my question was simply: The drafters of the prospectus were the in-house counsel for JCM?",
  "Well, this case -- this case went off on -- in the district court, it was -- was it 12(b)(6)?",
  "Okay. And all that the Fourth Circuit said is it goes beyond; it has to go further. And the -- the impression that I got from the Fourth Circuit's opinion is -- and it could be reduced to a very simple statement. They say: JCM was in the driver's seat. It was running the show. And if that can be proved, they thought that they would have a good case under -­",
  "But that was -- I mean, before you started out with a statement that sounded like the sky is falling because lawyers would no longer be safe, banks would no longer be safe, but the Fourth Circuit was -- was a much narrower view. Its view was this -- JCM was the manager. It was controlling everything.",
  "What did -- how did it reserve that? You said twice in your brief that Janus is a name to which JCM reserves the right. How did it reserve the right?",
  "In that connection, Mr. Gannon, would you answer the -- the statement that Mr. Perry made that the Government had, in fact, conceded that this theory would spread not only to the -- to the investment adviser so closely linked to funds but to every lawyer, every accountant, every bank.",
  "He said that you said that on page something here.",
  "But the -- the whole arrangement was made possible by JCM. JCM wants long-term investors, so it puts this provision in the prospectus. The board of directors have no reason to believe that JCM is dissembling and it's going to go out and seek hedge funds.",
  "What was the theory of -­ of the fund shareholders? You said the fund shareholders recovered -- there was a settlement.",
  "What -- what was that action?",
  "Well, they say that these -­",
  "But then, what -­",
  "How do you answer the -­ the anomaly that Arizona cannot impose a fine even in a modest amount, but it can revoke someone's license to do business?",
  "Can you explain that, E-Verify, because this is a Federal resource, and the Federal Government has said we want this to be voluntary. How can Arizona take a Federal resource, which the Federal Government says is voluntary except in certain circumstances, and turn it into something that's mandatory?",
  "I don't -- I don't get into any pre-emption or not, but it's -- Arizona wants to use a Federal resource. And the Fed makes it available if the employer can use it voluntarily, but not mandatorily. How can -- how can Arizona set the rules on the use of a Federal resource?",
  "Can you also explain the I-9? You said it's the same as in the Fed. Home free if you have documents, Social Security, driver's license. But you also require the E-Verify. So how -­ does the E-Verify information modify the I-9? How -­ how do those two -­",
  "What can -- Mr. Phillips, what can the State do that would be complementary rather than conflicting?",
  "Mr. Waxman, I take it from this whole discussion that you are recognizing that this is not a crystal-clear regulation; there is some ambiguity, and that's why we are talking about how much deference we owe to the agency.",
  "Mr. Waxman, why are we getting into all of this, because there's no question in this case that the Federal Reserve Board had authority to issue Regulation Z? There's no question about what authority Congress gave to -- to the Board.",
  "So -- and the only question is: So -- so the Board adopts Regulation Z, and then a question comes up, what does it mean? Well, surely the Board that wrote the rule is first and foremost the proper interpreter.",
  "Mr. Palmore, suppose there was no triggering event, but in the initial statement the company said: We reserve the right to raise the interest to X amount. No triggering event, just a reservation of the right to raise the interest. Would that have to be -- and then it implements that later on. Would the cardholder have to have notice of that under the old reg?",
  "Changes the rate in the cardholder's favor?",
  "Yes, but would you -­ would it be in the greater interest of your client if the initial notice said we're going to raise it to the top, no discretion?",
  "But if it says: We prefer one notice to two. So, sorry, we can't give our cardholders that benefit. We'll say this is the rate, this is going to be it. Then we will spare ourselves a second notice.",
  "Well, you know the highest rate, because that's stated in the original notice, and you could shop on the basis of that.",
  "And it's fine to say then, Federal Reserve Board, this regulation that you had and that you explained a number of times was a bad one; you should change it, which they did. But you are up against a regulation that both sides say has some ambiguity, but that the Board has said what it meant a number of times. So is -- is the Court free to say the new rule is much better so we're going to say that that's what the old rule was as well, in the face of what the Board has said?",
  "But the problem with that is in the Ninth Circuit split about the official statements, and Judge Cudahy gave a very cogent explanation of why the majority just is dead wrong in how it read those official comments. So you're relying on what two judges have said the official interpretation was, against the dissenting opinion and the Board itself saying that's what we meant in our official comments, in our official comments.",
  "And what about the invited brief in the First Circuit?",
  "So we're getting back to what was my initial question. So you say you can't have flexibility that would favor the cardholder. If the initial notice is to count, then it has to be a fixed rate and the company can't exercise discretion to reduce the rate. That's what you're saying: A fixed rate would be okay. The problem with this is the company provided flexibility to reduce the rate in the interest of the cardholder.",
  "I'm not following that argument. I thought that the new regulation says now any time there is a change in the rate, whether it was announced originally or comes up later, just keeping it nice and simple, a rate change, you send notice. And you've got -- and you have to do it -- give 45 days' notice. I thought that that's what the new regulation was.",
  "Mr. Hacker, do we know that from this record? I mean, we know that the plaintiffs were able to identify -- there's some dispute whether it's 12 or 23, but do you represent that there were no other complaints made? So that, let's say, there has been discovery; now we're just at the pleading stage. The company would have said: That's it; we didn't have any more.",
  "But they might have been able through discovery to find that there were many more.",
  "But why shouldn't that determination be deferred until there's discovery, and then we can know how many reports there really were?",
  "Mr. Hacker -­",
  "Mr. Hacker, you just said, if I understood you correctly, that when the -­ when the news came out on Good Morning America, accurate or not, there was an obligation to do something about it, but among the -- the charges, it's not simply that there was these reports, but it's the way the company responded to them: two press releases that said allegations of any linkage of the drug to anosmia are completely unfounded. That statement was made even after the -- what was it, Dr. Jafek?",
  "-- had this presentation, and he was going to put Zicam's name on it, and the company said you don't have any permission to do that. So the company prevented Good Morning America from happening earlier, and it made these affirmative statements that there's no linkage.",
  "I thought that the scientific report that came out later said we can't say one way or the other, as opposed to the company saying that any suggestion of linkage is completely unfounded.",
  "They didn't say \"unfounded.\" They said the evidence is not -- we can't say yes and we can't say no. That's different from completely unfounded.",
  "Well, but you -- you have said raw adverse event reports. Am I not right that all of these reports came from medical doctors, and in response to the very first one, the company representative said, yes, we've been getting reports since 1999?",
  "But my question is, does it make a difference if these reports come from medical experts in this particular field?",
  "Mr. Frederick, your time is running out, and there's one thing that you emphasize in your brief -- I haven't heard you say one word about it here -- and that is you're saying it's -- this is not a case of a company that remains silent. The company, in response to this, issued press releases in which it said any suggestion of a linkage is completely unfounded. Now, that's something different from there are X number of reports. To what extent are you relying on the affirmative statements that the company made?",
  "General Bullock, would you please point to the precise language of the compact that freezes consumption, as distinguished from the amount of water diverted -- which freezes consumption as of January 1st, 1950?",
  "Well, the uses existing is irrigation. I don't see where it says -- and so I can understand, the amount of water diverted can't be increased.",
  "But would -­",
  "And what happens under Montana law?",
  "General Bullock, assume that you're right, that what was guaranteed was the same amount of water flowing into Montana as in 1950, and I -- I take it you don't care how Wyoming deals with this, but what -- if you're right, what could Wyoming do? It can't tell the -- the farmers go back to the old way of irrigating or go back to a different crop?",
  "So, you say it doesn't -­ they don't -- Wyoming doesn't have to know whether farmer A or farmer B is taking more than they took in 1950 -- I mean, is using more than they used in 1950; they just have to know what the total amount is, and Wyoming can make that up?",
  "Mr. Jay, I thought that the Special Master -- very important to him was the meaning of \"appropriative rights,\" and he said that the Wyoming law is just as you've described, that is, the farmer can use all that water; and he said Montana law is uncertain, but Wyoming law is not out of line with the general approach. Suppose this had been a case -- suppose Montana law, instead of being uncertain, was diametrically opposite Wyoming law, then what happens under this compact?",
  "In all of those cases, there was a forum in the United States where someone injured in the United States could sue. Your proposition is that a company can deliberately send its products, wants to exploit a U.S. market. But I take it that there is no place in the United States, because New Jersey is no different than California or any other place -- is it your position that there is no forum in which McIntyre can be sued, even though it set up this distribution arrangement for the very purpose of having its machines in as many locations in the United States as it could? Is there a forum in the United States where it could be sued?",
  "Which one?",
  "It could be reached in Ohio. Now, does that make a whole lot of sense? Is it any more convenient for McIntyre to come to Ohio than New Jersey? It's a lot less convenient for Mr. Nicastro, who had his fingers removed by this machine. But you -- you are conceding that there is a forum where this British company can be sued on a tort that occurred in New Jersey. Explain to me why, since there is a forum in the United States, the logical one isn't New Jersey rather than Ohio.",
  "I'm asking you -­",
  "-- the question: Where can it be sued? Well, something happened in New Jersey. The machine, allegedly defective machine, caused a harm there. What happened in Ohio? What basis for specific jurisdiction is there in Ohio? There was no tort in Ohio.",
  "I don't understand.",
  "What kind of common law indemnity are we dealing with here? Where does Mr. Nicastro sue? He hasn't got any assignment, any indemnity. Mr. Nicastro is injured in the United States by a machine manufactured in England, and he wants to sue, understandably, in the United States. Why are we talking about assignments, indemnity? That has nothing to do with Mr. Nicastro.",
  "No, I would just like to know first -- you said there is jurisdiction in Ohio and not in New Jersey. In New Jersey, it's the place where the accident occurred; and in Ohio, there's nothing but the relationship between the distributor -- there's a contract between the distributor and McIntyre. So why does Ohio have jurisdiction over this New Jersey tort?",
  "It's a forum what?",
  "And the claim in suit. That's very important.",
  "I still don't -- I don't follow how Mr. Nicastro gets involved with assignment, indemnity. Mr. Nicastro has a claim against -- well, he sued them both, but the distributor is now bankrupt. And he says, well, this is specific jurisdiction; specific jurisdiction, as International Shoe teaches, is where the claim arose. International Shoe, it arose in the State of Washington because that's where the shoe -­ the people who were promoting sale of International Shoe's -- International Shoe's shoes worked every day. So it was a claim relating to a tax owed by International Shoe based on the events that occurred in California. It was not all-purpose jurisdiction. And your suggestion that Ohio somehow is a proper forum for Mr. Nicastro's tort claim, I really don't follow that.",
  "Asahi -- Asahi, Mr. Fergenson, was a litigation between a Japanese component part manufacturer and a Taiwanese finished product manufacturer. What -- how in the world could you compare that case, which really has nothing at all to do with the United States? It's -- it's a Japanese valve manufacturer sells the valve to a tire maker in Taiwan, and there should be -- that suit should go forward in the United States? I can see it going forward in -- in Japan, but it has no connection with the United States. And how can you possibly compare that with this case where somebody was injured by a machine that malfunctions, allegedly? There was something very interesting you said in your brief. And you said the U.K., which you -­ you say -- now you've added Ohio, but you said U.K. would be the place for Mr. Nicastro to go. It provides a trusted legal system. What would be your answer if the manufacturer, same arrangement with a distributor, sell anyplace in the United States you can, is from China? Would you give the same answer?",
  "You -- you made a point about the trusted legal system. Well, let's say it was Russia, Mexico -- you may pick any one. The machine is manufactured in one of those countries where it's not so certain that there's a trusted legal system.",

  "We do, and we would like you to recognize ours. And we don't get that reciprocity, but we still are trying to get it.",
  "But the United States has taken a very neighborly view about recognizing and enforcing foreign judgments.",
  "Where did the New Jersey company that bought this machine find out about it?",
  "The -- the basis would only be the plaintiff's residence?",
  "But we don't accept that as a sufficient basis.",
  "It's the EEOC Convention on Jurisdiction and Judgments? Because that operates only within the Community.",
  "Are there -- there are some cases just beginning -- at the beginning stages, aren't there, involving sales through the Internet?",
  "There's one piece of this I don't quite comprehend. You -- there's no contest that there is jurisdiction over the parent, right?",
  "So it's -- it's based on consent?",
  "You are met with an argument that it's all one ball of wax. Parent and sub, they merge; it's one enterprise. And so if the subs do something any place, the parent is -- it's all part of one thing, so -- and I think that was the principal argument made by the Respondents.",
  "But Perkins is kind of an unusual case, because it was a company that at the time was doing business only in Ohio. It was a Philippine mining company, and it was World War II, so the mines couldn't be run. So to the extent that the corporation was existing anywhere, it was in Ohio.",
  "Well, suppose it's just a corporation that's registered to do business in North Carolina, and the connection with that registration -­ it says: I appoint so-and-so my agent to receive process for any and all claims.",
  "I think there's something very new about this, because general jurisdiction is all-purpose jurisdiction, and for a corporation it's sort of like a residence for an individual. I think Mr. Feder was making that point. What's -- what's troubling here is that the North Carolina court seems to be blending the two together: specific jurisdiction based on the claim arising in the forum, and general jurisdiction with a claim that has nothing to do with the forum, and its insertion of jurisdiction over any and all claims. And I do not know of any case post-International Shoe -- the only thing that we have is Perkins v. Benguet. Is there -- is there any case in which this Court has sanctioned the assertion of general jurisdiction based on some prior -- some product coming into the State, not the product that caused the injury abroad? I don't know of any case.",
  "Ms. Peddie, you haven't -- you don't have anything in the record about this being a unitary business. Unless you're trying to present some sweeping piercing-the-corporate-veil theory, there is nothing here that says that these aren't corporations that are acting separately, that have their own officers, have their own employees, keep their own books. There's nothing to show that it's all part of one enterprise.",
  "But the \"it\" wasn't the product that caused the injury here. As I understand the case, the tire that allegedly caused this bus to turn over was designed for the European and Asian markets, not the U.S. market.",
  "But why did -- why should -- Mr. Feder brought up the Helicopteros, and he said in that case, it was purchases; and in this case, it's sales. And in the purchaser case, certainly we said no, there's no general jurisdiction. Why should it be any different?",
  "In Perkins, it was the home of the corporation. There was no other at the time, because their permanent home was not functioning because of the war. So there was only one place.",
  "He was the president of the corporation.",
  "And whatever business it was doing, it was doing from that office in Ohio.",
  "May I ask you about the ramifications of your theory that there's general jurisdiction in North Carolina over these three subsidiaries? Suppose that one of the children on a bus was a Canadian citizen, was going home to Canada. And had the idea that juries in North Carolina are more liberal than in France. Well, there wouldn't be any jury in France, but -- so could the Canadian come and sue because there's general jurisdiction in the United States?",
  "No, you -- we're talking about Goodyear and these three subsidiaries. You say there's general jurisdiction in North Carolina. Those companies can be sued on any and all claims. So my question is: Could anyone on that bus that turned over in Paris come to North Carolina to bring the wrongful death, or whatever, suit?",
  "Do you have any case law that supports your position, which, I take it -- and correct me if I've got it wrong -- that a subsidiary is subject to jurisdiction wherever the parent is, so long as some products made by the subsidiary are shipped by the parent to the -- to buyers in the forum State?",
  "I see nothing in the North Carolina court's opinion that explains that this is the -- this is a corporation where we can obliterate the distinction between parent and sub.",
  "There's -- there's a -­ you open your brief saying something to the effect of this case is about outsourcing, jobs in the U.S. going to some subsidiary port. But then these subsidiaries are making tires which, on your own admission, very rarely come to the United States because they're designed specifically for vehicles in Asia and in Europe. And so I would think that Turkey would be the ideal location for -- for such a place. I don't get your outsourcing pitch.",
  "Could you go back? You -- you said something about the two of them are subject to suit. You said this is a question of one lawsuit instead of four. Could you explain that?",
  "What about France?",
  "It's not a question of more convenience. It's a question that the claim arose there, and then, of course, there was -- just because the claim arose there, there would be some convenience factors. All the witnesses to the accident are there; whatever is left of the bus is there.",

  "Where did the -- where did the Kentucky Supreme Court -- where did the Kentucky Supreme Court say that it was looking to a subjective state of mind on the part of the police?",
  "That didn't -- that didn't apply in this case?",
  "But why is -- why is that subjective? Why isn't that -- would it be foreseeable to a reasonable police officer similarly situated?",
  "They go to the apartment building, and they sniff at every door, and when they sniff, when a strong smell of marijuana emanates from the door, then they go through this routine, but they do it as a matter of every 2 weeks, as the Chief said, as a routine matter. They don't just knock on every door, but they knock on the doors where they smell marijuana, and they do that just as a routine, in all the buildings where they suspect there may be drug -- drugs being stashed.",
  "May -­",
  "May we just go back over -- you're putting in the fleeing felon, but as far as I understand from this record, it was never shown that the dealer that the police were following was aware that he was following and that he was fleeing from them. This is the -- it's not part of the question you presented, because we granted only on the exigent circumstances, but I didn't think that there was -- the dealer wasn't called, and he wasn't asked did you even know that the police were following you?",
  "May I ask a question -­",
  "May I ask a question that goes back to what you said? You have clarified very nicely that there has to be probable cause to think that there's something wrong going on in the -- the apartment. And you said that is, at that point when they -- the marijuana -- a strong smell comes from the door, at that point the police could go and get a warrant. Then they don't have to, because then they knock on the door. We start out with a strong presumption that the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, a strong preference for getting the warrant. So why in this situation wouldn't the first response of the police be -- instead of knocking, because once they knock they alert the people in there: Let's get a warrant; we'll come back.",
  "And how is it -- you mention Johnson.",
  "And I think the other side says it was the same thing except it was a hotel room instead of an apartment building. The police smell -- in that case, it was -- what was it?",
  "Didn't they smell marijuana or opium or something?",
  "You left out one thing. I thought they heard ruffling noises before they attempted to get into the apartment -- into the hotel room. There was something about noises.",
  "And what was that here? Because it was kind of vague. They heard movement. What kind -- what kind of movement? It didn't -- it said nothing about a toilet flushing -­",
  "Is your test is something novel? I mean, Justice Breyer mentioned that there are some five tests in the different circuits, and the foreseeability test is the one that the Kentucky Supreme Court used, but is your -- does your test coincide with the tests of any other circuits, or is it different?",
  "All you have to do is get a new named plaintiff?",

  "Yes, but there are 50 States.",
  "There are 50 States. And if -- and if the plaintiff was asking for a nationwide class action.",
  "We couldn't know. We couldn't -- when they went to the West Virginia Supreme Court, that was before this White v. Wyeth. They were arguing a question of substantive law: What do we have to show in order to get damages, when we say we weren't hurt by the drug? We're saying -- we're not saying we didn't get any benefit from it; we're just saying we paid more money for it than we should because it wasn't of the quality that it was represented to be. When the Federal judge said, having to make a determination of West Virginia law, no, it's not the law; you have to show causation, some harm to you. But then when they -- when these plaintiffs went to the West Virginia court, that was still an open question of West Virginia law, and the West Virginia courts might have decided it differently than the Federal court, right?",

We're going to stop that court from proceeding altogether. And the anti-suit injunction is -- it's a very strong weapon, and even though it's the -- the clients who are being precluded, it's really saying to another court: We're not even going to let you get to this question; we're going to stop you. So maybe you could be right about preclusion but wrong about use of the anti-suit injunction.",

  "Mr. Phillips, when the contractors -- when they failed to deliver the first aircraft at the time specified by the contract, their reason was that its costs would far outrun the contract price, and so it sought to reformulate the contract. At that time -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I think at that time the contractors said nothing at all about superior knowledge and the government's obligation to share information that it hadn't shared.",
  "But you would expect them to say, if they -- if that was the impediment to going forward on this contract, to at least mention it. And to -­",
  "Can you explain that -­ you've referred to it several times now. I thought that that was not a progress payment based on completed work. The government says that that money was advanced; you had not complied with what was necessary to comply with to get that 1.35 million. They distinguished the $1.35 million that you legitimately received as a progress payment, but this next, they say, you have not fulfilled what you needed to do to get that.",
  "But you are here seeking to -- to emerge as a total winner, that is to get from this contract what you would have gotten if it had been successfully completed, including any profit -­",
  "I would -- I think it's questionable, Mr. Phillips, for this reason: You say that it's an implied term of this contract that the government has a duty to share certain information, and you are seeking to enforce that implied term of the contract. So it seems to me, as to that alleged duty, you are the moving party. You're saying: Court, please enforce this implied term of the contract.",
  "You mentioned the 1.3 -­ that you get to keep the 1.35 million, but there was also another figure -- 1.2 million that you would get on top of that.",

  "It was thinking of a tort. It wasn't thinking of -- Reynolds is a tort action.",
  "So you're -­",
  "Am I -- am I right that this contract did specify certain information that the government agreed to give the Petitioner?",
  "Mr. Phillips said the reason they couldn't specify this information is they didn't know what it was.",
  "They -- they didn't know what -- it was secret information. They didn't know -­ wouldn't even know what to ask for.",
  "Do you agree that -- do you agree that there is nothing between -- I think Justice Scalia was asking Mr. Phillips, why can't we just say let's -- all bets are off, everybody go home with what they have. But Mr. Phillips says there are only these two things; there's either default termination or termination for convenience, and nothing in between. Do you agree that that's the world that we're dealing with, those two choices and nothing else?",
  "If that -- if you're right about that, the government's absolute right, could you withhold it from other contracts of these contractors?",
  "But you say -­",
  "So you are saying there is another way? There's a middle way?",
  "Mr. Richland, isn't there this difference: Just to take ordinary civil procedure, compulsory counterclaim doesn't have to satisfy any jurisdictional requirements, because it comes in under the wing of the main claim, but a permissive counterclaim has to independently satisfy a jurisdictional requirement. So that could be a reason, even though the Bankruptcy Code just says counterclaim, to distinguish the two. If there's an authority to deal with the claim, then there's authority to deal with the counterclaim, but if it's a permissive counterclaim, it's not based on the same transaction or premise, then it would have to be a self-standing claim. But, as you -- as you have said, this case does present what the parties have agreed is a compulsory counterclaim.",
  "And the counterclaim came at what point? After the proof of claim was filed?",
  "Will you include in that this 157(b)(5), because this whole thing would be a futile exercise if that tort claim comes -- comes out of the bankruptcy judge's -­",
  "Does the Government have a position on what the answer would be? We've remanded it, but that's an open question. But does the Government have a position on whether these kinds of claims would have to be heard by an Article III judge?",
  "Mr. Englert, something you just said about if he had any opportunity -- I thought his position was this is a nondischargeable debt. Even if it's discharged in bankruptcy, this debt would survive.",
  "So it wouldn't be wiped out? I mean, it would -­",
  "He would have another forum.",
  "Just one more point about the nondischargeability. He didn't have to bring that claim, did he? I mean, if it's -- if it's a nondischargeable debt, he doesn't have to have the bankruptcy judge confirm that it's a nondischargeability debt.",
  "Because there was no bankruptcy court handle to start with. There was no claim. If you're going to go back to equity, equity lays hold of a claim that fits within the equity court, and then, as you know, there were clean-up and clear-up doctrines so they could decide the whole case. So I think that the one thing one can say about Marathon is that when the debtor has a claim against the creditor and the creditor hasn't made any claim in the bankruptcy, he can't drag that into bankruptcy court. But once the bankruptcy court has authority over the claim, the creditor's claim against the debtor, then the court can clear up the whole matter.",
  "Just clarify one point, Mr. Englert. As I understand it, before the code was amended, when the Federal courts were operating under the interim rule, it was standard that the bankruptcy judges, given a claim against the estate, routinely dealt with counterclaims. Isn't that what the practice was when the interim rule was in effect?",
  "Ms. Blatt, would you explain the function that the contract mechanism serves? I mean, you could just have this -- you could just have the statute say: Thou shalt not charge more than the ceiling price. Period. What -- what is accomplished by having the contract reflecting the terms of the statute?",
  "Well, to the extent that you're objecting to the disruption of the Secretary, there is disruption when it's a private party bringing a False Claims Act.",
  "Even if the United States doesn't take over the case, just lets the qui tam relator -­",
  "-- proceed?",
  "You mean -- you mean there's no negotiated element to it? It's what the statute -- it's the same as Ms. Blatt said? It's -- the contract repeats the words, the terms of the statute, and that's it; is that what you mean?",
  "Ms. Blatt said nothing has been done. It just went into effect on January 1st, but are there -- are there plans to implement it?",
  "Mr. Frederick -­",
  "-- I thought when this case went back to the -- to the district court, the -­ the agency's position was this is a total surprise to us, 14,000 suits or whatever it is. No, we never -- we never envisioned making the individual whatever you call them -- the 430B -­",
  "We never envisioned making them the beneficiaries and -- and allowing them to sue. That would be quite disruptive of our program. That, I thought, was the position the Government took.",
  "I thought it was because the States have been given a role in the statute itself, where the 340B entities have not. I thought that was the -- the Government's position, that the States have a role in the Medicaid program, and that's an entirely different thing than this program, where these entities have no statutory role, say the drug manufacturers and then HHS.",
  "The result is the same, Mr. Frederick. And that's -- I mean, it was a central point in this last brief. You can call it whatever you want. It's -- Congress has not provided for a private right of action to enforce the terms of the statute. The contract embodies the terms of statute. So it would be passing strange if Congress, as we now read Congress, said we want private parties out of this; this is to be between the agency and the manufacturer to say. The same exact result. The same aim can be achieved through this third-party beneficiary route. And I think that said, that is the -- I mean, that is what stands out about this case. And so how do you respond to that? What's the difference between suing because the statute has been violated and suing because the contract has been violated?",
  "But the statute wouldn't apply to someone who doesn't want to be in the program.",
  "But we're told that whatever you say -- that's all we're talking about. We are told that computing the price is a very intricate business and that many of these disputes have been about what is -- what should the ceiling price be.",
  "There would not -- the ceiling price is out there, and there's no dispute about it. It's just a question of getting the manufacturers to charge that price and not a higher price. The question is: What is the ceiling price?",
  "But that's -- and then they have control over them. And they don't have control over these suits.",
  "Do you take the position that nothing has changed as a result of the new legislation? That is, Ms. Anders told us that this statute is going into -- to become effective. There's going to be procedures, better procedures than there were before. Is there still this third-party beneficiary suit, despite the possibility of going to the agency?",
  "What about -- what about personal appearances?",
  "Mr. Yang, can we go back first to this -- the request came in and, as I understand it, the Commission said there are two exemptions: The one for trade secrets, commercial, financial confidential information; and then there was one with Exemption 7 itself but as to the employee.",
  "How does the -- does the Commission, unaided by AT&T, go through the papers and decide what would be embarrassing for an AT&T employee, as distinguished from the corporation?",
  "Yes.",

  "-- not artificial beings. But it uses the words \"individual privacy\" -­",

  "Your argument is based on a case that will come before us. So -- but in this case, it's to your interest to say, yes, that has been -- that has been the Court's precedent, that FOIA exceptions are to be narrowly construed.",
  "Do you include in this the people, the persons that you say are shielded by this privacy exemption, as Mr. Yang said, foreign governments, State and local governments? Those have all -- those all fall under the APA definition of person.",
  "Can you give us an idea of -- the corporation has been shielded by Exemption 4 for its confidential financial information, trade secrets; and its employees have been protected under Exemption 7. What is it, what would be -- would fall within this privacy exception that would not be confidential business information or relate to employees of the corporation?",
  "But you were about to give a second example of where, even though it hasn't -­ personal privacy hasn't been used in -- but you said one example is the two officials who are saying unpleasant things about a regulator. And what was your other example?",
  "Is that a reason to change what was the understanding of Exemption 7? One of the items that doesn't work in your favor was the Attorney General's memorandum at the time of the '74 amendments.",
  "I'm talking about the -- Attorney General Levi.",
  "Yes, that's what I meant.",
  "Mr. Klineberg, you have read the brief of the Project on Government Oversight, where they give dozens and dozens of examples to show that, overwhelmingly, \"personal\" is used to describe an individual, not an artificial being. And it is the overwhelming use of \"personal.\"",
  "The government agrees that it's an enumerated power claim in this case.",
  "You are -- you are at no risk if the Court were just limited to what both of you agree is involved -- Article I, Section 8 -- and if there is a difference for commandeering claims, when the case arises, we can deal with it.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, is your concern that there would be a clash in these cases? You've given the example of the State wants to have this registration system. Suppose the -- the defendant can raise that and would prevail? Well, the State's not party to that suit, its interests have not been represented. Is that -- is that your concern?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, are we getting to the merits of the case?",
  "In the category that you would like to have saved, you said commandeering, but you said there conceivably could be others. Is there anything concrete, anything other than commandeering, that might fall under this State sovereignty side of the line?",
  "Unlikely to come up as a defense in a criminal case.",
  "Mr. McAllister, have you found any case other than this one where a criminal defendant was held to have lacked standing to challenge a statute under which the defendant was prosecuted?",
  "Mr. Roberts, is there -­ is there any, anything to indicate that what Congress might have had in mind is that in criminal cases inevitably there are going to be motions, and so the trial judge is likely to set the trial date for after that period runs?",
  "Is it because, Mr. Roberts, as you pointed out, it's not a continuing problem since the amendment to Rule 45, it's calendar days, and so there's no problem, and so what you're suggesting is we would not have granted cert on that question?",
  "But I think you don't.",
  "Let's go back to -- I don't think you should have been so happy with the way the argument was going -­",
  "-- because -- because your view is, Rule 40 -- if it's always assumed that there be conformity between Rule 45 -- Rule 45, it was business days, and then rule 45 changed not only to say calendar days, but included statutes for the first time. So I think what you're saying is that the interpretation of the statute tracks with Rule 45, Rule 45 formerly was calendar -- was business days, it is now calendar days, there is conformity. And plus, \"statute\" is in Rule 45, and that was at least laid on the table of Congress, so they know that it was there.",
  "Why wouldn't Congress think, we have a bunch of statutes that have times and we have a bunch that don't and the ones that don't, they should be interpreted into the Federal rule, that Rule 45?",
  "Under the 2009 amendment, Rule 45 includes statutes it didn't before and now it does?",
  "I think you would be very happy if we didn't.",
  "But then you would have to -- we would have to wait for another case to decide this issue, one which is a split, that is, the delay resulting from. What does that mean?",
  "How would you ever know that? How would we ever know that, Mr. Fisher? A trial judge that has had a lot of criminal cases knows that there's going to be some motions as you get closer to trial, but how would we know whether the judge -- this particular judge took into account the likelihood of motions in setting the trial date or didn't?",
  "Why -- why would the defendant stipulate?",
  "Why would -- why would a defendant who would benefit from the clock running stipulate?",
  "Why do you think that -­",
  "-- your motion -- I mean, the government had administrative motions, but you had a Speedy Trial Act motion; and you say that doesn't count, either?",
  "Isn't it enough for you to say -- or based not in whole, but in part -- based on, something could be based on several things, and one of them is the guidelines that then existed?",
  "Mr. Heft, are you relying on -- this was -- this is a plea agreement that said, specifically, defendant agrees to have his sentence determined pursuant to the guidelines, and then the judge says that he was adopting the probation report and the application of the guidelines as set out therein, so both the -- the defendant says, I agreed to a determination pursuant to the guidelines, and the judge says, I'm going to apply the guidelines in giving you your sentence. So the hypotheticals we're talking about are quite far afield from where you have a specific statement by the defendant and the sentencing judge that the guidelines are being applied.",
  "But now you're talking about a plea agreement, which the government has consented to whatever this agreement is and whether -­ whether -- sometimes a plea agreement will say okay, if you take a plea, we'll drop certain charges or we'll charge a small amount -- value of the drug. Was there any of that in -- in this plea?",
  "But in that event, the sweet part would be open to reconsideration too. I mean, you can't say, I want the good part, the lowered guideline, but I also want to keep that certain counts are dropped and that a certain quantity of drugs was agreed upon. You would have to reopen the whole thing.",
  "I am not following that argument for this reason. It seems to me if you ask what did the judge apply at the time he imposed the original sentence, well, it has got to be the guidelines, because first the agreement provides for it; then he says I am going to wait for the probation report so I can see what the calculation is, whether I agree with it; and then he gives him a sentence that is precisely within the guidelines. So if you asked me to describe what that sentence was -- of what was it, 46 to 106 days -- I say that was a guideline sentence. It was right there within the brackets that -- the guidelines. So why wasn't it a guideline sentence?",
  "I thought one of the things in the plea agreement was that the -- that the judge would have the right to himself calculate the guideline range.",
  "You said that the particular patent -- the defendant would have to know that the device infringed the particular patent. I think that would be a standard that would be impossible to meet. We have to know if it was patent number, whatever it was, '312.",
  "But you can keep yourself ignorant of it. I mean, for example, you pointed out that the -- that the device that was copied was purchased in Hong Kong, so it didn't have any marking, but the same Pentalpha could have bought the device in Montgomery Ward, looked to see if it had a patent marking; didn't do that.",
  "But didn't tell that patent attorney that they had reverse-engineered a particular product. If the attorney had been told this device copied the SEB fryer, isn't it 99 and 44/100ths percent sure that the attorney then would have found this patent?",
  "But I didn't ask you about this patent search. I said if they had told the patent attorney we have copied a particular fryer, it's SEB's fryer, now find out if it infringed any patent -­ do you think an attorney would not have found the SEB patent?",
  "But if you really wanted to know, wouldn't you have gone into Montgomery Ward and bought one of the fryers and turned it around to see if it had a patent number on it?",
  "But isn't -- isn't it true that Sunbeam was the party that asked for the patent search?",
  "And there's nothing in the record that says who -- who asked Pentalpha -­",
  "-- to get -- to get a letter?",
  "Before -- before you pass that question, then why as in '607 did they pick the SEB fryer to reverse-engineer?",
  "And then they copied the design of the SEB.",
  "But there was a finding that it was an infringement, that the Pentalpha fryer infringed the SEB.",
  "Where are you reading from, Mr. Cruz?",
  "They're dealing -­",
  "They're dealing with a Federal Circuit decision, they're reviewing that decision, the Federal Circuit had a formula. It said standard is deliberate disregard of a known risk. One thing you must surely do is to say whether that standard is right or wrong. So the Federal Circuit, whatever the jury found, Federal Circuit said the law is that you are liable under 271(b) if you are deliberately -- if you deliberately disregard a known risk. Is that standard the right one?",
  "And after that date you admit you -- because you continued to sell the product to the retailers?",
  "So after Sunbeam sued, then you are actively inducing infringement?",
  "I thought that opinion was after the first finding of infringement, that you redesigned the product and that, the evidence you got dealt with the redesigned products.",
  "But after just originally, Sunbeam is suing for infringement. Sunbeam notifies Pentalpha. At that point, Pentalpha is continuing to make sales. Is it infringing? Is it actively inducing infringement.",
  "You admitted there was purposeful, culpable conduct when you did not, when you had the original design and that was, and you were sued for actively inducing infringement of that design, by that design.",
  "But you think a jury could have found that from the facts?",
  "That seems to be a factual dispute, so maybe you can be clear on that. According to Cetus or Roche, at the time that this scientist came to Cetus to work, there was no Federal funding; that that Federal funding for this project, the Stanford project, came about after the scientist had spent his 9 months at Cetus. At least that's the picture that -- that they draw, that the Federal -- that they got their assignment from the scientist at a time when there was no Federally funded project.",
  "Mr. Ayer, it seems the Federal Circuit emphasized a distinction between the scientist saying \"I will assign,\" which was the language used in the agreement with Stanford, and \"I hereby do assign,\" and it seems that that was critical to the -­ to the Federal Circuit's decision. They say -- they cite a whole bunch of cases. The suggestion seems to be that if Stanford had said \"I hereby do assign,\" there would be no case because Stanford would have been first in time.",
  "Is that what we're dealing with in this case? I mean, there was a -- an agreement, a standard Stanford agreement, that said I will assign any -- any patent.",
  "So why isn't that the beginning and end of this case? I mean you -- there are important questions presented. But the Federal Circuit said everything turns on the difference between \"I will assign\" and \"I hereby assign.\" Cetus would have come second in time, therefore would not have prevailed over Stanford, but for, except, the Federal Circuit said, one is a future conveyance and one is an immediate conveyance. You know -­",
  "The whole thing that was wrong here is that Stanford, instead of drafting the agreement \"I agree to assign,\" should have said \"I hereby assign\" and then there would be no case. Is that -- the Cetus agreement said \"I hereby assign,\" and the Federal Circuit said for that reason, even though it was second in time, it takes precedence. Stanford just said \"I will assign.\" So if Stanford had instead used exactly the formula that Cetus used -- \"I agree to assign and hereby do assign\" -- would you have any case?",
  "So if the Cetus agreement that came second in time had said \"I will assign,\" then again, you would have no case?",
  "We -- we have a number of sample clauses in this record, and some say \"I will assign.\" Some say \"I hereby do assign.\" The notion that the -- that answer, who is it who loses, should turn on whether one drafter says \"I agree to assign\" and the other says \"I hereby assign\" does seem very odd.",
  "Then we're talking about nonexistent property; property that may never, in fact, exist?",
  "So in the future, the universities would be protected against a third party simply by changing the form of contract with their employees to say \"I hereby assign,\" so we would have no continuing problem? Is that all this -­",
  "You were here, Mr. Fleming, when I asked Mr. Ayer about that -­",
  "That's not -- so that the federally funded project existed at Stanford before Dr. Holodniy ever went to Cetus?",
  "Mr. Pincus, if the -- the substance that is involved in this case was a rock-like substance and it wasn't a powder. So why doesn't it belong? It's a rock-like substance. Why should it be outside the category cocaine base?",
  "Correct me if am I wrong about this -- I may have a misimpression -- but I thought you were objecting to a charge to the jury that charged cocaine base and didn't charge crack.",
  "But you just said it's an academic issue because there's not a market for leaves or for paste. What Congress was getting at was crack. The judge used the term cocaine base. Assume you are right. What should happen? Could you go back to the judge and he would then say, well, this is -- the chemists testified this is crack?",
  "It was -- it was -- the testimony was it was a rock-like substance. What wasn't said was -- what is it? Bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, was not mentioned.",
  "The -- the district judge would be the finder, right?",
  "Because you have no Apprendi problem?",
  "What is in (ii) now, on your reading, your expansive definition of \"cocaine base\"? What is in Romanette (ii) other than powder?",
  "They're all very exotic, but practically, what does the government prosecute under Romanette (ii)? What substances other than -­",
  "Yes. That's -- so there seem to have been a lot of words here, but in practice, (ii) is powder and everything else is under (iii)?",
  "Then, Ms. Saharsky, you do get the problem that Justice Breyer was trying to avoid. That is, on your definition this paste, which is supposed to be less addictive, less addictive than powder, gets bracketed with crack, which is more addictive.",
  "Why would he face liability? Because he didn't have the opportunity to challenge that decision, the Fourth Amendment decision; therefore, it would have no preclusive effect on him. A party who doesn't have the -- if there are alternative holdings and you lose on one, win on the other, you're not precluded by the loss because you didn't have an opportunity to raise it on appeal. So why would Camreta be precluded? Why would he face punitive damages as you're suggesting?",
  "Well, why isn't the answer, then, that that's the right case to take up? Because in this case, we have a plaintiff who is not going to be confronted with this situation again and who has put herself out of the running for damages because she didn't -- she didn't challenge the qualified immunity ruling. So she has no stake in any monetary relief from this claim. She has no continuing -- the -­ what has happened to her, happened to her at age 9, will never happen again now that she's past 18. So she hasn't -- if she came to court today with her case as an 18-year-old, she would have no case or controversy. It just seems like the whole case has evaporated. She has no claim. She did have a claim for -- for money damages, but she has relinquished that. So, what -- what genuine controversy is before us?",
  "She was the plaintiff. In Arizona, we were talking about whether a plaintiff still had a viable claim, right?",
  "But that didn't have to do with the school search -- the school seizure?",
  "So -- and this case presents the question about was this unreasonable? That -- what's left in the case has to do with the mother's claim, and it has to do with putting the girls in custody, right?",
  "What happened in -­ what -- what has Oregon done in response to this Ninth Circuit decision? Before it said that the caseworkers could have this kind of interview with the -- the child where there was a suspicion of abuse. Was there any change in practice in Oregon in response to the Ninth Circuit's decision?",
  "What about -- did she -­ did she -- let's go back one step. Does she have any viable claim now? This is not capable of repetition, evasive of review?",
  "You have very limited time. Could you -- could you go to the merits of the Fourth Amendment question and give us the Government's position on that?",
  "She's asserting the interests of other children who would be in the situation that she was once in, but no longer; but we have said the plaintiff herself must have a live controversy, and there was no class action here.",
  "Where are you reading in the holding of the court of appeals? Because I was under the impression that they did say there's only three ways: One is you get a warrant; another is you get parental consent; and a third is exigent circumstances. I thought that was the -- the ruling of law by the Ninth Circuit.",
  "Well, let's see where they -- I thought that, yes, the case is about a single plaintiff; it's not a class action. But they're making a rule of law. What does the Fourth Amendment require?",
  "You got a stipulation that there was a seizure, so -­",
  "There was never any argument that was not at issue in this case. Given that there was seizure -­",
  "-- the question is: Is it reasonable?",
  "Have you, in the -- many of the questions have gone to leads, but this is initially a social worker's investigation. And you said, when stating what the Ninth Circuit's rule was, that police are in combination with the caseworker. Suppose we took out -- out of the picture. He didn't utter a word in the interview. Suppose we take the sheriff, deputy sheriff, out. The only one who comes to the school and asks to talk to this child is the caseworker from the department of health?",
  "If the information elicited from the child is that she has been abused by her father, then there is a likelihood that there will be police interest in that.",
  "It wouldn't affect your client in any way, because she's out of it and you were candid from the beginning to say as far as she's concerned this is a moot case; but as far as Camreta and the other officers are concerned, we were told by Oregon's representative that they are not -- that they have tailored their behavior to conform to this decision.",
  "So -­",
  "But suppose the FOIA information is just to confirm, to back up, to fill out; that the -- the relator suspects there's a fraud going on, and he thinks that the -- the fraud will be documented by filings that the alleged fraudulent party has made in the government.",
  "Yes.",
  "So in each case, we'd have to tell what was the -- the false claims claim; was it so heavily dependent on FOIA disclosures, or was the FOIA disclosures -- say they were a minimal part of the -­",
  "If I -- if I submitted, as we -- all Federal judges do, financial disclosure statements to an administrative office, and then someone from the press has a Freedom of Information Act request to see that financial disclosure statement, does it then become -- does it become the report of the administrative office, rather than my report to the administrative office?",
  "So there's no difference between a report -- the government has an investigating commission and it works up a report -- as opposed to the many government agencies that are just repositories? They accept pieces of paper, reports, filed by other people, like a tax return, like a financial disclosure. The agency does nothing, has no input. I mean, there's surely different between those two kinds -- one, I would say, the natural understanding would be it's a report by the person who's filing it to the agency; and the other, where the agency puts personnel to investigate an issue, is a report of the agency. And you seem to say, no, they're all reports of the agency.",
  "Let's take this very case -­",
  "I'm asking you isn't there a difference between saying we want the raw filings, we want what Schindler filed, we don't want the government to do any investigations, we want them to do just the mechanical thing that they do under FOIA, and an agency saying we're going to investigate and make a report, we're going to put our people under the investigators, and we're going to interview witnesses, they're going to examine documents, and -- and we'll make a report? That's how I understand a government report. But it's very hard for me to understand how a report by Schindler becomes a government report simply because it is filed with the agency.",
  "We'll find out from them if that is what they have set their position. I had not read them to say that. I read them to say only -- to challenge your position that every FOIA response is necessarily a report for purposes of the False Claims Act.",
  "If you request a report, then you get a report.",
  "Which is -- can you point us to the page so we can see the Second Circuit's definition of report and the Second Circuit's definition of an FCA investigation?",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't want to eat into your time.",
  "Did the FCA, the amendments in 2009, which are not retroactive, do they have any bearing on this problem prospectively?",
  "Mr. Fisher, when you say \"in the presence,\" do you -- do you mean it necessarily must be in the courtroom, or would a video-conferencing set-up be permissible so that the technician or the analyst could testify from the lab, rather -- but it would be screened in -- in the courthouse?",
  "The defendant didn't give his consent, so we don't -- that's not a concern, but let's -- let's suppose defendant doesn't stipulate. Is this adequate to meet the Confrontation Clause?",
  "And that's what -- that's the New Mexico Supreme Court suggested, didn't they? They said bring the printout from the gas -- whatever -­ chromatograph, and then have an expert who was not the one who certified -- it was not Caylor -- but that here's the graph that came out of the machine, and this is the way this process operates. I -- in your answer to Justice Sotomayor, did you mean to agree with the New Mexico Supreme Court when they said printout plus an analyst who didn't do this particular run but knows how the process works?",
  "How do you answer the practical situation that Caylor, who did this particular run, does some dozens day in and day out, and he will have no memory, in fact, of this particular test. So having him there -- he knows how the process operates; he doesn't remember this particular one -- how does having him there -- what could be elicited on cross-examination of him that couldn't be from his supervisor?",
  "That was the principal thrust of your brief, that this isn't testimonial at all. You have not said because it was unsworn, because you recognize the certification is the same, but you're trying to equate it to a business record, public record?",
  "You do have the hurdle that this record was created for a specific purpose. It was created to provide evidence for use in a criminal prosecution.",
  "General, we seem to be describing -- this case seemed rather particular, that is, there was no objection by New Mexico to having an analyst show up, Razatos; so -- so he had to travel however long he said. It's just a question of one employee's time rather than the other. But -- and then you described how simple this thing was, you just put it in a machine, you would get out a piece of paper. Why didn't New Mexico have this -- there was an additional sample that could have been -- it would have been si simple to just retest it. Having the witness come to the court, why don't you arm him with the additional test, and then there would be no controversy?",
  "I -- I don't follow that because we have a substitute now. Caylor is out of the picture; we know that it is the defendant's blood because everything else is the same, and there's this vial that has a certain amount of blood and there's a certain amount left over, so it's not cumulative, because Caylor's out of the picture. It is the defendant's blood that has been lab tested by another analyst.",
  "Was Mr. Al-Kidd -- was he released after -- I understand he didn't testify at the trial, and there was an acquittal, and then other charges were dropped. Was Al-Kidd still in custody as a material witness after the trial was over?",
  "But he was restrained much longer -- for 15 months.",
  "But that's after there is probable cause to suspect that criminal activity has occurred. And then you -- once you have probable cause, they're not going to look behind probable cause. But, here, the whole reason for using this material witness statute is that there isn't probable cause to believe that al-Kidd did anything. The violation -- there was no violation of the law. So Whren is different. It's a different case.",
  "How does that -­",
  "General Katyal, there are some elements of this picture that are very disturbing, and we are talking about the Attorney General and the Attorney General's immunity. But there are allegations here that this man was kept awake, the lights shining in his cell for 24 hours, kept without clothes. Now that doesn't sound like the way one would treat someone whose testimony you want. Is there a remedy that he has for that obvious mistreatment?",
  "Mr. Kerr, the line that has been suggested by Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, that is exactly the line that the Eleventh Circuit took; is it not the case? I mean, Judge Kravitch said: Yes, the Fourth Amendment was violated, so to that extent we're following retroactivity precedent. But the remedy is something different. That was exactly the line that she took, wasn't it?",
  "And on your theory, I mean, there's another question in this case; that is, perhaps this evidence would come in under the inventory, as a -- as a legitimate inventory search, and if the Court decided that question, then -- then the question you're arguing, the exclusionary rule question, would have no practical consequences. On your theory, the way you reasoned, shouldn't the Court first decide was this a legitimate inventory search, and if so, then we never get to any exclusionary rule question?",
  "Essentially, is your argument essentially that we should distinguish never, which would be this case if your position is not right, and hardly ever. Is that -­",
  "Mr. Dreeben, what about Gant itself? Gant severely qualified Belton. Should there have been a suppression remedy for Gant, as Justice Kagan suggested, the very case that changes the law?",
  "And how would you answer it? Was Gant purely prospective or did Gant itself get the exclusionary rule?",
  "Suppose -- suppose it had been raised?",
  "I don't think that -­",
  "Were we right that -­ there were several cases that were TBR'd in light of Gant. Maybe some of them shouldn't have been TBR'd under your theory.",
  "She did say that if there is ambiguity, then the police must err on the side of not searching. Do you think that that's -- do you accept that?",
  "Is there -- is there any case in this Court where what was suppressed was information that was lawfully in the government's possession, as opposed to evidence that was acquired originally through the search? Here we have the DMV records, they're public records. I don't know of any decision of this Court that deals with suppression of evidence that is already in the government's possession, and if I'm wrong about that, you tell me.",
  "Suppose the police following Mr. Tolentino had noted down his license plate, and then got this information, not as a result of his driver's license, but from the plate on the car?",
  "They might show him as the owner of the car.",
  "How much time do they have to wait? Justice Kagan brought up if the police go to his home the next day. You've brought up attenuation theory a number of times.",
  "You -- I think now you have answered, he gets back into the car, drives it away, they can do nothing because it's too close to when they discovered his record of -- his suspended license. How much of an interval must there be? What do you mean by attenuation doctrine?",
  "I thought there was some rule about not being able to suppress a person's identity? You've been asked a couple of times why are you going after the DMV record; you should go after the police identification of Joe Smith or whoever. I thought there was some rule that says the identity of the person is not suppressible. Am I wrong about that?",
  "What's the difference between stopping a car and stopping a person on the street, as Justice Sotomayor asked? You can't stop somebody on the street for no reason. The person looks to you suspicious, so you stop the person and say: Tell me your name. For a Terry stop, you have to have reasonable suspicion. So why isn't it the same for somebody who is driving a car?",
  "May I ask you something about the practice in New York? I mean, there is an artificiality to this case because we are assuming that the stop was unlawful.",
  "But the police said it was lawful, because the radio was blasting so loud. Why did this issue even -- the issue of \"suppose it was unlawful\" even come up, instead of the city or the county saying what the police stopped him for was a traffic violation, was perfectly legal? Why get to the constitutional question when the prosecutor brought into play the argument that this was a lawful stop?",
  "You mentioned some -­ before you finish, you -- you said a name is not suppressible, and that's because this Court held -- we started out by saying the observation of the person that dropped out of this case, so we're talking only about records, but the extraction of a name, you say that's not suppressible, even though it was unlawfully extracted because there were no reasonable suspicions that this person did anything wrong?",
  "Why? Because when he entered a guilty plea, you reserved only the question concerning the motor vehicle records; you didn't reserve any other questions.",
  "Why would it make -- why would it make a difference at what you call the balancing stage whether it is -- whether the distinction is between public speech and private speech on the one hand or government as employer and government as sovereign on the other? Why would there be any difference?",
  "Why not?",
  "Mr. Ortiz, you're not drawing any line depending on the branch of government, in other words, executive, legislature. Those are certainly branches of government to which one can petition. But access to court you agree comes within the Petition Clause?",
  "What about the -- this as I understand it, came up originally as arbitration under the -- wasn't it under the collective bargaining contract?",
  "Would that count also, because it is a mechanism set up by a government employer?",
  "But you are not challenging that, as I understand.",
  "Mr. Palmore, what about the distinction that the other side brings up that Connick is about what happens inside the workplace -­ you don't want to disrupt the routine by the kind of activity in which Myers was involved -- but the Petition Clause, they're talking about conduct outside the workplace, that is a complaint filed in court, nothing that's happening in the workplace.",
  "What if added to that is \"and I'm going to sue\" or \"I'm going to file a grievance\"?",
  "Mr. Schnapper, you can write a letter to the president, you can write a letter to your congressional representative, but getting to a court, you have to pay a filing fee. And since this would be a civil case, this Court has held if you haven't got whatever is the filing fee amount, too bad, you don't have access to the Court.",
  "Are you suggesting that in one of these suits you wouldn't have to pay the filing fee?",
  "Mr. Schnapper, this is not -- if you're -- if you're talking about the practical significance, Myers in Connick was going around the office, collecting signatures. She was taking a poll. She was taking a poll and the poll was going to be presented to the employer. That sounds much more petition-like than filing a grievance pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. So the -- the distinction between Connick, who was taking a poll -- why wasn't that a petition? Maybe -- did she just put the wrong label on it? If she called her case a petition case, it would have been all right?",
  "Mr. Schnapper, let's come to the century in which we are now living. We have Title VII. Title VII has this provision, an explicit provision against retaliation. But suppose it didn't. Suppose it just prohibited discrimination and it didn't have a retaliation clause. It's the thrust of your arguments that the government employee would have a claim for retaliation, although someone in the private sector would not?",
  "You do, I think, recognize that it would be possible then to circumvent Connick if you could turn around and file a pleading and say: Now I have a petition, not just a grievance.",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, you knew that, though, from day one. This case is brought in State court, it's removed to Federal court. Ultimately the plaintiff says: I recognize that as a matter of law my 1983 claim is no good. But the plaintiff didn't say that until 18 months after the -- the transfer. So doesn't the plaintiff have some responsibility for running up all these costs in the Federal -- burdening the Federal court, having discovery in Federal court, instead of saying when defendant removed the case -­ either dropping the Federal claim or conceding at that point that it had no merit so it's only the State claims. I mean, doesn't -- doesn't the plaintiff bear responsibility for keeping that case in Federal court for 18 months?",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, there -­ there are distinct differences in the 1983 suit because, first, the plaintiff has to show defendant acted under cover of State law -- that's not going to be necessary in the suit for extortion or defamation -- has to show that Vice was an official policymaker for the city. Those are discrete issues that relate to the 1983 claim but have nothing to do with the extortion/defamation claim.",
  "In other words, you're saying that the lawyer has to keep account of -- now, if I'm going to spend time on \"under color of State law,\" I have to label that and figure the hours for that separately; similarly for whether Vice was an official policymaker, those hours that you are requiring that -­ instead of saying X number of hours for deposition of witness A, you are requiring particularizing the issue?",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, one -­ one piece of this you must know the answer, under the Louisiana law we have the extortion, defamation, and emotional distress going forward in Louisiana courts. Does Louisiana follow the American rule so that plaintiff even -- if the plaintiff prevails, there would be no award of fees?",
  "I don't see how that -­ one can say that looking at the complaint. It said extortion, emotional distress -- where is the complaint? Let's look at it.",
  "Right to be free from extortion.",
  "Is -­",
  "I thought that the Louisiana pleading rule were -- was that you state the basis of your claim, and you do not have to plead legal theories; and if that's so, then if this -- defendant removed this case to Federal court; the plaintiff wanted to keep it in State court; and in Louisiana, under the Louisiana pleading rules, it would have been perfectly appropriate. The -- the claim alleged gave rise to extortion claim, the defamation claim; so this complaint was filed in Louisiana court that has a rule that says tell us what happened, and then you can have whatever legal theory you're entitled to.",
  "Isn't that implausible, Mr. Stancil, when we consider that of all the claims here, the one that would seem easiest to prove is extortion, because Vice was convicted of extortion in a criminal proceeding? So if you're looking look and you say what is the outstanding claim here, I would assume that it was the extortion.",
  "The district court was prompted to do that by your motion for summary judgment.",
  "And you could have brought that motion very early on. If this is a frivolous claim on its face, then why didn't you move to have it dismissed immediately?",
  "Mr. Stancil, the first magistrate to get this case said explicitly that the discovery materials, the discovery in the Federal Court, would be usable in State court proceedings where those materials might aid in obtaining a judgment. So doesn't that have to be taken into account, that the discovery materials developed in Federal Court will now be used in the State court proceeding?",
  "Well, that certainly conflicts with the first magistrate. The first magistrate said use the material in the State for the State court proceeding.",
  "That's disembodying what -- we have a factual scenario here. Some of the discovery was spent in determining what happened with the alleged racial slur. Investigating the facts of that claim are certainly relevant to the State court proceeding.",
  "Ms. Blackman, what is complex about a juvenile investigator? That's what this police officer was. So he's investigating a juvenile for juvenile justice purposes, and I think there's hardly anything more objective than that. This case has child written all over it. It's investigator who deals with children. The first proceedings is going to be a juvenile proceeding. How can you not take that into account, whatever -- whatever these other factors may involve? But here it seems to me so rampant because this police officer dealt only with juveniles, and he investigated juveniles.",
  "Would be one relevant factor that would be considered was that nobody called the parents?",
  "The question really is if he is in custody. And maybe there's something different about being in the room with a juvenile police investigator and the assistant principal and being in that same room with your parents there.",
  "The way you phrase the question, you say, may the trial -- whether trial courts may consider the juvenile's age in Miranda to make the in-custody Miranda determination. Did you really mean \"may,\" so it's discretionary with each judge, whether a juvenile's age is relevant to the in-custody analysis?",
  "What do you mean by use it in this situation? This is a middle -- middle school. This is an officer who deals only with children. I can't imagine any setting where age isn't more apparent than when dealing with an assistant principal, a juvenile investigator, going -- deciding -­ the juvenile investigator deciding the place where he wants to conduct this is in a middle school. I mean, just as a matter of common sense, how can you say that we're going to have the same test for this 8-year-old as we would for the 30-year-old?",
  "And we look at what is the normal school setting just like we looked at the normal business settings, he's in class, all the children are around him. This seventh grader was marched by the school security officer, taken away from his peers, from his class in -- put in a room with a closed door with the assistant principal. That is not a normal part of the school day. That's not where he is required to be. This is -­",
  "For search purposes, is age consciousness required? Remember, a part of this is the police officer then goes to the boy's home. The police officer is trained to deal with juveniles. And he says to the boy, you can't consent to the search because you're a seventh-grader. I will have to get a warrant. So please stay here until I get a warrant. If he can't -- if he's not treated like an adult for purposes of the search, if you get the warrant, if the police need a warrant because they're dealing with a seventh-grader, why should it be different for in custody for Miranda purposes?",
  "I thought all the police officer was looking at when he said \"I have to get a warrant\" is that he's dealing with a seventh-grader, not all the circumstances. Very simple: Age.",
  "He's under the age of consent.",
  "He can't consent to a contract. He -­",
  "Limit it to when the age is known. If we limit it to, this is an officer who not only knows he's dealing with a seventh-grader but he decides the venue for the questioning is going to be a room in the school, that's -- it's not a mystery. It's not a guess. He knows he's dealing with a seventh-grader. He sets it up. Are we to ignore what the investigating officer knows? The investigating officer knows he's dealing with a child.",
  "What's the -­",
  "Before you -- you are so quick to answer that's right, isn't it so that the manual that this very officer was given to use said before you question a child, give Miranda warnings?",
  "Apparently the people who train these juvenile officers think it's a good thing, not a bad thing to give a Miranda warning.",
  "Mr. Waxman, in your opening statement, you said whenever, in civil contempt, a person is subject to incarceration he or she is entitled to counsel. In your opening statement, you didn't limit it to cases like the case we have before us; that is, where the defense is I'm unable to pay. Therefore, I can't get out of jail. Are you limiting -- are you limiting your argument to the case of a noncustodial parent or a former husband who says I just haven't got the wherewithal to pay? Or are you making a broader claim that anytime someone is subject to incarceration they must have counsel?",
  "Are you saying all the -­ all the trappings of criminal procedure come with it? This case is focused on a right to counsel, but what about burden of proof, what about a jury trial?",
  "Mr. Waxman -­",
  "Mr. Waxman, you mentioned Lassiter, and you mentioned something that Lassiter said in passing, but what was at stake there was deprivation of parental status. And the Court said sometimes, in some cases, yes; but we're not going to make an across-the-board rule. Now, that deprivation, some people think, is the worst possible, for a custodial parent to be told you're no longer a parent, you no longer have a child. And yet, the Court said we're not going to provide counsel in every case, because in some cases the person can get a fair hearing without counsel.",
  "Does that go for alimony and palimony as well as child support?",
  "So, the answer is yes, it would cover.",
  "Is there a State -- we've been told that, in many States, appointment of counsel for an indigent, noncustodial parent who has -- who has child custody arrears, that counsel is automatic. You have described something less than counsel. Is there any model, any State where there is such a procedure so one might find out how it's working?",
  "What about an aid who is not counsel? I mean, the family court has a lot of auxiliary people like child advocates who are there to assist people who need some kind of representation, but not necessarily a lawyer. Is that any part of yours -­ of what you would propose?",
  "Is the form you have in mind something different than the form, the IFP form, that would be filled out say, by a 2255 petitioner?",
  "The South Carolina Supreme Court, as I understand, heard this case after he was released, so they didn't consider it moot.",
  "But it was a fact, was it not, that he was already released?",
  "Isn't it -- isn't it true that most States in child support cases, when the defendant says I have no money, will appoint counsel?",
  "I thought the point was it's -- it's only if the defendant -- the claim is only if the defendant does not have the keys in his pocket because he has no money. So, in cases where typical a recalcitrant spouse won't pay until he's threatened with jail, that wouldn't come in this category. I thought Mr. Waxman was speaking about people who do not have the keys in their pockets because they simply cannot -- they do not have the wherewithal to pay.",
  "What about you -- you stressed that this falls on the civil side. So, why shouldn't we take Rule 54(d) as our model and say that instructs the court that you give parties the relief to which they are entitled, even if they haven't asked for that relief, even if they've asked for something that they can't get?",
  "Do we have any -- any computation about what it would be -- what the counsel fee would be, as opposed to keeping someone in prison for a year?",
  "It also said that there's a relaxed standard of causation. I think that's what Justice Kennedy is referring to when he said \"proximate cause light.\" But we have said in more than one case that there is a relaxed standard of causation in FELA cases. Was that wrong?",
  "It has nothing to do with the line of cases I think in the '40s in the FELA cases where the message of this Court seemed to be quite clear, FELA cases go to juries? There are a number of cases with reverse dissents that seem to -- to say just that.",
  "Well, what -- can you explain to me -- I mean, here the judge charged in the words of the statute, and they are also the words used in the model Federal instruction: Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in part from the railroad's negligence? You would say: Was plaintiff's injury proximately caused. And as you no doubt know, Mr. Rothfeld, that term \"proximate cause,\" it just loses juries. So considering that these cases go to the jury, what do you say to the instruction that's now given, based on the words of the statute, \"Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or part from the railroad's negligence\"? What should the judge charge instead of that?",
  "Well, maybe explain the difference. I mean, you were answering my question, and I asked how would you tell the jury? You said it's okay to say: Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in part from the railroad's negligence, but the judge must say something more. So what is the something more?",
  "Natural, probable, and foreseeable?",
  "Could you give some examples of what causes would be proximate and what causes would not so qualify? Something that's -- you said but-for is no good. So what would be a but-for cause but not a proximate cause?",
  "And the spelling out is natural, probable, and foreseeable?",
  "Are there any -- any negligence-type statutes? I mean this one, I mean, it's odd to say that the judge erred in reading to the jury the words of the statute, did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in part from railroad negligence. All that Federal statutes, negligence statutes that use the word \"proximate\" -­",
  "But you said your defense at trial was not about causation, it was no negligence, right?",
  "Mr. Frederick, suppose a juror says, We wouldn't -- goes to the judge and says, We would like to have an explanation of, what does it mean that the injury results in whole or in part from the railroad's negligence? What would the judge respond?",
  "We have three justices of this Court that say Rogers is irrelevant because it had to do only with multiple causes.",
  "They -- they -- they did ask for proximate cause?",
  "Mr. Maurer, you -- you don't have any objection, you wouldn't have any objection, if Arizona trebled the amount at the outset? In other words, there was a maximum amount, the so-called matching funds; if it were given all in one lump and the publicly funded candidate was told, give it back if you don't use it, that would be okay?",
  "How about not under Buckley?",
  "I thought that the point of Buckley was that the public funding, which you can accept or reject, the justification for it was that it increased rather than decreased speech. And the -- I think you were quite right in recognizing that matching funds, this Court has said, do not conflict with the -­ with the First Amendment.",
  "Not matching funds. Public funding.",
  "Public funding. And so if it turns out that the States -- public funding isn't being used because -- because the limits are low, and yet the, the State wants to conserve the public fisc. So instead of just increasing the amount at the outset, it says the -- the -- the object is the same, but we're economizing by not giving it out in one lump sum, we're giving it out in installments.",
  "What about all the background, there had been a number of scandals in Arizona, there had been vote buying? I thought that that was part of the origin of this law, was not as you now say had nothing to do with corruption. I thought it emerged out of that, those startling incidents of people actually selling their votes.",

  "Is there any responsibility if you -- the numbers are what has been left out so far. The company gets reports month after month showing that women are disproportionately passed over for promotion, and there is a pay gap between men and women doing the same job. It happens not once, but twice. Isn't there some responsibility on the company to say, is gender discrimination at work, and if it is, isn't there an obligation to stop it?",
  "Mr. Boutrous, there was a case, it was in the '70s, and it was a class action against AT&T for, I think, promotion into middle management. What was at issue there was a part -- a test, part objective, but then in the end, the final step was a so-called total person test, and women disproportionately flunked at that total person. And the idea wasn't at all complicated. It was that most people prefer themselves; and so, a decisionmaker, all other things being equal, would prefer someone that looked like him. And that was found, that total -- the application of that total person concept was found to be a violation of Title VII. This sounds quite similar. I mean, it's not just -- it's not subjective. You have an expert -- I know you have some questions about that expert -- but the expert saying that gender bias can creep into a system like that simply because of the natural phenomenon that people tend to feel comfortable with people like themselves.",
  "I thought that -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that this district judge said that -- that the absent class members would get notice and have an opportunity to -- to opt out. So, a -- a plaintiff, a member of the class who wants to go for compensation instead of just back pay could opt out.",
  "Isn't this something that would be -- I mean, this -- we're not just talking about getting your foot in the door. We're talking about certifying the class, and you may well lose on every one of these points, but -- but the 23(a) standards, they're not supposed to be very difficult to overcome. It's just a common question of fact -­",
  "-- that dominates at that -­",
  "But what seems to me is a very serious problem in this case is: How do you work out the back pay? You say -- we get through the 23(a) threshold. We got class certified under 23(b)(2). And the judge says, there's no way I could possibly try each of these individuals. So, we're going to do it how? How are they going to calculate the back pay?",
  "The district judge didn't think so. Didn't the district judge say that in awarding back pay some would get a windfall and others would be uncompensated?",
  "I thought -- I thought his point was not simply that some women were not underpaid, but women, if you had an individual case, the employer might show this person could have been fired, disciplined, and wasn't owed any back pay, not that she compares favorably to a -- a male peer, but that she wouldn't have gotten any pay at all.",
  "I thought, didn't the district judge say because of the numbers we couldn't -­ couldn't possibly have the hearing in each case on whether the particular woman was owed back pay? They did say something about this.",
  "I thought he said \"impossible.\"",

  "One thing you haven't touched on is to -- to have, first of all the question of whether (b)(2) is limited to injunction and declaratory relief.",
  "But if -- if you follow the advisory committee's note, then if dollars -- if damages predominates -- if damages predominate, then you can't use (b)(2). You have to make your case under (b)(3); and the one factor here is that about half the class is gone, so -- they're not interested in injunctive relief, but everybody's interested in money. So, why isn't the money -- why do you say that the -­ that the injunction -- injunctive relief is the thing and the damages are lesser, rather than the other way around?",

  "No, it was in the -- at the cert stage as well.",
  "The Federal agency says that these suits complement, they're not at odds with, the Federal regime, because they give the manufacturers an incentive to come forward. Everyone is interested in making sure that only safe drugs are marketed. So, far from detracting from the Federal regime, the agency responsible says, this helps us; it encourages manufacturers to report.",

  "And at least for those people, they have the means.",
  "The government is taking the position that there's no clash between the government, the State, and Federal law. It's not saying that you commit some kind of Federal offense if you don't file this law. The government is saying, the question is preemption. Is there a clash between Federal and State law to traditional Federal warn you have a preemption defense if you tell the FDA, and if either the FDA does nothing or tells you, no, we're not going to change the label?",
  "The -- the -- Buckman was about, was a -- it was a very odd case to be brought under State law for fraud on a Federal agency.",
  "Doesn't it say something about feasible? It -- it doesn't -- it doesn't give free choice entirely. It says -- what are the words? That the -- the interconnection doesn't have to be put just anyplace if it's not feasible or it's undue expense or something to that effect.",
  "That's why it's only technically feasible, because the economic burden is -- is not on the company. It has to provide it at the place if it's technically feasible, but it doesn't pay for it.",
  "Mr. Miller, would you, before you sit down, explain what is the Government's position when an agency is asked to file a brief? The Sixth Circuit asked -- invited the FCC to file a brief, it did, and then the Sixth Circuit disagreed.

  "It would be hard to argue, Mr. Hungar, that it makes no sense, but it made sense to Cardozo and Judge Rich.",
  "But just taking RCA itself, Cardozo said through all the verbal variances there runs this common core of thought and truth, that one otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent bears -- upon its face, bears a heavy burden of persuasion and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance.",
  "Then you -- then you have to be saying that Judge Rich got it wrong because he does deal with the -­",
  "It's -- it -- it is true that the Federal Circuit has been consistent now since almost the beginning, since that court came on the scene, and it does have a monopoly on appeal in patent cases since 1984. Because the -- the Federal Circuit has consistently taken this position, one would have expected that there would have been bills proposed to change it. Were there any?",
  "Mr. Hungar, could we go back to the statute that was enacted in 1952. Before that the burden of proof on the issue of validity of the patent or the effect of the patent, that was on the challenger. So when Congress added a presumption of validity, it must have had in mind something more than the defendant would have the burden of proof and the normal standard is preponderance. So by adding a presumption of validity, must Congress have intended to do something more than simply repeat that the defendant has the burden of proof?",
  "How actively do we acquiesce?",
  "Would you agree, looking to Judge Rich's opinions, that it would have been in order for the judge to instruct, if the judge had been asked to do so, that the evidence would carry more weight if it hadn't been presented, defendant's evidence would carry more weight if it hadn't been presented to the Patent Office?",
  "But -- but why -- why -­ why not, Mr. Waxman? If the whole reason for this extra deference, for this clear and convincing standard is a Patent Office is expert and so we defer juries similarly to defer to their judgment, but if they haven't judged anything, what is the justification for continuing to have the clear and convincing standard?",
  "But it is strange, isn't it, that they can take rehabilitation into account for the supervised release. I mean, that -- that's a provision, isn't it? As far as supervised release is concerned, the judge can take account of rehabilitation in setting the length of the term, but can't do that for the prison time.",
  "Well, how do we -­",
  "-- can we know that when the government -- didn't the government ask for 63 months?",
  "And the judge came up with something in between those two?",
  "Prisons have multiple treatment programs.",
  "And they have vocational treatment. Do you -- are you relying at all on the fact that in the supervised release term, the judge can say this man or this woman needs rehabilitation, and I want this program for her, but in the prison setting, the judge, this judge -- as the colloquy with Justice Scalia showed, this judge wanted her to be in the program, but she never got into it because the judge has no control?",
  "I could follow your argument much better if the judge could say that this specialized program -- as I am making that a term of your incarceration. The disturbing factor about your argument is the judge can only recommend; the judge has no way of making sure that this person will be in prison longer and get the treatment the -- the judge wants, because the judge can't control where the person will serve her sentence and what treatment will be available for her.",
  "Wasn't there something -­ you responded that she didn't -- she said I'd rather not. But wasn't there something about placing her with -- in the same facility as another inmate? Wasn't that involved?",
  "But wouldn't your proposal lead to unevenness in sentencing? If you -- if you're right, then this choice of extending a term to accommodate a drug program, that could be -- the judge would have the option. I think nearly half of the people who are incarcerated have a drug addiction. So one judge might say: I'm not going to let that person out until they -- they should at least have a chance to get into this program. And another will say: I can't control that; I'm not going to subject -- you would be introducing that, just what the framers of the Reform Act were trying to get away from, that this swings from one judge to another, and you're dealing with almost half the prison population.",
  "If you have -- if you have the precedent of Massachusetts v. EPA and if any one plaintiff has standing, I guess that's enough. So if you look at standing alone, it seems to me the States would have standing on the same basis that Massachusetts had standing.",
  "I thought your -- your first argument when you addressed this issue was there is a decisionmaker and that decisionmaker is EPA. So you wouldn't get to even how arduous a task this would be if it was within the court's bailiwick. I thought your position was that the function, this regulatory function, has been assigned to the EPA and not to the courts.",
  "EPA couldn't give -­ could EPA give that relief? We're dealing with existing stationary sources. We're not dealing with new or modified sources.",
  "More than that, Newdow was a case of a father trying to assert a right on behalf of a child, and the child herself did not want that right nor did her mother. So it seems to me it's worlds apart, and when you describe prudential standing as involving generalized grievance, I thought that the generalized grievance was Article III. I thought that's what Mrs. Frothingham's case was about; it was a grievance that she shared with everybody in the populations, so she didn't have standing.",
  "To that extent you disagree with Mr. Keisler because he says there is no Article III?",
  "Can we get to -- to the situation that now exists? They are seeking standards for existing sources. I asked Mr. Keisler, and do you agree with him, this is not a -- this is not a new source or a modified source; we're talking about existing sources. Does EPA, could EPA, regulate and set standards for existing sources?",
  "It's not an area where the Court can't go. To take a political question we all agree on, I think, the courts can't mess with the impeachment of a president, just -- but here the Court does deal with the subject matter all the time. It reviews decisions that the EPA has made.",
  "General Underwood, the -­ the relief that you're seeking, asking a court to set standards for emissions, sounds like the kind of thing that EPA does. I mean, Congress set up the EPA to promulgate standards for emissions, and now what -- the relief you're seeking seems to me to set up a district judge, who does not have the resources, the expertise, as a kind of super EPA.",
  "But if we just concentrate on I think the relief you want, you say: District court, if we pass everything else, you set emissions standards, you put a cap immediately, you set a cap, and then annually you require further reductions. Well, that just sounds to me like what EPA does when it sets emission standards.",
  "The agency -- the agency is engaged in that, in it right now, and that's another facet of this case, the potential for conflict. The EPA, after acting for a while, has now agreed that it does have authority to classify this as a pollutant and it has taken the first steps. One argument that the EPA -- that the United States is presenting is the way agencies go about this is incrementally, so they're starting with motor vehicles and then maybe they will go to new sources, and then they'll get to maybe where you are. But you want the Court to start with the existing sources, to set limits that may be in conflict with what an existing agency is doing. Do we ignore the fact that the EPA is there and that it is regulating in this area?",
  "Your point is that EPA, unless and until EPA gets to the point of setting standards for existing sources, the court can be side by side with the agency; we know that the agency is beginning, it starts with light motor vehicles, and then it's moving forward. But you say as long as the EPA hasn't gotten to stationary sources, the court can be conducting a similar function with -- one of many differences is that if the EPA is setting the standards they will set -- they will do it through notice and comment, everybody will be able to put in a submission; but the court substituting for the EPA, how does the court replicate that notice and comment process?",
  "But now there is an agency, and we know that it operates in a certain way, through notice and comment rulemaking.",
  "And here is the court and how does it operate to get to those standards?",
  "One aspect of the litigation process as opposed to the agency process, the agency makes its rule and that can be challenged in court, but suppose your plaintiffs lost this case on merits. I take it this is not a class action, there's no certification of any class. Other plaintiffs before another district court could launch a similar action against these very same defendants, right? There would be nothing to preclude that?",
  "That means you have -­",
  "Mr. Shah, you might want to make your third point. You said you had three points preliminarily, so why don't you make your third point and then respond to the question.",
  "Mr. Shah, you don't have to take a position on that, because you don't represent a private trustee. And the government can accept arguendo that there would be such a relationship, but I don't think you have to defend it.",
  "Mr. Shah -­",

I mean, from what you said so far, on the one hand you recognize that it is what we call a guardian, the guardian-ward relationship between the United States and the tribe.

Is that -- is that it or is it a more nebulous interest?",

In Riggs, the -­ case, right?",
  "You make a distinction, I -- I take it, between attorney-client privilege and work product. Initially, you were seeking both on the theory that the tribe is in fact the client, but apparently you are not pressing that point any more about work product?",
  "The government is maintaining throughout that it wears two hats. On the one hand it is a guardian or a trustee, and on the other hand it is the sovereign. So it's the latter, the government's claim that it is the sovereign, that makes the difference, it's not the -­",
  "Mr. Boies, how would it work in your view of the case? That is, you say that the loss, what's been called loss causation, is not something to be decided at the certification stage, but at the trial or summary judgment. Well, how -- how would the plaintiff class prove loss causation? Given the reliance hurdle that you have surmounted, now you're in -- you have your class certified; how does the class prove loss causation.",
  "The way the Fifth Circuit wrote the decision, the Fifth Circuit seems to be saying: Plaintiffs, you didn't show an initially false representation; and you, you plaintiff, didn't show a -­ a corrective statement that caused a price drop. As I read the Fifth Circuit's decision, it says: Plaintiff, you failed to prove one of the two things that you would have to prove. And you say: No, they really put the burden on -- on defendants, Fifth Circuit put the burden on defendant and found that defendant had met it instead of the other way around?",
  "But your -- your argument seems to say, to -- to get a class certified you have to virtually prove your case on the merits. You -- you leave almost nothing over. I mean, if you've won the class action certification on your basis and you've shown the material misleading and the price dropped as a consequence, the efficient market first -- you've shown all that, what else is left on the merits? You win on the merits if you win certification.",

So it is -- it is the State's current position that for this offense the maximum is 10 years.",

  "Mr. Gordon, is this -- is this essentially an academic question? Because this district judge said that he would impose the same sentence as a variant even if he couldn't do it under the guidelines, even if it were an incorrect calculation.

So isn't that -- I mean, isn't this an -- an exercise, essentially an academic exercise, if -- if your -- your client would end up in the same place?",
  "I'm -- I'm not sure what you're urging now. Are -- are you modifying or retracting the answer you gave to Justice Sotomayor, that is, the case where the maximum was 5 years, but then at the time of the Federal offense the State has changed it so it's 10 years? I -- I think you answered her question that it would work the same way, that what mattered is how the State currently ranks the offense, not the offender. But now you seem to be saying there might be a different answer when the State increases rather than decreases the penalty.",

  "Well, maybe -- maybe the Attorney General doesn't have that power. But your position is that whether this behavior, not registering, is criminal or not is left up to the Attorney General, is left up to the executive.

So, are we talking about, is this case simply about the period from February 1907 to August 1908, and that's -- that's all that's involved in this case, only those people? Or are you contesting that after August 1908, you still have some kind of claim?",
  "So, it's -- so, this whole case is about what happens between February '07 and August '08, and that's the limit of it.",

So, you would have had no challenge, not from the date of SORNA's enactment, but from the date of the rule that you're challenging -- and that rule was February '07. Your challenge is to the invalidity of the interim rule, right?",
  "Okay. So -- but before there was an interim rule, you would have no such challenge.",
  "You might have some other case, but this case is about a challenge to a rule as invalid. Is that -- that's as I understand it. So, there had to be the rule for you to make the challenge.",

  "But I'm talking about SORNA has been enacted, and now he's moving after SORNA is enacted, right?",
  "Okay. So -- so, SORNA is on the books. He's registered in Missouri. He's leaving the State. To comply with SORNA, what does he have to do other than tell the original State, I'm moving to another State?",

  "That was the answer that you gave to my question, which was the same thing: Why isn't it sufficient now for him simply to tell his parole officer he's moving?",
  "But those were under Missouri law, not under the Federal statute.",

In 2255 proceedings, counsel will be appointed only if the court determines that the interests of justice so require. So, the proposition you're urging would have ramifications in the Federal system as well, wouldn't it?",
  "And so, 2255 would no longer be the interests of justice so require because if it's your first opportunity to raise the point, the court must appoint counsel for you. That's your view?",

So, go to the trial judge with this Anders type brief that doesn't raise ineffective assistance of counsel, but it's such an obvious claim to make that when the -- when the judge reviews that Anders brief, if the trial judge thought that this defendant was abysmally represented, wouldn't the -- wouldn't the court say: Sorry, I'm not going to accept this Anders brief. It seems to me that you - - there was a flagrant ineffective assistance of counsel, and you should have raised that. That's a -- that's a viable issue. So, I'm not going to accept your brief. I mean - -",
  "So, if the judge reviews the Anders brief, really thought there was an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a valid one, the judge would have spotted the issue, and it would have been -- and it would have been argued on that first - -",
  "Yes. In the Martinez case, there was an Anders brief, right?",
  "Doesn't the trial court -- I mean, the excuse -- the excuse of counsel is not automatic; the trial judge has to look at it and say, yes, there's -- there's no issue for you to pursue; so, I'm going to excuse you.",
  "And how much time.",
  "How much time -- in the procedure you described, appointed counsel does inform Martinez: I'm not bringing up any -- any claims for you. So, if you want to pursue relief, you have to do so on your own. How much time would the defendant have? How much time remained?",
  "Would you explain to me, why don't we consider this adverse to your proceeding, because this postconviction proceeding -- it began and it began at the same time as the direct appeal, but it ended before this case became final. So, it was the first -- it was the first tier because it was decided before the direct appeal.",
  "Disclaimed to who? To -- I mean, how could a clerk be expected to know that the local counsel really isn't taking any part? I mean -- so was the disclaimer to the clerk?",
  "You said that even before that. In the rule -- you said the Rule 32 -- didn't you say something about -- the -- the notice that went from the prosecutor to Maples did not go to the local counsel, right?",
  "Did the -- did the prosecutor -- I'm not talking about the clerk now. The prosecutor had a filing in connection with the Rule 32 motion. Did the prosecutor send that to, well, everybody? Maples and everybody?",
  "But you seem not to rely on what the State as prosecutor did. It seemed to me the State as prosecutor was recognizing that Maples had no counsel; therefore, sent -- said you'd better file your habeas; this is how much time you have -- sent it just to him.",
  "But in the -- in the practice of a law firm, these were very junior people. Wouldn't the law firm have to have some involvement in giving them permission to provide this representation? I mean, usually there's something like a pro bono committee and a higher level. Can -- can such junior associates just go ahead and say, we want to spend a lot of our time defending a man on death row? Wouldn't they have to get some kind of permission?",
  "We do know, though, that they were not counsel of record.",
  "So, we know that the two who were listed as counsel of record --",
  "-- were not representing him, and they hadn't told the court.",
  "Mr. Neiman, I think we're blurring two issues. We're not talking about abandonment in this respect. We're talking about notice going to no one, and a -- and a clock ticking from a certain date that no one knows about. I mean, they were preparing for a hearing before this judge. So they weren't anticipating that he was going to rule without anything further.",
  "But as far as -- as far the record shows, De Leeuw is not on the record at all. There were three counsel of record. Two of them -- well, let's go back to this -- this -- the first issue. The State by its own conduct showed it didn't regard Butler as any kind of representative, because it didn't even send its Rule 32 response to Butler; isn't that so?",
  "What about --",
  "What about the notice that he's -- he had lost in the Alabama court and he'd better, if he wants to go to the Federal court, do something about it? That notice went only to Maples, right?",
  "And Mr. Garre made the point that if Maples were represented, that that would be improper, to -- to send a notice to Maples alone. So, the -- so, the State's attorney must have thought that Maples had been abandoned by his lawyers because he didn't notify any of them.",
  "But we do know they weren't counsel of record. We do know that the only two counsel of record were no longer representing him, and he had no reason to know that they weren't, but they were not -- they couldn't represent him. The two -- the only two out-of-town counsel were the two who disabled themselves from representing him by taking other jobs.",
  "So, there was no one from Sullivan & Cromwell other than those two on the record. So, on the record, they had abandoned him, and there was no substitute.",
  "Did you -- did you oppose it? Did the State oppose the out-of-time appeal?",
  "When -- when lawyers stop representing a client, as the two did, isn't there some obligation of them to tell the client and the court, we're no longer representing you, and arrange for substitutions? There were never any substitutions on the record of the other counsel. The record said these two people are representing Maples, and those two weren't. They never told the court, and they never told Maples. Isn't there some obligation on -- on their part to the court when they stop representing a client to advise the court?",
  "Then why did they -- why did they send to Maples alone the notice, you'd better file your Federal habeas? They didn't send it to those counsel. Where did they -- what made them send it -- send that notice directly to Maples and not to either of the Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers?",
  "Why is a per se rule necessarily what is being argued here? For one thing, he had no choice but to go with the police, right?",
  "So, it's different from some cases where the prisoner initiates the conversation.",
  "And it doesn't make any difference that they -- they took him from his cell, he was under compulsion to leave with them and interrogated during the hours when prisoners are ordinarily sleeping?",
  "If he were out and the police officer said, come along with us, he could say no. But here he didn't -- he didn't have that choice.",
  "Is it -- is the time relevant, that this was done -- they took him away at 7:00 in the evening and kept him for 7 hours?",
  "Well, they -- that didn't do him any good, because he couldn't get back to his cell without being escorted there.",
  "I thought that there was no discussion of the \"in custody\" point in Mathis. It was assumed that they were in custody, and the issue was whether he could be questioned about a crime other than the one for which he was being held.",
  "I thought you were going back to Miranda itself, which says in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.",
  "So -- and I think you repeated the phrase from -- from Miranda that what the Court was aiming at was incommunicado interrogation of an individual in a police-dominated atmosphere. The question is whether the Court has modified what Miranda said in -- in that regard.",
  "This Court, this Court, because this Court now seems to assume that it must be in custody and not -- not otherwise deprived of action, that being in custody is essential.",
  "Yes, I think you did.",
  "Well, their question -- the question is, is the person entitled to Miranda warnings? And the argument has been that they're not entitled to Miranda warnings unless you're in custody. They say: You want to have a per se rule for in custody; that is, if you're taken out of your cell and put in another place under police guard and questioned.",
  "There's no indication that he told -- that he told the --",
  "-- officers that he needed medication.",
  "You said that Congress can set a time limit. In this case, we're dealing with, let's say, Aaron Copeland, who gets the benefit of copyright, and Congress says: No, we think Shostakovich should be treated just like Copeland. Yes, we took care of our own when we weren't part of the world community, but now we are. And so, all that Congress is doing is giving Shostakovich works the same limited time as Aaron Copeland. And why does that violate the limited-time prescription?",
  "But the person -- the person we're talking about, the work we're talking about, never got the first limit. There was no -- there was no time, there was no time when that work could have been protected. So, why isn't it consistent with the Copyright Clause to say, you are entitled to limited time protection? We're not talking about a case where you've had the protection, enjoyed it, and then it expired, and then Congress says we'd like -- we like your work so much we're going to give you another term. What's affected here are people who were unprotected. And Congress says we think that they should have a limited time.",
  "They didn't get the equivalent of what a U.S. author -- but let's take the large category, because it's the ones that you feature. You're talking about Shostakovich, Stravinski, and I say, well, what's wrong with giving them the same time that Aaron Copeland got?",
  "That's not a limited time. That's saying you have no time.",
  "But it has to have a beginning, too. And that's -- for these people who were unprotected, because we didn't recognize their copyright, there's no beginning.",
  "I can understand your argument that the public domain is untouchable. I'm not sure I get that from the Constitution. That says to secure to authors for a limited time the exclusive right. That -- that's talking about what you can secure to authors. So, I don't see why using the words of the Constitution, to secure to authors for a limited time, Congress can't say: We want every author to have a limited time.",
  "The foreign works that we didn't give -- we're not treating them any better. They don't get a different startup date, but they get the same end date as our own authors.",
  "We're not talking about expiration dates. So, I'd like you to concentrate --",
  "That's not -- that's not -- none of these -- none of these copyrights have been extended beyond their expiration date. They just weren't protected.",
  "But is it -- that is -- that is not --",
  "That is most distinctly not before this case. So, please let's not talk about a copyright that has been protected, has expired, and Congress wants to revive it. We are concentrating on what Congress did to bring us into compliance with the worldwide system, and it's saying: We're giving a limited time to these authors.",
  "They never had a limited time before.",
  "Did anyone in the same -- the same -- published the same year as De Tocqueville, a U.S. author, that would have a copyright protection today?",
  "I gave the example of Aaron Copeland versus Shostakovich. Let's go back to De Tocqueville. Who has a copyright who published in, what, 18 -- what was it?",
  "Yes.",
  "I think you gave an analogy to the statute of limitations, and I thought you were quite right about that. You can extend the statute of limitations before it's expired, but once it's expired, it's over. The problem with you using that as an analogy is that there was a beginning. Time ran out, and you're trying to deal with a situation here where you say, you know, the time was limited for the U.S. work, but it's unlimited, that you -- you cannot treat the foreign work -- you cannot give it a limited time, the same limited time that you would give a U.S. work. You're saying these people had no time, and they may never get time.",
  "But it isn't -- it isn't quite --",
  "-- quite so because there are these examples of the people who couldn't get copyright because of wartime both after -- after both World War I and World War II, and -- so, those people were allowed to get the protection that they couldn't get because of the war.",
  "That's presupposing that they're all going to give notice.",
  "At the time we joined Berne, there was an appreciation that we deferred the article 18 issue. There wasn't any -- anyone who said that we satisfied it.",
  "Well, there were many people who read article 18 in a different way, and Congress was later persuaded that that was right.",
  "They -- they found that compliance with article 18 was appropriate for us to become a full member of the international copyright community.",
  "All this rides on accepting your argument that zero is a limited time.",
  "Would you say it was would required by TRIPS?",
  "Is it not so that if we don't comply with Berne 18, then we are subject to being sanctioned by some World Trade Organization --",
  "Mr. Laycock, would you clarify one point? You say the church decides who's qualified to be a minister, but, as I understand the facts here, she was never decommissioned as a minister, and, beyond that, she was even recommended by the officials to other parishes to be a commissioned minister. So, it's -- it's odd to say there's any interferences with who is qualified to be a minister, because the church was holding her out as being qualified.",
  "But I thought your position would be if she's a commissioned minister, as distinguished from a teacher who conducts grace or takes the class to chapel. I'm -- I take it the Chief is asking for somebody in this -- that you categorize as a minister, although mostly she's a math teacher. You would say the extent of her religious duties don't matter; what counts is that she is commissioned as a minister.",
  "I thought that it was part of -- it was agreed that there was no fact dispute that what she did, her duties at the school, did not change from when she was a contract teacher, and therefore not a minister, and then she takes courses and is qualified to become a minister, but what she's doing at the school is the very same thing. And I thought that was the basis for the -- the decision that we're reviewing, that there was no difference at all in what she did before she was commissioned and after she was commissioned.",
  "But you're isolating one parish, but there was something in one of these briefs that said the majority of the teachers in the Lutheran schools -- let's see where it was. I think it was - -",
  "Is it -- is it in the handbook? I mean, one of the objections -- if this - - if this is a rule that's going to bind the teachers, then you would expect to find it in the handbook. But the handbook doesn't tell her, if you complain to the EEOC about discrimination, then you will be fired.",
  "Mr. Laycock, you, in order, I think, to dispel the notion that nothing is permitted, in your reply brief you say there are many suits that could be brought that would not be inappropriate. And I think it's on page 20 of your reply brief. But I don't understand how those would work if the policy is you're a minister; if you have quarrels with the church or a co-worker, we have our own dispute resolution, and you don't go outside. But you say tort arising from unsafe working conditions. Suppose one of these commissioned workers said, I think that there are unsafe working conditions and I'm going to complain to the Occupational Health and Safety Agency. And wouldn't she get the same answer: This has to be solved in-house. You don't go to an agency of the state. Why -- I don't follow why the tort claim based on unsafe working conditions would not fall under the same ban on -- keeping disputes in-house?",
  "But I thought the reason that she was unfit for the ministry was that she went outside the house.",
  "So, in all of these cases, you go outside the church, you go to the government, then you have a - -",
  "But she could -- she could be -- for any of these things, she could be disciplined, fired because she complained outside the house.",
  "The tort claim could proceed, and then she would get damages, and that would be all right?",
  "Did you say -- did I understand you before, in response to Justice Sotomayor and Justice Scalia, that even if she were merely a contract teacher, the fact that she teaches religion classes would be enough for her to qualify for the ministerial exception?",
  "Is the clincher in this case, but even -- I think you answered if she were not a commissioned minister, she's teaching the faith; therefore, she can be fired, and it doesn't matter whether she's commissioned. So, the commission is irrelevant. It's -- it's her job duties that count.",
  "Now, it was certainly for some purposes. I mean, if every teacher who teaches religion and math and a lot of other things said, I'm a minister and I'm entitled to the parsonage allowance on my income tax return, certainly that's something that a government agent would review.",
  "How many accountants go to platforms?",
  "But if that -- if that's what Congress meant, then the emphasis should be on is this person one who regularly works on the outer continental shelf. And the -- this worker, we're told, was on the outer continental shelf 98 percent of the time.",
  "I thought your brief, your reply brief, said you -- you superimpose a status test. You have the situs of the injury, and then you superimpose status. So, your test is not simple state of -- place of injury.",
  "Mr. Clement, if your position is right, then we have a worker who most of the time is doing work on a platform, and he will be covered or not depending on whether the injury occurred on the shelf or on the land. So, it's -- the other view is to say what this person does most of the time is what counts. Then this worker would always be covered by OCSLA. And if you take your view, then one will be covered by OCSLA; another one who is doing the same job is covered by a State -- a State -- you have a variety of State workers' compensation laws as opposed to a uniform law governing workers of this kind.",
  "Mr. Clement, may I go back to -- you referred to Herb's Welding, but that was a case -- it was a claim under the Longshore Act, not an OCSLA claim, and the Court said it was expressing no opinion on whether 1332(b) covered the injury.",
  "But Congress also did not adopt the proposal, the specific proposal to confine OCSLA to situations in which State workers' compensation was unavailable.",
  "Is there any injury on land in the course of employment that would not be covered by OCSLA where we have a worker of this kind that -- who spends 98 percent of his time on the outer continental shelf -- the injury, however, is on land? Is there any case where such a worker who predominantly works on the outer continental shelf would not be covered by OCSLA in your view?",
  "So, then what you're really saying is -- it's not your test, but really the Government's saying we look to see, is this person dominantly working on the outer continental shelf?",
  "You -- you're talking about the Chandris standard that the seaman's relationship to the vessel must be substantial in nature and duration - -",
  "And that's a kind of a vague -- what's substantial? It's the same problem we have here. What is the - -",
  "Yes. So, how have courts worked this out? What is a substantial relation to the vessel?",
  "But why -- why doesn't Congress know? Because I think States overwhelmingly would include outer continental shelf workers in their compensation scheme.",
  "It would make sense to use the Longshore Act because they wanted to have the same level of compensation.",
  "No. No, no. They wanted the OCSLA worker to have the same benefits as the longshore worker.",
  "But Respondents said you could.",
  "Respondents in their brief said that if you had sought postconviction relief in the State courts, then you could have argued Gray was the controlling decision, and they would have accepted that Gray --",
  "Well, apparently the Pennsylvania Supreme Court thought that he hadn't properly raised it. I mean, they initially granted review post-Gray, and then they found that the grant was improvident most likely because Greene had not raised the -- the Gray issue below.",
  "Not as of the date they made it.",
  "Why?",
  "Because the statute says adjudication resulted in a decision. And the decision, the only decision, is the Pennsylvania Superior Court, because there was a non-decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Resulted -- that is -- in a decision that was. It didn't say \"is.\" I mean, you would have a much stronger argument if it had read \"resulted in a decision that is contrary.\" But when it says \"was,\" that sounds like at the time of the adjudication.",
  "Mr. Fisher, what about the -- well, the purpose of AEDPA was to require the Federal courts to respect the State courts' decision. And there's only been one decision in this picture, and that decision was the Pennsylvania Superior Court. And we are not giving much respect to that decision, which did not have the benefit of Gray, if we're going to say, no, we have to look at that decision as though Gray were already on the books.",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't understand the problem. If you look at the Pennsylvania Superior Court decision and say, as of that time, the -- there was no violation of any clearly established law, period. Why is that complicated?",
  "What's left of it?",
  "Mr. McConnell, you started with the notion that the disclosure provision in the statute is meant to apply to ordinary people, and if an ordinary person not schooled in the law read \"you have a right to sue,\" wouldn't they understand that to mean I have a right to sue in court?",
  "But the -- the Act in Gilmer did not designate court action or right to sue as a right within the non-waivable provision.",
  "No, if this were written to be read by and understood by lawyers, I think you would have a stronger argument. But this is meant for consumers, and they read \"you have a right to sue, and that right is not waivable.\" A right to sue -- they're not going to think about cause of action. They don't know what cause of action is. But they do know that a right to sue is a right to bring a lawsuit.",
  "Is that in -- is that in the statute? Or is it just a colloquial - -",
  "Yes, but Title VII doesn't say \"right to sue.\" It's a name that the agency uses, but it's not -- it's not in the statute. The statute doesn't say you have a right to sue.",
  "Except that this is not what the parties decide. These are take it or leave it contracts. So, the consumer doesn't really elect arbitration. It's just presented as part of the terms that the consumer can take or leave and not negotiated.",
  "It's a question of whether we take that into account in -- in determining what \"you have a right to sue\" means.",
  "What else is non-waivable besides the 3 days to back out?",
  "Would your position of right to a lawsuit -- would that extend to a post-dispute genuinely bargained-for right to arbitrate?",
  "Another argument that is made, in opposition to your position, is that the statute says any waiver of any protection or right may not be enforced by any court or any other person. And the suggestion is \"any other person\" must contemplate an alternate dispute method that doesn't involve court - - court or any other person.",
  "But you -- but this arbitration agreement precludes class actions, doesn't it?",
  "Well, Mr. Nelson just said no, that their position doesn't suggest that, when I asked him about post-dispute and he brought up settlement as well. He said that their interpretation does not exclude a settlement in which the plaintiff agrees - -",
  "And the violent felony -­ the violent felony in this case, he had a suspended sentence, didn't he?",
  "When you say a sharp change, I think that this is a very confusing set of decisions. And the Wadud case that was brought up before has a footnote that says that -- that the board had stated a waiver of inadmissibility may be granted in deportation if the alien was excludable as a result of the same facts. And then that footnote ends: \"We shall withdraw from that language in each of these cases.\"",
  "What about the comparability of the crime involved in St. Cyr? That was a drug offense. Does the inadmissibility criterion -- does that accord with the one for deportation?",
  "So that -- there the linguistic comparison works, right?",
  "Is -- is there any aggravated felony crime of violence that is not a crime involving moral turpitude?",
  "Was Judulang's crime a crime involving violence?",
  "I mean a crime of moral turpitude.",
  "What -- what -­",
  "But what your position means that it's up to the agency -- up to the person who makes the charge, because take Mr. Judulang, he could have been categorized as deportable because he committed a crime involving moral turpitude, or he could have been categorized as somebody who committed an aggravated felony. It is then totally in the hands of the person who is making the charge whether there will be a match or not.",
  "But that doesn't -- if the -- if the officer labels the manslaughter in this case a crime involving moral turpitude, then there's a match -­",
  "And if he labels it aggravated felony crime of violence, then there's no match. So, it's up to the charger whether there will be this match or not.",
  "Then -- then you have to say, yes, you can have somebody who would get a waiver of inadmissibility for a crime and the very next day be put in deportation without any waiver for that same crime.",
  "But I'm giving you -­",
  "-- these categories -­",
  "These categories.",
  "Mr. Gannon, in your brief, I thought you'd conceded that.",
  "That -- just the example that Justice Sotomayor gave. Somebody is declared inadmissible because it's a crime. This manslaughter or aggravated felony crime of violence is on the admissibility side a crime involving moral turpitude. So, he's allowed in. And then he's in and he's declared deportable, and he can't get a waiver because there's no analogue. I thought your brief said, yes, that's the consequence of our argument; however, prosecutors would not seek deportation if inadmissibility had been waived.",
  "Right.",
  "But he also said that there are only two grounds for deportation that have no analogue in the grounds for exclusion.",
  "Entry without inspection and firearms conviction.",
  "Do you apply the reasonable suspicion rule to all arrestees? I thought you were making a distinction between felons and less serious offenders.",
  "To do -- to do what?",
  "You just said that strip naked is different from a strip search.",
  "So, what is permitted? There are various things. One is showering in the presence of officers?",
  "They -- they can be inspected without their clothes; just nothing more than that?",
  "No, I want to know what's permitted.",
  "One, not the other?",
  "But less intrusive than the one -- the search in Bell v. Wolfish, which involved pretrial detainees?",
  "Do we know if the pretrial detainees in Bell were also inspected on entry into the facility?",
  "But you are trying to state the constitutional rule, and you keep talking about what is their rule, and we're trying to find out what are the limits -­",
  "-- of the rule, and I think you've already qualified what you said opening. Opening, you said reasonable suspicion is the rule for everyone, the felon as well as the minor offenders. Now you seem to be saying, well, this case involves only minor offenders; so, let's limit it to that. That's what I thought you were saying now.",
  "Even for -­",
  "-- body lice?",
  "But they are -­",
  "May I just ask, on your medical personnel, children in school get inspected for -- for head lice, prisoners for body lice. You don't need a doctor to do that?",
  "But that's not constitutionally required.",
  "So, that's another thing that -- that you don't need to -- they can inspect for body lice, and that's -- that's okay?",
  "But the Government tells us that that's true only if they don't put the arrestee in the general population.",
  "Are there any limits -­ are there any constitutional limits, in your view? You say you didn't attempt the kind of search that was done in Bell v. Wolfish. Is there any constitutional impediment to your doing so?",
  "So, there's no -­",
  "You are saying that they can do the full -- as far as the Constitution is concerned, all of these searches are permissible.",
  "In Bell v. Wolfish -­",
  "But they did -- they did stress that there was a visitor who could -- who could give the inmate contraband. Bell v. Wolfish doesn't -­ and I asked Mr. Goldstein whether we know whether the pretrial detainees in New York were searched that way on entry, and he said there's nothing that shows one way or the other.",
  "Then how does that -­",
  "That's not the Federal rule. And, by the way, the brief was really confusing. When what -- when I read page 1, page 1 tells me that the BOP policy requires all incoming pretrial detainees to be subject to visual body cavity inspections. And then it isn't until page 30 that I learn there is an exception for the very category of arrestee that we're talking about here, that they are not subject to body cavity inspections unless there's reasonable suspicion that they're concealing contraband. That the misdemeanor or civil contempt offender is not subject.",
  "Yes, but I want to know how people in this category are treated in the Federal system. And you -- you -­",
  "You reversed it. They -­ those people are not subject to this visual body cavity search.",
  "What is the reason? If there's so much sense to that policy, why isn't it the Federal policy? Before you said because there aren't that many offenders. If there were more, then would there be -- would the Federal policy change so that even people who are in on a contempt charge or a minor crime -­",
  "I'm sorry, I didn't understand. You think the Feds think it's a good policy to inspect everyone?",
  "When you say no violation, you don't mean that there was no ineffective assistance of counsel? I thought that was conceded, that there was ineffective assistance.",
  "Suppose the defective advice causes the defendant to enter a plea that he would not have entered if he had been properly advised. Can he get relief?",
  "So, explain why defective advice causing a plea, that qualifies, but defective advice causing defendant to turn down a plea - -",
  "-- does not?",
  "I think that's not -- that he got ineffective assistance, yes, that's not controverted. But that he would have gotten the 51 months or 68 is certainly controverted because of two interventions. The prosecutor can say: No deal; I'm withdrawing it, even after an initial acceptance. And the judge can say: I think 51 to 68 is entirely improper for what this man did.",
  "How can the judge -- the judge -- he knows what the plea -- let's say he knows what the plea bargain was, but he also knows that for one of the crimes, felon in possession, that alone, the sentencing range is 81 to 135. So, without any - - considering anything that happened at trial, the judge knows that the plea bargain was for less than if the man had been charged with -- only with a felon in possession.",
  "So, it -- it seems most unlikely that a judge would have accepted the plea bargain for 51 to 68 for the crimes that were charged.",
  "That may be, but is it not true that the sentence range was 81 to 135 for a felon in possession?",
  "What is the unanimity on the remedy? Here, the court said that the writ shall be granted conditioned on the State taking action to offer the 51-to-85-month plea. So, that doesn't bind the judge, but it does bind the prosecutor.",
  "And it removes the possibility of the prosecutor saying, I would have withdrawn that initial offer.",
  "So, the prosecutor -- the remedy is -- is that the remedy that's uniform? That the prosecutor has no discretion, only the judge does?",
  "You conceded -- you conceded he had a fair trial.",
  "That's not in the case.",
  "It can't be a charade and still be fair.",
  "Well, the open -- the open plea that was made -- that's a critical stage. In fact, he took a plea. But he, I think, has a plausible argument that the plea he made, the open plea with no bargain in the picture, that that plea was not intelligently made because he didn't know that there had been an offer for him to plead to a misdemeanor rather than a felony.",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Yang, in your view, is there any situation in which a defendant could regain a plea opportunity that he lost due to counsel's conceded inadequacy? And I think it is accepted that not telling him of the plea offer was ineffective representation. Is there any case where the defendant could regain the plea opportunity that he lost?",
  "Yes. If he doesn't seek a trial, right.",
  "Yes. If he doesn't want to go to trial and he's going to plead guilty, is there any circumstance where he could regain that lost opportunity?",
  "But he's -- the Missouri Supreme Court said in what -- that the prosecutor - - they would not -- they would not order the prosecutor to renew that earlier plea. So, they said the options were you can get a new trial -- you can get a trial or you can replead the open plea. But wasn't it -- didn't the court say we will not order the prosecutor to reinstate the earlier offer?",
  "But you are -- you are leaving out of the picture the prosecutor's prerogative to withdraw his plea. That you said that the court - - said it lacked authority to order the State to offer any bargain, but also the court said, I'm not going to require the prosecutor to renew an earlier offer. One thing is clear in this case: The prosecutor did nothing wrong. The wrong was on the part of defense counsel. So, why should the judge disarm the prosecutor, take away the prosecutor's right to change his mind?",
  "And that's -- is that the question that the Court raised?",
  "So, the Court was expecting you to address it.",
  "Are -- are you recognizing that the remedy that the Missouri Supreme Court did give was a futile remedy? That is, to plead guilty, to have another open plea or trial, because this defendant apparently doesn't want to go to trial.",
  "But why should -- now that we know what the judge's sentence was, and part of the plea offer was remade, the part about -- what was it -- 3 years with 10 days in jail?",
  "And the judge said, no, I'm not going to give him just 10 days; I'm going to put him in jail for the whole 3 years. Now, if that's - - this is the sentence that the judge gave, he rejected the -- half of the plea bargain, so surely he would have rejected the more generous one.",
  "We go back to what you said initially; that is, if there's no alternative remedy, Bivens fills the gap. Suppose we had a case just like Carlson, only the State law allows survivor actions. In Carlson, I thought the rule emerging from Carlson is that prison personnel in Federal prisons are subject to Bivens liability, and we don't look in each case to see whether there could have been a State tort.",
  "Is that so?",
  "Mr. Franklin, there were some references to Mississippi law that seem to be inconsistent with the notion that all States would provide an adequate remedy.",
  "Is it -- and it might hold State prisoners as well.",
  "It might hold -- some private facilities will take State prisoners as well as Federal prisoners.",
  "And if they do have State prisoners, the State prisoner would have recourse to, not Bivens, but 1983.",
  "So, you have two prisoners, identical mistreatment, and one gets a Federal remedy and the other doesn't.",
  "Did any of those courts address the problem of how the pro se prisoner is going to get an affidavit?",
  "Mr. Shah, go back to what you said about lacking -- these private -- these employees of the private corporation you said lack qualified immunity. But they do have -- courts have allowed them to have a good faith defense. So, in practice, how different is that, whether they have qualified immunity or whether they have a good faith defense?",
  "What about the character of the claim? If it's a Bivens claim, it's a constitutional claim. It's an Eighth Amendment claim. And if you're looking to State remedies, that's an ordinary tort remedy with no constitutional involvement.",
  "Would you be taking the position that even if there is an alternative State remedy, tort remedy, even so there ought to be a parallel Bivens action? Or would you say no Bivens action if all of the States have adequate tort remedies?",
  "But in Carlson, it was Bivens or no damage remedy. Here, that's not the case.",
  "In Carlson, the Court was operating on the theory that with respect to the Federal employee, it was a Bivens remedy for damages or no remedy at all.",
  "Right.",
  "And here, it is different from Carlson because there is an -- a remedy against an individual. So, we have the parallel remedies here which didn't exist in Carlson, and that makes the two cases different.",
  "Well, what was the purpose of making the reference to private contractors in the Westfall Act?",
  "Do you know if any of these Bivens claims have been pled in the alternative; that is, a Bivens remedy, but alternatively State law?",
  "Is there diversity in this case?",
  "So, you said there was a statute of limitations problem with starting new.",
  "What about, if there is diversity - -",
  "-- allowing an amendment?",
  "Mr. Pincus, you said -- I think you used the words \"the one who motivated the charge\" or something to that effect. And I'm looking at the complaint that was filed in this case, and it says -- and this is on page 28 of the joint appendix. It says Mr. Hodges -- that's the prosecutor -- knew or should have known there was no probable cause. \"He,\" Mr. Hodges, \"directed Mr. Paulk to appear before the grand jury and attest to the truth of such charges.\" So, if anyone was the instigator, it was the prosecutor, not his aide. But the prosecutor gets absolute immunity.",
  "But if he did it -- if he did at the prosecutor's bidding, then he is not the prime mover.",
  "He -- the instigator, what you call the complaining witness, would have been immune if he gave the identical testimony at the trial itself, right?",
  "It's only -- it's only what you call the complaining witness that gets this special treatment? All the other witnesses before the grand jury would be absolutely immune?",
  "The question is, where do you locate the grand jury? We have on the one side, you recited Malley. That was an arrest warrant, testimony in support of an arrest warrant. Then we have the trial, where everybody gets absolute immunity. And grand jury is in between those two. So, why should we bracket it with the arrest warrant rather than with the trial? The -- the arrest warrant is certainly pre-prosecution.",
  "Then you agree with the -- with the position that the United States took, which is you can -- if there were -- there was evidence outside the grand jury proceeding that this person was the instigator, that that could be the basis for a malicious prosecution 1983 claim? I thought the United States' position was: We're not going to use the testimony before the grand jury, but if this person did things outside the grand jury to instigate the prosecution, that's -- that could - -",
  "Well, let's go back one stage. Let's go back to an arrest warrant. The witness -- and the concern that the affidavit in support of the warrant is filled with lies. The affidavit is presented to a judge. And I would think that's better than a prosecutor. And yet, there is no absolute immunity for someone who lies in order to get a warrant, even though the judge makes the judgment whether the warrant should issue.",
  "Suppose -- suppose we had, instead of a grand jury proceeding and an indictment, an accusation to begin the prosecution and a supporting affidavit in connection with the accusation. Would there be -- would there be absolute immunity then for the affidavit that supports the accusation which will begin the prosecution?",
  "No. We take the grand jury out of it. We're going to begin the case, the prosecution, by an information, or I think the Georgia law refers to something called an accusation. If -- if we're not before a grand jury and the prosecution is instituted by an information and there is an affidavit supporting that information, is there absolute immunity for the false affidavit in support of the information?",
  "But you -- you cited a provision of the Georgia Code that seems to equate what's called an accusation with an indictment. It's on the bottom of page 22: \"All legal proceedings by which a person's liability for a crime is determined, commencing with the return of the indictment or the filing of the accusation.\" So, if the Georgia Code equates those two, the return of the indictment or the filing of the accusation, why shouldn't the immunity rule be the same for the two? And you told me that Malley would cover the filing of the accusation. So, why shouldn't it be the same for the return of the indictment?",
  "Do you regard the grand jury as a judicial proceeding?",
  "But -- but there's no judge. And it seems to me odd to say -- there's no presiding judge, there's no cross-examination. And the indictment has the same function as an information. So, why should it rank as a judicial proceeding?",
  "And that would go for the prosecutor, too, right?",
  "For the information? If you -- if you bracket it with Malley, the -- the prosecutor who lies to the magistrate is not going to have absolute immunity at the arrest warrant stage. Is the prosecutor absolutely immune for making out an information that's packed with lies?",
  "Why isn't -- why isn't an arrest warrant intimately associated?",
  "Ms. Millett, suppose, instead of having the statute broken down into (c)(1), (2), and (3), Congress had written (c) as just one paragraph that says: You must have a certificate of appealability, and this is what the certificate must contain. No division into (2) and (3). Would you still maintain that only the first sentence of the paragraph is jurisdictional and the rest is not?",
  "Then that would exclude this case, wouldn't it, because there is a constitutional issue? It's a speedy trial issue. But that issue was not reached below, because the case was dismissed as untimely. So, the only constitutional issue that's in the case is one that couldn't be adjudicated by the court of appeals. Isn't that right? Is there another constitutional issue other than the speedy trial issue?",
  "It's a little odd that you would identify that issue for the court of appeals when the court of appeals couldn't take it up because it wasn't reached below, because the case was -- was dismissed at an earlier stage.",
  "But it does -- it does suggest, Ms. Millett, that final, two ways -- conclusion of direct review is you've gone up the ladder, and that's it. And the second part is, well, if you don't go up the ladder, you just stop. Then when your time to go up the ladder has ended, that's it. It -- it seems that there are those two possibilities, as Justice Kagan put it so well: You lose or you quit.",
  "So, you would have a difference between 2255 and 2254. And on the State level, you would have a variety of times because some States -- they don't all make it the mandate. They don't set finality at the mandate. There may be different -- there may be different periods of time before the mandate issues. So, you would have various time periods for State prisoners. But if you were a Federal prisoner, then you would have -- there would only be the one --",
  "I'm not talking about a test. I'm talking about time periods. There -- there's a uniform time period for 2255 petitions. There would not be a uniform time period for 2254 petitions.",
  "Can we back up and tell me why which statute we're dealing with, 2253 -- why that's jurisdictional if \"jurisdiction\" means, as we have said, that class of cases that the court is competent to hear. So, I look at 2254. That's State habeas.",
  "Federal petition by a State prisoner. And 2255 is a petition by a Federal prisoner. So, those are the class of cases. The class of cases are habeas cases, '54 State prisoners, '55 Federal prisoners.",
  "2253, it seems to me, is a processing rule that applies to both categories. It applies to '54, and it applies to '55, but the classes of cases are identified in '54 and '55. So, I would write 2253 as a mandatory processing rule but not -- not a rule that tells us what class of cases the court is competent to here.",
  "So that it doubles as -- 2254 is jurisdictional; 2255, and then 2253, which tells how you are to proceed under either one of those, is not simply a mandatory how you do it but jurisdictional.",
  "The feature of this case that I think is very unsettling is there is an issue for the court of appeals to decide. It's the timeliness issue. The court of appeals could not decide the speedy trial. If -- if this case were to fail because the trial judge didn't identify the speedy trial issue when the court of appeals in no way could reach that issue in this case, isn't that something only a -- a distinction only a lawyer could love?",
  "If you say -- if you say that -- here's Judge Gaza, and he says: Yes, there's a statute of limitations question here; it has to be decided before we get to the speedy trial. But if the judge felt that the speedy trial issue was not meritorious, then why would he grant a certificate of appealability on the threshold question that you have to decide before? Because, it seems to me, it would be a waste of everyone's time if the judge thought that the speedy trial issue had no merit.",
  "In this -- in this very case, that was so, right? Because the -- the period for discretionary review expired in August.",
  "And the mandate issued on September -- some date in September.",
  "So, there could be no State habeas until the mandate issued. So, the days in between would count against the defendant on the speedy trial clock, even though he would -- he could not have filed a State habeas; he could not have stopped the clock by filing a State habeas.",
  "So, if someone on the court of appeals noticed that, yes, the certificate pinpoints the only case -- only question that the panel can decide at this juncture, but there is a lurking constitutional question, then isn't 28 U.S.C. 1653 exactly what the panel would do? That is, 1653 says that defective jurisdictional allegations can be amended in the trial or the appellate court. And so, all that would have had to have happened is very much in line with Justice Breyer's questions, is the judge on the panel said, oh, the certificate of appealability didn't mention the speedy trial issue. So, counsel, would you like to amend, or we on our own will amend to put that question in?",
  "Well, the appeal couldn't go forward on that issue because that issue hasn't been decided below. The one thing we know is the speedy trial issue -- the case cannot go forward on the speedy trial issue. Isn't that right?",
  "Why?",
  "How common is it for courts of appeals to reach substantive issues in the first instance --",
  "-- when there's no decision of the district court?",
  "Wouldn't -- wouldn't the most sensible procedure be -- let's forget the intricacies of 2244 and '53. But you -- you have a case where there's a statute of limitations question, and that has come up for review. Wouldn't the court of appeals 99 out of 100 times say now the substantive -- since we've decided that the case is timely, then it is district court's function to resolve the substantive issue?",
  "So, at least for all eyewitness testimony, there would have to be some pretesting for reliability; is that -- is that your contention?",
  "And in this case, in which category do you place the eyewitness testimony? Is it police suggestion, or is it suggestive but not through any manipulation on the police's part?",
  "You -- you answered that due process works only in favor of the defendant.",
  "Not in favor of the State.",
  "And that is your only - - your only distinction. You are saying this is a one - - one-way - -",
  "-- street.",
  "Do you distinguish the - - do you distinguish the husband's situation? He was an eyewitness too, but there was a motion to suppress her testimony. Is that an example where there's an eyewitness testimony but no suggestiveness? Why didn't you move to suppress the husband's statement?",
  "So, you'd put them both in the same category?",
  "What about all the -- all the other safeguards that you have? I mean, you can ask the judge to tell the jury be careful; eyewitness testimony is often unreliable. You can point that out in cross-examination - -",
  "-- ask all those questions. You can say something about it in your summation to the jury. And, as Justice Breyer brought up, you have the evidence rule that says if the prejudicial value outweighs probative value, that the judge can say, I'm not going to let it in. Why aren't all those safeguards enough?",
  "Well, leaving aside the police - -",
  "-- because, there, there's an interest in deterrence, in deterring the police from manipulating evidence.",
  "It is a difference between - -",
  "-- suggestive and suggested by the police.",
  "The -- if the suggestion comes from the police, then the evidence will be excluded. If the suggestion comes from some place else, unless we change the rules - -",
  "-- it would be admitted.",
  "Mr. Whalen, the common definition of deceit is acting -- intentionally giving a false impression, intentionally giving a false impression with the intent that someone will act on it. So, it seems that's exactly what filing a false return is. You give a false impression of what your income is with the intent that the IRS will accept it.",
  "But why isn't it obvious? What proof would you need? You submit a document because you want to convey a false impression for someone to act on. Why do you have to have anything more than that to establish deceit?",
  "Do we have that in the briefs?",
  "But the point that was being made is not that it's fraud and deceit. Quite the opposite. I think Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Scalia have tried to get you to focus on the evasion that involves no false statement at all, evading payment where you say nothing. What would be the crime if you simply don't pay your taxes, and you don't file a return, so you are not filing anything that's false? Where would that come in the Internal Revenue - -",
  "Would it be evasion simply not to report your income?",
  "But 7206 is the lesser offense. I mean, you don't take -- you don't dispute that the heavier crime is the 7201 crime; that is, evasion. It gets a more severe penalty. And when Congress picks out one tax crime and one tax crime only, why wouldn't we assume that that's what Congress meant with respect to aggravated felonies? That there's one tax crime, the most serious tax crime, that fits that label. And the (M)(i) provision deals with the many, many statutes that involve loss -- fraud or deceit and loss to the victim?",
  "But that was one of the problems that was brought up in the amicus brief which actually you considered, that reading the (M)(i) to include 7206 offenses would also -- would bring in offenses that are merely misdemeanors at the State and local level. It would really swell the category of tax crimes that lead to deportation. That -- did Congress really mean to turn misdemeanors into aggravated felons? And then there was a very practical point made, that the government is going to be hurt more than helped by what you are seeking, because we are told that very often the government will try to make a bargain. It has a 7201 case, but it's going to be a little hard to prove. So, they offer as a plea bargain 7206. And if you -- if your position prevails, we are told, there will be many, many people who will say: If it's a question of whether I get thrown out of the United States, I'm going to go to trial; I'm not going to plead to something that will mean immediately when I serve my time I will be thrown out of the United States.",
  "There's a technical aspect of this case I don't understand. Maybe you can explain it. There was a question about what might be the revenue loss in -- in the case of the wife. Why should the revenue loss be different? She's -- she's convicted of aiding and abetting.",
  "Although it's not a criminal statute?",
  "It's not a criminal statute.",
  "There -- there's one technical feature, too, that I also didn't understand. The particular tax here in question, the failure to report was 76-some thousand dollars, but the number that was given for the total failure to report is over 1 million, and the -- the loss to the IRS at -- is 245,000. Well, the 245,000 loss must refer to more than the failure to report 76,000.",
  "I'd just like to know how we got -- how the 245,000 revenue loss was calculated, given that the crime that was charged, the failure was to report only 76,000?",
  "But you say, Mr. Lewin, that -- you're not claiming exclusivity in Congress. You say foreign relations is a shared power. So, if it is a shared power, why does Congress trump the executive?",
  "Does that go the full length of saying if Congress passed a law that says the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Jerusalem must be designated as the capital of Israel in all official documents -- suppose that were the law. I take it, from everything you've argued, your position would be, yes, Congress has that authority.",
  "Not all that old.",
  "Mr. Lewin, I take it from what you -­",
  "What you've argued is that you're skipping over the question that the D.C. Circuit decided. I take it your view is it's not a political question; so, the Court should resolve the merits.",
  "What of all the -­",
  "The two examples that are given in the brief, one of Texas, where Petitioner says there was a case where Congress went first -- Congress recognized and the President acquiesced, and the same thing with Taiwan; it was a statute and the President implemented it. So, if the -- Congress thought it had the authority, the recognition authority, in those two measures, and the President acquiesced.",
  "Why not all the way? I mean, if the Court decides that the Constitution commits this authority exclusively to the President, then it's all over. That's the merits of the case: Does the President have this authority? So, the political question label seems to be kind of a -- a subterfuge because if there is a textual commission -- commitment to the President, that's the end of the case.",
  "Then -- General Verrilli, then you are taking the position that this is not a shared authority; it's an exclusive authority, that there is no role for Congress. Am I right? Or is there some role in recognition for -- for Congress?",
  "But that is still -­ that's a merits determination. The whole question is, who has the authority? And whatever label you put on it, if you decide that the President has, as you just said, the exclusive authority, that's the end of the matter. It -- it's not leaving it -- it is not leaving it, as Justice Breyer said, to the political branches to fight it out between them. It is saying the President has the exclusive authority.",
  "There was a third party involved in the telephone -- in the pen register case. And, here, it's the police. Essentially, I think you answered the question that the government's position would mean that any of us could be monitored whenever we leave our homes. So, the only thing secure is the home. Is -- I mean, that is -- that is the end point of your argument, that an electronic device, as long as it's not used inside the house, is okay.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, this case started out with a warrant. There was a warrant, and the limits weren't followed. The warrant said 10 days, do this in 10 days, and the police took 11. They were supposed to do it in D.C. Instead, they did it in Maryland. So, the police could have gotten permission to conduct this search. In fact, they had received it. Now, I take it that the practice had been, because it's in the electronic surveillance manual, better get a warrant. Was there any problem about -- when this kind of surveillance is wanted by the government, to get a warrant? Were they encountering difficulty getting warrants?",
  "And the speed as well.",
  "An easy way to pick someone up for speeding when you suspect something far worse but have no -- no probable cause.",
  "That was -- that is when the police came upon the violator. But this is -- it's all in a computer. The police can say we want to find out more about X, so consult the database, see if there's an indication that he was ever speeding in the last 28 days.",
  "But the Fourth Amendment protects us against unreasonable searches and seizures. And if I were trying to explain to someone, here's the Fourth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment says -- or it has been interpreted to mean that if I'm on a public bus and the police want to feel my luggage, that's a violation; and yet, this kind of monitoring, installing the GPS and monitoring the person's movement whenever they are outside their house in the car, is not? I mean, it just -- something about it that -- just doesn't parse.",
  "Who would be under your test the judge of the reasonable suspicion?",
  "But he -- he wouldn't be protected against a surveillance camera that could get information. And is this really different in kind from the surveillance camera?",
  "I think that's conceded by both sides, and that's accepted by both sides. The warrant expired. There was no warrant. The government certainly could have gone back and said, judge, we didn't make it; we need a little more time; give us 10 more days.",
  "Well, he saw a picture. Boatner saw a picture in a newspaper, and that turned on the light for him, right? It wasn't any police suggestion.",
  "Wasn't there also an intervening -- didn't he say 5 days after that he couldn't identify? And that was after what he said on the night, the same night.",
  "Five days later he said: I couldn't -- I couldn't identify him.",
  "Does this -- was this line-up -- was this after Boatner saw the photograph in the newspaper?",
  "And that was before or after the picture in the paper?",
  "But how could it not be material? Here is the only eyewitness - -",
  "-- and we have inconsistent statements. Are you really urging that the prior statements were immaterial?",
  "How does that make it not material? You can argue that it should be given diminished weight. But an inconsistent statement by the only eyewitness seems to me most material and useful to the defense in cross-examining the eyewitness. I really don't understand how you can -- you can argue that the jury shouldn't put much weight on it because there were these other things; but to say that it's immaterial I find that that is -- is not plausible.",
  "But it is a description that others, other suspects, fit. The close-cut hair, the gold teeth. That didn't identify Smith, as opposed to the other suspects who had those same characteristics.",
  "It was a prior inconsistent statement, and we can argue about whether there were more consistent statements than inconsistent statements, but to say that this was not Brady material, we -- we're not saying that Larry Boatner made up a story on the stand that wasn't -- didn't conform to the truth. The question is, should the prosecutor -- should the defense attorney have access to a prior inconsistent statement?",
  "But Kyles is a decision saying what the prosecutor must disclose, not it's a good practice.",
  "How do you know? How do you know? How can you possibly know? The jury is supposed to decide on the credibility of this witness. There's a statement that he made a prior inconsistent statement. The -- Mr. Shanmugam outlined five categories of what he called Brady material. Is -- are you maintaining that none of those categories, that there was no Brady material at all in this case?",
  "Yes.",
  "I'm talking about Mims and -- what was the woman's name? Russell?",
  "And Young and the snitch, the one who said that his cellmate told him that his cellmate was the perpetrator.",
  "Was it a determination by the judge that it wasn't a dying declaration?",
  "And how about Mims?",
  "All right. Let's go to Mims, who said, I saw them -- I saw the perpetrators go to their car when they were exiting. They had ski masks.",
  "But isn't it most unlikely, as your -- as Mr. Shanmugam said, that robbers -- I mean, the people who are entering, intruding on another's premises to rob, or whatever else they're going to do, would wear masks going out but not going in? I mean, they don't want anybody -- they don't want anybody to be able to identify them.",
  "Well, is that maybe - -",
  "But you're taking that judgment away from the jury. There was a prior inconsistent statement. Shouldn't that be the end of it? A prior inconsistent statement, one that is favorable to the defense, has to be turned over, period. I thought was what Brady requires.",
  "So, is there anything saved to the State? I mean, there is a savings clause. Once you get to the entrance to the slaughterhouse, is there any room for any State regulation?",
  "Because that would be a requirement? Is that -- is that -- do you rely heavily on -- on the distinction between a requirement and something that's merely permissive?",
  "Mr. Frederick, could you -- could you clarify what is at stake for the worker here? The railroad worker ordinarily has the FELA claim, but the FELA claim in this case was dismissed. So, can you tell us what recourse -- if you lose, what recovery can this plaintiff get? And also explain to me why the FELA claim was dismissed.",
  "Can you explain - -",
  "Can you explain the difference -- you make a distinction between field pre-emption and conflict pre-emption. Does that have any practical significance at all in this case, because I thought you agreed that the design defect claim would be barred?",
  "I thought that that was not the nature of the notice claim. The design is whatever it is. But the manufacturer has to issue warnings so that the worker can protect himself against that hazard. So, I thought that the defective design - - yes, I understand your argument. You would have one standard for on the line and another when it's in the repair shop. But this is not telling them to change the design in any respect. It just says: Asbestos -- you could take these measures to protect yourself.",
  "But that was -- that was the Safety Act, and they didn't amend the Locomotive Act. The Locomotive Act is what it was, and they didn't put that clause in it.",
  "Do we have any information on the -- I mean, there are small claims courts in State court. Is there any practice of removing $500 claims and paying much more than the $500 that's at stake?",
  "In this -- in this case, could -- could this case have been brought in a small claims court? Where does it come from?",
  "Could the -- could these claims be brought in State court as class actions?",
  "But you could remove it to the Federal courts, and then you could.",
  "But it's up to -- it's up to the State.",
  "Congress --",
  "Congress said you bring it according to your law and your rules of procedure. So, the State could make it -- Congress may have been interested in the small claims court, but it certainly didn't limit the States to bringing -- to putting these claims in small claims court.",
  "This goes back to Justice Alito's point --",
  "Justice Alito said this claim arises under Federal law; the substantive law that governs is not State law.",
  "It's a --",
  "Is it because the FCC once took a position that the action was limited to State courts?",
  "Mr. Garre, do you have any example, other than this statute which is odd -- is there any other example of a claim that arises under Federal law, as this does under Federal statute -- the substantive law is Federal -- that one may not bring in State court?",
  "Is the law any different, the violation and the governing law, any different than if the Attorney General had brought suit or if the FCC sought to enforce this law? I mean, the substance of the law -- whoever sues, the Attorney General, the FCC, the Federal law that governs is the same, isn't it?",
  "But I'm talking about the claim of the -- the violation, the wrongful conduct is the same whether the Attorney General is suing, whether the FCC is enforcing.",
  "Mr. Garre, was it really a loophole? What would -- I mean, if this -- if conduct -- if the telemarketers are calling from out of State, but the impact is in the State, the person who is being called, it seems to me that there certainly would be jurisdiction over the out-of-State tortfeasor who's doing something out of State that has this impact. It targets the State, and it has its impact.",
  "How about supplemental jurisdiction? Which says it doesn't have an amount in controversy.",
  "But Congress -- Congress also -- it made -- for attorney general suits, it said: And Federal court jurisdiction is exclusive. So, it's given Federal court exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate this claim, because the claim, as you -- I think as you recognize, is the same whether it's brought by the FCC, the attorney general, or private. So, if you use the word \"exclusive\" there, it said nothing in this private right of action about the State courts being exclusive.",
  "Let's go back to the -- this -- this claim -- unlike the Shoshone Mining, this claim arises under Federal law. There's no question about that, is there?",
  "Okay. So, Federal law creates the cause of action, and when Federal law creates the cause of action, the rule has always been there's 1331 jurisdiction.",
  "But the later-enacted statute doesn't say that Federal law no longer creates the cause of action.",
  "You have jurisdiction when Federal law creates a cause of action.",
  "When Congress creates a Federal claim, it usually doesn't. I mean, the assumption is that it's going to be concurrent jurisdiction.",
  "Can we go back to your 1983 example? Because I was thinking about that, and you said, well, the later specific statute is another Federal statute. You have -- Congress has another Federal statute that makes the more general 1983 not available because you have the more specific Federal statute.",
  "Because she can't --",
  "Because she can't prove it at the early stage. I mean, the problem that Congress was concerned about was that you can't tell until the house is going to be sold in the end how adequate the title insurance was. So, Congress is acting on the potential that these kind of kickbacks can cause harm. And this does seem to fit the bill of restitution, unjust enrichment cases, where the plaintiff doesn't have to prove any harm; she just gets back what the defendant should not have received.",
  "Suppose she -- suppose she appended to her complaint an affidavit by a well-respected economist that says Congress was right; these kind of arrangements will have an adverse effect on the people who are purchasing title insurance. And goes through all kinds of analyses that show that. Would that be adequate then?",
  "Is that -- is that right? I thought --",
  "Mr. Lamken, you're not seeking damages. You're seeking what the statute says you can get, which is your money back treble?",
  "So, it's not that you have to prove --",
  "-- any other damages because the statute has specified what the recovery is.",
  "On your first --",
  "On your first point, you cite Lampf, but Lampf had two limits. So, it said -- what was it, 1 year from whatever, from discovery. And then it set an outer limit at 3 years, and it was the same thing in Merck. Here we just say -- it just has what seems to me a plain vanilla statute of limitations that is traditionally subject to waiver, equitable tolling. We don't have that special kind of statute that gives you one limit and then sets a further limit that will be the outer limit.",
  "The problem is it reads like dozens of statutes of limitations. It says no suit more than 2 years and that -- I think that the general understanding is that that limitation, that kind of limitation -- there is a presumption that it is subject to equitable tolling, forfeiture, waiver. And why, if this one doesn't use any different words, why should --",
  "Well, it's -- it's not simply a prophylactic. I mean, there's an objective that 16(a) expresses; that is, Congress wanted these trades to be reported and to have the form filed, Form 4 filed. So, it's a -- it's a disclosure-forcing provision, 16(a) is. Then, why would Congress mean for it to operate to immunize a defendant who has not made that filing and who has concealed what was supposed to be reported in 16 -- under 16(a)?",
  "How about the Second Circuit rule?",
  "We have to accept the plaintiffs' allegations as true. You may well be right that they really knew or they should have known. But, at this stage, we can't make that judgment because we have to accept the plaintiffs' allegations as true.",
  "If you extinguish the claim -- the statute of limitations doesn't terminate the claim. It just says you can't get a remedy if you sue too late. But there are statutes that say you have no claim after X time, and that would certainly be a repose. You have no right anymore after that.",
  "Is that true of --",
  "Is that true of State -- you said taxes. Is it true of State taxes?",
  "So, in this -- in this -- we're dealing with a capital gains tax on the sale of the farm. Suppose a State had a similar tax; it also taxed the gain on the sale.",
  "The argument that is made against your position -- 1305 was one of the provisions that was featured, I think, both in the Ninth Circuit and the Tenth Circuit, and their position seems to be that 1305 gives the government an election.",
  "So, what -- what farm sales would be included? What farm sales would get this benefit that Senator Grassley obviously wanted them to have?",
  "How about employment tax? Employment taxes?",
  "What would be -- what would be the right way?",
  "Then maybe Congress shouldn't have passed this statute. But the injury, the invasion of privacy, that's not something where pecuniary damages are -- are prime if they exist at all. I mean, this is -- the -- the tort that this is comparable to is intentional infliction of emotional distress. The -- the person who is subject to this, to this embarrassment, this humiliation, doesn't have out-of-pocket costs but is terribly distressed, nervous, anxious, and all the rest. The -- the act that the Congress is reaching, the impact of it is of that nature, not -- I mean, pecuniary damages do not ordinarily attend conduct that embarrasses, humiliates you, causes mental distress.",
  "Even if it is -- even if it is, the damages are -- the damages are not of a pecuniary kind. So, you could say that Congress was much more generous than the common law was, but the impact on the person who is suing is not going to be out-of-pocket business loss, pecuniary loss; it's going to be the embarrassment, the humiliation. So, it's -- it's -- if Congress wanted to do something about the impact on the person it has given a right, it's not going to do something that has to do with pecuniary damages which it's not likely the person in -- in this plaintiff's situation is not likely to suffer.",
  "But that's the -- why -- is -- is a harm to a dignitary interest, is that an actual injury?",
  "You describe that injury -- I mean, it is an injury, the emotional distress, the humiliation. Is that an actual injury?",
  "Well, let's take this case. Did the plaintiff suffer an actual injury?",
  "At least, did he allege that he had suffered an actual injury?",
  "I didn't -- I didn't ask you that. I asked you, did he suffer an actual injury, as opposed to someone who is complaining about something -- an abstract right or an abstract theory? Is there an actual injury here?",
  "Well, you have to have an injury first before you can get damages. So, my question is, was there an injury?",
  "Yes.",
  "What does \"actual damages\" mean under the Fair Credit Reporting Act?",
  "But it can mean, and I think it has been held to mean, damages to a dignitary interest. Mental distress has been held to -- the term has been held to mean that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.",
  "Just to question what the term means, what the term \"actual damages\" means.",
  "Well, the -- the Privacy Study Commission coming after can't say what the statute means. I mean, that would be post-legislative history. I mean, the statute exists, and then we have a Study Commission to see what amendments might be made. But the Study Commission can't decide what the -- what the Act means.",
  "But that's just saying that he didn't have a good claim for relief. But let's take the worst case, where -- where a government official spreads all kinds of false information or even true but terribly embarrassing information about a person, does it deliberately. Let's take that case, because your rule covers all of them.",
  "But wasn't that the very thing that Congress -- why did they pass this in the first place? I mean, Congress was thinking of emotional distress injuries.",
  "But it's --",
  "It did set a pretty high bar for the plaintiff to meet, because the plaintiff would have to prove intentional or willful conduct, not negligence, but --",
  "What difference does it make for him? Now, he served his State time. He came over to serve his Federal sentence. He didn't get credit for the 2-1/2 years he spent in -- in the State. But what is the consequence? How much -- what is the difference to the defendant in this case?",
  "Entitled to credit or you could seek it? I mean, what wouldn't -- he has the State time and he -- 2-1/2 years, and then he has his Federal sentence. Why would you be entitled to any credit?",
  "He could recommend it. He could recommend it, could he not?",
  "Mr. Jay, what does the \"or\" mean? Maybe the judge -- it was 20 years ago; maybe the judge said nothing. Nevertheless, it's: What was the intent of the sentencing court or the goals of the criminal justice system?",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "Do they take -- do they take account of the -- the defendant's behavior in the State facility? Is that a factor?",
  "Which is something that the judge couldn't know.",
  "Well, it does to this extent: If it's two -- if the second sentence that hasn't yet been imposed, but there's an indictment in another Federal court, if there's two consecutive prosecutions, the first judge can't say I want my sentence to run consecutive to the one that may or may not be imposed by another Federal judge. That would not be possible, right?",
  "So, why should it -- if the order is one way for successive Federal prosecutions, why should it be different when the second prosecution, instead of being Federal, is State?",
  "But it will be the second judge.",
  "But the State judge can decide what's going to happen to the second sentence.",
  "What do you do --",
  "But what do you do with the -- the argument that the judge who anticipates a second sentence may be wrong? He doesn't know what that will be. And when I asked, how does the bureau make these judgments -- does it take into account the conduct of the prisoner in the State facility -- that's something that the judge who sentences first can't possibly know.",
  "So, if you have a gang member and the crime has absolutely nothing to do with gang membership -- that I think is the case here; it's a domestic assault -- as long as you're a gang member, then every warrant can say search for all gang-related information? That's essentially your position, isn't it?",
  "But you -- you said this is domestic assault. There is no gang activity involved in that assault, right?",
  "So, anyone who has a weapon and is a member of a gang then can be -- there can be a search for any and all weapons and material related to weapons?",
  "I'm -- I'm on to the part about all gang-related activity, when the crime has nothing to do with the -- with the gang. Let's -- let's stick to that. Then guns is another issue. But this said warrant to search for any and all gang-related items?",
  "But they didn't need to tie him to the shotgun. They had photographs of him with the shotgun.",
  "What -- what do you need more than here he is with his gun? The defendant himself and his gun? I mean, what --",
  "What about the provision for any photographs that depict evidence of criminal activity? That seems to me as general as you can get. Photographs depicting evidence of criminal activity.",
  "I though the test was \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable.\"",
  "Mr. Wolfson --",
  "Mr. Wolfson, if -- suppose they had had a warrant to search just for the sawed-off shotgun. You conceded that when they go into the house and they're looking all over, they could look in cabinets and drawers for the -- to find pieces of the shotgun. They come across other guns, they can at least secure -- take those guns for their own safety. There are other people in the house, and somebody might use them. So, what's -- what's the difference in the scope of the search if they have a warrant just to look for the sawed-off shotgun or if they have a warrant that covers any guns?",
  "What happened here when they -- when they -- they did seize weapons that belonged to the plaintiff, Mrs. Millender. They -- they took them because they thought they were the defendant's? But -- not that -- they thought they were Bowen's?",
  "Is the first -- is the first approved, the drug itself -- they're not claiming that, because that patent has expired, isn't it?",
  "But what about the fact that the FDA, and not the patent holders, were drafting the use codes at the time this legislation passed?",
  "Mr. Horwich, do we -- do we know what FDA's position is in this case? Is the position you're presenting the position of the FDA?",
  "What you -- what you described sounded very much like this case. So, if the -- what was the D.C. Circuit case? If -- if the D.C. Circuit said it's arbitrary and capricious not to -- to just accept the -- the brand's use code --",
  "What was fixed? I missed what you said. What was fixed in the counterclaim?",
  "I can't imagine that that would really come to -- I mean, if it's a transposition of numbers, that there would be -- have to be a proceeding to get it changed. I mean, the minute that was noticed, I assume that the brand manufacturer would change it.",
  "Mr. Perry, may I ask you, on that core question: We have a patent on a drug alone. It expires, and then the patent holder gets a label patent that's on a method of use, and we have a generic that wants to sell the drug alone which is no longer patented. Doesn't want to sell it in combination with anything else. Wants to sell the drug alone. Can it do so without infringing the method-of-use patent?",
  "There was a deadline set for all submissions, wasn't there?",
  "But this petition had something new, the report that his investigator had turned up this evidence.",
  "Well, suppose -- suppose the public defender had said to the district court what it said to the Ninth Circuit, and that is that the attorney-client relationship has broken down to such an extent that substitution would be appropriate, what wasn't asked, but suppose the public defender had given that answer to the district judge. Would the district judge still have rightly denied the motion for substitution?",
  "Where did you get it from?",
  "I thought -- Mr. Waxman --",
  "I thought -- I mean, this is a case that has been going on for, what, 12 years in the district court?",
  "And I thought that the basic disagreement between the client and counsel was counsel said our best shot is going to be to keep you alive; so, we want to do everything we can to change the death sentence, and then -- and we don't want to detract from that by making a claim of actual innocence when there's -- there'd be a very slim basis for that. So, that's the judgment, and it's a strategic judgment that counsel made: Our best shot to keep this man alive is to concentrate on the penalty phase.",
  "But it's all -- it's all that, what -- what he told his girlfriend, right? There's nothing else. It's only that?",
  "In the case of the blood that was tested in the police lab, there the person who was testing did testify at the trial, right? It wasn't just Lambatos -- Lambatos, but the one who had tested the blood?",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Carroll, are we talking about 10 witnesses? I thought we were talking about just one witness, from Cellmark.",
  "That's 1 person, not 10.",
  "You -- you said \"independent,\" and I don't -- you said that in your brief. I don't understand how Lambatos's testimony can be independent of the test results supplied. I mean, it's based on the test results. She -- it can't be independent of them because it's entirely dependent on them.",
  "If the report had been introduced, the Cellmark report, it would be testimonial; is that -- is that right?",
  "Yes. Right.",
  "Well, how does it become --",
  "How does it become non-testimonial when it's relayed by the recipient of the report? I mean, if -- if the -- you're not introducing it for the truth, then it's not relevant.",
  "I thought you earlier recognized that her -- her opinion could not be independent of the test results. It depended entirely on the test results. So, I -- now you've -- you've inserted \"independent\" again, and I thought you had -- you had given up on that.",
  "Does Illinois -- does Illinois have notice and demand?",
  "It does not?",
  "Mr. Shapiro, on that question and the question Justice Scalia just raised, the Government, you know, has taken the position that you're under the wrong section. It's not a question of patentability, but you've used the example of the finger; you said it's obvious. So, why didn't you raise the sections that the Government says would have been the appropriate ones on the novelty or anticipation of prior art and obviousness?",
  "Mr. Shapiro just told us, when I asked him that question based on your -- your brief, that people need to know up front that it's -- this is not a patentable subject matter; very important that it be 101 and not 102 and 103. So, how do you answer his rejection of the adequacy of prior -- anticipating prior art or obviousness?",
  "Could it have intervened somehow, because the -- the United States has come here rather reluctantly, as you recommended against granting cert in this case. When this was in the Montana courts and it was a question of what is the Federal law, because Federal law is going to control -- everybody agrees that -- could the United States have come into the proceedings in the Montana State court?",
  "And if we -- if it were remanded, the United States would still stay out of it because it's going to be in the State --",
  "Mr. Garre, what is -- you say that you're not taking just -- you look at the whole river as a whole. You're saying that, no, that isn't your position?",
  "And it is also not inch by inch. So, what's -- when is segmentation appropriate?",
  "So, you just -- so, you are disagreeing with the United States, which has given us its view of what the Federal law is. It doesn't coincide with Montana's.",
  "Mr. Garre, you -- you have said this is genuinely a controversy between the State and the United States, but the United States is not a party to this -- to this litigation. And we know from the briefing before us, the United States takes a different position than Montana. It doesn't agree with you. But if this case -- how can a case be decided without any input from the United States when you say that's the true dispute; it is between the State and the nation?",
  "But the court of appeals did say that there would be no independent liability under the -- for violation of the compliance order. That is, unless there was a violation of the statute, there would be no penalty for violation of the compliance order.",
  "What -- what kind of review are you seeking? I mean, one thing you could say is you dispute that this property is subject to the Act. That might be a question that's reviewable. Do you seek more than that? Do you seek review at this stage of anything more than whether the property is subject to the Act?",
  "What would the standard be that -- before -- you have APA review. So, it's just that -- that the EPA acted reasonably in determining that you have wetlands?",
  "Is there no limitation on the compliance order? It just -- it can be there forever until the EPA decides to bring an enforcement action?",
  "I asked you earlier, in this APA review, would there be any further question after the determination is it wetlands, is it not? And you had said no, that's -- that would be it. But you answered another question that would suggest it may be wetlands, but it shouldn't -- there should be -- you should be allowed to build your home anyway.",
  "But they asked -- they asked for a hearing. Didn't they ask EPA for a hearing on whether their lands fell within the statute? They did ask for a hearing, and the EPA said no.",
  "There's -- there's one thing I do want you to tell us is -- EPA has three choices. It can go to a compliance order; it can issue an administrative -- trigger an administrative penalty when -- where there would be APA review; or it can bring an enforcement action. How does the agency decide which of those three routes it's going to take in a given case?",
  "But what about this administrative order that -- the administrative order internally within EPA subject to judicial review? When does it use that as opposed to a compliance order?",
  "But in concrete, Mr. Stewart - -",
  "-- how would it work? You say it's a lesser standard under the APA. But the question is, is this wetlands or is it not?",
  "But as far -- as far as the EPA is concerned, they're finished with that question. This is not something that, well, we might look at it again tomorrow based on new evidence. The determination that these are qualifying wetlands -- that has been made.",
  "But the Morgan case involved -- it wasn't a contest between the PTO and the would-be patent holder; it was an interference proceeding, wasn't it?",
  "Ms. Anders, one of the problems with, I think, your position, is it sounds very strange to have two proceedings, one where you go directly to the Federal Circuit under 101 -- 141; and then this other one where you go to the district court, where if that's not, as Judge Newman said, a whole new -- whole new game, then why would Congress create two judicial review routes, one in the district court reviewable in the Federal Circuit, the other directly in the Federal Circuit, if there's no difference? That is, if in both of them, it's not de novo review; it is reviewing what the -- what the agency did under the ordinary standard for reviewing agency action. What's different about the -- the 145 proceeding?",
  "And you were beginning to answer that by saying, well, you can't have oral testimony before the PTO. But what else? I asked you what would be -- what's different about 141 and 145 on your view. And you said one thing is oral testimony. What else?",
  "But you said that you could -- you could go into court on 145 even if you had no new evidence.",
  "So, you do -- in that case, would there be any difference between 141 and 145 other than you go to a different court?",
  "Are there limits on the new evidence that can be produced? Are there any limits, in your view?",
  "And on that I think you -- you're not taking the position that Judge Newman did. I think -- didn't you say that if no new evidence is introduced in a 145 proceeding, then the court engages in APA-style review?",
  "And that -- and that - -",
  "It didn't -- it didn't ignore it. It took it into account along with other plans. My -- Mr. Clement, suppose the D.C. court that has exclusive authority over preclearance in mid-February denies preclearance. And suppose - - suppose we accept your position. You prevail in -- in this proceeding. And then the three-judge district court says this -- this plan -- these plans do not meet the section 5 requirement; we deny preclearance. What happens if we use the Texas plan that has not been precleared as the interim plan?",
  "I don't see how it's basically Upham. That was a plan -- there were two contiguous districts. There was a problem with them. The Attorney General said the rest of it was okay. Here the entire plan -- the plans are -- are opposed.",
  "But the district court in that -- in that scenario is projecting what the D.C. court that has exclusive authority is going to do. And that's why I find your -- your position troublesome. You're asking one court to make its best guess at what another court is likely to do, and that other court has exclusive jurisdiction.",
  "They denied summary judgment. They didn't deny preclearance.",
  "They denied summary judgment.",
  "They did write in a -- in their summary judgment opinion, they made it sound like it's very complicated.",
  "And so, that's why I'm - - I have some doubts about how swiftly they're going to render their decision after -- what is the date? The trial will end on February 3rd?",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Young - -",
  "-- as I understand, the union recognizes that a consequence of mootness would be that the Ninth Circuit judgment is vacated. Now, if the union would also recognize that that means the district court judgment stays in place, so if the Ninth Circuit judgment is worked out and you're left with the district court judgment as the law of the case, then I think it is moot, isn't it?",
  "But it wasn't -- this - - this case is about a completed episode. It's about a special assessment that is long over.",
  "That's another - - something quite different than the capable of returning to old ways, because here we do have a discrete episode that's over. And there was no question that, even though that -- what was it, in 2005 -- that the period in 2005-2006, when the special assessment was in effect, that was long over, but you were -- you were continuing to litigate it. And nobody suggested that it would become moot simply because the period was over.",
  "Well, they said that it had become moot because they gave you all the relief you requested; so, there was nothing left to the case.",
  "General Verrilli, I took it from the briefs and what the FCC has been doing that the major objection is that one cannot tell what's indecent and what isn't; that it's FCC, the censor, that's saying \"Private Ryan\" is okay, \"Schindler's List\" is okay, but \"NYPD Blue\" is not. And I do think that that is the major objection, that we have a government agency that is going to make decisions about when nudity is okay and when it isn't. You can't do it in terms of time because \"New York\" -- the \"NYPD\" was 7 seconds and another broadcast, \"Catch-22,\" was 40 seconds. So, it's -- it's the appearance of arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in concrete situations. That I think is the major flaw.",
  "Well, I'm not so sure because the examples were given of -- I guess excerpts from \"Private Ryan\" and from \"Schindler's List\" have been on television.",
  "If they did an excerpt from \"Hair,\" could they televise that?",
  "In the -- in the opera, in \"The Makropulos Case,\" there's a scene where a woman is seen nude entering a bathtub. And suppose that were shown, that scene from the opera.",
  "You hear them on the street.",
  "But you -- you are saying that the standard can still be symbolic, as Justice Scalia said. We want the King's English when -- the very children we're talking about, when they go on the street, when they -- their big brother says something to them, it is -- the words that were -- the expletives are in common parlance today. I mean, it is -- I think that children -- that children are not going to be shocked by them the way they might have been a generation ago.",
  "Mr. Foreman, I think everyone has been trying to get you to focus on the health care sickness leave alone, and in the -- in the portions of the Act that this Court upheld, the Congress said there is this close association of women with children; we think it's going to be good for everybody if fathers recognize their responsibility for elderly parents, sick children, sick spouse. So, we -- we can see the rationale, trying to change the stereotype, trying to open up caregiving for both sexes. But you have answered the question that women and men get sick; there's no -- there's no disproportion. So, how do you tie that, just -- just that part of the Act, where there -- there isn't the obvious association of women with childbearing? So, we extend the benefit to men so they'll be associated with child care. There isn't that same link here, is there?",
  "What relief did you ask for? Damages, we know, and the -- you have to overcome the Eleventh Amendment. Injunctive relief, you don't, but did you ask for it?",
  "Well, you - -",
  "You must have asked for such other and further relief.",
  "Well, Congress must have thought that giving the woman back her job was an important part. I mean, I thought the whole idea is she wasn't supposed to be fired. So, I think that the - - the relief, the non-monetary relief, is certainly important.",
  "When you -- when you - -",
  "When you say you're concerned about a disincentive to hire women, but the Pregnancy Discrimination Act makes that unlawful. So, if an employer decides I don't want to hire women of child-bearing age, that is an out-and-out violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, isn't it?",
  "But you're relying on the incentive -- the disincentive to hire women of child-bearing age. The law protects the woman of child - bearing age by saying, Employer, you can't refuse to hire her, promote her, and all the rest because of pregnancy.",
  "I'm just asking you about -- your -- your argument rests on an employer acting unlawfully, you see. He won't hire -- we have to give them medical leave, to everyone, because otherwise the employer won't hire women. And that's -- the question I'm asking is, you are assuming that the employer will break the law by refusing to hire women that -- of child-bearing age?",
  "But I -- your argument to a large extent depends -- or you say Congress did this because they wanted to eliminate or at least reduce one kind of discrimination against women in the job market.",
  "And that -- that discrimination was refusing to hire women of child - bearing age. Well, they couldn't do it out and out because that would be a violation of the law. So, is Congress having in mind discrimination that is under - - under the radar screen, that it's going to go on even though it's unlawful?",
  "Need go no further? I'm sorry. I -- I didn't - -",
  "They couldn't -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act says that you have to treat pregnancy like any other disability. So, if they're not giving anybody any leave for anything, they don't have to give any leave; not 12 weeks, not 1 day. And that's what -- that's the gap that this legislation fills. It says, yes, you do have to provide leave for women who have disabling conditions, including pregnancy, but then you have to give that to men as well. You can't reserve that for the one sex. So, it was the gap in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act that this -- this was referring to.",
  "The idea is it's part of one package. I think that's what Justice Breyer was getting at. But just suppose that Congress wanted to improve conditions for the -- in the job market for women, which I think it's fair to say was the motivating force behind this Act, and they also wanted to protect families so that sick children, sick spouses are attended to. Now, what leave policy would say, okay, to do that, we will have leave when a spouse is sick, a child is sick, a parent is sick, but not when the worker herself is sick? Without -- it's all part of one package which is designed to increase job security for women and increase protection for their families. So, I don't think you can slice off (D) from the other three.",
  "Was that -- that wasn't part of the original Act, was it?",
  "And so, it was -- that was -- the concern was a discrete concern for veterans.",
  "In that part.",
  "It wasn't part of the package that was the Family/Medical Leave Act.",
  "But there's some focus in the legislative history particularly on the -- the family that has a single parent -- much more often a woman, not a man -- and the devastating impact on that family of the woman getting sick, the sole breadwinner getting sick. So, that was certainly an -- a problem for families with -- with only one breadwinner. And Congress was focusing on those women and wanting to have job security for them. That wasn't the only group of women, but certainly that -- that affected the -- this Act as it came out, didn't it?",
  "There's a question of how Congress would do it. If they -- if they provided only for the woman who's the single head of the family, then that would be vulnerable under equal protection because they didn't provide it for men.",
  "So, the leave is a remedy for the problem. I think there's really not much disagreement about the problem, that there is gender discrimination in the job market.",
  "And then the question is how do we remedy that?",
  "What happens in the case - -",
  "And the -- and the critical time, then -- I think, isn't it true that most compensation payments are the -- are as a result of voluntary action by the employer and not a proceeding?",
  "So -- and then in those cases, when the employer says, okay, I will voluntarily make this compensation available, then measuring - - the -- the pay would be measured by the time the employer makes -- makes the compensation available, right?",
  "But there's no award.",
  "But we have -- what is - - I mean, there can be. But here's a person who has been injured and gets compensation without having to bring any legal proceeding for it. What is the weekly -- the measure then? It can't be an award, the date of the award, because there is no award. So, what is it?",
  "But your reading doesn't encourage employers to pay, because they can stop just by saying they contest, right?",
  "So -- so, your reading I think leads to protraction. And they get that date of injury rule no matter how long they string it out under your reading. If you read -- what is the magic phrase -- newly - -",
  "You can say, well, that means in the case of the employer who pays promptly, pays immediately and continues to pay voluntarily, that the compensation is acquired when the employer starts paying voluntarily. But if the employer is not paying, then the compensation is newly awarded when there's an award. So, I don't see why -- what kind of problems this statute would have if we say newly awarded could mean awarded by the statute, which would be newly awarded when you're injured; but it can also mean compensation ordered by an award. So, you have the employer who pays promptly can lock in that early date, but if he doesn't pay promptly, the -- then the ceiling is going to go up till the time the award is entered. What's wrong with that reading?",
  "And your answer to the - - to the problem of an employer protracting -- so he doesn't have to pay sooner; he can wait till later -- is there would be no penalty as long as the employer says I'm -- I'm contesting, but you say the attorney's fees, that's -- is that - -",
  "About what percentage of the compensation cases involve the statutory maximum? Because if you -- if your pay is less than the statutory maximum, this issue doesn't come up.",
  "That's across the board, Ms. Millett, the rule you just stated? Is there any situation in which a private attorney engaged to assist a government office in the performance of a public function would lack qualified immunity? Or is it simply wherever a government agency employs a private attorney to assist it in doing its work, that attorney will have qualified immunity?",
  "I thought that in this case the -- the firm that the lawyer was associated with said its dominant business was giving advice to local government, local municipal government units. So - -",
  "There's another part of qualified immunity, and I know it's not teed up in this case, but why is it reasoned decisionmaking to recognize you can't enter a home without a warrant, but you can tell the occupant to bring out every item you want to see? It seems to me that that's not -- that there - - there's clearly established law to say that's wrong.",
  "Why didn't you cross-appeal on the clearly established law? Because then -- then you could concede, so, arguendo, he had qualified immunity, but the advice that he gave was contrary to clearly established law.",
  "Why didn't you bring up that -- that issue?",
  "No, but -- but whether it was clearly established. In other words, what we had here was a recognition: We can't go into the house; we can't go into a house, private house, without a warrant. So -- in fact, Filarsky said something about I know a way -- a way to get around that; we just tell them to bring out the items.",
  "What about -- what about the argument that Filarsky makes, that if there were to be a proceeding against him, inevitably the witnesses would be the government employees? They would be the battalion chiefs, the fire chief. So, one of the reasons for the qualified immunity is you don't want to disturb government employees in the routine performance of their work. Certainly, in this case, there would be disruption, distraction of these government employees.",
  "But he did say that something was unambiguous, and that was the little (i) that was added. And he also said he wasn't taking any position on the '54 code; isn't that so?",
  "He did.",
  "Can you clarify, Mr. Stewart, two things that Justice Breyer brought up? One, he said that the IRS had given people advice that Son of BOSS was okay; it would work -- this tax shelter, this tax scheme, would work. And then he said -- he suggested that a basis is like deductions. And you agree that overstatement of deductions don't get you the longer statute of limitations. So, why -- why should an inflated basis get you to 6 years when inflated deductions don't? That's one question. And the other question is, is it so, that agents told people that Son of BOSS would work? Is - -",
  "But that's got to mean - - that's got to refer to (i). It can't refer to the - - Harlan said two things. He said it's ambiguous; therefore, I'm going to look at the legislative history to find out what the predecessor section means. And then he says: I'm not going to speculate on what this new thing means, but I do want to point out that the result we reach in Colony is in harmony with the unambiguous language of 6501, et cetera. The only unambiguous language that he could be referring to is in (i) because he has just -- he had said the earlier language was ambiguous.",
  "Well, why would they be redundant? I mean, if the statute without little (i) meant what you said it meant, then there would be no occasion to put this in, because \"omission from gross income\" would refer to items of income, period. That's -- so, what work does (i) do, if it just -- if the main rule, the general rule, is as you say it is?",
  "But it also said before that, Mr. Garre, and without doing more than noting the speculative debate between the parties as to whether Congress manifested an intention to clarify or - - clarify or change the 1939 code. So, not taking a position on whether the new section changes the code. And the part that is in harmony -- I can't see how that could be read to mean anything other than the (i), which is unambiguous and certainly in harmony with the result in Colony.",
  "But as I read it, it isn't saying and Colony controls; it's saying we're not going to take a position on what the 1954 code does, whether it clarifies or changes.",
  "But he says \"unambiguous language,\" and he can't mean the general rule because he's already said that is ambiguous. He's got to mean the new provision, which is certainly unambiguous.",
  "But he did say -- he did say he was looking to -- he said the text isn't clear; therefore, I look to the legislative history.",
  "As far as going forward is concerned, that's -- that's just the way it is, right?",
  "Could they -- could they -- the person who -- who is here and then the new law is passed -- could that person have petitioned for discretionary relief before traveling?",
  "But it wasn't before. We -- I think we have held that an immigration lawyer is obliged to tell a defendant faced with a criminal charge what the legal -- what the immigration consequences will be. And here, suppose before the -- at the time of the plea in this case, the attorney had said, once you've served your time, you will be able to take brief casual trips. That would have been accurate advice, right? Before IIRIRA.",
  "But I'm asking you, the lawyer talking to the client -- and the client wants to know before I enter this plea, what will be the consequence for me? And the question that's asked is, will I still be able to visit my mother in Greece? What should the lawyer -- what should the lawyer at that time have answered?",
  "What about the characterization? Which seemed to me to make common sense. Yes, the trigger is that he has gone abroad and is returning. But the target, they say, was the crime. That's why the law -- the law really doesn't care about the travel back and forth; what it cares about is that this person was convicted of a crime.",
  "What about -- there was -- wasn't there in the prior law a child domicile - - a child was able to satisfy the 7-year requirement based on the parent's domicile, which was deemed to be the child's?",
  "Does a child who is not emancipated have the capacity to independently establish a residence?",
  "If the supposition -- if the supposition is that the parents -- I think Justice Breyer's supposition was that both parents were LPRs. The likelihood of the 6-month-old child being born in the United States and therefore being a citizen would be rather large.",
  "They do say - -",
  "In your -- your argument -- under your argument an alien, a child, who never acquired LPR status in its own right could get a cancellation of removal based on the parents' status.",
  "There -- this Court has dealt in the constitutional context with parent-child relationships under the immigration law. And let's take Fiallo v. Bell. There the Court said, well, it tells us that for married parents it's this way, and for a child born out of wedlock, that relationship is something else. That could be considered quite arbitrary when the question is, is the child left orphaned? But the Court said, well, that's what the statute said. It made that distinction, and the Court upheld it. But there are a number of cases where there is -- the statute does say, parent-child relationship, this is imputed, that is not, and dealt -- the Court dealt with that in Miller and Nguyen.",
  "What do you do -- what you do if the parents -- the father is an LPR, the mother is not? Do we then impute to the child the father's status? The couple is not married.",
  "They have joint custody. They live together. They're just not married.",
  "Well, I think it was agreed that -- that LPR status would be necessary. At least, Mr. Kinnaird said that.",
  "So, we're talking about the 5-year period and the 7-year period. The child would have to have LPR status.",
  "But you can be a resident without being a domiciliary?",
  "Mr. Russell, when you say the agency in charge, am I right in thinking that HUD and its successor -- they don't have any suit-commencement authority?",
  "For injunctive relief?",
  "But they're -- but the purchaser is the giver, and the statute reads, \"No person shall give and no person shall accept.\" The acceptor is the loan company. The person who is giving would be the consumer, the customer.",
  "But -- so, the person who gives is -- is not answerable under your reading of this (b)?",
  "But then we have Quicken as the giver and the person who receives the referral or kickback as the receiver.",
  "Mr. Russell, there's one puzzling aspect of -- of your interpretation. It would be a rather large thing for Congress to say we're going to cover overcharges, as I believe HUD says is -- counts; and yet, in the -- in the purposes of the Act on page 1 of the appendix, it says nothing about overcharges, nothing about payment for a service not received in the -- in the four -- \"it is the purpose of the Act to,\" and then there are four things listed, and none of those say to stop charges for services that weren't performed.",
  "But that is -- that is HUD's interpretation?",
  "But you -- you are now splitting HUD's position. HUD's position says overcharges are reached by the statute. You say not overcharges, but only a fee when no service is performed. So, why couldn't the customers have said there is a fee for the service performed, that's the reasonable fee; and the rest of it is a charge for a service not performed? I mean, can you really maintain that distinction between an overcharge and a fee for services that are not performed?",
  "Then why is the statute labeled, titled, \"Prohibition Against Kickbacks\" -- that's one thing -- \"and Unearned Fees\"? What -- how do you -- what does \"unearned fees\" refer to in the title of 2607?",
  "Did you give a complete answer to the question what does (b) cover that (a) does not? So, one suggestion that's made is, well, you didn't -- if all this statute has to do -- do with is kickbacks, then all you need is (a), and there's no necessity for (b). You said one thing is contract, proving a contract, and not -- is there anything else?",
  "Where do you get --",
  "Where is that in the policy statement? The difference between unearned and --",
  "What of the document that's -- that's read out in open court and it's a document, a contract, in another language, and the interpreter -- the witness presents the document, and the interpreter interprets it?",
  "Well, what if the -- if the interpreter, being diligent, said I'm going to have to translate this document in open court, I'd like to have it in advance so I can be sure that my translation is going to be accurate? So that in fact the interpreter looks at the document and, in -- in preparation for the trial, translates it.",
  "What about depositions? The -- the translation would be of the spoken word, but it wouldn't be in court.",
  "Mr. Himmelfarb, in section 1920, there are two provisions that specify costs necessarily obtained for use in the case. And the interpreter provision doesn't have that qualification, doesn't say \"necessarily obtained for use in the case.\"",
  "You are asking to read \"interpreter\" to mean \"translator\" as well and to import into sub (6) \"necessary for use in the case.\"",
  "Is that -- is that altogether clear, because she first said -- didn't she first say that the jury cannot agree on any one charge?",
  "But then they went -- then they went out again.",
  "And that's the problem. They, the jury -- the judge gave them an Allen charge, and they went out again. And I think you have recognized that the jury could have then said we'll go back to square one, we'll consider capital murder, first-degree murder. So, they -- I think you recognize that after the judge gives them a charge of this kind, they can begin all over again. And here, when they came in and said we -- we can't agree, defense counsel didn't ask to have the jury polled.",
  "General McDaniel, in this case, they deliberated for 4-1/2 hours at the point where the judge asked them where do you stand on this count; where do you stand on that? And so, they were up to the manslaughter, and they were stuck on that. And the jury foreman said we can't go to negligent homicide because we haven't reached agreement on -- on the manslaughter charge. Then they go back for just a half hour. How realistic is it to think that they began over at that point, rather than trying to resolve the manslaughter charge so they could do exactly what the judge told them, and then get to the negligent homicide charge?",
  "Mr. Sloan told us that it was the State that prevented the elucidation because defense counsel said: Judge, we can try to do what Double Jeopardy Clause says, not try a person twice for the same offense. So, Judge, please ask the jury to rule on those two -- give them a sheet that gives them a choice of guilty or not guilty. But they went -- that originally was just a series of guilty on the four counts, and then their other choice was acquittal. Now, defense counsel says, ask them, is it guilty or not guilty, instead of asking just is it guilty. And the judge declines to do that. Isn't that why we don't have definitive answers? Because defense counsel says -- said, Judge, give the jury the chance to tell us whether they --",
  "Well -- she had asked; so, why was it necessary for her to repeat it? And she said, Judge, please let them vote yes or no on the -- the two most serious charges. And the judge said no. She might have figured if she was going to repeat that, she would just annoy the judge. She had made the -- she had made the request.",
  "Suppose -- suppose, General Verrilli, that the decorations were left out and Congress had said we don't like people saying that they were in the Marine Corps for 25 years when they never served for a single day in any armed force. So, they have a statute just like this one, but it is directed to the false claim that one has served in the armed forces. I don't see in your argument that there's something special about the decorations.",
  "Well, the assumption -­ the assumption is that it's false. That was -- and that it's not so hard to find out if somebody claims to have the Medal of Honor and he doesn't. So that -- first, you answered yes, that it's only self, and now you said, no, it's -- it can be -- or at least I think you said -­ making a false statement of fact. And the concern is -­ and I gave you the question of just in service, leaving out the -- the decorations -- other statements of fact, false statements like \"I deny that the Holocaust ever occurred.\" That's a statement -- a false statement of fact, isn't it?",
  "Did the military -- did the military ask for this? You're claiming there's a special interest in seeing that a military honor is not debased.",
  "Why? I mean, it's expressive. One is I am speaking through conduct, and the other is I'm speaking through words. You wear the medal and you're saying I am a Medal of Honor winner.",
  "So, you think that the wearing -­",
  "-- that the wearing of a military decoration that you haven't earned, that that's also of questionable consistency with the First Amendment?",
  "No circumstances. Where you go out in the street with the -- with the medal on you for everybody to see.",
  "But the Government has said that's not how we read the statute. And the courts read statutes to avoid a constitutional collision. So, let's assume that we are not going to cover performances, satire. It's just a bald-faced lie. That's all that this covers.",
  "Suppose -- suppose the statute were amended, as has been proposed, to require an intent to obtain anything of value.",
  "But that wouldn't -- that wouldn't reach this speaker. Is that -- is that -- that wouldn't reach Alvarez because he didn't obtain anything of value.",
  "Well, it is -- it is what the -- swords are crossed over here because you say this is a deliberate waiver, and the government says, no, it's -- it's a forfeiture, and forfeiture -- if it's forfeiture, then the court of appeals has discretion to take it up. If it's a waiver, then Day makes clear -- so, it's a question of which box this case fits into: Is it forfeiture or is it waiver? And your position is it's waiver.",
  "But you had two opportunities at least to make the argument based on the original postconviction motion, the 1995 postconviction motion. You -- you did not raise that. You were silent twice.",
  "Well, then, I'm confused because I thought that there was -- it was conceded that the question was asked, did you file another postconviction motion? Answer: No.",
  "But this wasn't failure to raise an argument; this was representing to the court we will not challenge timeliness. That was the representation made to the court. That was not negligent oversight in not raising the question. It was an affirmative representation to the court that, although we might have done it, we will not challenge timeliness.",
  "But the consequence of that was the district court then had to deal with the case on the merits, had to take up the two exhausted claims and rule on them, after having told the district court you don't need -- we're not raising the statute of limitations, we will not challenge timeliness. So, you put the district court to the necessity of deciding the case on the merits. It does. It takes up the two unexhausted claims and deals with them on the merits. In -- in Day, absolutely nothing transpired between the State saying the claim was timely and the magistrate's detection of the computation error. The district court wasn't put to what was unnecessary work. If the -- it was the consequence of saying we won't challenge it that forced the district judge to deal with them on the merits. In Day, the counsel didn't bring up the question because counsel thought that it was timely. He had miscalculated and made a mathematical error. And the judge then said, you know, I see that the number of days that's required by statute, they have run. And as Day pointed out, at that point, the trial judge could have said: Now, you know, you miscalculated; wouldn't you like to amend your complaint and put it in a defense? So, the two cases, the two situations are -- are so different. The district judge wasn't -- nobody was made to do anything extra. But in -- here, because the attorney said we won't challenge it, the judge had to deal with the case on the merits.",
  "There is something about the principle of party presentation. The party raises the issue. The court of appeals is the court of review, not first view. Here -- in Day, the -- the lawyer did not know that he had a statute of limitations defense, that -- did not know because he had miscalculated the time. Here the State knew very well that it did have a statute of limitations argument, but it says we're not challenging it. And then the ordinary thing is that a court of appeals reviews decisions of the district court; doesn't decide questions in the first instance. But here you are saying the attorney can tell district judge don't decide this; go on to the merits. Then the court of appeals, which is supposed to be reviewing what the district court does, instead deals with that question in the first instance. That seems like an odd inversion of the role of the -- of the district court and court of appeals.",
  "You didn't say we're going to refrain from it. You said, District Judge, Your Honor, we will not challenge timeliness.",
  "Didn't have any qualifications.",
  "And the difference is that in Day counsel didn't know that he had a statute of limitations defense. So -- but the court suggested it. In this case, the defendant -- I mean, the -- the attorney knew, the State's attorney knew, they had a statute of limitations defense and nonetheless told the court we won't challenge timeliness. It seems a big difference between the factual background of Day, where the lawyer didn't know there was a statute of limitations defense, and this one, where the lawyer knew very well there was and decided to tell the district court not to -- not to deal with that issue.",
  "Except we have a system where the court doesn't raise issue on its own. The ordinary rule is the party presents it, and when the party says to the court we will not challenge timeliness, it seems to me that's quite a different thing from just having an answer that doesn't raise the defense. It's affirmatively representing to the court that we -- we are not making this an issue.",
  "But Day did say that if -- if a party knowingly waives a limitations defense, then no court can bring it up. The party has made the choice.",
  "Are you -- you're talking --",
  "Mr. Schwartz, I thought you're talking about the constitutionality of a statute.",
  "Not any constitutional claim that there has been unconstitutional action by an official. I thought that your point was when you're challenging the constitutionality of a statute, then you have a right to go to the district court.",
  "I thought your position was that the Merit Systems Protection Board has said we have no authority to adjudicate constitutional questions, period.",
  "So, I thought that the court was saying this claim is dismissed because we don't have jurisdiction to deal with that kind of question. And then your next -- the Federal Circuit -- well, how can the Federal Circuit exercise jurisdiction over a claim where the first-instance decisionmaker said it didn't have authority to render the decision?",
  "I thought that that's what your position was.",
  "I thought your position was that whatever the MSPB cannot hear, then you can go to the district court.",
  "Do you take the position that the MSPB, having no jurisdiction and saying it has no jurisdiction, it can't adjudicate this matter, well, then, a reviewing court has no jurisdiction to -- to review? There's nothing to review because the MSPB said we have no jurisdiction.",
  "I thought that your point was and hasn't the Federal Circuit said that the MSPB has no jurisdiction to decide we have no jurisdiction to review.",
  "And that an appellate court is reviewing a court of first instance. The scheme that has been proposed would turn the Federal Circuit into a court of first instance, rather than an appellate court.",
  "I thought you said this one.",
  "This one, because you want to make a record of all the changes that have occurred in the service, and you need much more than briefs. You need to have maybe testimony from people who have -- who have been working with the changes in the -- in the opportunities for women in service.",
  "I thought your whole point was --",
  "Mr. Feigin, those -- those statutes to which you refer said that no action on the claim -- well, this was Social Security benefits -- no action shall be brought under 1331. There is no such provision here.",
  "Can you go back and tell me when the government changed its position? It was my understanding that up until, well, certainly this case was litigated, the government was taking the position MSPB has no jurisdiction to pass on the constitutionality of a statute. When did the government back away from that position? When did it say, no, we were wrong; they do have jurisdiction?",
  "Is there any such possibility in this case? I mean, the statute says men must register for the draft. There's no way to avoid -- to reread that statute to say anything other than that. So, I don't -- I don't see any constitutional avoidance.",
  "Johnson v. Robison is one such case. I don't recall in that case anybody referring to any administrative law treatise.",
  "Do you know of any other -- any other case where an appellate court has authority to decide a question that the court of first instance lacked authority to decide? I mean, you say MSPB says it has no authority, and you agree with that. I couldn't think of another case where a court of appeals, which is a court of review, not first view, substitutes itself for an incompetent court of first instance.",
  "Where did -- where did Salfi go? The agency couldn't decide the constitutional question. So, what's the next stop? Was it a court of appeals or the district court?",
  "Yes.",
  "Not on the constitutional question.",
  "Why? The district court is -- that's what it's equipped to do. That's what it does all the time. And --",
  "Mr. Hoffman --",
  "Mr. Hoffman, I -- I thought that Justice Kennedy asked you, is there another nation that has a counterpart to 1350 that imposes civil liability on corporations for violations of customary international law, where the conduct occurred abroad, the harmed person is employed, and the defendant is not a U.S. resident?",
  "That sounds --",
  "That sounds very much like Filartiga. And I thought that -- that Sosa accepted that Filartiga would be a viable action under the Tort Claims Act. So, I thought what we were talking about today, the question was, is it only individual defendants or are corporate defendants also liable?",
  "But this statute doesn't use the word \"individual,\" and it doesn't use the word \"person.\" As far as a corporate entity is concerned, a corporate -- a corporation could sue, could be a plaintiff under the Alien Tort Statute, could it not? There's no --",
  "What happened to I.G. Farben? I thought that it was dissolved and its assets taken.",
  "But there's no -- there was no civil liability adjudicated in Nuremberg. It was about criminal.",
  "If you look --",
  "If you look to the law of the place where the corporation is headquartered, well, suppose that has a typical respondeat superior liability that says corporations are liable for the acts of their agents. So -- and most -- correct me if I'm wrong, I think most countries in the world have such a notion, that corporate -- corporations are responsible for the acts of their agents. So, how does the -- looking to the law where the corporation is headquartered, where does that get you when that country has the very same law that we do, that, yes, corporations are liable for the acts of their agents?",
  "Ms. Sullivan, and I'm -- in Sosa, as I understand it, it's all about what is the conduct that falls under this law of nations. It is not about who is the actor subject to that law. Sosa is dealing with what kinds of conduct come within the Alien Tort Statute. It -- it doesn't consider the question of what actor; that wasn't before the Court. What was before the Court is what kind of activity violates, is contrary to, the law of nations.",
  "I assume the United States has taken that into account. I mean, for you to -- representing the corporations to say what is in the interests of the United States, when the United States representative told us they think that individuals and corporations are both subject to suit.",
  "I thought they rejected civil liability for everyone. It wasn't limited to corporations.",
  "I thought Justice -- Judge Edwards' opinion was about politically motivated terrorists not coming within the Alien Tort Statute.",
  "But there were --",
  "There were witnesses who testified, were there not, Mr. Fisher, that the TVPA would take care of a Filartiga type case, that when the torturer shows up physically -- those were the words that were used -- the torturer comes into the state, into the United States, is physically present in the United States. That was the model that at least those witnesses had in mind, and some of them were quite distinguished witnesses.",
  "But you found no tort --",
  "-- no tort statute uses the \"individual\" to include organizations.",
  "How many judgments under -- I don't know whether it's Filartiga or Filartiga -- that -- that pattern, where the individual torturer is found in a U.S. jurisdiction?",
  "There have been many judgments; how many have collected?",
  "Well, wouldn't -- if Congress really wanted to have this, why wouldn't it include entity liability? The corporation is likely to have more money than -- than an individual torturer.",
  "What about the point that the immigration law takes care of that? They wouldn't be able to get into the country.",
  "Mr. Stancil, who are \"these people\"? We have the plaintiffs in this suit, and there's a judgment -- there was a judgment in the court of first instance and the appellate court for a dollar amount, but we're told that there are many more of these Barrett Law projects and that they all operate the same way. So, the result is a lot more money than these plaintiffs are claiming; is that not so? If your position on the law is right.",
  "Why isn't that a choice for the legislature? Because everybody could be treated equally by getting their money back, or nobody gets out from under the old system. So, why shouldn't that be -­ the decision is you can't treat these two groups of people differently. So, I think the Court has said in a number of cases you can equalize up or down. That is a legislative choice.",
  "They said it could go either way.",
  "It was up to the Oklahoma legislature. They could make it 21 for everyone or 18 for everyone.",
  "Those are -- those are obviously meant to deal with -- with children whose parents are not married.",
  "Mr. Miller, there's one provision in (h) that's puzzling, and maybe you can tell me what it means. It's at (h)(2)(A), and it's the last sentence of (A). It says: \"Applicants who according to State law would have the same status relative to taking intestate personal property as a child ... shall be deemed such.\" What person is that referring to? Someone who is not a child but has the same status as a child?",
  "Anyone else or just that category?",
  "It -- it was addressed in the Ninth -- in the Ninth Circuit decision, wasn't it?",
  "But the words -- you say this is plain meaning. It says the child of a wage earner, an individual; a child -- it seems to me you are importing the term \"married,\" because someone can be the undisputed child of a wage earner who is unmarried. So, it's not a question of disputed versus undisputed. A wage earner can have a child, undisputed that the wage earner is the parent, but the wage earner is not married.",
  "But I thought we weren't supposed to look to (h) at all. I mean, your thesis is (e) covers it --",
  "-- and there's no reason to refer to (h).",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, don't you run into a problem? Perhaps not in 1939, but since then this Court has had a number of decisions that deal with the distinction between children born in and out of wedlock, and in some of those cases, it has held that the distinction between the two is unconstitutional, that there are no illegitimate children. All children are legitimate, whatever their parents may be.",
  "Yes, but if we are going to apply those equal protection decisions to this statute --",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, these children were born 18 months after the insured wage earner died. If we look to other categories of children, say, stepchildren -- and there is also one for adopted children. For stepchildren, they qualify only if they had that status no less than 9 months before the wage earner died, and adopted children is also a limitation. The stepchild and the adopted child -- there could never be any question of being born 18 months later. They wouldn't qualify. There's -- there is a time limit for the other children. And if Congress had thought about this problem, maybe it would have put a time limit on this, too.",
  "Well, that would be fine if the statute said what you claim it says. It says a child is a child of a wage earner. And you'd have to import these things that Congress didn't say to get to what you claim is the plain meaning. But what do you do with the sentence in (h)(2)(A) that says \"in determining whether an applicant is a child of an insured individual for purposes of this subchapter\"? The subchapter is not for purposes of (h), but for purposes of the entire subchapter, which would include (e).",
  "But how could it do that when the rest of the sentence says, \"to determine whether an applicant is a child for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner shall apply the State law of intestacy\"?",
  "Well, if we're going back to 1939 understanding, wasn't it also understood that the marriage ends when a parent dies?",
  "So, there wouldn't be -- a child that's born 18 months after the father died wouldn't be considered a child of a marriage because the marriage would have ended.",
  "But it's not -- the jury didn't say that the defendant was in violation only 1 day. It said it was in violation within this span of many months, and it didn't say how many days. It didn't say whether it was every day or 1 day or 10 days. It just didn't focus on the number of days. But it didn't find they were in violation only 1 day, which is what your opening statement was.",
  "Was there an objection at trial to the charge on the ground that it didn't instruct the jury to find the number of days of violation?",
  "What do you make of this old case that the Government cites, U.S. v. Tyler? And it was the question of -- the penalty was four times the value of the goods, and this Court said the judge, not the jury, is responsible for imposing the fine and, therefore, also for determining the value of the goods.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, I think the reference -- it was a fleeting reference to fines, and it could have meant that the judge has discretion to set the fine up to the maximum in the statute. That's one possible meaning.",
  "What about the amount of loss issue that Justice Breyer raised, was very complicated to determine what the amount of the loss is?",
  "If we --",
  "If -- on the question of the value of goods or the amount of the loss, what would the standard be? Would the jury have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that it was -- that the value was such and such?",
  "Mr. Stevenson, but in Roper, the Court also made the point -- when it ruled out the death penalty, it said, \"To the extent the juvenile death penalty might have residual deterrent effect, it is worth noting that the punishment of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is itself a severe sanction.\" So, the Court in Roper seemed to be anticipating this case and suggesting that -- that it was all right, it was constitutional.",
  "Would that satisfy you if the -- if it were not a mandatory term and it was left to the trier, and you could put in all the mitigating circumstances?",
  "Or you could say you reserve that question for another day.",
  "Mr. Stevenson, may I ask you a case -- a question specifically about the Miller case? There were two boys involved in this horrendous crime. The older one took a plea and got life with parole. Was the plea offered to Miller?",
  "Was it -- was it a factor in Miller's case? Was there a lesser -- lesser offense that was charged?",
  "He was -- the -- there was also a felony murder charge in the Miller case?",
  "Is --",
  "Is it taken into account when the -- the child is in the juvenile system initially, has to be moved to the adult system. Is the judgment -- is there any cutoff on the transfer? Or can a child be transferred to the adult system at any age?",
  "So, if you're -- if you're under 14, you can't be transferred out of the juvenile system?",
  "So, if he were only 13, he would get out when? When he was 21?",
  "That's in -- in the Jackson case. In the Jackson case, the crime was very similar to --",
  "Mr. Stevenson, you're making an argument now in Jackson's case, and Jackson was the felony murder case. And I think at least in your brief, you made the argument it was just happenstance, bad luck, that in Jackson's case the shop attendant was killed. And in Graham's case, the person who was assaulted survived. But your argument to us seems to make no distinction between the two cases.",
  "What is the standard in Arkansas for moving a child from the juvenile system? We heard, I think, in Alabama it was -- was age 13?",
  "It was age 12.",
  "You say the sanctity of human life, but you're dealing with a 14-year-old being sentenced to life in prison, so he will die in prison without any hope. I mean, essentially, you're making a 14-year-old a throwaway person.",
  "Did you say that Arkansas has no life with parole?",
  "But that's not available to an adult. That's only in the --",
  "Well, you're -- and you're agreeing with the dissenting judge, who I think did say this error is harmful.",
  "And so, you're not saying that it's just that they didn't use the right formula, but you would say, given what occurred here, the importance of this witness, that -- that this was a -- this was a harmful error?",
  "I thought -- I thought your main point -- yes, you said \"this jury\" rather than a hypothetical jury. But I thought your main point is that what's wrong is to say strip out the infected testimony, take that out, look at the rest of the record, and if the rest of the record warrants conviction, no harmless error. I thought that what you're saying is that the basic mistake is what -- what are they looking to; are they looking to all of the evidence, or are they just asking the question, let's take out the tainted evidence, see if there's enough to convict?",
  "But, Mr. Yang --",
  "You're going back then to your position in your brief where you said that you would not include, in the harmless-error calculus, that the jury requested to hear Marina's testimony again, the length of their deliberations, the divided verdict? You said in your brief, at pages 32 to 35, that you would not include those.",
  "But I thought you answered Justice Kagan that you could take them into account, the court could take them into account but cautiously, not give them -- not give them undue weight.",
  "You would -- you would take into account that the prosecution apparently thought this was important, so important. The trial was over. The prosecutor said: Judge, I'd like to come back so these tapes can be introduced. That -- the -- we have the witness testifying that defendant is there by chance; he was not part of the scheme. We have no direct evidence, because Cruz never spoke to this defendant, to Vasquez. He's at the scene, we know that. And an explanation, an innocent explanation, is given why he's at the scene. And then the government comes back, after everything is done, and says: We want the jury -- we want these tapes to be before the jury. Isn't that -- don't we take into account that the government itself thought this was very important?",
  "But my point to you is it wasn't fleeting if the government says we want to extend the trial so that we can play these tapes, all of them. And they contain not just the one statement. There's the one statement that the trial will be bad, a trial will be bad for all of them, and they all -- that -- they should take a blind plea.",
  "What was --",
  "What was the line that the government, the prosecutor, repeated three times while she was on the stand, the exact line?",
  "Yes.",
  "The government thought -- thought it was important for the jury to hear it, because they said it three times.",
  "But you -- you are essentially saying, as I understand you, that if there was such a thing as a directed verdict in a criminal case, if the judge would say, you know, I will direct a verdict here because there's only one way a rational -- rational jury could come out.",
  "And you read --",
  "You do agree -- you do agree that the government has the burden of showing that the error is harmless?",
  "It's the government's burden. And you also agree that we should look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant in making --",
  "So, what does it mean that the government has the burden? What does the government have to do?",
  "The absent error. So, that means -- wait. You look at just the evidence that's not tainted?",
  "What was the probable --",
  "What was the probable cause? What was the probable cause for the arrest?",
  "Explain that to me. That's a false statement to a government officer, but that's not the reason -- 1001 wasn't the reason that these officers had to arrest. They -- there was a question of assaulting the Vice President, and I think that the charge that eventually was made in the State court was harassment. So, there's no indication that these officers had 1001 anywhere in their minds.",
  "You're not suggesting absolute immunity?",
  "But it's a different kind of qualified immunity?",
  "Even though this -- I think in Hartman, Justice Souter gave two specific reasons, neither of which apply in this context. I mean, this is -- it's the prosecutor who institutes the charges, but the suit is not against the prosecutor, who would be absolutely immune. So, that is not in this picture. Here we have one officer. So, it would certainly be an extension of Hartman because the reason that Hartman gave for the rule was tied to -- very much tied to prosecution rather than arrest.",
  "May I go back to the probable cause, the question I asked before? It's not like the taillight. 1001 came up in court. I -- this situation may well have warranted probable cause for assault, probable cause for harassment. But where did -- but the 1001 was not the -- was in no one's mind. It does seem quite strange.",
  "But doesn't it matter that it's something that comes up only in court; it's not something that -- I mean, why wasn't the natural -- well, one would expect probable cause to arrest because it was an assault or harassment -- the actual charges that were made?",
  "But it's ambivalent. I mean, suppose it turns out you have this trial. We know what words were spoken. Get to the trial; it turns out Reichle is a strong opponent of the war in Vietnam. Then, end of trial, right?",
  "Mr. Long, why don't we simply follow the statutory language? I know that you've argued that the Davis case has been overtaken by later cases, but the language of the Anti-Injunction Act is \"no suit shall be maintained.\" It's remarkably similar to the language in -- that was at issue in Reed Elsevier: \"No civil action for infringement ... shall be instituted.\" And that formulation, \"no suit may be maintained,\" contrasts with the Tax Injunction Act. It says the district court shall not enjoin. That Tax Injunction Act is the same pattern as 2283, which says \"courts of the United States may not stay a proceeding in State court.\" So, both of those formulas, the TIA and the no injunction against proceedings at State court, are directed to \"court.\" The Anti-Injunction Act, like the statute at issue in Reed Elsevier, says \"no suit shall be maintained.\" And it has been argued that that is suitor-directed in contrast to court-directed.",
  "But how is that different from \"no civil action for infringement shall be instituted\" -- \"maintained\" and \"instituted\"? Anything turn on that?",
  "Mr. Long - -",
  "Mr. Long, you said before -- and I think you were quite right -- that the Tax Injunction Act is modeled on the Anti-Injunction Act. And, under the Tax Injunction Act, what -- what can't be enjoined is an assessment for the purpose of raising revenue. The Tax Injunction Act does not apply to penalties that are designed to induce compliance with the law, rather than to raise revenue. And this is not a revenue-raising measure because, if it's successful, they -- nobody will pay the penalty, and there will be no revenue to raise.",
  "Mr. Long, there's another argument that has been made that I would like you to address, and that is all this talk about tax penalty - - it's all beside the point because this suit is not challenging the penalty. This is a suit that is challenging the must-buy provision, and the argument is made that, if, indeed, \"must-buy\" is constitutional, then these complainants will not resist the penalty. So, what they're seeking is a determination that the \"must-buy\" requirement, stated separately from the penalty, that the \"must-buy\" is unconstitutional. And, if that's so, that's the end of the case; if it's not so, they're not resisting the penalty.",
  "If that's -- if that's the problem, it's easy to amend a complaint. They can just take that out of the complaint. So, it can't turn on that.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, a basic question about your argument: If you're right about the second part, that is, for purposes of the statute, the Anti-Injunction statute, this penalty does not constitute a tax, then does the Court need to decide whether the Anti-Injunction Act in other cases, where it does involve a tax, is jurisdictional?",
  "But the question that I asked you is, if you're right that this penalty is not covered by section 7421, if you're right about that, why should we deal with the jurisdictional question at all? Because this statute, correct, the way you're reading - - read it doesn't involve a tax that's subject to the Anti-Injunction Act.",
  "So -- so, you agree that we would not -- if we agree with you about the correct interpretation of the statute, we need not decide the jurisdiction.",
  "How likely is it - -",
  "How likely is it -- I mean, the government is going to be defending these suits. How likely is it that the government will overlook the Anti-Injunction Act? So, it seems to me that this is arming the government by saying it's waivable at the government's option.",
  "Why isn't Reed Elsevier -- if you're dividing jurisdiction from claims processing -- it says you have to register before you can sue. There are a lot of things you have to do before you can sue. So, why isn't Reed Elsevier like you have to pay a filing fee before you can file a complaint?",
  "On your statutory construction argument, is there any other exaction imposed under the Internal Revenue Code that would not qualify as a tax for Anti-Injunction Act purposes, or is 5000A just out there all by itself?",
  "They are different things.",
  "This says \"Immediately\" -- the Reed Elsevier statute says immediately after instituted unless a copyright is registered.",
  "So, why isn't that like the filing fee? Before you can maintain a suit for copyright infringement, you have to register your copyright?",
  "Why would - -",
  "Why would somebody not choose to obtain it? Why -- that's one puzzle to me. There's this category of people who are Medicaid eligible; Medicaid doesn't cost them anything. Why would they resist enrolling?",
  "But it may be just that they haven't been given sufficient information to understand that this is a benefit for them.",
  "If you're going to have insurance, that's how insurance works.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, I thought that your main point is that, unlike food or any other market, when you made the choice not to buy insurance, even though you have every intent in the world to self-insure, to save for it, when disaster strikes, you may not have the money. And the tangible result of it is -- we were told -- there was one brief that Maryland hospital care bills 7 percent more because of these uncompensated costs, that families pay a thousand dollars more than they would if there were no uncompensated costs. I thought what was unique about this is it's not my choice whether I want to buy a product to keep me healthy, but the cost that I am foisting on other people if I don't buy the product sooner rather than later.",
  "General Verrilli, can we go --",
  "Can we go back to -- Justice Breyer asked a question, and it kind of interrupted your answer to my question. And tell me if I'm wrong about this, but I thought a major, major point of your argument was that the people who don't participate in this market are making it much more expensive for the people who do; that is, they will get -- a goodly number of them will get services that they can't afford at the point when they need them, and the result is that everybody else's premiums get raised. So, you're not -- it's not your free choice just to do something for yourself. What you do is going to affect others, affect them in a major way.",
  "But yesterday you told me -- you listed a number of penalties that are enforced through the tax code that are not taxes, and they're not penalties related to taxes.",
  "Well, isn't -- a tax is to raise revenue. A tax is a revenue-raising device, and the purpose of this exaction is to get people into the health care risk pool before they need medical care. And so, it will be successful if it doesn't raise any revenue, if it gets people to buy the insurance. That's -- that's what this penalty is -- this penalty is designed to affect conduct. The conduct is buy health protection, buy health insurance before you have a need for medical care. That's what the penalty is designed to do, not to raise revenue.",
  "Mr. Clement, doesn't that work -- that work the way Social Security does? Let me put it this way: Congress, in the '30s, saw a real problem of people needing to have old age and survivor's insurance. And, yes, they did it through a tax, but they said everybody has got to be in it because if we don't have the healthy in it, there's not going to be the money to pay for the ones who become old or disabled or widowed. So, they required everyone to contribute. There was a big fuss about that in the beginning because a lot of people said -- maybe some people still do today -- I could do much better if the government left me alone. I'd go into the private market, I'd buy an annuity, I'd make a great investment, and they're forcing me to pay for this Social Security that I don't want. But that's constitutional. So, if Congress could see this as a problem where we need to have a group that will subsidize the ones who are going to get the benefits, it seems to me you're saying the only way that could be done is if the government does it itself; it can't involve the private market, it can't involve the private insurers. If it wants to do this, Social Security is its model. The government has to do -- has to be government takeover. We can't have the insurance industry in it. Is that your position?",
  "I thought you --",
  "But the problem is --",
  "The problem is that they are making the rest of us pay for it, because as much as they say, well, we're not in the market, we don't know when they -- the timing when they will be.",
  "And the -- the figures of how much more families are paying for insurance because people get sick, they may have intended to self-insure, they haven't been able to meet the bills for -- for cancer, and the rest of us end up paying because the -- people are getting cost-free health care. And the only way to prevent that is to have them pay sooner rather than later, pay up front.",
  "Well, let me -- let me ask a question that I asked Mr. Clement. It just seems --",
  "It just seems very strange to me that there's no question we can have a Social Security system -- besides all the people who say I am being forced to pay for something I don't want -­ and this, which seems to me, to try to get care for the ones who need it by having everyone in the pool, but is also trying to preserve a role for the private sector, for the private insurers. There's something very odd about that, that the government can take over the whole thing and we all say, oh, yes, that's fine. But if the government wants to get -- to preserve private insurers, it can't do that.",
  "I thought -- I thought that Wickard was you must buy; we're not going to let you use the home-grown wheat. You've got to go out in the market and buy that wheat that you don't want.",
  "I thought that it --",
  "It was common ground that the requirement that the insurers -- what was it -- the community-based one, and you -- they have to insure you despite your health status; they can't refuse because of pre-existing conditions. The Government tells us and Congress determined that those two won't work unless you have a pool that will include the people who are now healthy. But -- so -- well, first, do you agree with your colleague that the community-based -- and what's the name that they give to the other?",
  "Yes. That that is legitimate Commerce Clause legislation?",
  "Well then, what about the determination that they can't possibly work if people don't have to buy insurance until they are -- their health status is such that the insurance company just dealt with them on its -- as it will? They'd say, I won't insure you because you're -- you're already sick.",
  "But how about the sick people? Why would they insure early if they were going to be protected if they get insurance late?",
  "Well, we all --",
  "Mr. Clement, there are so many things in this Act that are unquestionably okay. I think you would concede that reauthorizing -- what is it -- the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, changes to the Black Lung benefits. Why make Congress redo those? I mean, it's a question of whether we say everything you did is no good, now start from scratch, or to say, yes, there are many things in here that have nothing to do, frankly, with the affordable health care, and there are some that we think it's better to let Congress to decide whether it wants them in or out. So, why should we say it's a choice between a wrecking operation, which is what you are requesting, or a salvage job? And the more conservative approach would be salvage rather than throwing out everything.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, it's not a choice between someone else bringing the case and a law staying in place. And what we're really talking about, as Justice Sotomayor started this discussion, is who is the proper party to take out what isn't infected by the Court's holding? With all these provisions where there may be no standing, one institution clearly does have standing, and that's Congress. And if Congress doesn't want the provisions that are not infected to stand, Congress can take care of it. It's a question of which side -- should the Court say we're going to wreck the whole thing, or should the Court leave it to Congress?",
  "You're relying on Congress's quite explicitly tying these three things together.",
  "One of the points that Mr. Kneedler made is that the price won't be affordable because the -- he spoke of the adverse selection problem, that there would be so fewer people in there, the insurance companies are going to have to raise the premiums. So, it's nice that Congress made it possible for more people to be covered, but the reality is they won't because they won't be able to afford the premium.",
  "Isn't that true of every Medicaid increase, that each time -- I mean, and this started quite many years ago, and Congress has added more people and given more benefits -- and every time, the condition is, if you want the Medicaid program, this is the program. Take it or leave it.",
  "Mr. Clement, may I -- may I ask you -- question another line? You represent, what, 26 States?",
  "And we're also told that there are other States that like this expansion, and they are very glad to have it. The relief that you're seeking is to say the whole expansion is no good, never mind that there are States that say we don't feel coerced, we think this is good. You are -- you're saying that because you represent a sizeable number of States, you can destroy this whole program, even though there may be as many States that want it, that don't feel coerced, that say -- think this is a good thing?",
  "Let -- let me ask you another thing, Mr. -- Mr. Clement. Most colleges and universities are heavily dependent on the government to fund their research programs and other things, and that's been going on for a long time. And then Title IX passes, and a government official comes around and say -- says to these colleges, if you want money for your physics labs and all the other things you get it for, then you have to create an athletic program for girls. And the recipient says I am being coerced, there's no way in the world I can give up all the funds to run all these labs that we have. I can't give it up, so I'm being coerced to accept this program that I don't want. Why doesn't your theory -- if your theory is any good, why doesn't it work anytime something -- someone receives something that's too good to give up?",
  "Where on your -- I'm trying to understand your coercion theory. I know that there are cases of ours that have said there's a line between pressure and coercion, but we have never had, in the history of this country or the Court, any Federal program struck down because it was so good that it becomes coercive to be in it.",
  "Let's take -- let's take public colleges.",
  "Mr. Clement, may I ask one question about your bottom line in this case? It sounds to me like everything you said would be to the effect of, if Congress continued to do things on a voluntary basis, so with adding these new eligibles, and say, States, you can have it or not, you can preserve the program as it existed before, you can opt into this. But you're not asking the Court as relief to say, well, that's how we -- that's how we cure the constitutional infirmity; we say this has to be on a voluntary basis. Instead, you are arguing that this whole Medicaid -- the addition, that the whole expansion has to be nullified and, moreover, the entire Health Care Act. Instead of having the easy repair, you say that if we accept your position, everything falls.",
  "Because -- because the limitation on sale is they can't sell -- by Federal law, they can't sell. And you -- you are debating about exchange, sale. What strikes one about this case is that these are workers -- they work autonomously. They don't clock in and out. They work outside the workplace. After they're trained, they have minimal supervision. Is there any other category of exempt workers that have that kind of autonomy and yet come under the wage and hours law?",
  "For example, what are the -- that's what I wanted to know. What are the categories of people that seem to be autonomous, not the type that clocks in and out?",
  "What about -- what about the extras? I mean, we're told that part of this job is to have a good relationship with the doctors. It includes dinners. It may be conventions. Entertainment, maybe golf. If -- if you're right, would the time on the golf course get time and a half?",
  "You were -- you were giving examples, and we just stopped at --",
  "-- emergency service worker. But you said there are many examples --",
  "-- of people who are highly autonomous and still come under the hours regulation.",
  "May I ask you to follow up on other -- other categories of employee? You gave me cleaning workers, emergency service workers. Are any of those categories people who get paid commissions?",
  "Mr. Malcolm -- Mr. Stewart, is it -- is it true that that option is no longer available, that the Department of Labor no longer gives opinion letters?",
  "But it also says -- it also says promotional work incidental to sales made by someone else.",
  "-- is nonexempt.",
  "And these sales -- I mean, eventually there is a sale to a hospital, to a pharmacy, and that sale is not made by the detailer.",
  "But it's got to be non- binding.",
  "But that seems to be inconsistent with this -- this opinion letter. The request is put in by the pharmaceutical company, and they want an exemption under administrative employee. In the Department of Labor's response allowing that exemption, it says that these detailers, and they use the word \"detailers,\" medical detailers, are engaged in a form of promotional or missionary work.",
  "This goes -- the letter goes on to say that these detailers are engaged in a form of promotion not having for its object the making of specific transactions.",
  "But as far as your 70 years, it's suspect for two reasons. One is we're told that in the early years, at least, before there were regulations restricting the sale of prescription drugs, that these detailers did two things. They did have their informational function, but they also did direct sales to pharmaceutical companies, to hospitals. So, for at least 20 years of those 70 years, these people were engaged in what the department would call sales. So, that's suspect. And then when we have the commitment, the opinion letter that says we have a category for these people; they are engaged in instruction, in information; they are not engaged in sales; but because they're so independent, we rank them as administrative -- in the particular case we rank them as administrative people. So -- so, it's not so that there was a sudden about-face as you suggest. We have a categorization as -- as administrative employees, but not sales employees, and we have a history of these detailers at one time actually selling.",
  "Did you claim -- did you claim exemption as administrative employee?",
  "So, that would -- then that would be still open if you lose on the outside sales?",
  "Did -- did the pharmaceutical companies request -- ever in this period, request a ruling, a rulemaking on the status of these PSRs?",
  "That was an opinion letter, they said. I thought they said that was an opinion letter.",
  "Yes. I asked if there was a request from the pharmaceutical companies for a rulemaking on the proper classification in this case.",
  "Why must you -- why must you look to an amicus brief? Why not just look to the regulation that defines -- the regulations that define \"sale\" and that define \"promotion\"? The 541.503 says promotion work incidental to a sale made by somebody else is not exempt. Why do we get into the amicus brief when we have in these 541 regulations a definition of sales on the one hand, promotion on the other, and then this statement that promotion work incidental to sale made by somebody else is not exempt? Why doesn't -- why isn't that the answer to this case?",
  "Does the -- does the pharmaceutical company have a sales force? I mean, who sells to the wholesalers, the pharmacies, and the hospitals?",
  "But there are -- there are people who sell to them. There may be only a few, but --",
  "Is there -- are they exempt, too?",
  "The -- the actual sellers from the -- the people on the staff of a pharmaceutical company who sell to the wholesalers, pharmacies, and hospitals, are they exempt?",
  "Did it -­",
  "You're right that if -­ you're right -­",
  "But that's true of all of the cases that you -- the cases -- you pointed to two or three that use \"fair implication.\" The Court in all those cases found that there was no fair implication, so that 109 governed. Isn't -- isn't that so? That was true in Marrero. It was true in Northern Securities.",
  "But in none of the cases that used the fair implication language did the Court say: And, therefore, the old statute no longer governs.",
  "So, you're relying on a standard that this Court did -- must have considered appropriate because it deviated from the words of the statute. It said it a few times. But in application, it always came out the same way.",
  "But that was not true of the 109 cases. You don't have a 109 case that said the standard is fair implication, and, therefore, the old statute is not enforced.",
  "Why do you pick the date that the Fair Sentencing Act went into effect, if it -­ if what -- if the guidelines, the 90-day period that the Commission came out with its new guidelines on November 1st, that's some time after August 3rd, which is when the Sentencing Act. So, on your theory, why isn't the right date the date that the Sentencing Guidelines went into effect?",
  "But you have to draw a line someplace, and that's inevitable, that -- that some people are going to fall on one side. But the point about the guidelines and the statute working together, wasn't there a time when the Sentencing Guidelines -­ they wanted to do away with this distinction and Congress said, no, Sentencing Commission, you can't do it, you can't do it to the guidelines when we don't do it to the statute?",
  "But Congress did say: Sentencing Commission, you conform your new guidelines to applicable law. The applicable law has got to be the new law, because if it were the old law, there's nothing to conform. There's nothing that they need to change. It's only that this -- section A(ii) makes sense only if the applicable law is the new law. Otherwise, the Commission doesn't have to do anything to achieve consistency.",
  "Before you do that --",
  "It was my understanding that that system that has been described as arbitrary was not the one that was applicable to the years in question.",
  "To what extent do you -- do you rely on -- you haven't mentioned it up until now, but Congress, in these appropriations, said \"not in excess of.\"",
  "It wasn't just a general \"subject to appropriations.\" It was a specific amount, the Secretary shall not pay in excess of a certain dollar amount for these costs.",
  "It really --",
  "Mr. Freeman, where did these caps come from? Did the agency initiate them? Or, there's a chart -- perhaps I don't understand it correctly. It's on page 210 of the joint appendix. It does -- it does seem to indicate that it was the BIA that proposed the cutback.",
  "You can't get it from Cherokee. I mean, yes, there's Ferris, and then Cherokee --",
  "-- is relying on Ferris. But Cherokee was very careful to point out that there were funds to cover the cost --",
  "But you don't -- you don't have the obligation to perform. I mean -- right? In a term of the contract, that their lack of sufficient appropriations, performance by either party is excused.",
  "Mr. Phillips --",
  "-- do I understand your position to be that, yes, the cap has meaning, because in order to exceed the cap, the tribe has to sue? So, any tribe that sues, for any tribe that sues, the cap is meaningless? It's only for the ones who are not sophisticated enough to sue. They're just stuck with what Congress said. So it seems to me that would be a very bizarre scheme to set up that, that you have a cap, but the cap is meaningless if you bring a lawsuit.",
  "My question is whether the cap was meaningless. And I think your answer is, yes, for anyone who sues, the cap is meaningless.",
  "You must answer that question --",
  "You must answer that question \"yes\" --",
  "-- because that's exactly what the Secretary did.",
  "You -- claimed that it was pro rata.",
  "But how does one determine what is the indubitable equivalent of the creditor's claim?",
  "The -- the sale -- something -- the sale can't go on without the court's approval. I mean, the -- the auction has to have the court's approval, right?",
  "And so what qualifies as indubitably equivalent?",
  "Suppose the -- suppose the creditor thinks that the -- the sale was -- undervalued the assets, that it -- it wasn't the equivalent?",
  "Wouldn't that be a reason for saying that there's no adequate -- there's nothing under (iii) that would be the indubitable equivalent? In other words, one thing is to say that, if you -- if (ii) -- if you fit into (ii), that's it, you don't go to (iii). Another is to say, well, you can go to (iii), but it's most unlikely that there would be the indubitable equivalent of allowing credit bidding.",
  "What is the reference? In clause (ii), we were just told, the -- the last clause refers to \"under clause (i) or clause (iii).\" What -- what is the reference in (ii) to clause (iii)? What does that mean?",
  "And that wouldn't be true of Mr. Patchak? Suppose he had filed in the 30-day window. The Secretary gives notice to affected persons. So he comes in and he says: I think that you don't have authority to do it because this tribe wasn't under Federal jurisdiction, and so I want you to call -- call it off. Nothing -- nothing has been transferred within 30 days. I thought both your brief and the tribe's brief said that the judicial review would be available to any affected person who used that procedure. Is that -- is that true?",
  "But you said -- you had it was important if. So the argument is this tribe wasn't under Federal jurisdiction. I could raise that because I'm an affected person. Somebody's got to be able to enforce against the Secretary the limitations that Congress put on the Secretary. So would there be standing in that situation? Mr. Patchak comes in within the 30-day period, so he's not trying to undo any done deal.",
  "So then you disagree with the tribe that said in no uncertain terms, in its reply brief, that this case is not about the availability of judicial review. Judicial review was available in the 30-day window.",
  "But he didn't file it within the 30-day window, so that -- that is -- there was a clear track. He could have filed within 30 days, and at least the government tells us that that would have been subject to judicial review, the ruling made within -- that nothing would go on until that action was cleared. So why -- if he could have sued early, before any title transfer, why isn't that all the relief someone in his position would be entitled to? Why should he be allowed to wait? I mean, the whole purpose of the 30-day window is to get people to state their objections.",
  "The government answers to that, that's in diversity. You know, you determine citizenship as of the date the complaint is filed. If the citizenship of a party changes, so it coincides with someone on the other side of -- of the line, it doesn't matter. But do you have cases other than diversity cases where the filing of the complaint -- nothing happens, nothing that can happen after affects the jurisdiction as set as of the time the complaint is filed? I don't know, outside diversity, where this principle has applied.",
  "But I think the government told us that the land didn't belong to the tribe in the first place.",
  "Well, the government did say that the Band was not the prior owner of the tract. So where would it go?",
  "But didn't they - - wasn't -- didn't they have some encouragement from a court of appeals suggesting there might be a due process problem if they didn't have that notice?",
  "But how would the state officer know if the person is removable? I mean, that's sometimes a complex inquiry.",
  "They did -- they did provide -- I mean, your position was the Federal legislation regulates the supply side. That leaves the demand side open. But there is regulation, and the question is whether anything beyond that is inconsistent with the -- the Federal -- it's not just that the person is removable, but, if they use false documents in seeking work, that's a Federal crime. So we have the -- what you call the supply side is -- is regulated, but you want to regulate it more.",
  "Mr. Clement, it seems that the -- I would think the largest hurdle for you is Hines, which said the registration scheme - - Congress enacted a complete registration scheme which the states cannot complement or impose even auxiliary regulations. So I don't see the alien registration as a question of obstacle preemption, but appeal preemption that alien -- we don't want a competing registration scheme. We want the registration scheme to be wholly Federal.",
  "May -- may I ask you about the statement you just made? Personal jurisdiction was raised as a defense, right?",
  "And so your position is it was waived?",
  "But it was not adjudicated. Is there - -",
  "You didn't mention exhaustion of administrative remedies.",
  "Might be -- Nigeria is one question, but other potential forums are the U.K. and the Netherlands.",
  "I think -- haven't both of those nations said they would not entertain this case?",
  "And what happened to that?",
  "Overturned it which way?",
  "So it rejected the forum non conveniens.",
  "May I ask you a question about your reliance on the Alien Tort Statute, but if your theory is that this is a violation of a universal norm, and that Federal common law makes it a claim available in the United States, now there is 1331 general Federal question jurisdiction. Couldn't you have said, never mind the Alien Tort Statute, I'm suing under 1331 Federal question jurisdiction, and I have got the -- the claim for relief is the U.S. common law implementing the international law?",
  "Well, maybe they had - -",
  "-- maybe they had to provide that in 1789 because there was no -- there was no general Federal question jurisdiction existing at the time.",
  "You point out, I think, an anomaly. If the victim is a United States citizen - - you say the only ties here are that the victims got asylum in the United States, so they are here. But someone who is here all the time, someone who is a citizen of the United States, but is abroad and is a victim of one of these atrocities, there would be no suit for such a person.",
  "Yes, but under the Alien Tort Statute.",
  "Does that mean, Ms. Sullivan, that you -- and do I understand your argument on brief correctly, that you would say from - - the revival of 1350 from Filartiga was wrong because nothing happened -- nothing happened in the United States there? Marcos was wrong because nothing -- the wrong occurred abroad? Does your -- the argument you're making now that this is not applicable to things that happened offshore exclude Filartiga and Marcos?",
  "But then you're at least saying - -",
  "Ms. Sullivan, before your time runs out, I mean, you have said, candidly, that if Filartiga were to come up today, if Marcos were to come up to this forum, there would be no basis under the Alien Tort Statute. But assume for the moment that those two cases -- that we accept them -- Sosa seemed to accept them. Is there anything different about your case?",
  "What about in your -- you do say in your brief that you think that Filartiga is within the Alien Tort Statute.",
  "You don't -- don't adopt a theory that many of the -- briefs do, that there has to be some connection, some nexus to the United States. You just tell us that Filartiga is okay. And how about Marcos, is that okay?",
  "Yes, but you -- you don't - -",
  "-- you don't offer us a nexus. You don't offer us that reason why Filartiga was okay.",
  "What else? What else? You -- you say Filartiga. You don't mention Marcos. Is Marcos in your view a proper exercise?",
  "There was also a U.S. perpetrator.",
  "Given the court's recent decisions on personal jurisdiction, and I have in mind particularly the Goodyear Tire case, is there personal jurisdiction in this case or in the case of your hypothetical?",
  "You -- you described cases with this purpose -- or function, the briefs cited the district court decision, Sea Village Marina, that says floating homes like the one here that can be towed and are not in the business of carrying people or goods, but can be towed miles across the water, that those constitute vessels. And this district court decision, Sea Village Marina, cited many, many cases. And you say that that district judge got it wrong, or the cases were wrong?",
  "Mr. Gannon, would you have said sounds like this structure is not a vessel, period. But your bottom line in your brief is that, if we disagree with the Court of Appeals, we shouldn't say this contrivance is not a vessel, we should send it back -- for what? What finding?",
  "So what would we tell them they should look into?",
  "Mr. Frederick, the city's position, it is whatever we want it to be. That is the first time Lozman was sued by the city. It was not under admiralty jurisdiction, it was a plain old landlord/tenant suit in State court, right?",
  "Yes, well, my question is, is it -- is it a vessel when you want it to be, and just an ordinary landlord/tenant situation when you want it to be that way?",
  "Well, let's take this very incident, that is he failed to comply with the revised rules and he was behind in his payment of dockage fees. Could the city have brought that case in an ordinary State court for the arrears?",
  "Why not?",
  "What about - -",
  "Mr. Frederick, this is kind of an idiosyncratic case. There are many cases I think in the courts now about floating casinos. I take it on your definition the floating casino would be a vessel subject to maritime jurisdiction.",
  "As long as the vessel stays in one place and the gambling goes on in one place, then it may be towed to a different location, and it stays there. You -- you say because it is able to be moved from one place to another it qualifies as a vessel?",
  "Mr. Schnapper, could you clarify what the district court, as you see it, does? Does it deal only with the discrimination claim, or does it deal with the MSPB's procedural ruling?",
  "Why don't we take this -- this very case, where the MSPB said that -- that the claim was time barred, so the Government would raise it as an affirmative defense.",
  "That's -- you're talking about the discrimination claim. In your view, could the plaintiff now in the district court say, I'll forget the CSRA remedy; district court, you have authority to hear the Title VII case, the ADEA case, and that's all I need? And so I'm not -- I'm abandoning my CSRA.",
  "And then that would take care of the whole thing you discussed before about the affirmative defense and the Government. It would be the plaintiff's choice, I want my Title VII case and that's it.",
  "Mr. Schnapper, can you explain something about the MSPB's role? That is, once you have a final decision from the agency, you could go right to court. You don't -- on the discrimination claim, right? You don't need to go to the MSPB. You don't have to exhaust anything before the MSPB to get your discrimination claim. So, how does the M -- the possibility of going to the MSPB make the discrimination claim any less ripe for judicial review than it would be if you stopped at the agency level?",
  "What are -- what are your advantages? You are deciding -- you have the final agency decision, you could go right to court on the discrimination claim. What do you gain by invoking the MSPB's authority?",
  "Ms. Harrington, may I just clarify that if -- if the case goes to the MSPB, and the MS -- the Federal circuit, the Federal circuit agrees with the MSPB that this was untimely filed, that's the end of the case, the discrimination claim would never be heard then.",
  "So if the Plaintiff then goes to the district court, then what position does the Government take?",
  "Mr. Schnapper told us in his brief, and he repeated it this morning, that the MSPB and the EEOC disagree with your reading of the statute, that they think that the so-called mixed case goes to the district court.",
  "Well, didn't -- in the Ballentine case, didn't the MSPB take the position that it didn't go to the Federal circuit?",
  "And so you -- are you -- are you telling us that the position you're representing on behalf of the Government is the position that the MSPB would take today, is the position that the EEOC would take today?",
  "Mr. Srinivasan --",
  "The United States -- the United States is governed by the substance of the Credit Reporting Act. The Act applies to the Government, but your point is there's no sanction for noncompliance, even though the United States, a Government system, is supposed to conform to the standards in the Act.",
  "May I ask you, Mr. Jacobs --",
  "-- whether you think Congress ever honed in on the issue whether the United States, given the multitude of financial transactions in which it engages, ever thought that sovereign immunity would be waived? I mean, if you're right about this, the consequences are enormous for the Federal fisc. And we -- the -- the statute developed in a peculiar way. First, there was the definition of person when there was no civil liability, and then some years later the prohibition of having both the credit card number and the expiration date. In all of it, is there any hint that Congress envisioned a waiver of sovereign immunity in the Fair Credit Reporting Act?",
  "When the definition of persons was put into the statute, there was no civil liability; isn't that right? So they didn't -- they could not have been thinking about civil liability.",
  "Ms. Brenan, we are straying pretty far from this case. And correct me if I'm wrong, but, as I understand it, the argument was made under State law, and then Williams said there was an abuse of discretion under State law and therefore the Sixth Amendment was violated. So there really isn't any independent -- Williams hasn't stated any independent Sixth Amendment right. It's State law was violated and therefore the Constitution was violated. So it seems to me if we just look at the position that Williams was taking, that these two, the State and the Federal claim, are tied -- tied together. And we don't -- to go beyond this case and imagine some other case that might come before us some day would not be wise.",
  "May I ask you about the underlying claim here? It is quite troublesome. I think this is a state that doesn't allow an Allen charge; is that right?",
  "And the possibility of getting rid of the juror, the hold-out juror, in this way is -- is really troublesome. The judge can't give an Allen charge to urge the jury to deliberate further, but can say -- now, the judge knows who the hold-out is, and to just dismiss that juror, it is -- it is very troublesome.",
  "That would mean that if you prevail it would just become routine. Justice Kennedy mentioned the stamp that says: We considered all of the questions raised, those not discussed on the merits --",
  "Was it fairly presented here?",
  "Given that the argument was abuse of discretion?",
  "What about this Court's precedent in, what is it, the Sanguinetti case, where the Court said that for there to be Government responsibility it is at least necessary that the overflow constitute a permanent invasion of the land amounting to an appropriation, not merely an injury, to property? We would have to withdraw or modify that statement, would we not, if you -- if your -- your argument prevails?",
  "So that would cover a one-time flood.",
  "I don't understand that. You said if -- if it's one flood, even though it destroys the trees, and certainly would not make - - would make it impossible to have picnics, what -- so if that's your position, then you're turning on it happened six times, not once. Is that - -",
  "Mr. Goodhart, maybe it would help to know what you think if we accept your position would be left over for the Federal Circuit to consider on remand. You -- you haven't asked to -- for outright reversal and have the decision of the Court of Federal Claims be the end of the matter. So if we accept your position, then what issues would be open for the Federal Circuit to resolve on remand?",
  "But what were the other issues that you just mentioned? You said we couldn't ask for an automatic affirmance.",
  "What about -- Mr. Kneedler, what was wrong with Judge Newman's position on this temporary versus permanent? It said - - she said that temporary versus permanent, the target should not be the Government's action, but the effect of that action; that is, if trees are killed and they weren't revived, the damage is permanent. That's where we should vote, not whether the Government is going to do this year after year.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, does your essential argument turn on this being indirect, as you say? This is consequential; therefore, it isn't -- it doesn't belong in the takings category, anything that's consequential rather than direct?",
  "In which cases would you say the defendant's ability to assist counsel is necessary? On what issues? You say that -- that if - - the assistance has to be necessary to a fair adjudication.",
  "In what cases would that be so?",
  "You're talking about a very narrow range of cases because I take it your principal position is it -- it would be unusual that the defendant needs to be competent in order for the lawyer effectively to represent him on habeas. So under what circumstances do you think competency matters, so that the lawyer should not be expected to go on without a competent client?",
  "Well, why should the - -",
  "Why should the Court do that? Why should it provide any guidance if, as you say, in both of these cases, the review is limited to the record, and we would never get to the question of, if it weren't reviewed, limited to the record, then what?",
  "Why couldn't you use the transcript? Everything -- all -- all the exchanges between the defendant -- defendant and the trial judge are in the transcript.",
  "The district judge in this case explained why he concluded that there was no issue that couldn't be fairly adjudicated on the basis of the record. What was wrong with his -- his explanation? He looked at the case carefully, and he said, there's nothing that can't fairly be adjudicated on the record.",
  "Treatment stopped because he -- he said there were side effects?",
  "Opposing counsel said that there is an exception for ineffective assistance of counsel under our decision in Martinez.",
  "Like -- like the stay in Rees?",
  "You would have to -- to maintain your position, the Court would have to qualify Rees, or at least the interpretation that says the stay should be indefinite once the petitioner is found incompetent because that's what has happened there. The court said, find out if he's competent. The answer was, he is incompetent. And then the court just let it sit until the man died.",
  "And there'd be no stay at all, unless it's necessary for just adjudication of the claim, so that would be a threshold question.",
  "At least only -- only in cases where the competence -- the claim of incompetence is genuine. I mean, if anyone says, oh, I want to make -- take advantage of the more defendant-friendly standard, all I have to do is allege I'm incompetent. But that's not the case. He has to be - - there has to be a hearing that determines he is, indeed, incompetent. So - and -- and most defendants I don't think would be able to establish that they are, indeed, incompetent.",
  "But not this one because the claim is he was never competent; isn't that so? He wasn't competent to stand trial, and he never - -",
  "And his mental condition never improved. So this person, if -- if the -- the standard is he's got to be competent, the likelihood is he will never be competent because he wasn't even, according to him, competent at the time he was tried.",
  "But not staying everything, according to the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit said that -- that there are issues or may be issues that can go forward right away. And as to that, is there any issue that could be argued, despite the incompetence?",
  "And what -- what are those?",
  "Mr. Rein, before we get to that, because the Court is supposed to raise it on its own, the question of -- of standing. The injury - - if the injury is rejection by the University of Texas, and the answer is, no matter what, this person would not have been accepted, then how is the injury caused by the affirmative action program?",
  "May I ask you on that specifically, let's take away the 10 percent solution. Suppose the only plan were the one that is before the Court now, no 10 percent. This is the exclusive way that the University is attempting to increase minority enrollment. Then, if we had no 10 percent solution, under Grutter, would this plan be acceptable?",
  "Well, then the -- the question is can you have both? But it seems to me that this program is certainly no more aggressive than the one in -- in Grutter; it's more -- in fact, more modest.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Rein, it seems to me that, in your talking about critical mass, you are relying entirely on the 10 percent is enough. They don't -- they got minorities through the 10 percent, so they don't need any more. And I tried to get you rigidly to focus on -- forget the 10 percent plan. This is the entire plan.",
  "Because of the 10 percent.",
  "But is the -- the race-neutral alternative is the 10 percent plan?",
  "But you say, and that's okay because it's -- it's race-neutral. But is it really? The -- the only reason that they instituted the 10 percent plan was to increase minority enrollment.",
  "And it -- and that -- the only way it works is if you have heavily separated schools. And worse than that, I mean, if you -- if you want to go to the University of Texas under the 10 percent plan, you go to the low-performing school, you don't take challenging courses, because that's how you'll get into the 10 percent. So maybe the University is concerned that that is an inadequate way to deal with it.",
  "Mr. Garre, could you explain -- I think you were trying to before -- what seems to me the critical question in this case: Why didn't the 10 percent solution suffice? There were a substantial number of minority members admitted as a result of the 10 percent solution. Why wasn't that enough to achieve diversity?",
  "Mr. Garre. Mr. Garre.",
  "Mr. Garre, before your time is -- runs out, the other point that I'd like you to answer is the argument based on Parents Involved, that the gain is just too small to warrant using a racial criteria.",
  "Once you have the 10 percent, you don't need more. So how do you answer the argument of the gain is too small?",
  "But that's the same - - the same would be true in -- of the Bakke plan, that in some cases it's going to make a difference. The same would be true under Grutter. The same would be true under the policies now in existence at the military academies.",
  "Is it any more unchecked than the Harvard plan which -- that started all this off in 1978, decided by Justice Powell? Is it any different from how race is used in our military academies?",
  "When you -- now, Mr. Goldstein, when you say, \"this case,\" is there any proof in the record that there was a small amount and no -- no remuneration?",
  "Mr. Goldstein, it's because they are trying to mirror the Federal statute, which makes the small amount and no remuneration, makes that like an affirmative defense. The burden is on the defendant to show those two things, to get out from under the main statute.",
  "So what the Government is suggesting is as close to the Federal statute as you can get.",
  "You said Carachuri. That case involved, in -- in order to hold for the government, you would have to go outside the record of the State conviction. You'd have to add something that wasn't in the State conviction. And it's the same thing here. To get to where you want to go, you have to add something that isn't in the State conviction.",
  "I don't follow - -",
  "-- your answer because I think you have to concede that, under your view, a lot of people who are convicted under the Georgia statute who had a significant quantity, which they intended to distribute - -",
  "-- for remuneration - -",
  "-- many of those people would -- under your view of the statute, many of those people would -- would not have committed an aggravated felony.",
  "So you have that - -",
  "-- a large underinclusiveness problem, which you haven't solved.",
  "But all that follows from, in Carachuri, the government wanted to go outside the record.",
  "Do -- do you agree with Mr. Goldstein when he says, in reality, it's not an affirmative defense, that the defendant never has to prove the amount?",
  "Are there any other consequences? We've been talking only about dispensation from removal. But are there any other consequences that matter?",
  "General Verrilli, can you be specific on who that person would be? Because, as I understand it, it's unlikely that, for example, the lawyers in this case would be charged with any criminal offense. It's more probable that their clients would be; but, according to the government, their clients have no Fourth Amendment rights because they are people who are noncitizens who acted abroad. So it's hard for me to envision. I see the theoretical possibility, but I don't see a real person who would be subject to a criminal charge who could raise an objection.",
  "So the client is somebody who is abroad and who acted abroad, and is not a U.S. citizen.",
  "How likely is it that a service provider would object?",
  "And the litigation was unsuccessful.",
  "Well, using what you just mentioned, suppose -- just let's suppose that the Court should hold there is standing. Couldn't the government then say as far as the merits of the complaint, this information is classified, these are state secrets, we can't -- we can't go forward with the litigation?",
  "General Verrilli, but in this case the Complainant can never know. I mean, I know you emphasize the speculative nature of this claim, but it's not speculative if the government being given this authority by Congress is going to use it. Isn't that so? I mean, are we to assume that - -",
  "Is there much of a speculation involved in how -- I think it's only one time, and it was under the pre-amended statute, that the FISA court ever -- ever turned down an application.",
  "You never know. There may be dozens of concrete applications affecting the Plaintiffs in this case, but we will never know.",
  "Mr. Jaffer, could you be clear on the expanded authority under the FAA? As I understood it, it's not like in the old statute, where a target was identified and FISA decided whether there was -- the court decided whether there was probable cause. Under this new statute, the government doesn't say who the particular person or the particular location. So, there isn't that check. There isn't that check.",
  "What other measures besides having to travel to have conversations?",
  "Well, the travel overseas I understand is the one thing that has a dollar amount attached to it.",
  "But these others -- these other precautions, being more circumspect in their questions, talking in generalities - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Which they can never, never have, and that's what makes this -- if -- if there could be a person in this category who would know, but the person will never know. You did mention minimization procedures as one safeguard against abuse. What are the minimum - - what -- what minimization standards are taken that will protect plaintiffs in this class?",
  "But your reading -- your reading is essentially, once a copy is sold anywhere, the copyright owner loses control of distribution everywhere. That is essentially your argument.",
  "So -- but -- so this notion of sold anywhere, end of distribution rights everywhere, that has been called, I think, the universal exhaustion principle.",
  "And we are told that no country has adopted that international exhaustion regime, that most countries adhere to the national exhaustion regime, which nobody is contesting here. That is, if it's manufactured in the United States and sold in the United States, that copy belongs to the person who purchased it, end of case. But if the exhaustion doctrine applies only nationally, then your argument is asking for something that runs against the regime that is accepted in most places.",
  "Well, let's take, for example, the European Union, the position in -- in those countries. Suppose we -- we just transformed - - transferred this case to one of those countries, the exact same case; and my understanding is that they would follow the national exhaustion.",
  "Yes, but not -- not exhaust -- you sell a copy in -- in Thailand; then it's home free all over the world.",
  "Is it all right? Wasn't there also the question of allowing manufacturers to segment markets so we'd have the copyright by abroad, governed by foreign law, copyright in the United States governed by U.S. law? Wasn't segmentation of the market allowing people to do just what these people are doing?",
  "Has that ever happened? I mean, the Ninth Circuit cases have been around for some time. Has any manufacturer ever moved abroad?",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz told us that under this title means different things in other sections, and he gave a number of examples.",
  "Mr. Olson, do you have an answer to the outsourcing problem and the charges that if you read the statute as you are urging, then you are inviting the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs?",
  "Mr. Stewart, may I ask you a preliminary question? In Quality King the government took the position that the Petitioner is taking here. What led the government to change its mind? Was it just what has been called \"dictum\" in Quality King, or is there another reason why the government has switched sides?",
  "Mr. Garre, does your argument mean -- you say minimally intrusive, and that the dog will detect only contraband, that the police then are to go into a neighborhood that's known to be a drug dealing neighborhood, go into -- just go down the street, have the dog sniff in front of every door, or go into an apartment building? Is that -- I gather that that is your position.",
  "Suppose -- suppose the house had on the lawn, no dogs allowed?",
  "Yes, but not implied consent for the policeman to come up with the dog. The only purpose of the dog is to detect contraband. So you can say, yes, there's an implied invitation to the Girl Scout cookie seller, to the postman, even to the police officer, but not police officer with dog, when the only reason for having the dog is to find out if there's contraband in the house.",
  "This is not any dog. This is a drug detecting dog.",
  "Not this -- not this purpose. You said centuries, but I think you recognize that it wasn't until the seventies when the dogs were used to find culprits. But to use it in this way I think it was only since the seventies.",
  "I didn't -- I didn't understand the concession to be that the police had come to the door with the dog, the sole purpose of the dog being to detect contraband.",
  "You're agreeing with Mr. Garre that the police could take a dog and go down every house on the street, every apartment in the building?",
  "A house just like this house?",
  "Well, so any home, any home anywhere, and we should say that that's okay, and we can say it's okay because the government won't use it?",
  "This Court has dealt with an item that was seized before, a piece of luggage, a car. They have not dealt with the dog sniff in the context of a home that's not seized.",
  "What about, Mr. Blumberg, the government cited many, many pages in the record, I just took the first one, petition -- appendix to the petition, 104 and 105. The court said, the officer and the dog were lawfully present at the defendant's front door, and we were told that that was conceded by you a number of times.",
  "I thought you were talking about a dog trained to detect contraband - -",
  "-- not just any old dog.",
  "Mr. Blumberg, the Florida appellate court, yes, the court of appeals, did say that that the officer and the dog were lawfully present. But you say you didn't make that concession.",
  "That -- that goes to the field performance; but, the other requirements, that the -- some showing that the test -- that the training program is reputable, some showing that the handler, not only the dog, has -- has had training, it seems to me those two -- not -- there's nothing improper about that.",
  "Why didn't -- then why didn't they get the dog recertified? By the time of the search, the certification had expired 16 months.",
  "Well, what do you -- what do you have to show to establish that the dog was well trained.",
  "Well, if it were just that -- you have the show that the program was reputable.",
  "Mr. Garre, you said there was the certification, training program, but you gave a third. You said, or otherwise show proficiency in locating narcotics. So if there is no certification, no training, how would the state establish that the dog was reliable in detecting drugs?",
  "And I think you'll agree that the handler, too, the handler would have to - -",
  "Not -- not certification, but that the handler has been -- has been trained - -",
  "-- to work with drug detection dogs.",
  "Mr. Palmore, you criticize the Florida Supreme Court for requiring evidence of field performance; and, assuming that that evidence is not required, if the defendant, in preparing for the suppression motion, wants what information there is, would it be proper to seek -- for the defendant - - would it be permissible for the defendant to speak -- to seek through discovery whatever field performance records there are?",
  "So -- so if the state doesn't keep -- if the state doesn't keep any performance records, then there would be no field performance to show, but that doesn't mean the state loses; is that what you're saying? The state doesn't keep performance records. The Florida Supreme Court seemed to say field performance records are required.",
  "Are you conceding that the Florida Supreme Court, at least with respect to the field performance records, was wrong, that they -- it is not a Fourth Amendment requirement?",
  "But they said it was part -- but they outline what the government must prove, and that was one of them.",
  "Doesn't this -- this officer has been working with this dog for many months. They have training periods every week. So why isn't that enough to show that this handler and this dog worked effectively as a team?",
  "That's not what the Florida Supreme Court said? It listed, along with training, that the -- the provision of records of field performance.",
  "Suppose it's -- it's a dog that's just completed the training, training course, top-performing dog in the training program, but there's no field record.",
  "The alert -- the alert here could have been to residual odor, or it could have been to drugs inside the pickup truck. If it's - - because the alert was in front of the -- a front door handle, is that -- so it -- it's equally likely that it -- that it was just residual odor or that there were drugs inside the pickup truck. Can the police establish probable cause when what the dog alerted to may well have been residual odor and nothing inside? The dog didn't alert anyplace other than the door handle, is that...",
  "And if we think they were wrong in that respect, I suppose that you would say the Court shouldn't reverse, but should vacate and remand because the question did alert him to the door handle, was that enough? Was that enough to establish probable cause that there were drugs in the vehicle?",
  "But Terry -- Terry is an open question in this case. It wasn't decided below, but it was raised. So -- so you're arguing we shouldn't extend Summers, but that leaves this very case susceptible to the assertion that this was a legitimate Terry stop.",
  "If they did do -- if they did do a Terry stop, and in the process of that stop the police officer got a call that said, we found lots of contraband, guns in this house, at that point they could have turned the Terry stop into an arrest, couldn't they?",
  "So if he came back -- I mean, the scenario here is he was supposed to be driving his friend home, and he would have come back while the search was ongoing, but the police could apprehend anyone while the search -- if that's what you're saying, while the search is ongoing - -",
  "And then Mr. Shanmugam says they could stop him. They could stop anybody. The search is ongoing. Somebody approaches the house; the police can stop that person.",
  "But - -",
  "Mr. Wall, the Summers case was an exception. The main rule is you have probable cause. So you are taking the exception, which was tied tightly to the house. You want him to stay on the premises so he can -- there won't be any risk that he's going to disrupt the search, but it was -- it was an exception to the main Fourth Amendment rule, and now you are asking to have that exception spread. And so today you say, oh, well, we're not - - we're not asking if the person gets to her workplace, but that the police, but maybe why -- why not? I mean, you -- it's one thing to confine Summers to the house, the immediate premises, and another to say seven-tenths of a mile away, that's okay, too.",
  "You have to draw a line someplace. When he is descending the steps to his house, he is still associated with the house. And once he steps over that line, the Summers rationale it seems to me doesn't apply. But there's a curiosity about this case, maybe you can explain it to me. They stop him seven-tenths of a mile away. By that time, the search is ongoing. They have found guns and contraband. They take -- why do they take him back to the house? What was the reason for taking? There was nothing there that he could -- he couldn't obstruct the search. He was in handcuffs.",
  "He couldn't point out anything in drawers because they'd found it all.",
  "Explain -- explain to me -- the police, they have the informant's tip, and they see them coming out of the house. So it seems to me it's a good case that that would be reasonable suspicion. Coming out of the house, he looks like what the informant says. Then they -- can they -- they pat him down and they find his keys, and the keys are to the house.",
  "In this case, you couldn't think of a reason why they took him back to the scene.",
  "They can follow him.",
  "Mr. Fisher --",
  "-- what -- what about the argument that Strickland doesn't come into play unless the Sixth Amendment includes the collateral consequences in counsel's obligation to defend a defendant in a criminal case under the argument that up to -- up to Padilla, only advice relevant to guilt or innocence and sentencing was required, not collateral consequences?",
  "So it's also a question if -- if conviction meant loss of a professional license, that would be an open question?",
  "Is there any -- Mr. Fisher, is there any application, you call it application of Strickland, that would qualify as a new rule, any application at all, or is just Strickland never a new rule?",
  "You answered that question when I asked it, you said that removal of a professional license would not fall under -- wouldn't -- would be at least an open question.",
  "Mr. Fisher --",
  "Mr. Fisher, are you -- you're not making any argument that Teague is inapplicable because this -- the underlying conviction here is a federal conviction, not a state conviction, and Teague emphasized comity to the states; you're not making that argument?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, Padilla itself was a collateral proceeding. And if the state can argue in Padilla itself that a new rule was being sought and that that was permissible only on direct review, should the state have prevailed?",
  "But this Court is a Federal court, so --",
  "-- if your concern of Teague is comity, concern about -- the states running their own system, I understand the different – the state collateral and the Federal collateral view; but, if the idea of Teague is we don't want the Federal court to come in there and overlook what the state court did, why wouldn't that apply to this court reviewing a state court decision as much as it would apply to a Federal district court at a hearing habeas from a state conviction?",
  "Well, do we know that that's true in Kentucky?",
  "And this Court could not have raised it on its own?",
  "Have we applied -- have we applied Teague to Federal convictions before?",
  "It hasn't. And at least one important basis for the Teague rule is the comity to the state court system, which you don't have when the underlying conviction is a Federal conviction.",
  "It was -- it was approved by the Judicial Conference in September.",
  "Although you said you recognize that we have not had a Teague case involving a Federal conviction, I mean, there is lots of language in Teague cases about the Federal courts not interfering with state courts, that Teague was intended to minimize Federal intrusion into state criminal proceedings, to limit the authority of the Federal courts to overturn state convictions. I mean, we have really pressed that -- that basis.",
  "I thought we were talking about, Mr. Waxman, the materiality of the alleged misstatement, and I am really nonplussed by your answer that, if the judge says it's immaterial, that doesn't end it for everybody. Certainly, it should -- it ends it for the class; you said that. Should it also end it for the representative of the class to say, okay, now I'm going to come back, and this statement, -this finding of the immateriality doesn't bind me. Of course, it's going to bind the class representative. So if it's immaterial, the case ends. And if it is material, then it is material to everybody in the class.",
  "Mr. Waxman --",
  "Mr. Waxman, there is no question about 23(a), right? The 23(a) prerequisites have been satisfied.",
  "So the only thing is (b)(3), that is that a question of law or fact common to the class members predominates over questions affecting only individual members. The question that predominates is the question of, were these representations material; if they were material, then the certification is proper. If they were immaterial, it's not. It's just -- I don't understand why this isn't just a clear case of a question common to the class; that is, the question of materiality.",
  "Mr. Waxman, the -- the Basic opinion that started all this off, on page 242, lists materiality as a common question. The materiality of the misrepresentation, if any, is listed as a common question, and that made perfect sense to me.",
  "Mr. Waxman, you seem to be setting up two determinations of materiality. You say, in order to certify the class, you have to show that the misrepresentation was material. And in order to win on the merits, you certainly have to show that the misrepresentation was material. How do those two findings of materiality differ? How does the finding that you say must be made at the certification stage differ from the finding that must be made at the trial?",
  "But I’m still -- what -- what does \"material\" mean at the trial level, what does \"material\" mean at the certification?",
  "So it's the same question. It has to be -- if it's established at the certification stage, it has to be established again at trial?",
  "Mr. Frederick, you say -- you say, you point out, quite rightly, that the efficiency of the market was conceded -- was conceded below.",
  "It was not challenged. Except that now, in -- in Amgen's brief, there is a suggestion that the efficiency of the market is a more sophisticated question. And it's not my note -- binary, I think is what they said -- it isn't that it's either efficient or it's not efficient; it depends on other factors.",
  "It sounds like you are saying you have to win on the merits of the materiality question in order to get the class certified.",
  "Mr. Estrada, you are limiting your argument to the determination of damages, as I understand it.",
  "Because the -- because the Third Circuit agreed that, as far as any antitrust impact --",
  "-- that could be established on a class basis.",
  "But why -- why not? Because, generally -- and at least it's my impression -- that in class certifications, if the liability question can be adjudicated on a class basis, then the damages question may be adjudicated individually. Take a -- take a Title VII case. A liability -- a pattern of practice of discrimination, therefore, liability, but damages can be assessed on an individual basis. So why isn't bifurcation possible here?",
  "It doesn't have to be the same for every member of the class. As the dissenting judge pointed out, you can have subclasses.",
  "But you challenged the probity, Mr. Estrada. You said Comcast said it had no objection to McClave's qualification as an expert. So what you were talking about was the probity of this report, not the admissibility.",
  "Mr. Barnett, this is on a different issue, but you had originally suggested that you had -- that the motion -- that the settlement that's looming was a reason that this Court ought not to decide this case. But do you now agree that, given the district court's denial of your motion to enforce the settlement, that the proposed settlement has no bearing on this Court's consideration of the case?",
  "Even when the defendant interjected this issue and the defendant urged the judge to make this incorrect notion that you have to negate the higher crime, in order to convict of the lesser crime, it was the defendant that led the -- the trial judge into error. The trial judge didn't come up with this on his own.",
  "But you're not arguing that that was the correct charge that - -",
  "Could a system say, if you have Double Jeopardy looming in -- in -- in the case, then arguments like the one that the defendant made and the judge bought have to be made pretrial, and if they are not made pretrial, they are waived. I mean, here, the -- the -- the case was ongoing when the defendant made this suggestion, as opposed the system had built into it a requirement that defendants that are going to make this kind of plea do it pretrial.",
  "You cannot necessarily - -",
  "Mr. Gannon, if we -- if we adopt your rule, it -- it can't be for this case only. And I -- I think this characterization, nonexistent element -- or a court's misconstruction of an element, I think, in many cases, you could do -- call it one or call it the other, so that -- that's a difficult line to -- to adopt.",
  "But -- but you could prove the crime without a reasonable -- beyond a reasonable doubt, if you never raised the statute of limitations. And statutes of limitations exist for civil claims, as well as criminal claims. And in -- on the civil side, the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense. And it's up to the plaintiff to plead and prove -- both plead and prove it, both the burden of production and persuasion. Why should it be different on the criminal side?",
  "But you -- I think you - - you recognized that -- that the defendant has the burden of production, not the government, the burden -- burden of coming forward with this defense and producing some evidence of the withdrawal.",
  "Not -- only for the later period. It doesn't negate that this person was once a member of the conspiracy. The government has the burden to show membership, and it did. So it's not -- it doesn't reach back to negate that there was membership at some time. It just says, after withdrawal, we no longer prosecute.",
  "But you -- you would have the government prove that twice. They prove his membership in the conspiracy. And then you say, once he alleges that he withdrew, they have to prove it again.",
  "What would you -- what would you have to produce to get over your threshold of satisfying the burden of production?",
  "What -- what evidence of withdrawal did you produce in this case?",
  "But you -- you agree - - you agree that that would not have necessarily meant withdrawal?",
  "Yes, but you recognize - - you recognize, as I think Justice Alito's question doesn't, that there is -- there is a withdrawal defense and the question is how do you allocate the proof burden? So your case accepts that there is a withdrawal defense. Indeed, the judge gave a charge to the jury on -- so the contest, as I understand it, the difference between the two of you is you say, defendant can say, I withdrew. If he does that, he has to prove it. And the defendant is saying, I have to produce enough, so that a jury could find I withdrew, but you have the ultimate burden of persuasion.",
  "Is this -- the burden allocation, is this a more hypothetical academic question? I mean, you pointed out that you had ample evidence to show that he remained a member of the conspiracy. So does the allocation of burden of persuasion to the defendant versus proof of production to the defendant, persuasion to the government, does it really make much difference? Does it have much practical consequence?",
  "Yes, indeed, but -- but you are assuming a conflict. You're saying either the -- the statute applies or Rule 54(d) applies, but the statute can be read to say, we're describing one category of case, we are describing the worst case, the bad-faith harassing plaintiff, and the statute deals with that category of person and no other. So if you're not a bad-faith harassing plaintiff, but you, nonetheless, lost, then you're under 54(d).",
  "Well, there are a number of reasons. One is symmetry because they have costs in the part about defendants. And the concern that, well, if we leave out costs for the bad-faith harassing plaintiff, then it -- it may be assumed that they get only attorney's fees and not costs. So the statute's provisions like this may be redundant, but one can see that a drafter might very well want to say, well, we said we're dealing with the defendant costs, we want to put the same thing in with a plaintiff.",
  "Ms. Zieve, if we look at other statutes, it seems to me we would want to look at statutes involving lenders, so we would look at the -- the Truth in Lending Act and the -- what is it, the Credit Organizations Act --",
  "-- and those do not provide for attorney's fees. They are covered only under 54(d), which is costs, not fees. Why should we read this Act in a way that -- so -- so that a defendant under this Act who can get attorney's fees is worse off with respect to costs than defendants under the other lending legislation, the ones that have only 54(d)? Congress gave defendants something more here. Why -- why would -- why should it be that 54(d) would apply to the lender under the Truth in Lending Act, but not to the lender under -- under this Act?",
  "Ms. Blatt, we do have in this case the views of the government regulators, the FTC and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and we have heard the government's position on the relationship between these two provisions. Should we give any weight to the interpretation of the government administrators?",
  "Would you explain why we would look to other rules? You wouldn't look at the Rule 54(d), but we might look at Rule 11 and we might look at something else? I thought your -- your position was that this statute governs all requests for fees and costs under this particular Act.",
  "But, Mr. Dabney, are you saying that this device of the unilateral covenant is no good, unless it says that you will never be sued for any shoe that you ever produce? Is -- are you saying that the covenant is no good or that this covenant is deficient?",
  "So -- if -- if you are uneasy about the covenant as it exists, why didn't you say, judge, this covenant doesn't give us adequate protection, it should be amended, and then say what you think you need to be adequately covered?",
  "Mr. Dabney, that's a different answer than the one you gave me when I asked the same question. You said because we don't want to be an involuntary licensee of Nike.",
  "But can you -- can you just explain to me -- you've given a name to this carte blanche that -- that Nike would give you. What is the significance of your being an involuntary licensee? It's not something that -- that you wear as a brand. I mean --",
  "Then you're going back to saying the covenant -- no covenant is any good.",
  "Mr. Dabney, suppose there had been no infringement claim, could you have -- but you're in the shoe business and you're -- you're worried -- could you have brought a declaratory action or an action for an injunction to have the trademark declared invalid?",
  "So you say you could not have brought a suit to -- to cancel?",
  "But, Mr. Dabney, you told me that you could not bring such an independent suit, you have to be stung once. So you can bring it as a counterclaim, as you did here, once there's an infringement suit, but you -- you did say that you could not just walk into court and say, I want an injunction invalidating the trademark.",
  "Ms. Anders, you did say, if I recall correctly, that Congress regarded the PTO as the preferred form for cancellation proceedings. The -- the statute sets up the PTO proceeding, but it also allows the claim to be brought in -- in court. So what -- what shows that Congress meant these claims to be -- to go to the agency in preference to the court?",
  "Mr. Goldstein, how the case came to us -- how this case originated was a counterclaim.",
  "And at the time the counterclaim was asserted, there was certainly Article III jurisdiction over the counterclaim, right?",
  "So it's -- so it's a question of -- of deficiency in their pleading. Suppose they amended that counterclaim and said, as soon as we are able, we want to do a counterfeit.",
  "Why? Why? I know you said that in your brief, but if you give it -- yes, if you -- if you say the -- the whole world can copy it, but this covenant would give it to only one manufacturer.",
  "So why would you abandon -- why would giving a covenant to Already amount to abandonment of your mark?",
  "Mr. Goldstein, can you inform us of when this practice of the unilateral covenant in order to moot a -- a cancellation claim, when -- how long has it been around?",
  "Mr. Goldstein, what about Federal Rule 41(a)(2)? It says, if the defendant has pleaded a counterclaim -- and you have recognized that there was Article III jurisdiction over that counterclaim -- the case may be dismissed on the plaintiff's request over the defendant's objection, only if the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication.",
  "So on the face of it, it seems that this -- that that rule fits this case to a T; that is, the -- plaintiff wants the case withdrawn, defendant objects, and the question is can the counterclaim remain pending for independent adjudication.",
  "May I interject just one thing that I would like you to clarify? Justice Breyer started out by saying the standard comes from Friends of the Earth. Do you agree? Because, as I recall, your brief doesn't -- doesn't even cite Friends of the Earth.",
  "Mr. Horwich, you said in -- in your reply brief that, if the Hospital Authorities Law specifically authorized local hospital authorities to acquire any and all hospitals within their geographic area, then the clear articulation requirement would be satisfied. But the Authorities Law does authorize the acquisition of other hospitals. And it doesn't say one or two; it says other -- other facilities. So why doesn't the hospital laws law do exactly what you said would satisfy the -- the clear articulation requirement?",
  "Georgia wasn't so sure because didn't it come in originally on the side of the FTC in this case?",
  "Mr. Waxman --",
  "Mr. Waxman, you are essentially interpreting the Georgia statute that sets up the hospital authority. And you -- you're saying this is how we read it. We start with the antitrust exemption is for the State, not subdivisions, so the State has to give it to the subdivision, for the subdivision to have it. Could the Federal court have said, we -- we'd like to know what the Georgia legislature -- what the Georgia authorities think this statute means? So, could a question have been certified -- I don't know if Georgia has a certification procedure, but to the Georgia Supreme Court, and said, tell us, does this statute, is it intended to transfer the State's immunity to the locality -- to the local unit?",
  "But the question is does this -- does this legislature mean that the State is transferring its immunity to this local unit?",
  "Mr. Ortiz, why isn't the question that you're presenting academic in this case? Because didn't the district judge say that there had been no showing that Davis' conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive? It wouldn't matter if the supervisor -- if the conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive harassment, and, equally, if the company responded every time a complaint was lodged. The district court found both of those things, that it wasn't severe and pervasive, and that every time she claimed -- complained an investigation was made.",
  "What other than the job description? The job description says that the catering specialist has authority to direct or lead the part-time employees. But what concrete instances of Davis exercising supervisory authority over Vance is there in this record?",
  "What I mean is not the statement, well, she's a supervisor. But comparable to Faragher, where the lifeguard who didn't have authority to hire her or fire her said, if you don't date me, you are going to be cleaning the toilets. We don't have anything like that in this record.",
  "But that was also -- that would be for a very confined period. It would only be when the -- when Vance was a part-time employee. Once she is a full-time employee there isn't that.",
  "Mr. Ortiz, did she ever have that authority, because the record as far as we have it says that the work assignments, what Vance was doing, came from the chef or from Kimes, and the most that Davis did was transmit the chef's orders of where people would be stationed.",
  "Have you answered the argument it shouldn't get any deference because what -- what the EEOC guidance does is it is -- it is interpreting two decisions of this Court, and this Court, not the EEOC, is in the best position to determine what those two cases mean?",
  "I thought in Faragher it was that -- that the lifeguard gave her her daily work assignments. He controlled what she would do on the job.",
  "Was that -- that question wasn't presented. It was -- it was just assumed that -- that Silverman would qualify as a -- as a supervisor.",
  "But why should that -- why should that matter? I know you said that in your brief, Mr. Garre, if the -- if the alleged victim talked back. But in one of the very first cases that we had in this line, Harris v. Forklift, there was -- it was the boss, so there was no question about supervisor, and he was really making things hard for this employee; but, she was very firm, and she talked back to him. But, still, that's not what we said that counted. We said, is she being subjected to terms and conditions of employment that she would not be subjected to but for her sex.",
  "Mr. Ortiz said it wasn't just part-time. He called my attention to the page before that says she also -- that Davis also directed --",
  "With Sereboff, that you -- you referred to, that -- that certainly describes the lien you rely on, but there's a footnote toward the end that leaves open the make-whole doctrine and, I assume, also the common fund doctrine, so -- so it's -- it's an open question.",
  "Where is that abrogation -- where is that abrogation in this -- not the plan description, but the plan itself -- what clear language in the plan bars the -- the --",
  "But that --",
  "I'm asking about the plan itself because the plan controls if there's a discrepancy.",
  "Yes. And I -- and I don't -- you -- you make a distinction between reimbursement clause and the subrogation clause. And this -- as far as I can tell from the plan, is no reimbursement clause. The only one that's there is labeled \"subrogation.\" And I looked at what's in the plan, and I don't see language that clearly abrogates the common fund.",
  "Let's go back to what the -- the simple argument. We have an agreement here, and the plan is asking for what the agreement gives it. Why is the plan unjustly enriched by receiving exactly what the plan entitles it to receive?",
  "Well, couldn't that party simply say, I want to go to the other side of the court? You just made a distinction between the remedy at law and at equity. This is the plan, and if the plan is told, well, if you go to equity, you get all these extra things. You could say, I'm asserting my rights at law.",
  "I thought you were discussing the common fund would be the allocation between McCutchen and the plan. But now, you seem to be talking only about the attorney's right to come in first.",
  "But then what your -- your first answer was that this is a very small set of cases that you're dealing with. If your answer to Justice Scalia is yes, this Court could take a case that's unsettled and, by settling it, make the error plain. That would open the door to a huge number of cases, wouldn't it?",
  "Was there a reason -- I think you represented your client at the trial.",
  "Is there a reason why you didn't bring this up when the judge imposed that sentence? I mean, there was -- one thing is Tapia; but, before that, there was a statute that says, judge, don't lengthen sentences for purposes of rehabilitation. And you didn't call that statute to the attention of the -- of the judge, did you?",
  "Were you -- were you aware of the statute at the time?",
  "How many months are left for the defendant's sentence?",
  "He didn't?",
  "But the judge was not aware of those impediments?",
  "Mr. Wall, why doesn't that describe this case? In here is a statute, never mind Tapia, the statute says to the judge, don't lengthen the defendant's sentences for purposes of some cure. And if the judge was not aware of that statute, he surely should have been, the prosecutor shouldn't -- wasn't it incumbent on the prosecutor to tell the judge, Judge, sorry, you can't do that?",
  "But he was not aware of the statute. No one called it to his attention.",
  "Why -- why was it a Tapia claim? Why wasn't it simply, trial -- trial judge, the statute says imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation? Why weren't those -- why wasn't it really incumbent on the prosecutor to tell the judge, just read those words?",
  "And what about what the rules -- what the rules advisory committee? I mean, is it -- when 52(b) was put in the statute, they – they cited a case you cite in your brief, the Wiborg – or Wiborg case. That wasn't, at the time, error. It was a sufficiency-of-the-evidence error, the kind of thing you would expect the counsel to bring to the attention of the Court. And nonetheless, the -- the advisory committee put it in as an example of how 52(b) should operate. And why? They said they put it in there because it was a matter vital to the defendant. So the objection wasn't made, so the contemporaneous objection rule was -- was not observed and nonetheless, the Court said, We are going to take -- we are going to consider it on appeal because the matter is vital to the defendant. I can't imagine anything more vital than being deprived of 19 to 27 months of freedom.",
  "Mr. Wall, your time is up, but we have a rule -- the Supreme Court has a rule -- and I would like to know how the government reads it. It's our Rule 24, that says we, this Court, may consider plain error not covered in the questions presented, but evident from the record. Is our rule -- in your view, must the error be plain at the trial court stage, or is it enough that the error was plain at the court of appeals stage for us to apply our rule?",
  "Did that offer include admission of liability? Or was it just that it was going to pay the amount of damages requested?",
  "So if -- if there were judgment of liability, then that would be preclusive for all other people similarly situated?",
  "Well, that -- so the next case is another employee who claims uncompensated work time, and that's brought on behalf of similarly situated people. Then that next case, the employer would be -- would be subject to summary judgment because the liability has been established.",
  "But it was not possible for anything to be done about the certification because you moved immediately. The complaint is filed, and then you moved -- then you immediately offered the judgment that you did.",
  "But there is nothing in Rule 68 -- you're basing the -- your position on a rule that provides as the only sanction, if the plaintiff continues and gets less than the offer of proof, then the plaintiff has to pay the costs. Rule 68 doesn't say anything about dismissing suits.",
  "What do you do when -- when you have a governing statute that says that an employee may bring suit for and in behalf of himself and other employees similarly situated? Can you use a mere rule, Rule 68, to cut out what the statute authors -- authorizes; that is, that the employee can seek relief on behalf of himself and others similarly situated? Mustn't you give a chance for the statutory provision to work, which you didn't. By filing immediately, you didn't allow the normal process of inviting opt-ins to occur.",
  "Yes, but you have to give the plaintiff an opportunity. That --",
  "Suppose -- suppose the plaintiff had simultaneously, with the filing of the complaint, moved to have it first preliminarily certified as on behalf of other employees situated; so, instead of having the complaint, which was labelled a collective complaint, separate from a motion for certification, they came together, that the plaintiff filed a complaint and immediately filed a motion for certification and a request to discover the names of other people similarly situated.",
  "So your answer is it wouldn't make any difference?",
  "Was there attorneys' fees in that offer? I thought there wasn't in --",
  "Well, you -- you don't accept the argument that I suggested, that is Rule 16 -- 216, the Fair Labor Standards Act, in saying that you can commence a suit on behalf of others similarly situated, and implicit in that is that there be some decent interval for you to find similarly-situated people?",
  "Why didn't -- why didn't you file the -- the motion for certification, along with the complaint?",
  "But you could -- you could have done that with the complaint and I don't -- you say you want to get joiners, so why do you have to wait? Why -- why wouldn't you -- why wouldn't the most logical thing be to say, court, we have labelled this a collective action, and now, we want to start the ball rolling in getting certification?",
  "Mr. Mann, if this is -- if what Mr. Yang just told us is so, then there would be no issue preclusion because there has been no -- been no adjudication of anything. Then it seems to me that this case falls into a classic exception to mootness, which is defendant's voluntary cessation doesn't moot a controversy. And this controversy is capable of repetition yet evasive review because every time -- so the plaintiff's got this judgment, not preclusive. The employer continues in the old ways. The plaintiff sues again. This seems to me to fit exactly into that category of cases. If there is no issue preclusion, defendant doesn't have to stop the practice, can continue the practice, and then every time there is a suit say, okay, we'll pay the judgment.",
  "But there is nothing litigated when you have --",
  "Claim preclusion, but the claim is, for this period of time, I wasn't given the compensation. That's the claim.",
  "And then there is another period of time, and there is no issue preclusion.",
  "But there was no ruling in the court of appeals. The court of appeals did not rule on the statute -- whether the statute mandates that these logging roads be governed.",
  "So is -­",
  "And so that's not a point that this Court could resolve in the first instance.",
  "Yes, you can do that; but this Court is a court of review, not first view, and we don't take questions that haven't been aired below.",
  "You wouldn't have to do anything if the Court vacated the decision below. Then you wouldn't be facing anything.",
  "Would you be -­",
  "Would you be entitled to it?",
  "So -- so if you're right, that you're entitled to it and we agree with you, then there is nothing. You don't have anything hanging over your head as a result -­",
  "-- of the prior decision.",
  "But we didn't -­",
  "But that -- that is the question, the question of what the statute requires, was not decided below.",
  "And you -- you're not urging that we reach it?",
  "But if you were challenging the new rule, you would have EPA as your adversary. The format of this case now is we have -- we have Decker on one side and you on the other, and the EPA is not in the lawsuit.",
  "The -- the Court's decision in Henderson against Shinseki, that also involved an intra-agency appeal, and yet, we said that equitable tolling was permissible.",
  "Could she -- could she have adopted equitable tolling?",
  "This -- this agency not more than 3 years extension, that was adopted after notice and comment, and Congress amended this statute several times thereafter, but it left this -- this 3-year outside limit intact. So if Congress really wanted there to be no leeway at all, then it should have done something about that regulation.",
  "And why -- why do you say that? I mean, the record that we have says that the CMS failed to use the best available data. It doesn't say anything about deliberate concealment.",
  "Well, in -- in any event, the Baystate case, which is what revealed all of this, in -- in that case, the district judge there didn't say -- he said they didn't use the best available data. He didn't find any deliberate concealment.",
  "But Justice Scalia was not correct in what he just said. The 3 years is for the provider. The 3 -- under the Secretary's regulations, the provider gets an additional 3 years, but no more; isn't that right?",
  "Yes. But it's not 180 days for them. It's 180 days, plus an extension up to 3 years.",
  "But are you challenging -- I mean, there is a rule that says that -- there is a regulation that, for fraud, it's -- the time is unlimited. But that -- that regulation, the government says, applies only to the provider, not to the -- the government. Are you challenging the agency's reading of the word \"party\" in that regulation?",
  "Did you -- did you make that argument in this case? I wasn't aware that you had challenged the interpretation of -- of the fraud regulation.",
  "Well, suppose it's just what the Baystate court said it is. It isn't deliberate concealment, but it is failure to use the best available data. And I take it the argument you just presented is equitable tolling is tied to misconduct. So just failure to use the best available data, not deliberate concealment, wouldn't make it.",
  "So what -- what circumstances trigger equitable tolling, in your view?",
  "Yes, but suppose that the fact-finding turns out that the -- that there is no deliberate concealment, but there is merely a failure to use the best available data.",
  "So you would have to prove that before we know whether there is equitable tolling.",
  "Yes, but I'm asking you, if you get past that hurdle, then we never -- we won't know that there is equitable tolling until we have tried out the question of the character of --",
  "Why in your case, even assuming that there might be equitable tolling, here, is it -- is it 10 years later? And there was this Baystate case going on. You -- you didn't file immediately after that litigation was instituted. You waited until those plaintiffs won their case. You waited till there was a decision of the lower court. So it seems to me you -- you said there's a requirement of diligence. Why -- why didn't you have to file when you were first on notice, which you would have been from the complaint filed in the Baystate case?",
  "How many -- how many cases are there like this pending, either at the agency level or in court now?",
  "What was the purpose of having the monitoring station if nothing can be done? And are -- the monitoring shows, yes, there is a lot of pollutants in there, and we know that at least some of them have to be ascribed to the district. But you say, unless you -- you show the outflow, that it comes from there, no liability. Why shouldn't it be that, given there is going to be a contribution that the district is making, that the district should have the burden of showing, no, there are all these other ones out there, so our percentage is X, not the whole thing?",
  "Mr. Shah, what about the problem that one of the amici brought up concerning dredged material? Said that if we just say Miccosukee applies, then when there's a dredging operation and the material is redeposited back into the same water, then that would also -- there would be no responsibility based on that.",
  "And if there -- if there is --",
  "Mr. Shah, am I right about that this other theory, if it were open to the Ninth Circuit, would apply equally to the other rivers that Justice Breyer mentioned, and those were out of the case because, when it got to the Ninth Circuit, we were talking about only the Los Angeles and the San Gabriel?",
  "That -- that other theory would apply to all four.",
  "But how do -- the district is a big contributor, but there are other contributors. So, on your theory, how do we determine what is the share that the district would be liable for?",
  "Well, would you still I'm not clear if you gave me an answer to how the district share would be determined. It is not the only polluter. Are you saying each permittee is responsible for the whole?",
  "So how do we find out what is its part -- what is its share?",
  "That’s because you’re giving up -- you're giving up on the two rivers, even though your theory would work the same way with respect to them?",
  "But do you think that the trial court was wrong, the district court was wrong, and the Ninth Circuit, both times, when they said, well, you didn't prove -- there was no -- there was no proof that the district was responsible for a given part. So, on your theory, both the district court and the Ninth Circuit were wrong on that?",
  "Why would it make any difference? Once -- once the decision -- the district court decision is vacated, then the State court can go forward. There is nothing that inhibits it from doing so. There is no Federal court order. So your third point, I think, is --",
  "Now, I don't understand that. The child is now in Scotland.",
  "So how would these six months be satisfied?",
  "But you can argue that on the basis of the vacation of the district court's Hague Convention order. You -- you're not inhibited by anything, as far as I can see, that the Federal court has done. Since it's been vacated, it's as though it never happened.",
  "But you don't have -- you don't have that individual -- the residence -- habitual residence determination because it's been wiped out.",
  "When you say, \"bring the child back,\" there's an impediment to that because now this court in Scotland has told her don't -- the child stays here. There's an order that the child not be removed from Scotland, and there is also -- doesn't the mother have -- wasn't this mother deported?",
  "So if she -- she -- if she -- the mother comes back into the United States, she's committing a criminal offense.",
  "But what about the order of the court in Scotland?",
  "How long has the child been -- now since -- since the return, pursuant to the Federal court's order, how long has the child been residing in Scotland?",
  "Is that done in a separate judgment? The --",
  "And is there any problem about the time to appeal from that having run?",
  "But, as far as mootness is concerned, if you have not appealed from that order and the time has run from your appeal, you can't rely on that to avoid mootness.",
  "But in Scotland, it's -- it would be a custody proceeding. Forget about the Hague. The child is there. The mother is bringing a custody proceeding. And the question for that court is where is the child's habitual residence now?",
  "But that was only for determining the Hague Convention; and, if the Hague Convention is out of it, then there is a custody proceeding. The idea of the Hague Convention is just to get the case to a forum that's an appropriate forum to decide the custody question, right?",
  "Ms. Saharsky, not to -- I mean, the whole object of the Hague Convention is to stop this shuttling the child back and forth. But, because of this unfortunate situation we have, where the district judge wouldn't give a stay, you're -- what you're -- what you're urging is exactly what this Convention was meant to stop. This child has been in Scotland for 14 months. Now, you say bring it back to the United States, and we -- we start over. The whole object of the return procedure is so that you get the child to a place that's a proper place to determine custody; isn't that right?",
  "You agree that the ideal -- the ideal procedure would be, and I quite agree, that you have a very fast track stay pending appeal and an expedited appeal. But there is no rule that -- that requires that, so how -- how could that sensible procedure be put in place?",
  "But we wouldn't go back to what should have happened, that is, the district judge applying the four factor test -- or did the district -- there was an application for a stay. It was denied, right?",
  "You're -- I think you're -- you're - -",
  "We -- we have a brief in -- in the case telling us that the question Justice Breyer is posing, would they look at it; they would say it's irrelevant.",
  "Because what her habitual residence was then doesn't matter one whit to us. We want to know where she is residing now, and that's the reason why the Scottish court would say it's not relevant to the question before us. Their question is not a treaty question. Their question is custody of this child.",
  "Mr. Cullen, are you saying that the -- under the treaty, there can be no rereturn order? Is that what you're saying? Whether the -- whether the return order was wrong or right, there can be no rereturn?",
  "But that was the purpose of the Convention, was to cut that out. That's the whole reason for the Convention, that they wanted to stop the shuttling of children. Do you -- are you aware of rereturn? Your -- your thesis is that the -- that, now, the court of appeals could tell the district judge, you were wrong. And then the father, armed with that, can go and get a rereturn order from the Scottish court under the Convention. Have there been instances under the Convention, was this question of rereturn -- is rereturn authorized, assuming that there was a valid return order, at least valid when it was entered and when the child was returned --",
  "What is the incidence of rereturn under the Hague Convention?",
  "Was the child returned? Or was it just a decision that the appeal could not be avoided? Was the child returned by Poland?",
  "That's -- see, that's the whole problem, is that you -- you're going to have rival decrees of two countries, which is what -- exactly what the Convention was meant to avoid.",
  "Mr. Boutrous, I thought at least as an alternative argument, you're saying: The statute itself is silent. It doesn't deal with this question of amount in controversy. However, the individual, the named plaintiff, who has said, I'm not going to seek more than the $5 million, cannot speak for the members of the class who are absent. He can't stipulate that they will take under 5,000. I thought that was the central part of your argument, not based on the statute itself, but on the notion that a named plaintiff, unless and until he is -- he is certified to represent the class - doesn't represent them. He can represent himself, but he can't bind the people who -- who have not been certified as part of a class. I thought that was part of your argument.",
  "What about specifically the question that the Chief asked about time? You did argue in the district court that these plaintiffs could have specified a 5-year time period, in which case it would be clear that the amount in controversy was satisfied. But instead, they took a 2-year period. Can we take that also into account in determining the amount in controversy, that the complaint could have been enlarged to include 5 years instead of 2 years?",
  "Your concern is that the -- that the certification -- if the certification would occur in the Federal court, that's one thing. But you're -- you're saying that the named plaintiff can't stand for the entire class when we know that -- that the certification question, if the stipulation is binding to prevent removal, it's going to be the State court that's going to look into the adequacy of representation and whether the stipulation binds all members of the class. That's your whole concern. If the -- if the Federal court made that determination, I think you wouldn't be here.",
  "What do you do -- in the language in 1332(d)(1)(D), the term \"class members\" means the persons, named or unnamed, who fall within the definition of the proposed class, the proposed class, and that's what we have here.",
  "But your theory doesn't depend on it being just a little over $5 million, the theory would hold whether it was $8 million, $9 million --",
  "Even though you admit in your brief -- you agreed that the stipulation -- I didn't think that this is what you said on page 53, the stipulations can have no effect on absentees, until the Court finds at the certification stage that the stipulation was made in good faith and doesn't render the named plaintiff an inadequate representative. But we have to judge removal at the time removal is made, and at that time, there is no determination of class. So at the removal stage, the stipulation is inoperative as to the non-named class members.",
  "How is it binding when you said in your brief it doesn't bind the unnamed class members?",
  "Justice Breyer's hypothetical would not come up on your theory because the Federal court would never get the chance to make that determination. It would be made in the State court.",
  "So would that include the I'm suing for two years when I could have sued for five?",
  "You don't take issue, do you, with the argument that in -- in determining what the State law is you can take account not only of the words of the statute, but how the State Supreme Court interprets those words?",
  "Let's -- let's get back to this case. I think what you're saying about the plea colloquy is, even if he had said to the judge, yes, I broke and entered the Metro Mart, even if he had said that, the conviction still would not be for burglary.",
  "There's -- there's probably an obvious answer to this, but the Taylor definition of generic burglary is unlawful entry into or remaining in a building with intent to commit a crime. Why doesn't this, the crime of which the defendant was convicted, satisfy the remaining, the remaining in the building with intent to commit a crime?",
  "That -- that intent would continue while the person remains in the building.",
  "But breaking and entering -- in your brief as I understand it you are not relying on the prosecutor's charge that there was breaking and entering. You're relying entirely on the plea colloquy. And in this plea colloquy, the prosecutor said, he broke and entered a grocery store. He says nothing. In the typical Rule 11 setting, when the judge goes through the series of questions, the judge doesn't take the defendant's silence. The defendant has to positively affirm. And here we have a plea colloquy where the prosecutor says something and the defendant doesn't respond. Why is that any kind of a necessary admission when he said nothing, which he might have done under the impression that it didn't matter because he had the intent to commit a crime?",
  "Why should it be different than in the Rule 11 colloquy? Why shouldn't there be -- if -- if this is going to determine whether there's a crime qualifying under ACCA, why should it be enough that the prosecutor said something? Why shouldn't the defendant have to say, yes, I broke and entered the grocery store?",
  "Is that - -",
  "-- to charge it as what? What's shoplifting?",
  "But it -- but it does come under this section 459.",
  "Mr. Liman. Mr. Liman, you -- you are typing this a penalty case. The government says yes the accrual is the ordinary rule, but discovery is the rule when there is fraud, and fraud is alleged here. So how does the Court decide whether to type this case a penalty case, as you urge, or a fraud case, as the government urged -- urges, when both captions fit?",
  "How did the government take it out? I mean, the point here is that there was a concealment. There was a hiding of what was -- the impermissible action.",
  "Mr. Liman, how does it work with a disgorgement remedy? I take it that that's still -- that you are not challenging the disgorgement?",
  "But you don't apply -- you don't say it's too late for them to sue for disgorgement?",
  "So is there any statute of limitations on disgorgement?",
  "Are there no statutes, Mr. Liman, that say the claim accrues when the injury is discovered, that use both -- both terms?",
  "Are there no statutes that use both terms, \"accrues\" and \"discovery\"? A statute, for example, that says, this claim accrues when the injury is discovered?",
  "And it is a generous period. It's -- it's 5 years. And, Mr. Wall, maybe you can explain the SEC's pursuit of this -- of this case. The alleged fraud went on from 1999 to 2002. It was discovered in 2003. The SEC waited from 2003 to 2008 to commence suit. What -- what is the reason for -- for the delay from the time of discovery till the time suit is instituted?",
  "You answered the question with respect to jury verdicts. I suppose it would be no different if it 's the judge that found the 10 percent rather than the jury.",
  "The question that Justice Breyer was asking about the 10 percent has already been answered because we were told that if a jury allocated 10 percent to medicals, it would not make any difference, the statute entitles the State to 30 percent.",
  "I thought -- I thought your brief said that at some point, if it gets too high, you do have a problem under the anti-lien provision of Medicaid?",
  "Is that -- is that what happens? You said you -- that in North Carolina for workers' compensation -- for settlements that are subject to workers' compensation liens, you have this type of system.",
  "How does it work for workers' compensation recoveries that have the same thing, they -- they owe the State for the medical.",
  "Do you agree -- do you agree that the only flaw in the North Carolina statute is that it's a fixed amount, and that if it were a rebuttable presumption it would be okay? If the North Carolina law says 30 percent is the cap, but in a particular case you can show that that's not a fair allocation?",
  "But he said -- he said in the ten or so cases he had had in the past, I had -- I encountered no difficulty getting a warrant in prior cases. There was nothing that distinguished this case on the facts from other cases on the facts.",
  "Probable cause is not enough. If you have probable cause, then you can get a warrant. But it was and I think still is the main rule that if you can get a warrant, you must do that. Probable cause is surely not enough. Then we'd never need a warrant when there's probable cause.",
  "But we do have -- we do have, I think, an indication that there are jurisdictions that do it inside of a half-hour.",
  "Ms. Saharsky, what about saying at least they should try, since a number of jurisdictions can do this within a half hour, say, initiate the process while you are going to the hospital; when a half-hour is up you proceed; but at least there has been an effort to get a warrant.",
  "You mentioned Schmerber. Why did the Court go through all of the -- why -- it could have made it a much shorter opinion by simply saying, yes, blood alcohol dissipates. But it didn't. It -- it pointed out that in that particular case there was a delay to investigate the accident, the person had to be taken to the hospital for care, so how much time elapsed? I think it was two hours, wasn't it?",
  "What was all the -- why was it in the opinion?",
  "Yes. They didn't need to say any of that.",
  "What about that field sobriety test? Suppose the person who is apprehended and is suspected of being drunk says, I'm not going to walk a straight line. I'm going to just sit here. You can't make me do anything without a warrant. Do you need -- if the defendant doesn't consent, do you need a warrant to -- to have the standard sobriety test?",
  "Yes.",
  "What you're saying is if it's now or never --",
  "-- where the other is a slow process.",
  "Mr. Shapiro, before your time runs out, the case of the fingernail --",
  "-- scrapings has been raised as saying well, that's -- somebody is going to scrape your fingernails, that's as intrusive as a blood test.",
  "It says, \"anticipation of litigation in connection\" --",
  "Not only ongoing litigation, but it can be used in connection with anticipation of litigation.",
  "Do you recognize that you could use (b)(4) to identify class members?",
  "So -- so if it's -- if it's a solicitation, suppose this information was a -- the recent automobile purchaser was asked: Did you buy a car recently? Were you charged this additional fee? Period. That would be okay?",
  "That would come under (b)(4)?",
  "That's why -- would you -- I want to make sure I understood your prior answer. You said, I thought, that it would have been okay to get the information from the bureau and then ask, did you buy a car recently? Did you have this additional charge? Now, suppose -- you said that was all right?",
  "Well, isn't that -- wasn't that crystal-clear here? Because the dealers were saying, you can't go forward unless you have a plaintiff to match every dealer. You're trying to bring a representative action, but your list of plaintiffs, none of them bought from Dealer Z. So we are investigating to see if we can have a representative action with a line-up of plaintiffs, each of whom has purchased from a list of defendants.",
  "Well, suppose we had -- what -- it was limited to did you buy the car, did you pay the fee? And then somebody who --",
  "We -- we have just those questions, no -- are you interested in joining a lawsuit, please call us. But somebody who receives this notice, it just asks, did you buy a car, did you pay the charge, then calls the lawyer's office and says, tell me something about this letter that you told me -- that you -- you sent to me. And how does the lawyer answer?",
  "It doesn't necessarily follow --",
  "-- that they -- they are describing only what goes on in the court. If you just took the phrase \"investigation in anticipation of litigation,\" \"in anticipation of\" sounds like before litigation begins.",
  "I don't know why this case doesn't fit that description because the -- the position that the dealers were taking was you can't -- you ought to maintain a representative action. The State has such an animal, it's not quite a class action, representative action. To qualify, the group must be numerous. So how am I going to find out if it's numerous, without asking these questions?",
  "Might that get the lawyer into some difficulty with the Bar Association? They'll look at this and say, look, we told you, if you are -- if you are seeking clients, then you have to put advertising material. And a letter like that would tip the recipient off to something is going on, I should find out about it, and maybe I should join it.",
  "But then there is a whole string of defendants who were doing the same thing -- the same allegedly unlawful practice, they couldn't reach without getting additional plaintiffs.",
  "But their client is a -- is a group. This -- this is not an individual action --",
  "The statute says sue for the benefit of the whole.",
  "Suppose you -- you said that you had a few people came and complained to the lawyers, and then the lawyers wanted to see how widespread this was. Suppose the lawyer herself bought a car recently, and she got this administrative fee. And, now, she has -- no clients have approached her, but she would like to find out how many similarly situated people there are, so she can get one of these representative actions going. Could -- on that basis, would it be permissible to use -- would that come under the litigation exception?",
  "Ms. Maguire, you don't -- you don't have to take the position that there's no stare decisis effect. In a unanimous -- a recent unanimous decision of this Court, obviously, would carry more weight than one that has a plurality opinion, so you don't have to say -- it isn't a question of yes or no, it's a question of the degree of respect that we would give to our former decision.",
  "You mentioned drug weight. Let's -- so you're making -- your argument would mean that drug weight also has to be found by the jury because that can -- the length of the sentence can depend on the -- the drug weight.",
  "But let's say --",
  "How about in deference to the jury's finding? I mean, in this -- this -- this very case, wasn't it so that the judge said, I could just say seven years because it's within the range, but it would be dishonest of me to do that, wouldn't it? I have to say seven because it's the mandatory minimum. I think this is a case where the effect is -- is shown graphically, that the judge says, I'm stuck with the seven; I would prefer five. That's what the jury would lead me to do, but I'm -- my hands are tied, I cannot respect the jury's finding.",
  "The one -- the one counsel who was qualified, what was his name?",
  "Lorenzi, yes. He was only one at the time who was qualified to be lead counsel?",
  "And the Louisiana Supreme Court said, you don't have to do this. You're his -- you're his attorney, but you have a right to be paid, and the State has to pay you. So there was no obligation on the counsel's part to do anything; and he kept asking, please have a funding order, let me be paid, and I'll do my job.",
  "You would like us to say what Judge Cook said in -- in her opinion, that responsibility for funding rests with the State, not with the defendant. Once an attorney is appointed, it is the State's obligation to ensure that adequate funds are available for the defense. And I take \"for the defense\" to mean not simply counsel, but the witnesses, the -- the investigation. It is certainly true that none of the delay due to the lack of funds was, in any way, attributable to the defense. That's, essentially, what you would like us to say?",
  "Can we clarify one point? Justice Scalia said something about a defendant facing the death penalty going \"scot-free.\" There was an armed robbery charge that was added in 2007. Do you dispute that a new clock started in 2007, the first time that the robbery charge was -- was made?",
  "But wasn't there something about that motion was withdrawn -- the 2005 motion was withdrawn in 2006?",
  "How -- on that, how could it possibly be Lorenzi's fault, which is what you said is your first point, when he said, pay me, Supreme Court of Louisiana, you have said that my operation as counsel for this indigent defendant doesn't become operative till I get paid, I have a right to get paid. All that counsel did was to say, again and again, pay me, get the funds to pay me. I don't understand how in the world it could be the fault of an attorney who has not gotten one cent from the State, has a right to be paid before he engages in representation -- how can it be his fault?",
  "Mr. Boyer was -- had a limited education and a low IQ. Did anyone ever counsel him about this, no, you don't have to have two lawyers, you can have one? Did any judge ever tell him what his rights were?",
  "What was the level of his education?",
  "And he was expected to know all this about two counsel -- you have a right to two counsel, but, if the State isn't going to pay them, you can go forward with one counsel? Did anyone ever tell this man, with an eighth grade education, what his rights were?",
  "And she was not -- you know, you said that, at all times, he had at least two. It seemed to me -- two paid counsel. Lorenzi wasn't paid, so it was -- was it Singer?",
  "And then the woman -- Lehman, is it? But, when she started representing him, she didn't have the qualifications to be counsel.",
  "But she wouldn't -- she couldn't be appointed counsel in a death case under Louisiana's rules.",
  "Yes, but, in the very beginning, she wasn't even qualified to do that.",
  "The -- the court itself said, repeatedly, that the cause of the delay was the funding crisis, the court -- I think we have to accept that as being the case, that the funding crisis -- the effort to get this lawyer paid failed, time and again. And it was the court determination that it is the funding crisis that caused the delay.",
  "Mr. Feldman, but it says, first, \"for purposes of this section.\" And, as I -- I understand your argument, those words don't count. In other words, you would be making -- you would interpret the statute the same way if the sentence started with \"the provisions of Section 2680(h).\"",
  "The Veterans Administration, it doesn't say that, does it?",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Feldman, do I understand the mechanics of this right, that, if the injured person sued the United States directly, that suit would fail because the battery exclusion would apply, but it's only by suing the officer -- the doctor and then getting the United States substituted that the battery exception is abrogated; is that right?",
  "Mr. Feldman, when the Westfall Act, which doesn't abrogate the intentional tort provision, when that was passed, why -- was there any reason why Congress kept these five or six separate acts, like the Gonzalez Act, instead of saying, well, we did this piecemeal for particular agencies, and, now, we we’re dealing with Federal employees across the board, so there is no reason why we should have these five or six that go another way?",
  "Mr. Shah, this is not always the government's position. In fact, in a brief to this Court, in the Smith case, the government took the position that Mr. Feldman is presenting to us. What occurred to turn on the light for the government, to see that it was wrong in the Smith case and come up with this -- the interpretation you are now advancing?",
  "Why would -- why would Congress -- I mean, the Veterans Administration Act came after the four or five others, and Congress thought it was patterning that Act after the Gonzalez Act. Why would Congress want to provide this battery remedy if a Veterans Administration medical person messed up, but not if it was an armed service doctor?",
  "Mr. Shah, does it make any sense to distinguish between a medical malpractice, negligence and this unconsented operation, to split those two and say the government is liable for malpractice, but not for this unconsented action.",
  "Let's back up. When he asked for a permit, he voluntarily said, I -- as mitigation for the loss of wetlands, I am going to voluntarily create a conservation easement on the rest of my property. So he recognized, from day one, that there had to be some mitigation for what he was seeking to do in the permit. Is that right?",
  "And if he had offered nothing, and he just said, I want this permit to develop my land, and the agency said, you have offered no mitigation, we deny your permit, would he have a claim?",
  "Suppose he just put in the application, no mitigating -- no mitigation of any kind, and the agency says no. You recognize that he would have no claim, right? That he had an obligation to mitigate.",
  "I think you -- I think you have a problem then, Mr. Beard, because, if you look at the record, the record is very clear that it was not -- that the district didn't come back and say, take it or leave it, you -- you improve our wetlands, or you get no permit. There was -- and if you -- they are set out in the Respondent's brief at pages 13 to 15, oh, at least half a dozen, maybe more, that the -- the district said, here are several ways -- several ways that you could sufficiently offset the adverse impact. And some of them had nothing to do with improving the government's own land. So if we can't -- we really can't say this was a take it or leave it, either you do the improvement that we are asking you to do, or you get no permit, what do you do with the fact that, as the appendix certainly bears out, that the district offered a range, it offered many, many ways that this permit might be granted. And then it says, then you are free to come up with some other -- something else.",
  "Not -- not -- because he wouldn't go beyond what he was offering, but that's -- some of these options -- one was that he -- that he adjust the size of his project, that he make it smaller. The -- the staff suggested eliminating -- no, that -- that's a different one. But there was one that suggested that he -- he reduce the scale, the Petitioner reduce the scale of his project to one acre and preserve the rest for the conservation easement. Now, if that -- if he took that, would you have any -- any case here?",
  "If they said, we will give you -- we will give you a permit if you reduce the scale of your project to one acre, and then preserve the rest by a conservation easement?",
  "Suppose the record just doesn't bear that out; the record shows that it wasn't one option. They gave him a laundry list of things he could do, some -- some of them having nothing whatever to do -- anything off his own property. Suppose the -- whatever the district court might have said, the record shows that the agency said, you're right, seven things you could do, come up with here are six, if you have something else. And some of them have absolutely nothing to do with other properties.",
  "Where -- where is that?",
  "Mr. Wolfson, why isn't it entirely reasonable to say, if you are going to put a condition on a permit, that condition has to have some rough proportionate relationship to the harm that is being done to the permit -- what -- that seems to me perfectly sensible, that if they are going -- if they are going to exact a condition, the condition has to have some discrete proportional relationship to the harm?",
  "The question is whether the experimental use -- whether that was a viable theory. Why isn't that a substantial -- what do you mean by, \"substantial\"?",
  "Do you mean substantial beyond the -- the -- this particular case?",
  "What about other areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction, where the claim, if you are stating it initially, would have to go into Federal court and not State court, say, an antitrust claim, a copyright claim? Is -- is what you're saying about patents, does that go for every area, where initial jurisdiction is exclusively in the Federal court?",
  "Then what's the difference between, say, antitrust and patent?",
  "Issue preclusion applies only to someone who was a party.",
  "But that, certainly, is not binding. The -- whatever the State -- whatever the State court says, as a matter of patent law, has no binding effect on that question coming into Federal court.",
  "How?",
  "What would happen -- what would happen if that came up in an ordinary litigation in Federal court, and the Federal circuit, ultimately, decided the question, that the State court was entirely wrong about this; you don't need a witness. Well, that's the end of it, right? Once the Federal court decides the question, then whatever the -- the State judge thought was the Federal law is -- is gone.",
  "Anytime -- anytime -- I mean, a lot of patent questions -- as you already pointed out, a lot of patent questions come up in State court litigations, contract litigations, every time you have a patent question, then must the case go to the Federal court, in your view?",
  "So what is the dividing line between patent questions that belong in State court and patent questions that belong only in Federal court?",
  "Well, why don't you stay within the lines that you give us? You have said not every patent question that comes up in a State court gets dismissed, just so you can start over in Federal court, what patent questions -- now, let's not talk about breach of fiduciary duty general questions -- what patent questions are properly adjudicated in the State court as part of a lawsuit that --",
  "But the -- but the Federal court -- you said before that whatever the Federal circuit says, the State doesn't have to follow it the next time there's a case in State court, but the Federal court is certainly not going to follow what the State judge says on experimental use.",
  "And your -- your distinction between other areas of Federal jurisdiction where the Federal law controls and patent is what? What -- Justice Sotomayor brought up immigration law --",
  "-- copyright law. Why don't they -- why doesn't what you said work the same way in those fields?",
  "So your case turns on the -- the Federal circuit having exclusive appellate jurisdiction?",
  "But, if there's a large Federal interest, I mean, that's what you're saying that there is in the Federal/State balance -- the Federal balance -- it's preponderant on the Federal side. If there is that large Federal interest, is it surprising that the government hasn't come into this case, if there's such a Federal interest to be protected?",
  "There's a difference between you and your colleague on what \"substantial\" means.",
  "And she says it doesn't just mean necessary -- essential in this particular litigation, but, as in the Grable case and the Kansas City Title & Trust, has larger ramifications for many other cases, not just this case and whether there's going to be issue preclusion as to this particular inventor. Those -- I don't see an issue in this case comparable to those.",
  "Whether they -- those questions will come to the Federal circuit, and they'll decide it, and then they'll be settled.",
  "How likely is that, in practice, that once the Federal circuit weighs in, that the State judges will go their own way?",
  "Would that be the same thing for antitrust, be the same for copyright?",
  "Mr. Goldstein, this case has been presented in a very complicated way, but it seems to me that what we're dealing with is a rule adopted by the Commission, and the Commission's rule-making power, as you know, is very broad. They have power to make the rules needed to carry out the provisions of the Act. And 332 is -- counts as a provision of the Act. So why isn't it just a proper implementation of that rule-making authority?",
  "But if the abstract question really isn't presented -- I mean, just to follow on what I asked you first, here is a phrase, \"a reasonable time.\" And the Commission interprets that phrase in a reasonable way. Why is this case any more complicated than that? Why doesn't the FCC have the authority to interpret that term, within a reasonable time?",
  "Mr. Goldstein, in following that, it seems to me you -- you are basing your argument on what is said in 7(a). And that preserves the authority of the local governments. But the provision that we are talking about is (b), and (b) says limitations, authority that the local governments do not have, and among those limitations is that they have to act within a reasonable time.",
  "I just don't understand how the FCC's general rule-making authority is removed as to a provision that limits what the State and local governments can do.",
  "But you are -- you are skipping over (2), which is the phrase \"reasonable time.\"",
  "Just -- just on a practical level --",
  "-- what sense does it make to read this to say that each time there is a dispute that comes to the Court, the Court will decide in that particular case, with no guide at all, what the reasonable time is?",
  "How do you know -- how do you know when it's 30 days after a failure to act?",
  "Where does that say anything about what you just read about what is a reasonable time?",
  "Can you -- can you tell me, what is -- what is the ambiguity? Because I looked at (b). (B) is limitations. Limitations is on the State, and then it uses the phrase of what the State cannot do. The State has to conform to a reasonable time. What is ambiguous about this?",
  "Would that include, say, a meat -- a meat inspector? There is a wide range of Federal employees that have arrest or search or seizure -­",
  "I understand --",
  "Your view is that the limitation is scope of employment.",
  "The scope of employment is, and you don't add on anything else to that. You don't add arrest, search and seizure. But does this whole issue have an academic flavor, because how in the world could the conduct involved in this case qualify as within the scope of employment?",
  "Mr. Yang, even if -- if -- it depends on State law, that's clear. But does the United States sometimes concede scope of authority so it can represent -- it can be the sole defendant in the case, the individual officer is off the hook, so that the United States could make the argument: It never happened; the officer didn't do what the plaintiff charged?",
  "May I ask, in light of your opening statement, are you then abandoning your position that it must be either arrest, search or seizure? You have used the Ninth Circuit formula.",
  "Is it a limitation? Is scope a limitation? I thought that you -- you didn't question that, that scope is a limitation on the conduct that's covered, right?",
  "What about the takedown that occurred here and I -- it's not uncommon. The -- your definition includes three things, arrest, search, seizure. And correctional officers do engage in searches of cells for contraband, and they do engage in seizures. Those are not -- this isn't like arrest, which you point out the arrest is unusual; it's an escapee or a visitor. But that's not true of search and seizure.",
  "Then scope becomes kind of a surplusage.",
  "It has to be a law enforcement function. Give -- give me an example of a case where -- where scope would also be relevant, would also be applicable -- if you -- if there is a law enforcement function, then it fits. So what does scope add?",
  "But why --",
  "But why -- you said making or use and it isn't an either-or thing then -- as the other side has pointed out. You can use the seed to make new seeds. So use and make aren't -- it's not either you use it or you make it. You can use it to make a new item.",
  "Well, suppose he -- he had never bought any Monsanto seeds. He just goes to the grain elevator and 90-odd percent of those seeds have the genetic composition. So -- and he planted that and he harvested it. Would he be infringing on Monsanto's patents?",
  "So he never has to buy any seed, at all, from Monsanto.",
  "Well, you just said that -- that we haven't had a case involving self-replicating. I mean, the Exhaustion Doctrine was shaped with the idea of an article; there was an article that you could use and then you use it and it's used up. But we haven't applied the Exhaustion Doctrine when you have a new -- when you create a copy of the original. So it's -- it's not that we have law in place. We've been dealing with an item with the Exhaustion Doctrine and now we have hundreds of items, thousands of items, all growing from that original seed.",
  "And they may -- they may they own them, but that doesn't mean that they are infringing. They may -- the seeds are owned by the farmer. But when he uses them to grow more seeds, he's infringing on that patent. So I don't think that the ownership has anything to do with it.",
  "But he couldn't put the herbicide on -- he couldn't -- if he went and bought conventional seeds, not the genetically improved seeds --",
  "-- then -- then he wouldn't -- what would the yield be if he puts the herbicide on it and they are all killed?",
  "Can you -- can you explain that business a little more fully than you did in the briefs? He's in the business of collecting records from all the States about tax assessments.",
  "And he -- and he does that for a client who could very well ask himself. So what is the service that's being performed?",
  "How much -- how much of an impact, in fact, does it have on his business? I mean, there are 47 States who will provide this information.",
  "But the point is that FOIA is tied to, as Justice Scalia said, the citizens should know what their government is doing. And you don't have to give any reason at all, if you were a part of that political community. Now, Virginia doesn't allow people from out-of-State to vote. They're not part of Virginia's political community. So why isn't this -- if you're not part of the political community, then you don't fall under FOIA, which is a peculiar statute, in that everybody who is covered by it can get whatever they want, and they don't have to give any reason for it.",
  "But if it costs for Virginia -- Virginia has to take care of its own, and, if it has to service FOIA requests from all over, it's going to cost the State. It's going to have to hire people to do this. They're going to have to spend many hours going through these records, so the State doesn't -- it wants to conserve its resources for its own people.",
  "Then you would be doing something very strange with this statute because you would be saying Hurlbert has a right to this because it's his business. But the statute, the character of this statute is it doesn't matter what you want the information for. But you're saying the out-of -- the in-Stater, it doesn't matter. Out-of-Stater, is it your argument that, if this out-of-Stater has a good reason for getting this and it's related to the out-of-State's business, so you -- you're changing the character of a FOIA statute, which is it doesn't matter what you want it for.",
  "But it has -- it has -­",
  "What else -- what else can Virginia do besides -- I don't know if there are elks in Virginia, but besides -- to reserve for its own -- for its own people? You say, this is -- good government in Virginia is for Virginians. Big game hunting, scarce resource can be reserved for in-State people. What else can Virginia do?",
  "Are you leaving out -­",
  "Are you leaving it -­ you -- you switched now to-- and you were led there, but you switched to the dormant Commerce Clause. What about your other client, McBurney? He doesn't have any dormant Commerce Clause claim.",
  "Mr. Clement, is there another example -- Justice Kennedy mentioned that this was what they call \"one-off.\" It's one time only, and it's retrospective. Is -- is there any instance in which a foreign tax credit has been given to something that looks like this, a one-time only adjustment that is -- that operates retrospectively on past earnings?",
  "I thought you would -- you would answer that, that the Commissioner gets some credit, too. This is the Commissioner -- this is a Treasury regulation. So one question is: Do we owe that regulation any kind of -- any kind of deference?",
  "Ms. O'Connell -- if the Court should go the way the Fifth Circuit went -- the way the Tax Court went -- could the regulation be changed so it wouldn't happen again?",
  "Suppose the State's position were not as you accurately have stated the Texas Court of Criminal Appeal. It didn't say collateral review is the preferred route. It said either way will do. You can bring it up on direct appeal, or you can bring it up on collateral. Would you say that Martinez applies in that situation? Or does it depend on having the -- the State highest court in the matter saying, this is the preferred way to go?",
  "And if it didn't, if it just said, you can bring it up on direct, but we realize these limitations because the transcript won't be ready, so you can wait and bring it up on habeas. I'm just asking how far -- the rule that you would like us to adopt -- you say this is just like Martinez. Is that where you would draw the line, that the -- the State's highest court has to say, we prefer this matter to be brought up on collateral review?",
  "But is your point that he has to have one full and fair opportunity to make the Wiggins claim, and it doesn't matter whether it's direct or collateral? I think you mentioned that at least one State requires you to do it on direct, but does provide for developing the record.",
  "What are the rules other than the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals having said, in several decisions, the preferred route is collateral review?",
  "Well, if that is the system in Kansas and Michigan, then why -- why is it outside Martinez, if the point is you can't effectively present the ineffective assistance counsel when you've got the same counsel who was alleged to have been ineffective and is not going to condemn himself?",
  "Explain why the time that you have on direct appeal isn't adequate. So you say you need -- need to investigate. Well, some of the things, like school records, his prison records, it doesn't take a long time to get those, does it?",
  "Why is it a second bite when the Texas Supreme Court -- court of criminal appeals, has said, again and again, as a general rule, defendants should not raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal, should raise it on collateral review?",
  "I don't -- does the statement \"defendants should not raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal\" doesn't mean what it says?",
  "And the Fifth Circuit was wrong, the circuit that ruled in favor of Texas, but said, in the Ibarra case, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has made it clear that State habeas petitions -- and the State habeas petition is the preferred vehicle for developing ineffective assistance claims? Was that wrong?",
  "Mr. Oldham, do we have a clue, Mr. Oldham, if the information is correct, that direct appeal counsel in the county involved here gets a very limited amount of money -- gets, they said it's $1,500 fixed fee. But, if counsel who's appointed as collateral review gets $25,000, doesn't that suggest that the -- that the counsel on direct appeal is expected to deal with trial errors and the one that gets all this $25,000 can go out and find a psychologist, a sociologist, whoever is going to give us a profile on this person?",
  "Is it true that it's the county that reimburses the direct appeal counsel and the State reimburses the habeas counsel?",
  "Has there ever been such a case, any case in which a direct appeal counsel has been held ineffective for failing to present a Wiggins claim?",
  "But I asked, if there was any decisions that says, you should have raised it on appeal, appeals counsel didn't rely on the advice of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and, therefore, because counsel followed the advice of Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, she was ineffective?",
  "Well, the -- the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in addition to saying, as a general rule, bring it up on -- on collateral review, said -- and there's a reason. The reason why is the undeveloped record on direct appeal would be insufficient to establish claims that must be supported by extra-record evidence. So that seems to be an expectation that extra-record evidence will be developed on collateral review, not direct appeal.",
  "What about the position of the State that says Martinez is relatively new, if there is an extension of Martinez to cover this case, then at least give the Texas courts the first crack at deciding whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel, instead of having that done in the Federal court?",
  "Mr. Bursch, I thought that -- that Perkins -- didn't he say that -- that you could take into account -- I'm looking for the brief -- you could take into account delay as a factor in whether his actual innocence gateway plea should be heard.",
  "What would it take to -- what would it take to show diligence? And didn't he say that he tried to get a lawyer, several times, and was unsuccessful?",
  "Was that -- was that argued to the -- to the Sixth Circuit? Did you argue in the Sixth Circuit that, even assuming diligence, there wasn't enough here, and that's what the district court held?",
  "But it -- it was explicitly made to the Sixth Circuit?",
  "Before you present the argument --",
  "-- you are saying that Congress overruled Schlup; is that what -- the point you're making?",
  "Why can't you cross-examine her? Is it just because the lapse of time and she won't remember?",
  "Before you proceed with that, can you address Justice Alito's point that the district court said there is no merit to this; it's not an actual innocence -- it's not a valid actual innocence claim. And then the Sixth Circuit sends it back for the district court to decide something it's already decided? How do you overcome that the Sixth Circuit never reviewed the actual innocence question, the district court did and said this doesn't make it?",
  "And the statute of limitations would run from the discovery of the new evidence, not from --",
  "You have a larger -- you have a larger category, you say miscarriage of justice, so one is actual innocence. You say the category is well defined. So what else would fit under this -- and we can bring it up very late in the -- in the day. Anything else other than actual innocence would be in this category?",
  "How about --",
  "The Second Circuit -- when it had a similar case, the Second Circuit itself said that actual innocence is rare. This is such a case. This is a case where the alibi that he had was -- it was established by forensic evidence, air-tight, he was someplace else. The -- the Second Circuit didn't send it to the district court to decide the actual innocence. It decided that itself and then said, district court, now you deal with the -- with the questions that the petitioner is raising -- the constitutional questions. But the Sixth Circuit just seemed to be -- it didn't matter whether -- it didn't matter whether the actual innocence claim had any solid basis, when they sent it back to the district court. Shouldn't -- if there is an actual innocence gateway, shouldn't the court of appeals determine that before it returns the case to the district court?",
  "Yes, but it didn't find anything about whether this was -- this claim was -- was a good one.",
  "And I'm still puzzled about what happens next. The case goes back to the district court and the -- the district court is told, diligence doesn't matter. The district court says, yes, but I thought -- I thought that the claim was worthless.",
  "How about a Terry stop? A Terry stop?",
  "But these -- these are all cases -- I mean, the dominant use is to solve what they call cold -- cold cases, and you gave one example. This case is another. A rape committed 6 years before, right? And there was no reasonable suspicion, there was no -- nothing, right? And the suspicion comes up only because the DNA sample comes back as a match. So is it the -- this is a very reliable tool, but it's not based on any kind of suspicion of the individual who's being subjected to it, right?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, can you explain how it works, mechanically? Because I understand -- at least maybe this is just the Maryland statute, but if you can't use the swab that is taken from the arrestee when he is arrested -- it can't be used, it's inadmissible -- then you do it again. You do it -- but what it does supply is probable cause because you found out that he was a perpetrator of a rape 6 years ago. Then you have probable cause and you get a warrant and do it again. What -- what is the reason for the doubling -- the doing it twice?",
  "I thought fingerprinting -- Mr. Shanmugam, I thought fingerprinting was used to determine whether they -- the person has a record. We have this person, and now, we check the fingerprints to find out if he has a prior record, that's different from to find out if he has committed a crime that we don't know about. But -- but are fingerprints used to determine whether the person has a prior record?",
  "When they're no longer in the custody of the State, does the government have to destroy it? They served their time, and their privileges have been restored.",
  "The real formula is -- significantly increased the risk of perform -- of prolonging the defendant's incarceration. That's the standard you would like us --",
  "And is -- is the heart of your argument that there really isn't much difference at all in what district judges are doing, now that the guidelines are discretionary, than what they did when they were mandatory; that is, most of them will start with and stop with the guidelines. I think that's --",
  "But that was in the -- that Florida case was the mandatory -- almost mandatory guideline, and I think our starting point is -- your starting point, too -- is that, when the guidelines were mandatory, it was ex post facto because our decision in the Florida case said it was. Is this sufficiently different now that the guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory?",
  "This is a change -- your position is -- is a change, at least in the position that the government took in -- in the Seventh Circuit case that started all this. The government confessed error. The government said the district judge should have used the guidelines that were in effect at the time the offense was committed, and the government came to the Seventh Circuit and confessed error. So there was not even an argument until the Seventh Circuit and Judge Posner wrote the opinion that included all the hypotheticals that -- that were aired earlier about the victim impact statement and all of those are in that opinion. So it was only after -- after the Seventh Circuit opinion that the government changed its position.",
  "The guidelines range gets a presumption of reasonableness at the appellate level.",
  "Do you disagree with -- getting back to what this case is about, the D.C. Circuit, in opposition to the Seventh Circuit said, it is enough that using the new guideline created a substantial risk that the defendant's sentence was more severe than it would have been if the guidelines in effect at the time of the crime were used. And is it -- there is no doubt that this case fits that description. There was quite a substantial risk that the elevated guidelines would result in a more severe sentence.",
  "He's saying that -- the question is which guidelines in this case? And he's saying it's the guidelines in effect at the time he committed the crime. We are not dealing with other -- I mean, it's quite a simple choice. Is it -- does the court start with the guidelines in effect at the time the crime was committed? Or does it start with the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing?",
  "We know that this district judge, he didn't want to get into any philosophical things about what was better or what was worse. He said, I want to follow the guidelines. So the question for him was only which guideline. He got his answer from the Seventh Circuit. They said the guidelines at the time of sentencing. A judge in the D.C. District Court will get the other answer, the guidelines in effect at the time the crime was committed.",
  "But it's not -- it's not a question of whether the judge thought that the one guideline was better than the other. He specifically said he wasn't interested in that question. The question was which guideline does he follow? Which -­ what does he start with? And you recognize that you do start with the guidelines.",
  "But the district court was following orders. He was following the Seventh Circuit. The Seventh Circuit had said, you start with the higher guidelines.",
  "Was Judge Randolph wrong when he said -- quoting the Sentencing Commission -- that within-guidelines range, even after Booker, is the standard? Indeed, the actual impact of Booker on sentencing has been minor, and, for that minor, he cites the Sentencing Commission.",
  "But this statement comes from Final Report on the Impact of the United States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing.",
  "Mr. Kellogg, suppose it goes to arbitration as you think it should, and the arbitrator says to the merchant, to prove your case, you have to show the relevant market, you have to show that American Express had market power, that it used that power to the detriment of its competitors, and the way these sections -- the way these tying cases have gone is you get an expert. And I don't see that you can prove it in -- in a new way. I mean, the whole point of this is that the expense to win one of these cases is enormous. And no single person is not worth that person's while.",
  "What was the -- what was the -- I missed that. The sharing of the costs, how does that work? It's certainly not in the agreement, not in the arbitration agreement, that -- that American Express is going to pay for the expert for the other side.",
  "Oh. Oh.",
  "And then what you would you have, five, six different arbitrations going, and in each of those five or six cases, you would have -- they could share? They could share the million dollar cost of this -- the experts?",
  "I -- I'm sorry, but I don't think I got the answer to my question. Is -- the arbitrator has now said we have to have an expert, and the plaintiff says -- or the complainant says, I haven't got the wherewithal, and if I have six friends who bring individual arbitrations, that's not nearly enough. So what happens then, the case ends, and it's not possible --",
  "I thought that the only thing that the court of appeals said is, you have to pay 300,000 minimum for the expert, the most you can get in treble damages is 5,000. It didn't go into all the other things that you were saying. It said nobody in his right mind will bring such a lawsuit to pay $300,000 to get $5,000.",
  "In the AT&T Mobility case, the Court remarked that this was a -- that the arbitration agreement had certain provisions that made it easier for the consumer to use the arbitral forum. Is there anything like that in this arbitration clause?",
  "Yes, where not some other consumer in another arbitration, not that sharing of the costs, but wasn't AT&T Mobility going to pick up a good part of the tab of the cost of the arbitration?",
  "Did -- did American Express say, as Justice Breyer suggested, that, well we will concede A, B, and C, so the only issue on which you need proof is D? As I understood it, American Express never took the position that it would -- it would concede certain issues so that you could limit the proof.",
  "No, I'm not talking about --",
  "I'm not talking about pooling with other single merchants bringing single arbitrations. I'm asking whether American Express -- so here's the complaint. It says, I have to prove relevant markets separately. And did American Express take the position, no, you don't have to prove all that. I think that's what Justice Breyer was suggesting. There's only one thing that's really in controversy, and the rest we could stipulate. But I didn't see anything in all the time this case has been in the courts on American Express's part to say that we are not going to demand the full breadth of proof.",
  "Mr. Stewart, is it -- the arbitration agreement is a one-on-one, right? They can't, or can they have -- they have the 12 similarly situated people, not a class, join in the arbitration, or is it one on one?",
  "And even in the days before we had Rule 23, when you were bringing a suit in Federal court you could have multiple plaintiffs joining together.",
  "It was because -- it was because Judge Pooler said, \"I have been instructed by the Supreme Court that I may not require class arbitration.\" That's -- and she was bound by our decision that a court can't order class arbitration, isn't that correct? So that was not an option for her.",
  "The Second Circuit never said anything about, this is what it would cost in court. The court -- the Court of Appeals said, this is what it would cost to prove this kind of tying, right? It didn't say one word distinguishing what it would cost in litigation from what it would cost in arbitration. It was simply what it was going to cost.",
  "And Congress -- Congress said that, too. Nobody -- there isn't anybody in -- on any side of this issue who doesn't admit that huge progress has been made. Congress itself said that. But in line with Justice Sotomayor's question, in the D.C. Court of Appeals, the dissenting judge there, Judge Williams, said, \"If this case were about three States, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama, those States have the worst records, and application of Section 5 to them might be okay.\"",
  "You keep -- you keep --",
  "Mr. Rein, you keep emphasizing over and over again in your brief, registration and you said it a couple of times this morning. Congress was well aware that registration was no longer the problem. This legislative record is replete with what they call second generation devices. Congress said up front: We know that the registration is fine. That is no longer the problem. But the discrimination continues in other forms.",
  "Mr. Rein, I just remind because it's something we said about equal footing, in Katzenbach the Court said, \"The doctrine of the equality of the States invoked by South Carolina does not bar this approach, for that doctrine applies only to the terms upon which States are admitted to the Union and not to the remedies for local evils which have subsequently appeared.\" That's what -- has the Court changed that interpretation?",
  "General Verrilli - -",
  "General Verrilli, could you respond to the question that Justice Kennedy asked earlier, which was for why isn't Section 2 enough now? The government could bring Section 2 claims if it seeks privately to do. Why isn't -- he asked if it was expensive. You heard the question, so.",
  "Well, what we have here is, I think everybody agrees, that these transactions were not authorized and they were self-dealing to the extent that there was a benefit to Mr. Bullock from the investments that were made. So what, in addition to being unauthorized and self-dealing, which the government tells us should be enough to make defalcation, what else other than that it was not authorized and it was self-dealing?",
  "But is a trustee who is taking -- borrowing against the cash value of the life insurance making an investment for the benefit of himself and his mother getting profit from that investment and not sharing it with the other siblings who are also. So what more than -- I mean, he did that all advertently.",
  "But what about the two other transactions which were not done at the bidding of the father?",
  "But what -- what about the profit from the transactions, the profit that he made? Yes, he paid back everything with interest, but in addition to that, according to the Illinois court's judgment, there was a profit that he made that he didn't put back in the trust -- he didn't put in the trust.",
  "May I ask you a question that is not a technical bankruptcy question, but he -- the objective of filing for bankruptcy was to get rid of this judgment debt, this Illinois judgment debt, right?",
  "And the Eleventh Circuit said -- you know, we're really sympathetic to that, but the problem is that the bank would not let you sell the collateral. If you could sell the collateral, then you could pay off the loan and you wouldn't need to declare bankruptcy. Did you bring such a suit, the suit that suggests that the bank was the culpable party here by not letting you sell the property which would have enabled you to pay the debt?",
  "Mr. Byrne, I -- I wasn't finished asking you about the background of this. It -- it seems the simplest thing, if the bank is the culprit, then why not go after the bank and then get the money which would make the Chapter 7 unnecessary?",
  "But it was what the Eleventh Circuit thought was a solution to this problem.",
  "And were they wrong in --",
  "So there's nothing in the record that shows why the bank refused to release any of the collateral?",
  "But it did -- but Congress did specify how citizenship was to be handled. And it was to be an attestation, a signed attestation subject to -- to the penalty of perjury. So it's not as though the Federal form didn't relate to citizenship. It did. And it said this is the way we deal with citizenship. Then Arizona adds something else. So I would like, General Horne, for you to respond to a question that's already been raised in -- by the -- the panel that decided this case originally, which was, the statute said -- says each State must accept and use the Federal form, period. That's the end of it. And then it says, in addition to that, the State can do other things. The judge who asked that question thought it was perfectly clear, you use the Federal form, and if you want to do something in addition -- but you must use and accept the Federal Form and not add something to it.",
  "General Horne, there -- there are a whole list of State-specific requirements that get appended to the form. And I think Justice Scalia was raising the question, did you ask to have Arizona's requirement -- just as the other State-specific requirements -- did you ask the Federal Commission to include, as a State-specific requirement, this proof of citizenship?",
  "And those are what?",
  "What are they?",
  "What are the additional -- the question here is, is proof of citizenship an additional thing the State can ask. Now you're telling us that there are some additional things.",
  "Can you -- can you explain -- it's puzzling. You have all these State-specific and pages of State-specific requirements. What State-specific requirements are permitted and what State-specific requirements are not permitted? You're putting the citizenship on the not permitted side of the line. What is permitted and what is not permitted and what's the difference in the two categories?",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, I think General Horne told us that -- that the State did ask the Commission, but the Commission had only two members; the Commission didn't act on it. Only the legal director. So how could they get court review of an agency decision that was never made?",
  "And she didn't take -- she didn't take the -- the brand-name drug because the pharmacist gave her the generic, but she didn't know brand, generic, isn't that correct?",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Lefkowitz, then what you are saying is that the FDA's approval is not only what everyone agrees it is, a floor to enable you to market, but it is also a ceiling. That is you meet the FDA -- you get the FDA approval and that gives you a right to market, not simply an access to market, but it -- it operates as a ceiling?",
  "Is there something in the -- in the Act that says that the States have no role with respect to the safety and efficacy of the drug -- the drug, it's only the FDA approval, that's it?",
  "The failure -- the failure to warn defense was -- the -- the judge struck that out. So there was no failure to warn defense in the case.",
  "How do you respond to the argument, Mutual's argument that they have -- in 2005, they made -- this drug produced $7 million. The jury verdict was 21 million. They said that 3 years of their earnings wiped out.",
  "Did you get to the jury's -- to the instructions to the jury?",
  "So that's what the jury was supposed to apply, not what counsel said.",
  "But you just said there was nothing wrong with the jury instructions, at least you didn't object.",
  "How -- how did the Court reject it? They threw out the failure to warn claim.",
  "There are other -- there are other provisions that refer to a petition filed. For example, reporting annually to Congress, publishing a notice in the Federal Register, those both refer to any petition filed. And so in those sections at least, petition filed would include petition filed after the running of the statute of limitations.",
  "But don't you -- don't you put in the Federal Register and report to Congress petitions that had been filed out of time?",
  "Well, think about the Federal Register.",
  "So they don't file anything in the Federal Register?",
  "So using Federal rules as your model, and Federal rules list statute of limitations as an affirmative defense. Ordinarily, that's what it is. But is it an affirmative -- well, certainly it's an affirmative defense to any award of compensation under the Vaccine Act. But what makes it an affirmative defense to the award of fees?",
  "Why not --",
  "But there's a lot of information just in 11 -- what is it -- (c), tells what has to be put in the petition. And there's -- couldn't -- couldn't a Special Master make the determination based on that?",
  "So are you saying that the good faith and the reasonableness go to two things: One, the claim on the merits, and also the timeliness.",
  "You say the Special Master \"may\" award -- so it \"may\" award is discretionary.",
  "Well, let's take -- let's take this case. What would you put in to show that you have been reasonable, in good faith and reasonable, one, as to the claim; and two, as to the attorneys' fees? What -- what would the Special Master have to look at to make those determinations in this case?",
  "Am I right in thinking that there is no dispute on that point, that the -- the takings claim could have been asserted by the Hornes, as producers, in the Court of Federal Claims?",
  "Well, jurisdictional --",
  "-- jurisdictional or not, as a practical matter, producers who are not subject to fine as handlers, but the producers of the raisins whose raisins are being segregated, could they go to the Court of Federal Claims and say my raisins have been taken?",
  "But I'd just like a straight answer to that question. You -- you are representing producers, and they just produce.",
  "I'm saying hypothetically -- hypothetically. Is the Court of Federal Claims the proper forum for a producer?",
  "Mr. McConnell, would you explain the -- if they were just handlers and weren't producing any raisins, if they were just handlers, do they have a claim and where? And if they were just producers -- I take it from the question I asked and the question Justice Kagan asked that if they were just producers, the raisins got set aside, they were paid for only the ones that went to market, they could go to the Court of Claims. But now they're just handlers, as this entity is for most of the raisins that are involved, some 80 percent, right? It's only about 20 percent is their own. So could this work for someone who was just a handler, doesn't produce any raisins?",
  "Yes.",
  "What I'm -- I'm trying to understand is this scheme. Apparently it wasn't enough just to be a handler or just to be a producer. The claim that you're making turns on the coincidence of being both the producer and a handler.",
  "So any handler, any handler could be making the same claim?",
  "But what do you mean by -- what's the business model that's similar to this?",
  "You said --",
  "Mr. McConnell, I don't want to encroach on your rebuttal time, but one mysterious thing. The first time around, the Ninth Circuit decided this case on the merits. So if you're right, I take it, we remand and then they adjudicate the merits of the takings claim. But they already did that.",
  "Mr. Palmore, am I incorrect in thinking that the government is saying, handlers cannot raise the constitutionality of the Raisin Marketing Order? You've told us that the producers can go to the Court of Claims. What about the handlers? They're at least being fined for violating the Act, and it's their position that the whole thing is unconstitutional. Can they raise the constitutionality of the whole arrangement defensively, or they simply can't raise the constitutionality of the Act?",
  "But it would be --",
  "Mr. Bouffard, this law, this New Hampshire law, it regulates storage. Is this a law that applies only to the towing companies who tow the automobile and then store it, or does the law apply, say, to a garage, say, someone brings a car to a garage for repairs, and does this storage law regulate garage operations as well as towing operations?",
  "So -- so it would apply to a garage operator.",
  "Yes, but what made it abandoned was that they tried to locate the owner, couldn't and so -- this same thing could happen with a garage owner as happened to the towing truck. So there's nothing peculiar about being in the towing business that makes this storage application -- storage statute apply.",
  "When? When did that opportunity come up? Because I thought that the notice didn't get to the -- to the plaintiff, and then when the lawyer said, I have a client, it's his car, then the towing company went ahead and put it up for auction. And then no bidders, so they sold it, pocketed the money, gave nothing to the car owner. So I don't understand how it's a dispute about payment. This is not a case where the car owner said I won't pay for the towing.",
  "At what point did Pelkey say, I won't pay for the towing?",
  "But why should the tow operation be treated any different from the garage when they're doing the identical thing, that is, storing and then selling the vehicle?",
  "But it also tells how the vehicle will be sold -- sold, and your client is invoking that statute in order to be able to sell the car, but wants to have enforced only the parts that are favorable to the tow operation. And the -- the regime in New Hampshire is, yes, you can sell the vehicle, but this is how you do it. And it seems to me that that's not how it was done here.",
  "But -- about the parties never considering it, when this case was in the New Jersey courts, Oxford explained -- this is in the red brief at page 27 that's quoting Oxford's counsel then, that \"the arbitrator has the power to ascertain whether the parties contemplated class arbitration in their agreements.\" A power in the arbitrator that Oxford does not contest. Does it -- that seems to be a recognition by Oxford that -- that class arbitration was contemplated.",
  "But there was no -- in Stolt-Nielsen, the parties stipulated that the contract said nothing on the issue of class proceeding. In this case, we have no such stipulation --",
  "-- and the arbitrator is interpreting a term of the contract, the ordinary rule is that -- that the arbitration -- arbitrator's interpretation of a contract term, wrong or right, unless it's off the wall, is -- is not to be overturned.",
  "It was a combination of the two provisions. He said that everything that is excluded by the first provision is included in the second. And he also said something, which may or may not be so. He said that this particular way of describing the -- the -- what's arbitrable, this is an unusual wording. We have -- there's no civil action in the first clause and then arbitration in the second. He said that he had never seen this particular language. Is he wrong in -- in saying that this language is unusual?",
  "Was this -- was this a -- well, was this an experienced arbitrator?",
  "Well, of course, this was -- this was an adhesion contract, so there's no -- it was drafted by Oxford. And you made a point about betting the house, that the company wouldn't have agreed to it. But on the side of the doctor, he has a $10,000 -- a $1,000 claim, and he is saying that without a class proceeding, there is -- there is essentially no means to enforce the contract against Oxford, that none of these parties, none of the, what was it, 13,000 doctors, none of them could enforce the contract because the expense would be much greater than the $1,000 they could get at the end.",
  "I thought that Oxford conceded that it did not preserve any question of entitlement to de novo review.",
  "Why don't you, Mr. Katz, why don't you concentrate on what the arbitrator himself said? Mr. Waxman said this clause wasn't unusual, but the arbitrator said, I've never seen anything like this.",
  "Is the -- is the contract authorized it as for Dr. Sutter, all of the others are similarly situated, they got the same contracts?",
  "So either the contract means what the arbitrator said it meant or it doesn't. If it means what the arbitrator said it meant, then everybody's bound.",
  "And those -- and there are rules that governed that, right?",
  "You would never have class action arbitration if that were so.",
  "It would be impossible because you could never get in advance -- they find out that by getting notice and then they decide whether they want to stay with it or opt out.",
  "How long -- can we straighten out this 11 years? How many years was this in the New Jersey courts before there was ever an arbitrator appointed?",
  "How many -- how -- what is the history of class actions and arbitrations? There are at least enough of them so that the AAA has a set of rules about how you handle class arbitrations, right?",
  "Mr. Stewart, does this represent a change in the government's position? I got the idea from the briefs that at the time of this Schering-Plough case, that was also before the Eleventh Circuit, that the government was not taking that position it is now taking.",
  "What about the consideration that seems to be driving the government? That is, the generic is getting an offer that they would never get on the street. I mean, they are being paid much more than they would get if they won the patent infringement suit. If they won the patent infringement suit, then they can sell their generic in competition with the brand. But under this agreement they get more than they would get by winning the lawsuit.",
  "I thought the government was telling us that that's this case, that the -- what the generic is being offered in the way of sharing the monopoly profits is more than it could ever make if it wanted to and sold its drug.",
  "Well, what was the change that was made?",
  "Have we ever granted standing to proponents of ballot initiatives?",
  "Well, this is -- this is -- the concern is certainly, the proponents are interested in getting it on the ballot and seeing that all of the proper procedures are followed, but once it's passed, they have no proprietary interest in it. It's law for them just as it is for everyone else. So how are they distinguishable from the California citizenry in general?",
  "Mr. Cooper, Baker v. Nelson was 1971. The Supreme Court hadn't even decided that gender-based classifications get any kind of heightened scrutiny.",
  "And the same-sex intimate conduct was considered criminal in many States in 1971, so I don't think we can extract much from Baker against Nelson.",
  "California -- no, California does.",
  "It wouldn't be in California, Mr. Cooper, because that's not an issue, is it? In California, you can have same-sex couples adopting a child.",
  "Mr. Cooper, you are defending -- you are opposing a judgment that applies to California only, not to all of the States.",
  "Mr. Cooper, we said that somebody who is locked up in prison and is not going to get out has a right to marry -- has a fundamental right to marry, no possibility of procreation.",
  "Yes.",
  "General Verrilli, I could understand your argument if you were talking about the entire United States, but you -- your brief says it's only eight or nine States, the States that permit civil unions, and that's -- brings up a question that was asked before. So a State that has made considerable progress has to go all the way, but at least the government's position is, if it has done -- the State has done absolutely nothing at all, then it's -- it can do -- do as it will.",
  "Suppose -- suppose one of those States repeals its civil union laws?",
  "I thought he was saying -- I thought he was saying, Mr. Cooper, that it's not before the Court today. And remember Loving against Virginia was preceded by the McLaughlin case. So first there was the question of no marriage, and then there was marriage. So in that sense I understood the Solicitor General to be telling us that case is not before the Court today.",
  "I think it was McLaughlin v. Florida.",
  "It was cohabitation of people of different races.",
  "And the Court took that case and waited to reach the marriage case.",
  "I may -- my memory may be wrong, but I think the case was that people of different races were arrested and charged with the crime of interracial cohabitation. And the Court said that that was invalid.",
  "Unlawful.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan --",
  "But when the government -- when the -- when the case is adjudicated in the first instance -- we're talking here about appellate authority.",
  "The government sometimes loses cases in the first instance and then it doesn't appeal. If it agrees with the result that the court reached, it doesn't appeal and then the judgment in the first instance where there was adversity is -- is the last word. So when does the government decide, yes, we agree with the -- the adjudication in the court of first instance and so we'll leave it there? And when does it say, yes, we agree, but we want higher authority to participate?",
  "Does that include the -- does that include the courts of appeals or just this Court?",
  "Mr. Clement, the problem is that it would totally tort the States' decision that there is a marriage between two people, for the Federal government then to come in to say no joint return; no marital deduction; no Social Security benefits; your spouse is very sick, but you can't get leave; people -- if that set of attributes, one might well ask, what kind of marriage is this?",
  "How about divorce? Same thing? That you can have a Federal notion of divorce, and that that doesn't relate to what the State statute is?",
  "They're not -- they're not a question of additional benefits. I mean, they touch every aspect of life. Your partner is sick. Social Security -- I mean, it's pervasive. It's not as though, well, there's this little Federal sphere and it's only a tax question. It's -- it's -- as Justice Kennedy said, 1,100 statutes, and it affects every area of life. And so you are really diminishing what the State has said is marriage. You're saying, no, State did two kinds of marriage, the full marriage, and then this sort of skim milk marriage.",
  "How many States have civil unions now?",
  "And how many had it in 1996?",
  "Rational basis, Mr. Clement -- is a problem in your briefing. You seem to say and you repeat it today that there is three tiers, and if you get into rational basis, then it's anything goes. But the history of this Court is, in the very first gender discrimination case, Reed v. Reed, the Court did something it had never done in the history of the country under rational basis. There was no intermediate tier then. It was rational basis.",
  "And yet the Court said this is rank discrimination and it failed.",
  "May -- may I ask you a question about that? It's plain error because the defendant didn't make an objection in the lower court. But the defendant doesn't know about Rule 11 and doesn't know about 11(c) that says a judge is not supposed to participate in plea bargaining, and his lawyer doesn't tell him the judge is doing something wrong because his lawyer wants him to plea. So he lacks the information necessary to make a prompt objection. So it seems a bit unfair to say that he's subjected to plain error when he hasn't got a clue that the judge -- magistrate wasn't supposed to do what he did.",
  "But this is a lawyer that had filed an Anders brief. So he didn't -- even at that stage, the lawyer, the -- I don't want to absorb your time beyond this, but I think the plain error is questionable when it seems that the judge, the lawyer, they arranged against the -- the defendant, and the defendant doesn't know that he has this route.",
  "Mr. Feigin, is there any situation in which a -- a judge participating in a plea bargaining, any situation that would be prejudicial -- that you recognize would be prejudicial, and if there is can you describe what that would be?",
  "What -- what makes it prejudicial and this not?",
  "On that point, do we know -- do we know if the district judge who did preside at the plea hearing knew about the episode with the magistrate 3 months earlier?",
  "The same for the prosecutor?",
  "Mr. Yablon, the -- the case that you're presenting would be quite strong if the same judge -- if the magistrate judge also presided at the plea hearing, but here we have two factors that are special in this case. One is it's a different judge, and two is we have the interval of some three months in between. And then we have a plea hearing that looks to me like it's exemplary. The district judge did go through everything that Rule 11 calls for. So it is a different case, isn't it, when we have a plea hearing with a judge who is exerting no pressure at all, has nothing to do with encouraging the defendant to plead, but there was an earlier episode where a magistrate judge did overbear?",
  "But -- but the -- but the judge did ask, do you recognize that your -- your conduct satisfied the elements of the conspiracy? And the defendant answered yes. And the -- the judge asked, has anyone pressured you to plead guilty? And he answers no. So --",
  "Mr. Yablon, one problem with calling this structural error is that it's not so clear that this is a -- a bad thing. That is, some States, even today, allow a judge to participate in plea bargaining, and the advisors -- the rules advisory committee -- said, when it -- when it framed this rule, that some commentators had said it was quite -- quite a frequent thing that happened, that judges participated. So it isn't like not having a public trial or not giving a person counsel of choice. It's, this was -- this was something that still some jurisdictions think it's okay.",
  "Mr. Hansen, Respondents say that isolating or extracting natural products, that has long been considered patentable, and give -- examples were aspirin and whooping cough vaccine. How is this different from -- those start with natural -- natural products.",
  "Mr. Hansen, you answered my initial question by saying they start -- everything starts with a national -- natural product, but these others, the examples that I gave, you said they involve manipulation. The -- the cDNA can't be characterized as involving manipulation?",
  "But Mister -- General Verrilli, I got the distinct impression from your brief that your view was that, although the cDNA may be patentable, it might very well be rejected as obvious.",
  "General Verrilli, there's an assertion made in Respondents' brief that the United States would be in a singular position. That is, they suggest that in every other industrialized nation this could be subject -- could be patentable.",
  "Is that so?",
  "Do you concede -- Do you concede at least that the decision in the Federal Circuit, that Judge Lourie did make an incorrect assumption, or is the Lander brief inaccurate with respect to that, too? That is, Judge Lourie thought that isolated DNA fragments did not exist in the human body and Dr. Lander says that wrong.",
  "Even though -- even though the government has disavowed it, even though the government, representing the United States --",
  "At least that the strength of the presumption would be diluted.",
  "I thought that the Port said we don't apply criminal penalties which come from the tariff, we don't apply those to licensed motor carriers. They made that representation, so I think we have to accept that as being so.",
  "Do we know why, why Congress had a different regulation for ports and for airfields?",
  "Mr. Bash, how then do you deal with the problem that precipitated all of this? Here is a port that's getting lots of complaints from the neighborhood people. It wants to expand the port, it's being thwarted by environmental suits, so it wants to go green and it wants to do something about the pollution and the traffic and the hazards from the truck. You're saying that it can't do that?",
  "And how could a port respond to the complaints if you're making this -- this neighborhood around the Port an environmental hazard? And so we're going to make sure that our representatives vote against any expansion of the Port.",
  "Would you clarify -- would you clarify what the -- what happens when there is an infraction? Say three trucks. Is it right that you can suspend until the infraction is cured, that you can suspend all of that operator's trucks?",
  "But you could do the other. See, I'm -- what -- what are -- is it -- is it just a matter of grace that you will say, well, we'll require them to fix those two trucks and all the others can travel? Or could you say, until you fix those two trucks, none of your trucks come through?",
  "Let's say it's a major violation.",
  "And how about after it's corrected? The government then says there's some uncertainty about that, whether you --",
  "But I thought there -- there was a representation made that they toe the line that the government draws. That it, they can say, no access as long as you have trucks in your fleet that don't comply. But once you've gotten your fleet in order and you are in compliance, then we can't punish you for having wronged in the past by saying you're -- you're suspended. That -- that's the position that the government is taking, and I take it you don't agree with that.",
  "But he didn't. I mean, he -- he said that he was prepared to surrender rights to the mother, but not to a stranger. And when the issue of adoption came up, he said, \"Yes, I want to assert my parental rights.\"",
  "Where does it -- where is there a reference in the definition of \"parent\" to a State law? I see the -- which is the section that defines a parent?",
  "Yes.",
  "It says a parent means a biological parent of an Indian child and he fits that definition. And then the next section -- the next sentence doesn't have any reference to State law.",
  "But doesn't 1915 preclude the adoptive parents because they're not in the preferred category? If 1915(a) precludes the adoption, then the adoptive parents would have no legal basis for objecting to an award to the father.",
  "It's not listed under the -- there are guidelines for what constitutes good cause.",
  "What about now, when you said the best interest. Now the child has been some 15 months with the father. So if a best interest calculus is made now, you would have to take into account uprooting that relationship, would you not?",
  "Even though -- even though the guidelines to what's good cause do not include best interest.",
  "But I think Justice Breyer is quite wrong because a standard that says results in serious emotional or physical damage to the child is far from a best interest standard.",
  "I thought the definition of an Indian child is just straight out of the statute. An Indian child is someone who is either a member of a tribe or eligible, and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.",
  "I thought that there's some ambiguity there because one reason why he wanted to marry was that he would get more pay and allowances.",
  "He would be out under South Carolina law because he didn't support the child during the pregnancy.",
  "Termination of parental rights requires a showing that it's an unfit parent, which is quite --",
  "But the whole thrust of it, you -- this is directed to providing remedial services, which it -- it seems that it fits a situation where someone has custody but is having problems getting his or her act together so needs the help of a social worker, but it makes no sense to talk about remedial services for someone who has never had custody.",
  "That, Ms. Blatt, is what provoked the Act that Indian children were being removed from their families, but the Act is written in much broader terms.",
  "Why isn't it -- why isn't it like the -- is it Berghuis case? There was a case of someone who was given Miranda warnings, and, even so, the Court said he was silent. He didn't invoke the Fifth Amendment; therefore, his silence can be commented on.",
  "Mr. Fisher, but then -- do -- do I understand correctly that you're saying demeanor is different, so, although it was impermissible to comment on silence, it was okay to say he looked down, he seemed to be sweating, he was very nervous, he was shuffling his feet.",
  "But isn't the most logical inference from the silence not that he isn't quick enough to come up with an exculpatory answer, but that it would incriminate him if he answered?",
  "But he could -- he could invoke the Fifth Amendment with respect to one set of questions and not another, and what's disturbing me about your position, if it's -- if you have -- someone being interrogated, who is savvy, will say, \"I plead the Fifth.\" And somebody who is not that smart is just silent. To make a difference between those two people on whether comment can be made on the failure to respond is troublesome.",
  "You've -- you've said in your brief that there might be a whole other -- many other reasons for remaining silent, and I -- I suggested that the -- in -- in this kind of scenario, the most likely reason that the suspect will clam up is that he fears incrimination. But what -- what obvious other reasons unrelated to the Fifth Amendment, why a defendant might remain silent? I mean, the Griffin rule is he doesn't have to say, I plead the Fifth, because we assume that, when he doesn't take the stand, he is doing so because he doesn't want to incriminate himself.",
  "Okay. But -- but I don't think you -- you were going to tell me this great deal of conduct, what silence could mean other than, I fear incrimination. What else is --",
  "Mr. Dreeben, you say nothing about the -- what was the opening argument in -- in your brief, that the assumption that SORNA is something new added after is wrong because there were these predecessor laws that established a Federal requirement to register.",
  "But it's written -- but it's written in such precise terms, it must be incorporated in a divorce decree, and the decree must be filed with the employee agency pre-death. What you're saying is this specific exception, rightly cabined, is generalized so that in all cases, the second wife will prevail over the first.",
  "Why should it be different than the outcome in Wissner and Ridgway and one -- one case that you cite quite often is the Hisquierdo case for -- you -- you cite it for deference to State domestic relations law, but what was the outcome in that case?",
  "What -- what was the issue? What was the issue in Rose?",
  "Now, they were taking them from him to support his family.",
  "Which is quite something different. This is taking it from the designated beneficiary and giving it to somebody who isn't designated.",
  "Mr. Ruttenberg, how do you get to this notion that administrative convenience is all that is involved? After all, this is an employee's life insurance and the Government is saying to the employee, the beneficiary is your free choice, you can pick anyone, your spouse, a charity, it's your choice, but we want you to know that, although you make it and you can change it any time you want, if you don't change it that will be it. That -- so it's giving, the employee, control over the proceeds of his or her life insurance. Why isn't that a purpose along with administrative convenience?",
  "You would agree with that? I assume you would agree with what Justice Alito just said?",
  "That it has only to do with administrative convenience?",
  "Why should this scheme be treated differently than the National Service Life Insurance and the successor law in Wissner and Ridgway? Those operated the same way. They said the person who designates is who gets it and if you -- the only way you can change it is to have a change of beneficiary form filed with your employer, if you don't do that, whatever you've said is where the money goes.",
  "But the two decisions that dealt with the anti-attachment, they gave that as an alternative ground of decision. It was quite separate and discrete from saying what's on the beneficiary, the designation that controls. And they say, and also there's this anti-attachment.",
  "In -- in your briefs in this case, you put in the assignment provision as -- as an afterthought. I think you did not put it in your main brief. It came up only in your reply brief, and you didn't put it in the appendix to your main brief.",
  "So you -- you seem to assign lesser importance to it.",
  "Mr. Ruttenberg, what about the interest, which was an interest in Wissner and in Ridgway, of uniformity under this Federal insurance scheme? That is, one of the hypotheticals in the briefs was the deceased dies domiciled in Virginia. Wife number 1 comes from X State, not Virginia, wife number 2 two from Y State, and they all have different -- different rules. The employee, in the course of her career, may move around from here to there. But if you follow the Federal law, then it's going to be the same for every employee. These are the rules for every employee no matter where he or she lives, no matter the location of the spouse. And then we don't have these messy problems with choice of law.",
  "Mr. Johnson, that -- that is in the OPM manual, but I think Mr. Ruttenberg pointed out that it's 106-some-odd pages. How are employees covered by this insurance, how are they informed about what the beneficiary designation means?",
  "Mr. Johnson, there are at least one case where the State law would override the beneficiary designation and that's obviously if the beneficiary murdered the -- the insured. So how does this scheme to displace the beneficiary designated in the policy in the Slayer case requires State law? Is that --",
  "So you would get there by a Federal common law rule, but then who would get the proceeds? If the designated beneficiary is out because of the Federal common law that excludes a Slayer, where would you go next? You'd go to State law, right?",
  "The next one is -- it would be --",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, there isn't -- at least I'm not familiar with anything quite like this, where, if you're not told, if you want to run a government program, you have to speak the government's speech. This doesn't require the recipient to speak to anybody at all, except to the government itself, to say, I pledge that my policy is the government's policy. So it's making somebody adopt, as her own, the government's policy, rather than saying, I understand that I get my government money, I have to follow the government's rules about what I can say to the public. Here -- and is -- is there anything else quite like this, where you make a pledge to the government, but with respect to third parties doesn't apply?",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, on this, what does seem to me unusual, as Justice Alito brought out, requiring somebody to say, \"I believe this\" or \"I agree with the government on that.\" The Rust v. Sullivan, which is one of the precedents on which you rely, made it a point that the doctor was not required to represent -- as his own views, not required to represent an opinion that he doesn't hold. He has to adhere to the government's program in his dealings with the public, but he doesn't have to say, \"I agree with the government.\"",
  "Is that just an irrelevant consideration in Rust, that no one -- no one was being obliged to say, I believe something, that they don't believe?",
  "But, Mr. Srinivasan, there is a difference in this international setting -- you know, most of those separate affiliates was in Taxation Without Representation, and it was the cure for the Legal of Women Voters. But here, as the D.C. District Court said in its opinion, which was in your favor, oh, all you have to do is spin off a subsidiary that gets the government money; it's just a simple matter of corporate reorganization. But you know that getting an NGO -- a new NGO recognized in dozens of foreign countries is no simple thing to accomplish. I mean, to take a concrete example, look what happened about a year and a half ago in Egypt, when the U.S. NGOs were indicted for criminal -- for not complying with the permit requirements of the country. So it's one thing to set up a 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) operating in the United States, each does its thing. But to require an NGO to then, in the countries where it's operating, get the necessary permits is quite an arduous thing.",
  "Are you -- what -- are you saying that you can -- within the government program, within the government program, the government can specify whatever it wants, including this -- this policy, but it can't then say, and the organization outside the program is also bound by this profession?",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, that was one -- one -- veterans. Everybody else was subject to the lobbying restriction. Here, it's 20 percent of the funds go to the organizations that are free from this pledge.",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, we are told that in other compacts when they really mean to give one State the right to take another State's water, the provision in the compact is much clearer, much more definite. This clause, the one that you rely on, is kind of sketchy, isn't it? Doesn't say how they're going to get it, if they're going to pay for it. There's a lot to be filled in.",
  "How -- how does it do it? Does it have to apply to Texas?",
  "To Oklahoma.",
  "Who -- who erects the facilities to accomplish this diversion?",
  "Say that again, because we have a green brief that gives us samples of provisions for cross border.",
  "Because there have been many, many --",
  "Ms. Blatt, does Oklahoma law in any circumstance permit an appropriation of water -- water in Oklahoma for out-of-State use?",
  "Just here and now, does Oklahoma ever --",
  "-- permit out-of-State use of its water?",
  "But it's -- the coercion crime, at least under New York definition, requires force. And -- and here, it's a threat of exposure of an embarrassing fact. So what -- am I right about that, that the coercion, which is not a Federal crime but is a State crime, requires a threat of force to restrict another's freedom?",
  "What about -- you said transfer, sell, but there's also exercise. And the theory is that the defendant sought to take away the officer's right to make this recommendation, take it away from the officer, exercise it himself. So why doesn't it fit -- why isn't this an intangible right taken from one and exercised by another?",
  "Is this -- there is, I take it, no Federal crime that this conduct would fit? You said New York State has a coercion crime which you say this conduct might fit. But there's no Federal crime.",
  "And why did -- why did New York -- was the New York case dropped and the State officials urged the Government, the Federal Government, to make this a Federal case?",
  "How was it -- could you tell us a little more? How was it taken?",
  "In the -- in the age discrimination context, there wouldn't be a difference between the discrimination claim itself and the retaliation. They'd both be governed by the same standard, isn't that right, in the age discrimination area, the but-for causation. Or am I wrong about that?",
  "Yes.",
  "But your argument is that, in Title VII, where it's very clear what the standard Congress wants to have for the discrimination claim, you're going to have a different standard for retaliation. So, in these statutes, I thought these two traveled together, whatever the standard is for discrimination is the same for retaliation.",
  "Well, it seems that the overall purpose of the '91 Act was to overrule decisions of this Court that Congress thought had not interpreted Title VII properly. And am I right that what they put about motivating factor -- a motivating factor, that is more plaintiff-friendly than the -- than the standard that the Court declared in -- in Price Waterhouse?",
  "So it's -- it's really odd to think that, in wanting to go beyond what we did in Price Waterhouse, the Court meant to set up an entirely different standard for -- for retaliation.",
  "Well, even looking -- let's look at what they actually did. If we look at this (m) section, it says, \"except as otherwise provided in this subchapter.\" I take it that would include retaliation as well, in the subchapter.",
  "\"An unlawful employment practice is established.\" And then, when we go over to the retaliation provision, it says, \"It shall be an unlawful employment practice.\" So why doesn't that suggest that the -- \"an employment practice\" under the retaliation provision is the same as \"an employment practice\" under this --",
  "The EEOC didn't.",
  "But your alternate argument would -- would involve two standards, the one that Congress provided for substantive discrimination, the -- the improvement on -- on Price Waterhouse and then for retaliation, Price Waterhouse.",
  "And I started this -- this argument by asking, is there -- in the realm of anti-discrimination law, is there any example where you have the -- the substantive charge governed by one standard and retaliation by another?",
  "Well, what --",
  "There was some law in effect in Michigan on this subject from the year 1973 till the year 2001. There was no statute, and there was no ancient common law. But what was it? If I asked you the question, what was the law in Michigan on diminished capacity from 1973 to 2001, what would you respond?",
  "How -- how was the Michigan Court of Appeals construing the defense? Did it say -- it didn't say anything about the 1975 statute.",
  "And so that court, several times, recognized diminished capacity as a defense.",
  "The --",
  "Your colleague said that there were 130 appellate decisions -- I take it that's the court of appeals decisions -- recognizing diminished capacity as a defense.",
  "I think the question that was asked was, at the bottom line, at the end of the day --",
  "-- did anybody get sentenced less? Did it affect the outcome? You gave a case where a defendant was allowed to raise diminished capacity, but was -- are there cases where the defense was successful on the merits?",
  "But this -- the case is -- is very different from Bouie, which you -- which you rely on. In -- in Bouie, it was the question of a rule that is governing conduct. People come on to premises; they have no reason to think that they are committing an offense if they don't leave when somebody asks them to if they came onto the premise lawfully. So what the Court said in Bouie was that this is a regulation of primary conduct, and, at the time these people acted, they had no reason to believe that what they did was unlawful. That's quite a different --",
  "It -- it isn't subjective reliance; it's -- it's what was the law.",
  "And the Court said that the State supreme court interpretation of the statute was quite a surprise.",
  "Is this -- is this a one of a kind, in that, whatever the law was, it's clear from 2001 on? Are -- are there any other people who were similarly situated, who committed a crime before 2001, but were tried after?",
  "Why -- why was it --",
  "Why was it the right case? The parties didn't even raise it, did they?",
  "Mr. ­­ Mr. Clement, there are ­­ Zandford said that \"in connection with\" doesn't include every common law fraud that happens to involve covered securities. So can you give us an example of what would not be covered? What fraud involving securities would not qualify as in connection with the sale or purchase of securities?",
  "Mr. Goldstein, I take it, from what you said up to now, that you are not defending the Fifth Circuit's test. It called for a determination whether the misrepresentation is the heart or the crux of the complaint.",
  "Aren't those rather academic because SLUSA wouldn't be a bar to them anyway, because then that's class actions?",
  "But you're not contesting at this point ­­ I think both courts below assumed that the assets included stocks that would be traded on the exchange. You're not making the argument that it's not necessarily ­­ that maybe the portfolio included nothing that was traded on the exchange?",
  "Even if you're right about that, Mr. Clement, they also said there was a representation that this is insured by Lloyds, and there was another claim that they made. So even ­­ even if you are right, wouldn't the answer be, okay, drop anything that has to do with \"in connection with the sale or purchase of securities.\" We have ­­ oh, we have a claim about the insurance, and we also have a claim that both Antigua and United States were heavily regulated. Those were false. Why couldn't they have a complaint shorn of the incorrect premise and based on the insurance and the regulated aspects?",
  "Mr. Scodro, there's a preliminary question before we get to the question you presented, and that is, what authority did the Seventh Circuit have to deal with the question under the Age Discrimination Act? I mean, it was ­­ it went to the Seventh Circuit on interlocutory review ­­",
  "­­ a qualified immunity question. Everybody agrees that there is no qualified immunity, that there ­­ that there is, indeed, a claim that the Equal Protection Clause includes age. So Second ­­ Seventh Circuit had no authority to deal with any question other than that, did it?",
  "But in Wilkie, the whole case was dismissed by the district court, wasn't it? So whatever was said in that footnote was dicta.",
  "You're running up against the Seventh Circuit in that respect because the Seventh Circuit held that the existence of ­­ of an ­­ whether ADEA was the exclusive remedy, that that was irrelevant to the qualified immunity issue.",
  "The decision was that there was no qualified immunity. And the question is, having determined there was no qualified immunity, should they have stopped there? There wouldn't have been a trial ­­ if there is no qualified immunity, then they have no exemption from trial.",
  "There's another preliminary question, and that is, why are we talking about the ADEA, when the district court held that the ADEA doesn't cover Mr. Levin? And there seems to be not much of a dispute about that. You're not arguing that the ADEA does cover him, are you?",
  "But did ­­",
  "And as far as the ­­ the preclusion is concerned, why does it make a difference whether it's ADEA or GERA? Wouldn't the arguable preclusion be even stronger under ­­ under GERA because there is a special administrative remedy, you have to go to the EEOC first, and the only form for review is the Federal Circuit?",
  "Let ­­ let's assume that the question that was presented is before us. And you ­­ you have argued Fitzgerald. The other side says Smith v. Robinson should control. So why shouldn't the Handicapped Act decision control? That, like the ADEA, has allowed procedural parts that wouldn't be included in an equal protection claim.",
  "But why ­­ if the ADEA is expanding the Civil Rights protection against age discrimination much more generous to the employee, isn't it strange to think that Congress, at the same time, wanted employees to have these expanded rights and to do away with the preexisting remedy?",
  "May I just ask a question about what you just said? The record does show that Toca came into the case very late in the day, and he asked to have a postponement because he said, I have to get up to speed. I don't know anything about this case. So Toca, himself, is saying, I'm not acquainted with the case ­­ with the case.",
  "When you say the record is silence ­­ silent, I am looking at the Joint Appendix, page 295, and this is Titlow's statement. \"I would have testified against my aunt...had I not been persuaded to withdraw my plea agreement because an attorney promised me he would represent me. He told me he could take my case to trial and win.\" So that sounds like she was persuaded by Mr. Toca to go to trial because she could win. And he had, at that point, not made any appraisal of the case.",
  "Why ­­ why ­­ you made the point that this plea bargain could not be carried out once the number one condition, the prosecutor said, you testify against your aunt, and then we'll give you this deal. Once the aunt is tried and she doesn't testify, there's no ­­ there's no plea bargain. So why isn't that enough to decide this case? If you can't tell a prosecutor to renew a bargain that can't be carried out, then it's become impossible.",
  "May I ask you, Ms. Newman, if you would agree that the Sixth Circuit was wrong, at least to this extent, is there ­­ what is the argument for directing a prosecutor to make a plea offer that was never previously made? The offer that was made is impossible to carry out now. The offer was conditioned on her testimony at her aunt's trial. That didn't happen. So there is no ­­ there is no plea bargain offered. And yet, the court instructs a renewal, instructs the prosecutor to renew an offer that doesn't exist.",
  "Then how could ­­ how could the Court order the prosecutor to renew an offer that can't be made?",
  "But the whole ­­ what drove the prosecutor to make this bargain was he wanted the testimony, so how ­­ how can that ­­ that's ­­ I've never seen anything like this, where a court orders a prosecutor to make a plea offer that was never made.",

  "Mr. Burchfield, I'd like you to address this question about the restriction on speech. It has been argued that these limits promote expression, promote democratic participation because what they require the candidate to do is, instead of concentrating fundraising on the super­affluent, the candidate would then have to try to raise money more broadly in the electorate. So that, by having these limits, you are promoting democratic participation, then the little people will count some, and you won't have the super­affluent as the speakers that will control the election.",

  "But he can ­­ he can write checks to everyone that he wants to write checks to. It's just he can't give his special number of 1776.",

  "Mr. Stewart, can you explain the difference in the two proceedings? First, your position that the proper review is of the final partnership administrative adjustment. How would the penalty be adjudicated in that format, and if your ­­ if the taxpayer is right, that the adjudication must be made at the partner level proceeding, what would be the difference in the character of the adjudication?",
  "Using the language of the statute that you just quoted, can you explain to us what is the adjustment of the partnership item? That is, the statute says, \"Determine the applicability of any penalty which relates to the adjustment of a partnership item.\" So what is ­­ what was the partnership item adjustment?",
  "Mr. Stewart ­­",
  "If we ­­ if we go over to the merits, if this case came up today, and today, we have a penalty that wasn't there originally and that is for a non ­­ noneconomic substance penalty, would ­­ would the government today be going under that noneconomic substance penalty or would it be going under the 662(d)(3), that is the substantial valuation misstatement? Or is it the government's option, it can pick one or the other?",
  "If the government could choose either one, what would determine its choice?",
  "Mr. Garre, suppose the government had asserted this penalty under sub (6), or the transaction lacking economic substance. Would you be ­­ would you say it doesn't make any difference, it's the same? Or would you say that, under (6), your argument is not applicable to that and the determination could be made at the partnership level?",

  "That's only ­­ what that tells us is that venue is a highly waiverable thing. You can stand on your venue right, but you don't have to.

  "That doesn't mean it's improper. It means it's waiverable.",
  "Because consent is a basis for personal jurisdiction.",
  "Isn't that ­­ that's a problem with the argument. Both 1404(a) and 1406 provide for transfer. This Court has emphasized that it's one Federal system, and within the Federal system, the result shouldn't be dismissed, bring the case all over again, pay a new filing fee; instead of that, just transfer to the appropriate forum. And that's what Professor Sachs' view leaves out because the result, as you say, is ­­ it's only dismissal, no transfer.",

  "That would be taken care of simply by saying Van Dusen v. Barrack does not apply when a party is acting in violation of a contractual provision.

I mean, strict scrutiny was originally put forward as a protection for minorities ­­ a protection for minorities against hostile disadvantageous legislation. And so the view then was we use strict scrutiny when the majority is disadvantaging the minority. So you do, under the Carolene Products view, you do focus on race and you ask, is the minority being disadvantaged? If that were the view, then I suppose we would not be looking at this, well, the criterion is race and wherever the disadvantage falls, whether a majority or minority, it's just the same. That wasn't the original idea of when strict scrutiny is appropriate. So if we were faithful to that notion, that it is ­­ measures a disadvantage the ­­ the minority that get strict scrutiny.",
  "You said that the district court found it was clear that there was no ­­ there was no discriminatory intent, but that wasn't reviewed on appeal.",
  "You quoted ­­ you quoted from Crawford.",
  "And there is an opposing quote in Seattle itself on page, what is it, 486?",
  "\"When the State's allocation of power places unusual burdens on the ability of racial groups to enact legislation designed to overcome the special condition of prejudice, the governmental action seriously curtails the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied on to protect minorities.\" And it quotes Carolene Products. So ­­ and then the following sentence is: \"In the most direct sense, this implicates the judiciary's special role, not of treating the individuals as individuals, but the judiciary's special role in safeguarding the interests of those groups that are relegated to a position of political powerlessness.\" So the rationale of Seattle is that notion that we can't put hurdles in the way of a disadvantaged minority.",
  "How much time was left in this case?",
  "And you ­­ and if there were a one­year limitation running from the final administrative review, you would be out?",
  "Yes, but if there were such a rule, one year from the final administrative decision, this claim would become too late.",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "What accounts for the delay? When the ­­ the clock was running and more than a year went by before this suit was instituted, why was that ­­ why did that happen?",
  "But ERISA itself contains no statute of limitations, and it's generally assumed that, therefore, this State statute of limitations would govern, and if a State has the position that parties can contract the statute of limitations ­­ I mean, ERISA does have ­­ does have a statute of limitations for breach of fiduciary claims, right?",
  "And it has none for this kind of claim.",
  "I didn't understand your response to Justice Breyer's question, Mr. Wessler. I don't see how a Federal court that simply stays its ­­ stays its hand, abides the termination of the administrative proceeding, is in any way engaging in any kind of adversary process.",
  "Yes, many people in the administrative process aren't represented, but some are, right?",
  "Now ­­ in practice ­­ in practice, how often is that the case that the ­­ that the guidelines set by the Department of Labor are not ­­ are not met?",
  "But, Ms. Anders, the question is ­­ there is a division in the courts of appeals, and the question is: Could the Department of Labor, by regulation, resolve the matter one way or the other? Does ­­ even if ­­ even if it thinks the statute is clear, the courts obviously don't because most go the other way. So given that most courts go the other way, does the Department of Labor have authority to adopt a ­­ a regulation that would adopt the accrual rule?",
  "What is your position on Justice Breyer's suggestion that the trigger can be proof ­­ when you file proof of claim, but if it happens that beginning of suit at that point would ­­ while the ­­ while the administrative review process is underway, why not say you have to follow the time of filing, but if the administrative process ­­ in your case, the 4 years ­­ took 4 years ­­ just hold the suit in abeyance until the administrative process is complete?",
  "Isn't it true that in insurance contracts, generally, where there is this proof of loss as the trigger, there isn't a mandatory administrative ­­ most States don't have this mandatory administrative review.",
  "Ms. Carroll, did I understand you before to be taking the position that even if Congress enacted a statute of limitations with an accrual rule, that that might not be effective as against a plan provision that provides for the trigger being proof of claim?",
  "Does it? There are several factors that are taken into account. One of them is weight of the evidence. Are you equating those two things, probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the offense and weight of the evidence as one of several factors, to take account over the bail determination?",
  "Right to be heard ­­",
  "If your ­­ if your position prevails, there would be nothing to stop the defendant from using those assets for something other than paying an attorney. If the assets are unfrozen, freely available to the defendant, the defendant might say, I will settle for a legal aid lawyer, I want to use this money for something that I care more about. It ­­ there would be no control on that, would there?",
  "And how do you get at ­­",
  "But then there ­­ then there is the anomaly that the grand jury has said there is probable cause, this defendant can be prosecuted, and then you would have the judge make a determination that there isn't probable cause to believe. So you are asking a judge who has determined there is no probable cause to preside at a trial because the grand jury has found that there is probable cause. And how ­­ how could a judge allow a trial to go on? If the judge concludes there is no probable cause to arrest this defendant for this crime, how could the judge then conduct a trial? The judge would be overriding the grand jury's determination, right?",
  "Wouldn't the next step be that the judge would then dismiss the indictment? The judge has found there is no probable cause to charge this man with this offense. And yet, you're going to ask that same judge to try the case that ­­ it would seem to me that the logic of your position is, if there is to be this hearing on probable cause and the judge finds that there is no probable cause, then the judge dismisses the indictment. How could you ask a judge who thinks there is no probable cause to then conduct a trial.",
  "But you said something about plainly tainted assets. I thought that the hearing was given on the traceability of the assets to the crime. So on­on that part, the­ the defendant isn't allowed to challenge the connection between the assets and the offense, right?",
  "Everybody agrees with that. So there is a possibility to say, you said we have untainted assets, but the defendant in this case said, I concede that these assets are related to the charged offense.",
  "Did you say that, in this case, because counsel had been retained two years earlier, that the court was presented with how much the lawyer was going to charge to represent the defendants at trial?",
  "The ­­ the dollar amount was known, so that the court could then say, well, we'll unfreeze assets to that extent but no more.",
  "What was ­­ what was the figure? Counsel was identified.",
  "What was ­­ what was the amount of money that the defendants wanted spared from the seizure order?",
  "On that point, Mr. Dreeben, would you clarify what happens at the end of the road, if the defendant is convicted? I think you said, in theory, you could go after the lawyers to recoup the fee, but that would be difficult. Can you explain what is the difficulty? We",
  "General ­­ general ­­",
  "But he ­­ the defendant would have to introduce the issue of his mental state, either by his own testimony or an expert, but there's an oddity about this case. Do I understand correctly, General Schmidt, that, if there had never been a Federal proceeding, if this case had proceeded from start to finish in the Kansas courts, there would have been no Welner evidence, there would have been no prosecution expert, because it wouldn't have been allowed under Kansas's own rules?",
  "This ­­ this case was voluntary intoxication and ­­ and under Kansas procedure, the ­­ the prosecution could not have called a witness absent insanity or a mental disease; is that right?",
  "One issue is whether the expert, the government's expert, went beyond the scope of the direct, the experts for the defendant. That's an open ­­ that would be an open issue because I think Rule ­­ the Federal Rule 12.2 is very clear that the rebuttal testimony cannot exceed the scope of the defense expert's testimony.",
  "Isn't that an academic question in this case? After all, this expert for the government came in when the case was in the Federal system. The Federal system has a rule that, when the defense puts on an expert, the government can counter it. So the ­­ the limit would be ­­ I mean, Kansas doesn't provide for this? The Federal Rules provide for it in a very limited way. So to talk about using it beyond the scope of the Federal rule seems to me not the case that's before us.",
  "Are you suggesting that the government can answer in ­­ in a like manner as the defendant? The defendant opens the door by experts, then the government can call experts? That is not to say that a defendant simply offers his own testimony, the government can do something that ­­ that the defense has not opened the door to.",
  "Mr. Katyal, if this had played out entirely in the Federal court, the examination of the defendant was pursuant to Federal Rule 12.2. Your argument seems to be that Rule 12.2 violates the Fifth Amendment. I mean, the mental examination was ordered in the Federal court after the defendant said, I am going to put on a couple of witnesses ­­ expert witnesses, to testify to my mental state. Rule 12.2 says, when a defendant does that, then the government has the right to have the defendant examined by its expert. So the broad argument that you're making seems to lead inevitably to the conclusion that Rule 12.2 is unconstitutional.",
  "But this ­­",
  "But the scope question wasn't decided by the Kansas court, and they wouldn't get to it, unless they held that, yes, you can have this rebuttal testimony. Then the next question is, if you can have it, how far it can go? But the anterior question, can you have it at all, is the question the Kansas Supreme Court answered, no, you cannot have it. And we can't send it back to them without ­­ I mean, if ­­ if you can't have it at all, then it's irrelevant that the scope was too broad.",
  "Mr. Katyal, would you ­­ you said, in answer to my question, that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.2 violates the Fifth Amendment in small part. Can you be explicit? The rule, as I understand it, says if the defendant is going to introduce evidence concerning his mental state, then the government has a right to have the government's expert examine the defendant and rebut what the defendant's experts say. That's what the rule is. And then it says, you can't go beyond the scope of that issue ­­ of the mental state.",
  "You think it's unconstitutional to say to the defendant, you have a choice; if you introduce this testimony, then the government can follow where you have led; if you don't introduce the testimony, then of course, the government has nothing to rebut?",
  "Yes.",
  "It says, \"on which the defendant has introduced evidence.\" The evidence is the defendant's expert.",
  "Mr. Katyal, if that's your position, then you must disagree with the D.C. Circuit decision, which was already mentioned, United States against Byers, which took the position that, where the defendant leads, the government may follow. For the very reason that the defense expert has access to the defendant, you can't disarm the government by saying, we're not going to let you have a counter­expert. All you can do is cross­examine the defendant's expert.",
  "I didn't know that it was policy. I thought it was ­­ it was saying it is just like the defendant gets on the stand; he's subject to cross­examination. The defendant puts on experts; the government must be treated equally, must be able to put on its own experts. And as far as waiver, that's a fiction, isn't it? The defendant could say, 100 times, I'm going to testify, but I'm not waiving my Fifth Amendment privilege. It wouldn't matter if he said that 100 times. He will be exposed to cross­examination.",
  "Mr. Katyal, you have conceded, I think, in response to Justice Alito's question, that the rules could be changed to say, defendant, you cannot put on these experts. So how does that maybe help defendants who want to put on a defense of mental state? You can't put it on, unless the government can put it on. That's the current rule. But you're saying the response to it can be this evidence is shut out entirely. The government ­­ the government will have nothing to answer if the defendant doesn't put on experts. I'm not so sure that would be a rule that defense counsel would put on.",
  "What do you need to hammer out? You said that the rule now is no good because it allows government psychiatrists to have access to the defendant ­­ compelled access. That rule is no good, but the alternative of not allowing this evidence at all, what is there to hammer out?",
  "Is there really a huge difference between mental state as an element of the offense and mental state as an affirmative defense? I mean, in reality, doesn't ­­ doesn't the mental state argument of the defendant function as an affirmative defense to premeditated murder? Government has the burden of proof on mental state, but it ­­ it operates, as far as a defendant is concerned, if the defendant is able to show this voluntary intoxication, that would be a defense to premeditated murder.",
  "But we're dealing with here, from the picture, that looks like clothes to me.",
  "Mr. Schnapper, can I ask you another question? We're talking about time and whether it will be paid. And we have one worker that puts on this protective garb. And then we have another, the baker. It takes them about the same amount of time to do ­­ put on everything he has to put on. But everybody agrees, he doesn't get paid for that. What is the ­­ that that would come within the clothing. So we have all kinds of people who have to wear special uniforms, a doorman at an apartment house. It takes them time to put it on. Why should there be a distinction in getting paid between the protective garb and something that you must wear on the job? That ­­ yes.",
  "Mr. DiNardo, in this case, does it matter if we take your position that anything you need to wear to be ready for work or the government's position ­­ and I think it was the Seventh Circuit's position, too ­­ that equipment is different from clothes? But, here, the Seventh Circuit said the equipment that's involved, hard hats, glasses, earplugs, respirator, none of those things ­­ that they ­­ they take de minimis time, so we don't have to worry about them. In this case, will it make a difference if we go your way and say, everything worn counts; or the government's way, saying, well, at least clothes count, but equipment can be distinguished?",
  "It's not likely, is it, considering that the Bivens claim was created by this Court and not Congress.",
  "You ­­ you would not have any problem about ­­ assuming we agree with you that it's ­­ there's no personal jurisdiction, it's the wrong venue, for the district court in Nevada to transfer the case to the Federal district court in Georgia?",
  "But didn't they say they were residents in both places, in both California and Nevada?",
  "But it was ­­ it was stated as a separate claim, and I think Judge Grisholm read it that way, and I don't think Petitioner has taken issue with that, that there's ­­ one claim is for the seizure, another claim is for the false affidavit. So the seizure stops the funds immediately, and then the false affidavit keeps them there. So I didn't think there was a ­­ a genuine difference between the parties on whether the affidavit ­­ knowingly composing a false affidavit is an independent claim.",
  "Mr. Goldstein, can I take you back to the origins of all of this?",
  "The main move for personal jurisdiction, traditionally, is the plaintiff must go to where the defendant is, no matter how inconvenient that is for the plaintiff. Jurisdiction is defendant­centered. You're trying to hold a defendant, you have to go where he is. Then the long­arm age comes about, and we have specific jurisdiction, which, by the way, is what you're urging.",
  "You're certainly not saying they have all­purpose jurisdiction over Walden.",
  "And this Court, as the McIntyre decision indicates, has been pretty careful about specific jurisdiction. And Miguel wasn't enough that machine blew up or cut somebody's fingers in New Jersey. They had to purposely avail themselves of wherever the ­­ the standard words are. And here, you're asking for ­­ really pushing this specific jurisdiction to the limit. The defendant has acted only in Georgia. He hasn't set foot outside the State.",
  "But you are asking the Court to decide a big­ticket item, personal jurisdiction, and what ­­ the theory that you are proposing would apply not to ­­ just to Officer Walden, but it would be about as far out as any specific jurisdiction case I know. So the Court shouldn't say, well, jurisdiction, okay, venue, okay, but consider it transferring it to Georgia. That seems, to me, wild.",
  "Did ­­ did Calder have something to do with the notion that every defamation is ­­ that every publication is a tort where it occurs? There is something special about the libel cases. There was that theory that, wherever the paper that contains the libelous article ­­ wherever it is sent, each one of those places, the tort occurs there.",
  "Except, Mr. Goldstein ­­",
  "­­ it ­­ it is of no consequence to Walden whether this person is from Alaska or Nevada. In Calder, the article was about a person in California. The sources came from California. The paper had its principal circulation in California. It seems to me there's nothing resembling that in this case.",
  "Mr. Waxman, what do you make of the ­­ the patent listing non­infringement as an affirmative defense in an infringement suit?",
  "What you ­­ what you just responded, that would go as well for an alleged infringer who is not a licensee, right?",
  "This here ­­ this case is about the difference between the licensee and the non­licensee.",
  "I take it you disagree with the ­­ we have one friend of the Court brief that says this is not a case arising under the patent law; it arises under contract law. It's a contract case with a patent issue.",
  "How about a permissive counterclaim?",
  "How about a permissive counterclaim?",
  "But could ­­ could the patentholder bring in the declaratory action a counterclaim for infringement?",
  "But that was not ­­ Weast was not ­­ was not a patent infringement case. It wasn't a declaratory ­­ it wasn't a declaratory judgment, was it?",
  "Why ­­ why isn't that true here? Because you are seeking release of the escrowed funds.",
  "You cite ­­ you cite the default rule, and you rely on that totally. But there are other rules on burden of proof, for example, the party who has better access to the information, so it's not as though there is this firm rule with no exceptions. I take it, from your answers to Justice Scalia, that you are saying in every declaratory judgment action where only one party is seeking relief, that party has the burden of proof. So you're not limiting this to patent cases; is that right?",
  "But, Mr. Clement, you said that ­­ that the treaty is valid and the implementing legislation seems to largely copy the words of the treaty without adding anything. So it's a puzzle that the treaty could be constitutional, but the implementing legislation that adds nothing is unconstitutional.",
  "Mr. Clement, there's an irony in what you just said, because the victim, many times, went to the State police and said, please help me. And they turned her away a dozen times. And finally they said, go to the post office. So this doesn't seem to be ­­ you're arguing that this trenches on the State's domain. And, yet, in this very case, it wasn't until the State referred her to the post office, Federal officials, that she got any action.",
  "General Verrilli, before your time is out, you haven't answered directly why the Bill of Rights does constrain the treaty power, the implementation of it, Reid v. Colbert? Why is the Bill of Rights different from the federalism concern that the Court has expressed in many cases, when you say, yes, there is a check, the Bill of Rights is a check, but not the Tenth Amendment.",
  "Mr. Simeone, this ­­ the background of this case, I don't quite grasp. You originally said that you wanted to make sure you ­­ there was no disconnection, pending the FCC's resolution of the issue.",
  "Has the FCC had a proceeding to resolve it?",
  "Well, why wouldn't ­­ let's say you ­­ you ­­ there were no abstention. You have your case in Federal court. And the Federal judge says, the FCC hasn't spoken, so I don't want to step out in front of the FCC on this ­­ on this question.",
  "Well, you could. You could challenge it in the State court or this Court and ­­ eventually, but there's a proceeding going on in the State court, and there's a review ­­ State review attached to that. And you're ­­ you're saying we can cut off this administrative process that ends in State review. We could cut it off and go to the Federal court.",
  "Then you explain that. But ­­ but in the review ­­ in your review petition from the State court ­­ to ­­ to the State court, you brought up more than just this ­­ the question of these ­­ these charges.",
  "What do you say about the argument that ­­ that once the IUB decided to go on with this proceeding, you didn't want them to, but they did, that that then became a proceeding for them to enforce the access charge?",
  "Are you saying, then, that in every State agency adjudication attended by State court review ­­ Younger would apply?",
  "So can you ­­ so can you then ­­ we have only the two cases. We have Middlesex and Dayton, and you say this case belongs in that Younger category. What State court adjudication ­­ State agency adjudications attended by State court review would fall outside Younger on your rationale of what Younger covers?",
  "Well, then why wouldn't you say that Sprint was not the initiator of this State process? Because Sprint withdrew its complaint, right?",
  "Sprint ­­ Sprint withdrew its complaint.",
  "Yes. So, at that point, it becomes the board's proceeding. It becomes a proceeding initiated by the board and not by Sprint.",
  "Mr. Massey, with respect to that, there is a claim for restitution. I take it, if the suit is successful, the money that's collected will be distributed to all the people who are affected by this conduct.",
  "Mr. Massey, you envision one proceeding, it could be a class action on behalf of the individuals, that doesn't require everybody that satisfy the amount in controversy, and then this action by the Attorney General, which does, among other things, seek restitution. Isn't there an overlap between those two claims? And how do we sort out ­­ you said ­­ at one point, I think you described the restitution as \"disgorgement of ill­gotten gains.\"",
  "But, now, we have the consumers who were affected, they've already been paid. So how does it work for the Attorney General's suit? What is the impact of the class action that has already gone forward and been completed on the Attorney General's claim?",
  "Except we know that's not true in this case because we already have a settled ­­",
  "Is your ­­ is your view of what's called the mass action ­­ a mass action is you have to have a sizeable number of plaintiffs, each one with 75 ­­ at least $75,000 at stake. Is that ­­",
  "And so they would all be named plaintiffs.",
  "Are there many actions of that nature where there are hundreds of people, each with a claim of 75,000 or more?",
  "Why would you bring such a claim in Federal courts in this mass action format? I can see in Mississippi, it doesn't have class actions, but if you're in Federal court, why would you ever have a mass action, instead of a class action?",
  "In this particular case, the individual claims were settled in the ­­ in the class action, so if there ­­ if there are no individual claimants to be ­­ to be represented, why doesn't this end up being a claim where only the State of Mississippi has a stake because the individuals that the State might have been representing have already been satisfied, so if this is ­­",
  "That seems to be ­­ that seems to be disputed because I understood Mr. Massey to say that the restitution claim would go to the State. And you say that that ­­ the restitution couldn't go to the State.",
  "Maybe ­­ maybe they didn't, but if you look at the committee report, what is the definition of mass action? And it is, under this new subsection D­11, \"expands the jurisdiction over suits that are brought on behalf of numerous\" ­­ numerous ­­ \"named plaintiffs.\" \"Numerous named plaintiffs.\"",
  "Well, the question ­­",
  "But the question, Mr. Hungar ­­",
  "But your position is that wouldn't matter, as I understand, because you have ­­ you have ­­ you have two limitations, proselytizing and disparaging. And ­­ but I think Justice Kagan's question gets at ­­ place ­­ place limitations. One could read your brief and say, well, it doesn't matter; it could be an executive body, it could be a court, it could be a town meeting, a school board, a zoning board, a utilities board. That's ­­ is this case about prayer at the beginning of a legislative session, or is it about prayer in all three branches of government?",
  "Is there ­­ is there any constitutional historical practice with respect to this hybrid body? It's not simply a legislature. It has a number of administrative functions. Sometimes, it convenes as a town meeting. Sometimes, it entertains zoning applications. Is there a history for that kind of hybrid body, as there is for the kind of legislature we had in Nebraska or our Congress?",
  "Mr. Gershengorn, your ­­ your brief is the one who brought up ­­ and you were quite candid about it ­­ the hybrid nature of that body. I think it's on pages 22 to 24 of your brief. And you say it would be proper to have certain checks in that setting. So, for one, make sure that the entrance and the exit is easy. For another, inform the people in town of the tradition, so they won't be confused. But you recognize, on the one hand, that this isn't like Congress or the Nebraska legislature, and then you say these would be nice things to do. Are you saying just that it would be good and proper? Or are you saying it would be necessary, given the hybrid nature of this body?",
  "On the remedy, this case was remanded by the Second Circuit for the parties, together with the court, to work out appropriate relief. And if you could tell us what you think that relief would be because, then, that is a measure of the constitutional infraction. So what would ­­ you put yourself before the district judge and propose the changes that you think would be necessary to bring this practice within the constitutional boundary.",
  "What my question was ­­",
  "­­ your theory, and you say existing situation violates the Constitution. So what changes do you think would need to be made ­­",
  "­­ that would bring this within the constitutional boundary?",
  "All employees or would you limit it ­­",
  "­­ to the ones that had a hand in executing the contract?",
  "But it just came up. I mean, we are reviewing a decision of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. And this Spinner case from the ARB postdates. We have a district court, a court of appeals.

  "Can an accountant be a contractor?",
  "But then ­­ but the bottom line of your argument Mr. Perry, is that the whistleblower who is working for the accountant ­­ you say there are separate provisions that deal with the accounting firm and the law firm. But the whistleblower who wants to disclose what nefarious thing is going on would have no protection against retaliation by the accounting firm or, if it's a law firm, the law firm?",
  "But the answer to my question is right, they wouldn't have ­­",
  "­­ a whistleblower claim against the accounting firm or the law firm?",
  "I'm sorry. You told me that Congress didn't provide for the whistleblower, but it allowed the agency to do so.",
  "Which agency?",
  "Apparently, that's not the view of the SEC because I think they are ­­ they are represented by the government. And the SEC apparently takes the view that this provision does cover contractors. It covers lawyers who couldn't be contractors and accountants.",
  "It's a lot like the dissent in the First Circuit.",
  "Mr. Elwood, you're dealing with all kinds of hypotheticals. But in this case we had a jury determination that Rosemond was the person ­­ he was convicted of carrying ammunition, right?

  "What was the evidence that the jury had on whether he possessed the ammunition?",
  "Does that ­­ does that have to do with the additional 120 months? The underlying crime is 48 months and then the ­­ the gun makes it 120 months more consecutive?",
  "Well, why don't we just take it that we have a crime, the underlying crime, it's a 48­month crime, and then if you have a gun in connection with that crime, it becomes 120 months consecutive. And your position seems to be that all you have to prove is facilitation of the underlying drug offense. And it seems to me to ­­ to get 10 years of your life for the government proving no more than the 48­month charge is a bit much.",
  "Mr. Bash, would you explain why in this situation the gun abetted a drug deal when there was no drug deal? It had been thwarted. The drugs were stolen. They were not engaged in any attempt to sell the drugs. That was a failed attempt. So how is this done, abetting a drug deal, when the deal failed?",
  "Mr. Fisher, and you can stick with this case. Once he's arrested on a robbery charge, he can be held for many, many days. Why isn't it appropriate to assume, not when he's asked to come out and talk to the police for two minutes, but when he's incarcerated on a robbery charge, that the premises are no longer open to him, that he's no longer at home there?",
  "Well, in the ­­ in the interim. He's been charged, not convicted, and he's ­­ he's in jail awaiting trial.",

I just read the passage and all that it's saying is: Find out if in this case there was some corruption involved. But it does say employers and unions may set ground rules even if the employer and the union benefit from the agreement. So you seem to be construing the Eleventh Circuit decision to say something it didn't say, to say that organizing agreements violate 302.",
  "Where is that?",
  "It says ­­ it says that, at the end of that passage, curbing bribery and extortion are implicated.",
  "And said that's what ­­",
  "What is your position on the effect of the expiration of this agreement?",
  "Then may I ask you, Mr. Messenger, to clarify, because I thought you told me before that some organizing agreements are okay. Are you taking the position that all organizing agreements ­­ in other words, are you taking a position in opposition to what I read from the Eleventh Circuit, that organizing agreements can be valid?",
  "So you ­­ you do you want us to say that ­­ that to the extent that the Eleventh Circuit said, \"Employers and unions may set ground rules for an organizing campaign, even if the employer and union benefit from the agreement,\" you want us to say that that was wrong.",
  "And it has ­­ it has been enforced under 301. So it ­­ it would be odd to say that an agreement that is enforceable that court ­­ courts haven't enforced agreements just like this under 301 are criminal under 302.",
  "Have ­­ have courts enforced agreements just like this one under 301?",
  "Is it ­­ we heard from the other side that that hundred­thousand­dollar payment for the ballot initiative was a benefit both because it would mean that there would be many more workers employed by the casino if they were allowed to go into this new line of business. So that it wasn't payment to the employer of something that is of benefit exclusively to the employer. It was to the union's benefit too.",
  "Mr. Goldstein, you have given us three parts for an opinion.",
  "Is it your position, essentially, that, under this bilateral agreement, the case is to be decided by an arbitrator, not by a court in Argentina or the United States? And so the question is when an arbitrator will decide the case. And so the question of when doesn't say whether it's an agreement or not. It just says, that you sued too early, you started it ­­ you started too early. Is that your essential position, that this bilateral agreement says arbitration is the way this dispute gets decided, and everything on the way to that is what you call a preliminary question, but, essentially, the parties have agreed that their disputes will be solved by arbitration?",
  "Isn't that the same thing in France, which is supposed to be a popular place for international arbitration, that, in the first instance, the arbitrator decides, but, ultimately, the court can review everything?",
  "How do we know that? How do we know that? The question is, is this litigation preliminary ­­ going to the Argentinian court, is the litigation preliminary a condition on the consent to arbitrate a dispute? What is the answer to that question, in the view of the United States?",
  "Alright, so you've done all that. And what does the United States ­­ the United States is saying, court, you should look to all these sources, and then answer the question, is the litigation preliminary a condition on consent to arbitrate the dispute? So, after looking at the sources that the United States is telling the court it should look to, what is the answer of the United States to that question?",
  "Mr. Blackman, may I ask you, preliminarily, on your view, what happens next? That ­­ can this party ­­ and suppose you're right ­­ can the ­­ can the BG Group institute an action in Argentina and, if it's not resolved within 18 months, invoke arbitration?",
  "And if it is resolved, but not to BG's liking then, thereto, BG can invoke arbitration?",
  "Well, doesn't that mean that the treaty partners agreed that only an arbitration panel can conclusively resolve this dispute? Not a court.",
  "I don't ­­ I don't get your answer to my question. Am I wrong in thinking that, under this treaty, the ultimate decisionmaker is the arbitrator. There is no provision for the court to be the ultimate arbiter of the controversy?",
  "That's ­­ the D.C. Circuit treated this as there is no agreement until you go to the local court first.",
  "The argument is that there is an agreement to arbitrate. That will be the method of dispute resolution. You have to take certain steps before. So you have to go to the local court. But why isn't the dispute settlement mechanism decided upon by the parties' arbitration, and then what you have to do before that is in the nature of a procedural condition?",
  "Well, what would happen ­­ what would happen in this case if there was a judge's strike, so none of the courts were operating in Argentina? What would happen then?",
  "Before you do that, can you tell ­­ tell us why Michigan didn't resort to the dispute resolution means that the compact provided? The compact said, if there's a dispute, it'll be decided by arbitration. Michigan bypassed that.",
  "That's ­­ all that ­­ the enigma that you pointed out ­­ or the anomaly is ­­ is certainly clear. But what about Kiowa? This Court seemed to say that the tribe is immune on reservation, off reservation, commercial activity, government activity, it is immune, blanket immunity. So how can you prevail without having this Court modify Kiowa.",
  "But once the Congress didn't respond, the majority opinion in Kiowa ­­ I don't know whether it's \"Kiowa\" or \"Kiowa\" ­­ said ­­ you know, this is an unfortunate result, but Congress can do something about it. Well, now Congress hasn't done anything about it, and you are asking this Court, essentially, to modify the ­­ that precedent.",
  "You agree with that, that they could ­­ the State could go in and arrest all the customers that are gambling there? Could it seize the slot machines?",
  "What would be the big ­­ what would be the big change, other than modifying Kiowa, which is a divided opinion, and was dealing with a money claim. It wasn't dealing with injunctive relief.",
  "But – Mr. Katyal, is that right? The distinction between commercial and governmental, it was court made in the first instance, and then the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act codified law that was court made. So it was the courts that made the distinction between acting in a commercial capacity and acting in a governmental capacity.",
  "Mr. Katyal, isn't it odd to say that when this is the Court ­­ the doctrine of tribal immunity is something that was announced by this Court. Congress never passed a law that said the tribes have immunity. It's all this Court. And then you say, what this Court made, only Congress can unmake. That seems strange to me.",
  "Dependent sovereigns.",
  "Justice Alito's question was the Kiowa case. It was off reservation, the tribe owed money on a contract, which it refused to pay, and the Court said sovereign immunity.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, you went through the development of the foreign sovereign immunity and whether the courts were influenced by the government. It was the courts that recognized this distinction between commercial activity and governmental activity. Why couldn't the Court extend that same distinction to Indian tribes and say, it makes sense in the foreign country context, it also makes sense in the context of the tribes, to distinguish commercial from governmental?",
  "Mr. Clement, the argument was made that if ­­ if the airline has an unreviewable right to terminate this agreement for any reason or for no reason, if that is so, then it's an illusory contract. What ­­ what is your answer to that, if one party can get out willy­nilly, why ­­ what kind of bargain is it?",
  "How about Minnesota? In Minnesota, isn't it just a rule of construction of the contract?",
  "You said, \"in some States.\" So what about the States where that doesn't? Are you saying that, in some States, the implied covenant is assumed to be what the parties agreed upon, and, in some States, it's not?",
  "Suppose the State ­­",
  "If we had ­­",
  "In Wolens ­­ and this is a case that you rely on and that allowed room for contract claims ­­ the expression was \"self­imposed undertaking.\" And the airline says, we didn't impose, we didn't take on this obligation, but the law reads it into every contract, whether we want it or not. How is it self­imposed if the party has no say, that it's going to apply anyway?",
  "Suppose the supreme court of the State had an opinion that says, we're going to be candid about this, the covenant of fair dealing and good faith, it's not in this contract, but we will read it into every contract; that is, if the State supreme court said, it's externally imposed, this is a rule that we will read into every contract because of the policy in our State that people should deal with each other fairly. Suppose that was the controlling decision of the Minnesota supreme court. Then you're out; is that right?",
  "Well, it's one thing to read the terms in the agreement. It's another thing to say it's an underlying premise that good faith and fair dealing will control. Are you taking issue with the good faith and fair dealings standard being amorphous, being susceptible to different interpretations by different judges, by different juries?",
  "Is an employment at­will contract illusory?",
  "That's because the contract was silent. Here, it isn't. Here, the contract, says \"sole discretion.\" In Wolens, the question was retroactivity, and the contract said nothing one way or the other about it.",
  "The plaintiff ­­",
  "And the plaintiff used the frequent flyer program, whatever else it might be used for, he used it to get lower prices on flights, right?",
  "Your point is that you can get frequent flyer miles by purchases other than airplane transportation.",
  "Well, then you could ­­ you could sue them for infringing on your patent or whatever intellectual property protection you have. But here is an entrepreneur that says, we make a product, and Lexmark is disparaging our product. It is essentially trying to get us out of this line of business. Certainly, if you just read the words of the Lanham Act, this is allegedly false advertising, and the false advertiser shall be liable to any person who believes he or she is likely to be damaged by such an act. That ­­ that legislation seems to envision a very broad standing, certainly enough to encompass the person who is ­­ whose product is being disparaged.",
  "Explain to me why ­­ we are talking in abstract terms. Here is a manufacturer that says, my product is being disparaged by the defendant ­­ my product, not someone else's ­­ the result is that I am losing business. Why do we need anything more than that under the Lanham Act, which makes false advertising ­­ gives a claim for false advertising to somebody who's been hurt by it?",
  "But I'm not asking about State law remedies. I'm looking at this statute, and your interpretation seems to stray very far from what the statute ­­ this section of the statute says.",
  "And if you just read this section, would you agree that ­­ what is the party ­­ SCC is someone who has been injured, damaged, by the false advertising?",
  "Is there any question here that there was an intent on the part of Lexmark to stop the Static Control company from making these microchips?",
  "Yes. That's what we have ­­ and we have to deal with the complaint and have to assume that that's true. What the complaint alleges is that Static was making a product and Lexmark was disparaging it and not by happenstance, but quite deliberately.",
  "And the ­­ the directive ­­ the letter said don't buy Static Control's product because, if you do, you're in jeopardy of being a contributory infringer.",
  "Has that been applied outside the context of the APA, that is, when the suit is against an agency?",
  "Has it been applied to private party litigation?",
  "So what makes this limit a prudential limit? You are supposed to put ­­ the notion of a prudential limit is there is Article III standing, but, even so, you can't sue because you don't meet the prudential.",
  "Your zone of interests ­­",
  "Your zone of interest, in response to Justice Scalia, would establish another tier of zone of interest. The ­­ arguably, within the zone is the APA standard. And you said, here, you could strike \"arguably\" and just have it within the zone.",
  "So what's wrong with the ­­ what is it ­­ AGC, the antitrust standard? So it's got five things. And Justice Alito just suggested that maybe that's more generous to finding standing than ­­ than the reasonable interest.",
  "I'm sorry. You used \"target\" twice. Once, you said SCC was not a target, and the other time, you said it was, but it ­­ target isn't a test.",
  "Explain that. Because, if we accept the allegation of the complaint as true, the allegation is that Static's product was disparaged, that remanufacturers were told, don't use this product because, if you do, you're going to be involved in infringement.",
  "Well, was Title VII an APA ­­ when I asked Mr. Jones?",
  "But it is ­­ it is in the Air Force manual and in a JAG opinion, was the exclusive possession criterion.",
  "Has ­­ since this case has been pending quite a while, has the manual changed, has ­­ to ­­ to delete the exclusive possession?",
  "If ­­ if your position is right, then I ­­ I think there would be nothing left of Flowers, because Flowers, the government owned that area as well. Is there anything left ­­ I mean, that ­­ in this case, the ­­ the property is used as a public highway, and people go back and forth. In Flowers, it was a street. So are you urging that Flowers is essentially overruled?",
  "And where is this? Where is the exception? Is it ­­ was it in the bar order?",
  "It could have said ­­ it could have said that Apel can't use the highway. That would ­­ that dispensation was a matter of grace?",
  "Is that what you're saying?",
  "Flower ­­ Flower was with the street.",
  "On your Flowers point, I think Mr. Horwich said that ­­ that there was no doubt that 1382 applied. It was only a constitutional question ­­",
  "­­ in Flowers.",
  "But the ­­ but the barment order that Mr. Horwich just read to us says that he can use the road, but that's not ­­ because the road is outside the statute, that's because the government, as a matter of grace, said right in the order, right in the bar order, you can use the road. So there's a sharp difference. The government says the road is under military control, if the commander so chooses, but we're going to let him use the road. The government treats the ­­ the domain as including the road, as including this protest area.",
  "Can ­­ can we go back to your response to Justice Scalia? You said that the Respondents conceded, but ­­ but isn't it the case that it was the Colorado supreme court that said that the airline likely would have been immune if they had phrased the report more cautiously?",
  "So it's ­­ it's the Colorado supreme court, not the Respondent?",
  "But did the jury ­­ did the jury find falsity? Do you recognize that? Did this jury find that the statement was, as you say, materially false?",
  "And how did ­­ how did they make it? Because the only thing I see is the special verdict sheet and it doesn't ask that question.",
  "Can we go back to the \"who decides\" question? I find it very confusing. Now, everybody seems to say, well, it's the jury that decided ­­ that decides, but the Colorado supreme court said that it recognized that the court was to decide this question, not the jury. And in this case, the jury decided it. That was error, the Colorado supreme court said, but it was harmless. So who decides? Is it ­­ is it the court or the jury?",
  "What are ­­ what are the factual issues? You said the factual issues. I didn't think that there was much dispute about what was said to the air traffic safety. So what are ­­ what are the disputed facts that the jury would find relevant to the immunity?",
  "Well, they didn't ­­ they said, we were concerned about his mental stability.",
  "How do you add to the question ­­ the question in this case was put by the Court ­­ the question whether ATSA immunity may be denied without a determination the air carrier's disclosure was material and false?",
  "As I understand it, the ­­ the First Circuit position is not what's being defended; instead, it's the Eleventh Circuit's position, which is a bright­line.",
  "I thought it was that, if it's statutory, Budinich controls; if it's contractual, then you ­­ you treat it as though it's a question of damages.",
  "Mr. Feldman, before ­­",
  "Mr. Feldman, there's a ­­ there's a question that has not been ­­ that's not surfaced yet, but after Budinich, however you pronounce it, the rule makers changed Rule 58(e), and now, 58(e) provides a mechanism for deferring the finality of the judgment until the fee question is decided. You didn't seek an order under 58(e), did you? You didn't ask the district judge, please defer the finality of the judgment until the fee question is decided.",
  "So you didn't make that ­­",
  "You still could have said to the judge, please defer the entry of judgment until you resolve the fee question, and you ­­ you would not be entitled to that relief, but it would be in the discretion of the judge. And so that's how the rulemakers thought this problem could be handled. You can't have a judgment that does not become final until the fee question is decided. But if there's ­­ absent that specific determination, then the judgment becomes final when it's final, and the fees are a separate matter. I mean, it seems to me that, now, that this mechanism in the rules to handle this, we should not depart from the rules, whether it's contract or statutory, it's separate. It's not part of the underlying judgment.",
  "Mr. Feldman, going back to my 58(e) question, one thing that's interesting about the rulemakers' response to Budinich is they didn't ­­ they didn't make any distinction between statutory and contractual fee awards. You would have us divide the world up that way, statutes one rule, contracts another. But the ­­ the Rule 58(e) doesn't ­­ it's not confined to statutory fees.",
  "That would apply to statutory fees as well, the argument about piecemeal, duplicative appeals.",
  "And that's because ­­ because EPA did it that way ­­ you don't get that from the statute. You get it from what EPA did in the first round; is that right?",
  "But isn't there ­­ isn't the effect on the no longer child much more severe? I mean, if everybody has to get bumped down a little way, it'll make a difference of months until they qualify for a hearing.",
  "Well, it's not going to be 27 years.",
  "It's not going to be 20 years.",
  "What about all the time this one child has been waiting? It gets no credit for that?",
  "Is your position, basically, that this is in the nature of a ­­ an affirmative defense and that defendant carries the burden on remorse ­­ and what was the other one that Mitchell saved out? Acceptance of responsibility?",
  "So if defendant says nothing, then he hasn't ­­ he hasn't proved a mitigator.",
  "I thought we ­­ it wasn't controversial that, on mitigating factors, the defendant does have the burden.",
  "So is ­­ is there a difference between the prosecutor saying, judge, I want you to charge this jury that they can use defendant's silence against him, or a judge, on his own, telling the jury that, or the judge, as here, simply refusing to say you can't take it into account?",
  "Are all those the same, or would you distinguish them?",
  "But the courts in those cases had a specific issue before it. Its attention wasn't called to what I suggested is in the nature of an affirmative defense. The defendant has the burden to persuade the jury on mitigators.",
  "Was there any other ­­ defendant didn't say, I'm sorry. Was there ­­ was there anything else? Did the defendant produce anything else in the way of remorse?",
  "I'm curious about one facet of this case. This instruction was sought by the defendant. The prosecutor had no objection to it. The judge said, I'm sorry, I am not going to use that instruction. Is that common in Kentucky, that both parties agree that an instruction should be given, and the judge says, I'm not going to give it?",
  "How could this be ­­ let's assume that you're right, that there was error. How could it be harmful, given the ­­ that the mitigators ­­ that the aggravators were not in dispute, he had entered a guilty plea? So how was the defendant harmed by the failure to give this instruction?",
  "Mr. ­­ Mr. Regan, you ­­ you want us to apply equitable tolling in a field, family law, where the interest of the child is always of paramount importance and running all through family law is ­­ is that concern. And changed circumstances figure very large. So decrees that might be final in another area of law are not because, if circumstances change, then the child custody may change. So it seems to me that this area is hugely unfit for equitable tolling that would leave out consideration of the child's best interests.",
  "Where is Article 13, so we can look at it?",
  "Well, Mr. Regan, aside from the position of the United States, which ­­ which has changed, you made that point, the determination that's being made at this stage is really one of venue. It's where the main bout will be fought out. And so we don't want that to linger for a long time. We want that decision to be made with dispatch. And as one of the amici brief informs us, many of these what you call kidnappers happen to be badly abused women and if you ­­ if they had to go under Article 13, then they would have this full­blown, was he really the abuser? Doing it without equitable tolling, that question is reserved for the main ­­ for the main bout. I suppose if we had a case where the judge isn't certain was the father abuser or not, that judge would feel an obligation to stretch out this venue determination, to see if it's an Article 13 situation.",
  "May I ­­ may I ask you, I think your brief ­­ I may not be remembering it correctly, but I think you ­­ you said no equitable tolling, and everybody in all the other countries agree on that, but there is equitable discretion. I think that you ­­ and the question is, is there this equitable discretion notion?",
  "How ­­ how would that aid be invoked? Take Justice Scalia's example. The parent left behind in Mexico, no resources of her own or his own. How would the State Department get into the act?",
  "How did it ­­ how did it affect the ­­ how many board decisions will have to be redone, or how did ­­ how is the board coping with that problem?",
  "General Verrilli, we've taken you off your starting point. Your starting point was what is it ­­ what constitutes a recess. And your position is that it can be an intra­session recess. But if we look back historically, Congress met, and they met continuously. And then they went on horseback back home, and they were away for 6 months, even 9 months. Today, there's nothing like that. The inter­session ­­ the inter­session recess could be ­­ could be an hour. So what do we do with that? There was the vision of a long recess running for months, and today, the inter­session recess might be momentary.",
  "But it isn't ­­ it isn't tied then to the availability of Congress, availability of the Senate. I think you said throughout your brief that the rationale for the recess power is the President must be able to have the government functioning and staffed even though ­­ although the Senate isn't ­­ isn't around. But now the ­­ you seem, in your answers, to be departing from the Senate not available and making quite another justification for this. The Senate ­­ I think, to be candid, the Senate is always available. They can be called back on very short notice. So what is it that's the constitutional flaw here? It isn't ­­ it isn't that the Senate isn't available. The Senate is available. It can easily be convened.",
  "You do have ­­ you do have the one that you relied on in your brief, and this understanding goes back at least to 1823, and the ­­ the Wirt letter, Attorney General Wirt said, on the wording ­­ maybe on the wording, the case is not strong. But the purpose, he said, you would be honoring the letter and defying the spirit. That was the ­­ on the question of the ­­ when the vacancy ­­",
  "Before you ­­ before you ­­",
  "The ­­ we sort of drifted away from the new ­­ the new practice, the pro forma session. And you were asked, suppose there was nothing in the resolution about they would conduct no business. It was an informal understanding that they wouldn't. But there is no express agreement that they're not going to conduct business. Then do you lose on that part of the case?",
  "But your argument would destroy the recess clause. There would be ­­ under your argument, it is totally ­­ totally within the hands of the Senate to abolish any and all recess appointments.",
  "Suppose ­­ suppose we have an inter­session break. It's three days. On your reading of the Recess Clause, in that three days, the President can fill up vacancies.",
  "Well, leave out the second question. Just on ­­ the first question, because it seems to me that if the rationale was when Congress was out of town for 6, 9 months, of course, the President has to be able to make the government work. But now you're saying that in that time, it's only three days, they are going to be there available very soon to confirm. And let's say somebody ­­ somebody dies on day 1. The President puts in ­­ makes an appointment on day 2. You would say that's okay?",
  "If there is a 3­day recess between sessions, then your argument is that is ­­ that is a recess and the President can make ­­ can make appointments in that time.",
  "I don't follow that, because I thought that $75,000 would go to satisfy part of the claim, that there would still be the legal fees unpaid.",
  "Yes. But now the ­­ the trustee, who is obliged to try to find what assets he or she can, spends a huge amount of money in order to ­­ to prove that this claim of a second mortgage was false. And ­­ and there should be ­­ so what happens then, on your theory, that all that money was spent and the result is that the second mortgage is canceled; the creditors are satisfied? Nobody pays the legal expenses. Is that ­­",
  "Are you saying that he must spend the $75,000 on a new residence within how many ­­ what period of time?",
  "6 months. And if at the end of 6 months he can't find a home at that price, then what happens?",
  "Then if 6 months runs, and he hasn't purchased a new home, then the $75,000 goes where?",
  "They have been paid already.",
  "So then what you said before needs to be modified. He does get to keep the $75,000 because there is no creditors to be paid off from.",
  "I thought the objection had to be raised by a creditor within a certain time.",
  "I thought ­­ isn't there a provision that says, and if there's no objection, the exemption is what is claimed?",
  "Maybe you get it from the trustee.",
  "The faithless trustee.",
  "Ms. Harrington, at the cert stage in this case, the Government suggested the distinction between two situations: One, an action by the debtor to remove property from the estate, leaving the creditors unsatisfied. And that's where you say this power of exemption can be taken away. And then the other side was where the creditors are paid in full and only the trustee's litigation expenses are at issue. Are you dropping that distinction?",
  "I thought this ­­ the cities were relying on Section 912, as applied to the 1875 Act.",
  "Well, can you explain to me something to me about that 1875 Act a little bit? We know that until 1871, these railroad rights­of­way were considered to leave the government in the position of having a reversionary interest.",
  "And I don't see anything in the 1875 Act statute. There was an end to the giving away of large ­­ large quantities of land to the railroad, and so that was out. But what is there in the 1875 Act that changes the right­of­way from what it had been up until 1871?",
  "But the railroad wasn't benefited by the end of the 1871 understanding of the right­of­way. The one that was benefited was the government. The government got ­­ got back the land, so it's not ­­ we're not ­­ was going to stop giving land to the railroad, yes, but the beneficiary that is losing out under your interpretation is the government.",
  "Mr. Yang, would you clarify what you're ­­ what Mr. Lechner told us. He said that to this very day the Department of Interior has taken the position that these railroad rights of way are easements.",
  "What would ­­ what would be the exposure of the United States if we ­­ if you lose­­ are there takings claims now?",
  "Why should that matter given that, after the bankruptcy judge ruled, the U.S. District Court gave de novo review to this case and entered a final judgment that met all the requirements of Article III?",
  "Why would the ­­ why would the district judge do that when the district court said that there are no disputed issues, no relevant disputed issues of fact and it's a pure legal question?",
  "It uses the word \"appellate\" ­­",
  "­­ in 158?",
  "But the definition ­­ the definition was linked to a purpose. You­­ you laid out very nicely the two categories; the one category where the bankruptcy judge enters a judgment, the other category where the bankruptcy judge makes recommendations. So, if you ­­ the purpose of the classification was to indicate the bankruptcy judge can make the final judgment, can only make recommendations. Suppose the district judge had said, I'm uncertain after Stern about whether the bankruptcy judge had authority to enter a final judgment. So I am going to treat that summary judgment as a recommendation. I'll treat it as a recommendation and I will review it de novo. I agree, I enter final judgment. If the district judge had said that, then you would have no case, right?",
  "But she did say that EBIA had the burden to demonstrate error in the bankruptcy courts.",
  "Well, don't we have a decision that says that the ­­ the term \"wages\" should be interpreted the same way for FICA purposes and income tax?",
  "I have a question about the effect of the government's position. In the States, if these ­­ if we say these benefits qualify as wages for FICA purposes, then what about the States that say we will supply unemployment compensation only if there is not another source of unemployment compensation?",
  "If it is treated for income tax purposes as wages, why shouldn't it be treated for FICA tax purposes?",
  "What your are saying is on the income side they are treated as wages; on the FICA side they're not treated as wages.",
  "There are some severance payments that do count for FICA purposes, isn't that so?",
  "Could you review again, what is ­­ what is the relevant distinction between dismissal payments that are subject to FICA and payments that are not?",
  "It has to be involuntary?",
  "And SUB payments are all voluntary?",
  "You ­­ well, you told me that the dismissal payments are involuntary. How about the supplemental? Are they ever and always voluntary?",
  "How about that we should just ignore their revenue rulings, including the current one, and just deal with the statute? Is that what you are suggesting?",
  "And then what happens to the State compensation schemes which the revenue rulings seem to have been trying to accommodate?",
  "Mr. Rienzi, the problem that the State faced is it doesn't know ­­ and it has a history, there was a considerable history of disturbances and blocking the entrance, and it doesn't know in advance who are the well­behaved people and who are the people who won't behave well. So ­­ and after the disturbance occurs, it's too late. So the State is trying to say, We want to make sure that the entrance is not blocked, and the only way we can do that is to have a rule that applies to everyone. We can't ­­ we can't screen people to know who will be well behaved and who will be disruptive.",
  "How much is ­­ how much is restricted? How ­­ how long does it take from when you enter the buffer zone until you reach the clinic entrance?",
  "So the conversation can go on before those 7 to 10 seconds.",
  "There's not much you're going to be able to do to have a conversation that will persuade people in 7 to 10 seconds.",
  "Well, that's a ­­ a contested point because the Attorney General reads \"scope of employment\" to mean getting to my job and leaving my job, and does not include speech activity.",
  "This is the ­­ the chief legal officer of the State says this is a term that needs to be interpreted. The term is \"scope of employment.\" Scope of employment within this statute means getting to work and leaving work, and it doesn't mean political speech.",
  "But it's \"such as,\" it's \"such as.\" It says you can't talk about anything.",
  "Well, it's not content ­­ it's not based on speech about abortion. It's that you can't speak about anything.",
  "That was an injunction.",
  "I have no problem with the description of what Congress had in mind, reaching conduct that was prosecuted only as a misdemeanor. But the ­­ the words that Congress used has, as an element, the use of physical force. Under the Tennessee statute, as I understand it, you don't have to have physical force. You have to cause bodily injury to another, which could be caused by a means other than physical force.",
  "Yes.",
  "So in your view, and I think you said this in your brief, but what constitutes violent conduct? So you said not scratching, not bruising, not slapping.",
  "When I asked you the question, you ­­ you were hesitant about scratching, bruising, slapping.",
  "But on you reading, it seems that one thing that Congress really wanted to cover, it didn't; that is, the ­­ the defendant has brutally beaten the mother of his child. But under the Tennessee statute, you would say that that doesn't qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.",
  "So that means that on your interpretation, we leave out the one thing that we know Congress wanted to cover.",
  "Would it make any difference in your view if instead of domestic violence, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, the statute said misdemeanor crime of domestic abuse?",
  "I thought it was to negotiate what's typically negotiated in collective bargaining; that is, wages, is that not so? Wages and benefits?",
  "But how does it differ from the typical bargaining that a union does? It asks for a wage rate, and it asks for various benefits. So are you saying that when it's a public ­­ in the public sector, it gets converted into something else?",
  "But you're not ­­ you're not challenging ­­ or it's confusing whether you are or not ­­ the very idea of exclusive representation by a union. Are you saying that, in the public sector, there cannot be exclusive ­­ an exclusive bargaining agent?",
  "Is the mandatory ­­ let's take out, as Justice Alito suggested, take out the agency fee or fair­share fee or whatever it is, but there is an exclusive bargaining agent. Workers, your clients, say, we don't want to be represented by that union. The union is authorized to represent everybody in the workplace and has to represent even nonmembers, as well, without any discrimination. And ­­ and are you taking the position that there cannot be an exclusive bargaining agent if there are any dissenters who don't want to be represented by a union?",
  "They receive a salary ­­ I mean, they receive ­­ it's not a government grant to the ­­ to the healthcare worker. They receive a paycheck, and the government withholds from that. The government makes a FICA contribution for them and withholds the part that's their responsibility. So it looks just like they are an employee of the government, being paid by the government, and the government doing things that an employer does, withhold income tax, pay in part the FICA tax, withhold the other part. And they are ­­ they're also covered by workers' compensation, aren't they?",
  "As ­­ as employees of the State?",
  "They're not getting a paycheck and the insurance ­­ insurer is not deducting withholding tax ­­ isn't paying FICA tax?",
  "On damages as well as injunctive relief? I thought your brief said injunctive relief, but not damages.",
  "Ms. Saharsky, this ­­ before you sit down, there's one puzzle I'd like you to address for us, and that is your position is damages within the 3 years, okay; injunction, you can adjust for the laches. In the patent area, and also intellectual property, the Federal Circuit has said that laches may bar as it goes ­­ just the reverse, laches may bar monetary relief, but not injunctive relief. What explains the difference between, in the patent area, no monetary relief, but yes, injunctive relief, and your position in the copyright area, monetary relief but no injunction or a modified injunction?",
  "Mr. Perry, you said that the ­­ the objective is to get the copyright holder to sue early on and not to wait, but if the ­­ if no profits had been made in that early period and it would cost the plaintiff more to mount a lawsuit than the the plaintiff, who has a copyright that's going to run a long, long time, sue? If things stay the same, no suit will ever be brought. Why is it unreasonable for the plaintiff to see if the copyright is worth anything?",
  "Why should it be different from the patent case?",
  "So you think the Federal circuit's decisions are wrong?",
  "I thought that ­­ that J.L. gave an example of an exception that the report is somebody is carrying a bomb?",
  "There's a tip that someone is carrying a concealed weapon, and we have held that that has to be corroborated ­­ corroborated. You can take out a concealed weapon in an instant and fire it and kill lots of people. In fact, it was pointed out that there are more deaths caused by guns than there are from drunk driving. So what's the difference? The ­­ the argument on the drunk driving is very, very dangerous, but so is having a gun in one's pocket.",
  "But if you ­­ once ­­ once you brandish it, it's too late. The damage will be caused.",
  "Why? Why ­­ the ­­ we have the case of the trusted informer. The informer several times has given the police tips and it turned out to be right. And then we have another side, the anonymous person. Then there's somebody who calls, gives a correct name and address, but no record at all of reliability. Why should the fact that the name is known ­­ the name of the informant is known, if the police have no reason to believe one way or another that this informer is reliable?",
  "Why is that different from the knowledge in J.L., that they were three young men, and they were described, and the caller said, \"The one with the gun is the one with the plaid shirt.\" All of that was corroborated by the police, and yet, we held that that was no indication that a crime had been committed.",
  "But here, we have the police did follow the vehicle for about 5 miles and saw nothing erratic about the driving. So perhaps, if the police had immediately stopped the person or ­­ but don't ­­ don't we have to take account that there was no corroboration? When the police get there. Even if they could stop him instantly, when they have no corroboration, then that doesn't amount to reasonable suspicion.",
  "But this ­­ this family member, the uncle, residing in Pennsylvania, he could not have purchased that gun in Virginia, isn't that right, because he's a nonresident?",
  "But wouldn't he ­­ wouldn't he have to comply with the 552(c), which says how somebody who doesn't show up in person can purchase a gun? And none of those requirements were satisfied here. So it seems to me that what you're asking is just an end run around what Congress said. If you're out of State and you want to buy it, this is how you have to do it.",
  "In Virginia.",
  "Mr. Palmore, when the Agency changed its view in 1994, there was no change in the statutory text, was there?",
  "And at that time, the interpretation was that you committed the offense if you sold ­­ if the person, the true buyer, was an unlawful ­­ a person to whom firearms could not be sold. But if you ­­ if the ultimate possessor was a lawful possessor, then there was no liability. So the ­­ the statute has to be open, at least, to either interpretation, no change in the words. The Agency read it one way, and then later changed its mind and read it the other way.",
  "Why do we ­­ why would we ­­",
  "Why ­­ why should we get to that question, when we have what seems to be a clear order from Congress, and it is in 2259(a). It says, \"The court shall ­­ shall order restitution for any offense under this chapter.\" It sounds like that's a direction that, if there's an offense under this chapter ­­ which is undisputed, there is ­­ the court shall order restitution.",
  "Well, it doesn't ­­",
  "Let me ask you. You're mentioning this case. There was another case that also involved and came up at the same time, the Wright case, and there was a settlement there, and it was for ­­ what was the amount of money? The amount of damages in the Wright case?",
  "Now, but was there something in the evidence there that made it proper to award restitution in the Wright case, but not in this case?",
  "They're the same?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, I would really like you to tell us, concretely, what the government's approach would be; that is, we have all is one position, nothing is another position, and the middle. The government comes down in the middle, and what I gather from your brief, you say there should be a reasonable formula to arrive at a starting point for further analysis. So I don't know what you propose as a starting point. What is the reasonable formula that the Court should use for its starting point?",
  "How do you get to the",
  "And so it wouldn't ­­",
  "It wouldn't include the people who are not prosecuted, and it wouldn't include the people who, in the future, are prosecuted.",
  "So you start with ­­",
  "What about taking into account that the perpetrator, the uncle, that the restitution was something like $6,000; right?",
  "So if there's any kind of proportionality, it seems that the possessor of two images should not be responsible for more than the person who perpetrated ­­ perpetrated this horrendous crime.",
  "I would like you to, to the extent that you can, to help district judges get a handle on this, what formula should they use and what adjusting factors should they take into account after they have that starting formula?",
  "What about at least the amount of the judgments she has already received? The total amount, I think, was 3.4 million that you're seeking?",
  "And she has, so far, collected how much?",
  "Would you at least deduct that from the ­­",
  "But the point has already been made that it isn't a typical joint tortfeasor situation, where you can seek contribution from people who equally contributed. How would ­­",
  "How would ­­ how would the defendant here go about seeking contribution?",
  "Before you do that, can you clarify whether or not you agree with the dissenting judges on the D.C. Circuit? That is, if we limit it to criteria pollutants, even so, BACT must be installed for greenhouse gases. You seemed in your main brief to agree with that. You have a footnote saying it's got a heck of a lot of differences. It's 86 percent of the emissions on the Government's theory; 83 on yours. But your reply brief seems to turn 180 degrees from that.",
  "Well, what do you make ­­ what do you make of the endangerment finding that greenhouse gases have severe effects at the local level that ­­ I think the endangerment finding is not before us today. The endangerment finding is that they exacerbate ground­level ozone and smog.",
  "What else does it cover other than Title II, other than mobile vehicles?",
  "And what other programs I asked earlier. So we have the mobile vehicles. What else? You're saying it excludes PSD. What else does it ­­",
  "Can you clarify that? We have the NAAQS criteria. EPA has added many others across the years. For 30 years it's been adding things for which there are no NAAQS. What about all of those?",
  "One of the things that EPA said in ­­ in the explanation of this rule is that EPA could say that PSD or Title V applies only to certain GHG sources ­­ it's been suggested that that source would be carbon dioxide ­­ applies only to certain GHG sources and does not apply to the remaining GHG sources. But there didn't seem to be any follow­up on that idea. Well, the way to cure it is carbon dioxide doesn't work, take it out.",
  "There's a difference between them.",
  "So which one? Either one of them?",
  "Well, what ­­ what about BACT for CO2, then?",
  "Well, wouldn't the proper answer be if we are rejecting your entire position to say there are these other options? We're not going to say take out CO2. We're not going to say adopt the Kavanaugh approach. We're going to say those are choices for EPA to make.",
  "Well, how did the EPA come at ­­ settle on the number?",
  "When you said fully returned, it wouldn't be fully returned if the debt was greater than the value of the property.",
  "What would happen if it turned out that the property was worth more on the date of sentencing than it was on the date of foreclosure?",
  "Well, how do you arrive at the foreclosure amount? I mean, the one virtue or a virtue of the Government's approach is you get the money, and you know exactly how much the house sold for. How do you ­­ at the time of foreclosure, there's been no sale. How do you determine the value? You said in Wisconsin, there are often appraisals, but there wasn't any in this case, was there?",
  "And who's ­­ who has the burden of proof? If we ­­ we know the proceeds when it's sold. It's not sold. But you say it has to be valued as of the time of foreclosure. And I think you said someplace in your brief that it's the Government's burden to show the value at the time of foreclosure.",
  "Well, the Government's interest, I think, would be to show a low value, right?",
  "You made a point about under Wisconsin law, there would be ­­ and the foreclosure ­­ suppose there were a foreclosure, there could be no deficiency judgment. Were you trying to suggest from that that you get the property and ­­ and no restitution for the rest?",
  "There wasn't ­­ there wasn't anything at all in the record to suggest that there was undue ­­ that that 33 months was an undue delay.",
  "And there's a question about this case that I would like you to answer before you finish. And this is a case of a young man, 19 years old, he gets hooked into this scheme. He gets $500 for each parcel, $1,000; and then he's ordered to make restitution of $219,000. He was a bit player in the scheme. What happened to the people who dreamed up this scheme, Lytle and Valadez?",
  "So that ­­ but did they ­­ were they ordered to pay restitution for these two houses?",
  "If the sale ­­ if at the time of sentencing, the house has not yet been sold, but there's no ­­ there's good reason for the delay, because for example, there are no bids at an earlier time, could the judge defer the restitution order until the house is sold?",
  "There was no ­­ there was no ­­",
  "­­ evidence of that in this case, that the bank held on too long.",
  "The answer that Ms. Harrington gave was that there were no bids.",
  "I think she said there were no bids.",
  "On your reading, Mr. Katyal, I take it that if the district court denies fees, there would be slim to no chance of getting that overturned on appeal if you're dealing with the abuse of ­­ abuse of discretion.",
  "But if you leave it to the district court that way and the district court denies fees, isn't there a ­­ a risk of large disparities from district judge to district judge. One will say, yes, I think that this was uncommon, not run of the mine, so I'm going to award fees, and another one of them will say, no, I think it's pretty standard, so I won't award fees.",
  "Two of the items that you mentioned, one was venue, and the other was claim preclusion, issue preclusion, the Federal Circuit is no more expert in those areas than a district court would be.",
  "The ­­ you mentioned the venue question.",
  "And I was surprised. The Court said, well, that's for the Pennsylvania court to sanction.",
  "But you, I'm sure, have read Noxell case in the D.C. Circuit ­­",
  "­­ one of the problems there, one of the conduct that was considered unreasonable was suing in ­­ in a distant forum, very far from where the defendants operated. And claim preclusion and issue preclusion come up in all kinds of cases, so there's nothing expert about the Federal Circuit on those issues.",
  "You ­­ you had just said that we should return it to the district court with orders to require fee shifting. And how could that be if the discretion is to be exercised by the district court? I can understand your asking for a remand, but I can't understand your asking for a reversal and an order that the fees be reimbursed.",
  "And you think this Court is the proper court to look at the record and make that determination, that the district court got it wrong when the district court didn't think this was an exceptional case.",
  "I think you ­­ you did say if it's an exceptional case, the district court must award fees, but the statute says may. So even in the exceptional case, according to the statute, the district court is not required to award fees. Or do you read may to mean something else?",
  "If the Court is dealing with the Federal Circuit's test and it's got these two things, baseless and ­­",
  "­­ subjectively, and clear and convincing evidence, I think to leave out that piece of it when it all comes out of that one paragraph in the Brooks Furniture case, so I think once the case is before us, if we leave out that one piece ­­",
  "Well, why don't why don't we just take ­­ there's another statute, as you know, that has identical wording, the Lanham Act, and that says exceptional means not run of the mine, uncommon. And then there's a nice illustration, a case from the D.C. Circuit.",
  "Why don't we say, Well, we have it there in the Lanham Act, the same words.",
  "But you just look to ­­",
  "You look to the text ­­",
  "­­ and the text is identical in both. The legislative history, some people like it, some people don't. But the text is identical. So I think it would be odd to construe the very same words in the context of the Lanham Act one way and a different way in the context of the Patent Act.",
  "What about the inherent authority ­­ Justice Kagan brought this up ­­ not just Rule 11, but inherent authority when the court finds that the litigation is baseless and brought in bad faith? It seems to me that your standard is the same as what the Court could do without any statute. Are there other pieces ­­",
  "Mr. Waxman, could we just clarify one thing, that what you refer to as the SEM, that is not limited to IQ of 70, 75. That's across the board.",
  "So it has nothing to do with the death penalty and mental retardation ­­",
  "Retrospectively.",
  "The district court did make a finding that he did not show adaptive behavior, and the district court said that that was so because all of those experts that you've referred to were speaking retrospectively. There was no evidence of what the defendant's current condition was. That was ­­ I think it's in the Joint Appendix ­­",
  "Well, what ­­ there was nothing that limited you to the retrospective proof. The ­­ the trial judge asked a simple question, how did the defendant adapt in prison, and quotes one expert as saying: \"Well, I didn't test for that. I don't know why I didn't do it.\" And that same expert said that he had, in fact, done it in other cases.",
  "And if it were 76, you would not need to go on to adaptive behavior; is that your view?",
  "Can I stop you there?",
  "I thought that you don't have to go to, under your view, you don't have to go to the second and third standards if you ­­ on the first, it's 70 or below. I thought that adaptive behavior doesn't come into the picture, and onset doesn't come into the picture, if the IQ is above 70.",
  "How many States retain that practice with a rigid 70 cutoff?",
  "Would the court, in your view, ever have an occasion to decide whether conduct of this nature violates the Fourth Amendment? If you ­­ you were right about clearly ­­ clearly established, then could this ­­ could the underlying constitutional question ever be, what would be the posture of the case in which it could be decided?",
  "What do you say clearly establishes that? You ­­ you say the passenger is there. What case tells a police officer when there is a passenger no lethal weapon?",
  "What about the statement that there was a police manual that says once you authorize to shoot, you can continue shooting until the job is done?",
  "I believe that in Basic, Justice Blackmun said that there is this economic theory, but also the motivation for the Exchange Act and probability and common sense would lead to this presumption ­­ this rebuttable presumption. So he wasn't relying strictly on an economic theory. I think two or three times in the opinion, he tries to make that plain.",
  "Where is that, that it says that 18(a) is the proper ­­",
  "­­ reference?",
  "Isn't the ­­ isn't the ­­ it's not a question of is it rebuttable. I thought that that's already claimed from Basic. It's a question of when. You're arguing that it should be rebuttable at the class certification stage. The other side is arguing, yeah, of course it's rebuttable, but that comes in at the merits determination. It doesn't go to the question whether there are individual issues that predominate over class issues.",
  "Then how is such a plaintiff's claim typical of the class? You have ­­ you admitted that the 23(a) factors are met, commonality and typicality. Well, if one is a member of this class that says, we didn't rely individually, but we did rely on the marketplace as being ­­ as having integrity, if you have someone to whom a direct representation was made, that person is not a proper member of this class as a discrete question, not one common to the class, not one typical. The typical investor in a Basic class is somebody who no representation was made to that person directly.",
  "May I ask you about the rebuttable presumption, Mr. Boies? You agree that the Basic is a presumption and that it can be rebutted, but you say that's a question for the merits. What difference does it make at what stage the rebuttal is allowed? What practical difference does it make if the inquiry is made at the certification stage rather than the merits stage?",
  "How many of those drop out at the summary judgment stage?",
  "Whatever it might have been at the beginning, given the most recent legislation, Congress took a look at the 10(b)(5) action and it made a lot of changes. It made pleading requirements. It's difficult to say that this ­­ Congress would have legislated all these constraints if it thought there was no action to begin with.",
  "But, Mr. Shanmugam, it could have meaning if it were read to refer to the debtor's retirement fund, not anyone's retirement fund. And let me ask you one disturbing feature of this. Congress was very careful when it crafted exemptions from the bankrupt estate, like the homestead exemption. It said what, 22 ­­ something over $22,000, the car, 37­something. Is it likely that Congress would have created an exemption so large that ­­ this one is claimed to be $300,000 ­­ for funds that are immediately usable by the bankrupt? I mean, this big pot of money gets exempt from ­­ from the creditors' claim, it just seems incongruous considering how narrow Congress has made the other exemptions.",
  "Wasn't the purpose of that, however, to see that the beneficiary wasn't going to be hit with a huge tax liability if it had to take the whole thing all at once?",
  "But in this very case, I mean, this was a fund of what, $400,000­odd. The daughter, the beneficiary, had already spent 150,000 of that.",
  "So for your purposes, you wouldn't need ­­ I mean, you would be ­­ you would have a, I think, an airtight case if the statute didn't use the word \"retirement funds,\" it just exempted funds in ­­ in an account that is exempt from taxation, period?",
  "But it would just be defining \"retirement funds\" to mean the debtor's retirement funds.",
  "Could you explain in that context? You said something about uniformity. Seven states isn't a particularly high percentage of the States. Does the ­­ does the debtor's home State ­­ has the debtor's home State adopted this exemption?",
  "So would the other interpretation that says it has to be the debtor's retirement account.",
  "The court below had a ­­ had a simple take on this. It says that \"retirement funds\" means funds set aside for the debtor's own retirement. Petitioner tells us that you don't defend that definition, the definition that \"retirement funds\" means the debtor's retirement funds. Is that so?",
  "Is it so that you do not defend the position that \"retirement funds\" means funds set aside for the debtor's own retirement?",
  "It's just ­­ it's just puzzling why you want to disassociate yourself from the clear position of the court below that \"retirement funds\" means the debtor's retirement funds. Why would you want to do that?",
  "Mr. Clement, maybe it seemed clear then, but since RFRA, just as before RFRA, Congress has continued to write into Federal legislation specific religious exemptions for some, but not everybody, for individuals, sometimes religious institutions. So if it was all that clear that RFRA took care of it all, why did Congress continue after RFRA to pass these laws focusing the exemption on an individual, religious institution? Those, as I take your argument, all of those laws ­­ and there are more than half a dozen ­­ were unnecessary. Once RFRA was on the books, Congress didn't have to do that any more.",
  "Mr. Clement, this ­­ this was a law that was passed overwhelmingly, both houses of Congress. People from all sides of the political spectrum voted for it. It seems strange that there would have been that tremendous uniformity if it means what you said it means, to take ­­ to cover profit corporations, especially in light of ­­ there was an effort to adopt a conscience amendment, a specific conscience amendment in 2012, and the Senate rejected that. That ­­ that amendment would have enabled secular employers and insurance providers to deny coverage on the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions. It was specifically geared to secular employers and insurance providers. And that ­­ that was rejected.",
  "Well, It was a religious organization.",
  "This is ­­ this is what's different. I mean, all along the earlier cases dealt with individuals and they dealt with religious institutions.",
  "There was a point made earlier, and I think you didn't mean to say this, that provision of health care is not part of their religious belief. Covering their employees for health care, that is not a religious tenet, right?",
  "But, Mr. Clement, you made the analogy to RLUIPA. And the one thing that has not been mentioned up till now is the Establishment Clause. The Court was very clear when it came to RLUIPA, which you said is similar to RFRA, that the accommodation must be measured so it doesn't override other significant interests. And that was true of Sherbert and that was true of Yoder. The ­­ and the Cutter case, and this Court made it very clear, that the accommodation has to be balanced and you have to take into account other significant interests.",
  "It would make no difference if it were ­­ there are 20 FDA­approved contraceptives, all of them covered by the Healthcare Act.",
  "You ­­ you picked out, in one case what, three, and the other case four? Suppose the employer says contraceptives all together are against my religion, so I'm not going to give any contraceptive coverage.",
  "But your argument, it seems to me, would apply just as well if the employer said no contraceptives.",
  "Title VII was passed before 1993, so it wouldn't apply ­­ RFRA wouldn't apply to Title VII.",
  "Would you have taken the same position if all that had been was the first move, that is, the move to Fourth Street? Then there would have been about an equal distance from the pro­President demonstrators.",
  "Well, then would you say that you would have no tenable case if they moved them just the one street over so they wouldn't be in a position to throw a hand grenade to the patio?",
  "And have you ­­ you've conceded that there would be a security interest, in the hypothetical that Justice Kagan raised, that there are ­­ people are in front of that alley where they could throw a grenade. Once you concede that, then you say, but the security interest, the valid security interest is washed away because, in fact, it was reported.",
  "There was ­­ in Judge Berzon's opinion, she seemed to think it was very important that when the President got into the motorcade to leave only one side had access. So leaving aside what happened when the group was moved, would you take the position that not moving them back before the President left was a violation of their First Amendment rights?",
  "Mr. Gershengorn, suppose it's originally set up by the police, the motorcade is coming down, each side has roughly equal access. Then the Secret Service comes along and said: Clear the anti­Bush demonstrators. Suppose that, that ­­ those were the facts. Would there be a valid Bivens claim?",
  "The rationale is just it's more likely that the people who are against the President would be harmful to him than the people who are for him.",
  "Mr. Phillips, on the abstract idea, you know that the Bilski case held that hedging qualified as an abstract idea. So how is intermediate settlement a less abstract than hedging?",
  "There is no special software that comes with this ­­ that's part of this patent, is it ­­ is there?",
  "Mr. Phillips, let me just stop you there, because four Justices of this Court did not read that legislative history the way you do. And it was ­­ was in Bilski.",
  "Justice Stevens went carefully through that and he said: Congress was reacting to a decision. It had ­­ it was not addressing 101. So there are at least four Justices who say ­­ who didn't buy that argument.",
  "Mr. Phillips, in response ­­",
  "In Bilski, Justice Breyer did try to say that there wasn't that ­­ a whole lot of distance between the four who thought business methods were not patentable. But he ­­ he also said something else in ­­ in the other case, Mayo. Justice Scalia asked you the question about doesn't that go to novelty, but didn't Justice Breyer say in Mayo that novelty can be relevant to patent ­­ to patent eligibility? He said there's ­­ there's an overlap.",
  "The Federal Circuit in this case split in many ways, and it had our decisions to deal with. And you said, given Bilski and Mayo, this is an easy case. What is the instruction that escaped a good number of judges on the Federal Circuit? How would you state the rule?",

The law that you are relying on is supposed to be concerned with nutritional information and health claims, not a competitor is a competitor losing out because of the deception.

It has very limited resources. You are asking us to take what it has said about juice as blessing this label, saying it's not misbranding, when its regulations aren't reviewed by the Court, when there is no private right of action, and say that that overtakes the Lanham Act.

  "But, Mr. Olson, you have said ­­ you make this distinction between the exemption in the Act and what can be discovered. But the discovery rule itself, the advisory committee, the note on the original drafting of the discovery rule says, \"Statutes of the United States on execution,\" and certainly the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is a statute of the United States on execution, \"govern under this rule.\" And in case you don't get the point, it lists, oh, a few dozen statutes. For example, it says that you can't execute ­­ assign, execute, levy or issue other legal process against a Federal employee's retirement annuities. And there are all kinds of provisions, substantive provisions limiting what property is subject to execution.",
  "But this is a note to the discovery rule.",

  "Mr. Olson, but this is a sovereign, and as I understand the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, it says “execution, the foreign sovereign has immunity, has immunity except ­­ except when we're dealing with commercial property in the United States.” So the statute starts with a blanket immunity against execution for the foreign sovereign and then says, but there is an exception for property ­­ commercial property in the United States.",

  "Could it be addressed to Argentina on your theory? I think it could.",
  "I thought they objected to it. Didn't the banks object?",

You're using a discretion test, but you're not giving the district judges all over the country a clue about appropriate exercise of that question. And if I understand your most recent answer, you're saying it could go either way, it's up to the district judge.",
  "But there was a time when the government thought that was the right procedure.

  "But you told me before, I think, that the tax court can stop it. I asked you a question, could the tax court say now we're in court, any information has to be in compliance with the scope of discovery we allow.

  "But if you were to prevail, then the parties concerned might well go to their State legislatures and say, enact a statute of repose. That will get us off the hook, even before the injured person is aware of the injury and of the cause of it. The result of that would be to totally defeat what Congress meant to do in saying the trigger is when you know the cause of the injury.",
  "What would be the constitutional problem if Congress had said all people claiming an injury under this statute can commence the action three years after discovery of the cause, to say that?",
  "What kind of ­­ I don't follow that. A statute of repose is a time limitation; is that right?",
  "I thought that what Congress was trying to do was to establish a Federally required commencement date, a Federal requirement ­­ a Federally requirement commencement date. So when you ask the question, how much time do I have to sue for one of these CERCLA injuries, the answer would be three years after you know the cause of your injury. Now, on your ­­ taking out this statute of repose, there can no longer be a uniform answer to that question.",
  "So, Mr. Palmore, if ­­ if Congress ­­ if all of the States enact this 10 ­­ 10­year statute of repose, then that has totally undermined what Congress set about to do in 9658.",
  "But, Mr. Palmore, the question I asked is suppose all of the States have these 10­year statutes of repose. Then there would be no occasion to invoke 9658, and the plaintiff would be out of court before the action accrued in some cases.",
  "Does ­­ does the restatement court statute of repose, are they going back to what ­­ at least I learned in law school, there was a statute of limitations and then there was a so­called built­in statute of limitations. Statute of limitations general covered all claims, but a built­in statute of limitations was considered to limit not simply the remedy, but the right.",
  "But if you take this, the facts of this case, 10­year statute of repose, there was never a time when these plaintiffs ­­ when this ­­ these plaintiffs had an action that could be brought, just because the 10­year limitation ended their right to sue before they had a claim.",
  "But it's not a commencement date in terms ­­ \"commencement\" means commencement of a lawsuit. The true trigger for the statute of repose here is not a commencement of a lawsuit date. It is the commencement of the running of the limitation period. But it isn't the time when you can commence a lawsuit.",
  "But you couldn't commence an action. Say the last ­­ the defendant commits the last act, and then plaintiff sues the next day. Well, plaintiff can't sue the next day because the plaintiff doesn't know that she's been injured.",
  "They picked up ­­ they picked up on State statutes. And as I understand it, the very purpose of the statute of repose or the built­in statute of limitations is to check the discovery rule, to say, we don't want the discovery rule to operate after a certain amount of time, a certain amount of time has passed. So the notion of what has been called a statute of repose and a discovery rule, the very purpose of the repose statute is to say no discovery here.",
  "It encouraged what did you say?",
  "The study group was making recommendations to the States, and it made two discrete recommendations. One is time the statute of limitations from awareness of the injury and its cause; and the second was, instructing to the States, don't have any repose statutes because they will defeat our purpose of taking into account latency. So the study group is addressing State law. Then Congress does something different. It provides a Federal limitation period that is based on discovery of the injury plus the cause. The second recommendation made by the study committee abolished statutes of repose. Congress didn't do that.",

It's your rule, then, that the cell phone is fair game no matter what the crime, no matter how relatively unimportant the crime.

  "What do you mean by scope? You can look at e­mails but not something else? What would the scope limitation be?",
  "But you’re not questioning the ability of the police to take the phone. I thought that that was a given, that incident to the arrest, the police could take the phone. The question is whether they can search it without a warrant.",

  "Can you explain something in ­­ in your brief that would seem to make all of this beside the point? You several times referred to a release form that covered the years in question.

So more was at stake for this Tribe than simply filing a piece of paper.",
  "What of the point that Justice Kennedy suggested, that ­­ that States can have different reporting requirements? So it's a little bit like Egelhoff in that respect, that if there were uniform requirements, that would be less burdensome, but if each State has its own specifications, then that becomes burdensome and costly.",
  "Well, we know ­­ we know, Mr. Waxman, that Blue ­­ Blue Cross is providing this information with respect to individuals that its own plans insure, and we're told that it is providing the information for other self­insured ERISA plans who didn't make this objection. So do we know at least what is the burden of providing that information for the other self­insured ERISA plans that Blue Cross is ­­ is providing the information for?",
  "You're ­­ you're saying that the State simply cannot have an all ­­ all­payer database, that that's out because ERISA precludes it, even though it's going to leave a big hole in the information that the State has about that health care being given to its citizens,",

  "Mr. Clement, to take you down to the practical level, and we're not getting involved with war, take Nevada v. Hall. But Justice Kagan's point is, if California says that a Nevada truck coming on its California roads, injuring a California resident, so then Nevada is liable to the courts and the law of California, Nevada can say fine. If a California truck comes into our State and injures Nevada people, we will do the same thing. That's what I think Justice Kagan had in mind.",
  "And that's what Hall said didn't exist. Hall said the States, vis­à­vis each other, don't agree to respect the other's sovereign immunity. Hall distinguished sovereign immunity where you are the king, where you are sovereign, a State's immunity. And then said, but when another State is in the ­­ in the picture, equally sovereign, then both of them are sovereign, and neither has to respect the sovereign immunity of the other, that it's just ­­ well, when the ­­ when the nation was new, you will admit that there was no full faith and credit obligation. If one State was going to respect the sovereignty of the other, it would be a matter of comity, right?",
  "Okay. So ­­",
  "So when did it change from comity to an obligation?",
  "Yeah. The very concept of comity is a matter of grace, that's international law. That's what this Court said in Hilton against Guyot. Comity is not a kind of a full faith and credit.",

So is California now saying they were wrong in the argument that they made?",
  "Well, what do you ­­",
  "Mr. Clement, what do you do with ­­ I mean, one time we had ­­ had this issue, and the argument that you're making was ­­ was made in ­­ in Alden, and the Court spent over two pages distinguishing Nevada v.

  "May I ask you a ­­ a question? It's ­­ it's odd that you're making this charge that there was an impermissible effort to increase the Democratic authority, power, in the legislature, but the end result was that the Arizona plan gave Republicans more than their proportionate share of seats in the State legislature. And I think the numbers are, in total, Republicans won 56.6 percent of the State Senate seats, 60 percent of the State House seats. And that exceeded the Republican party's Statewide registration share of 54.4 percent. So if there was an attempt to stack this in favor of Democrats, it certainly failed.",
  "And ­­ and it was more than mixed motive. It was a finding of dominance, that the dominant purpose of this was to attempt to meet Section 5.",
  "And that's a ­­ that's a fact­finding which you ­­ you have a burden if you're seeking to overturn it.",
  "Do you ­­ do you agree with your colleague that it doesn't make any difference; that in the end result, the ­­ the legislature ­­ that the Republicans were disproportionately advantaged, had a disproportionate share of the seats?",

So we have the States overwhelmingly for half a century using population as shown in the census, and now you're saying they can't do that anymore.",
  "I thought ­­ I thought Burns said it approved a deviation from population but it took great pains to say, we're not saying you could do that in every case. Burns seems to be the only ­­ the only case that you have, and Burns involved this really peculiar situation of Hawaii with a tremendous military temporary population.",
  "Is it your view that what the Fourteenth Amendment means is that in all the years between ­­ what was it? ­­ 1868 and 1920, it was wrong for the States to include, for these purposes, women? They were not eligible voters.",
  "But you're saying that that was wrong. I mean, in your interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment from 1868 until 1920, the State should not have been counting women for ­­ for purposes of determining representation in the State legislature.",
  "In ­­ in your view, the States would have a choice between the citizen voting­age population or they could use the registered voters? Either one would be okay?",
  "Mr. Rein, may I ask, if we didn't have the 10 percent plan, if that were out of this case, and all that were left were the Grutter­like plan, would you then recognize that you had no claim? We have the ­­ what ­­ what the University of Texas has added on to the 10 percent plan. But now we wipe out the 10 percent, and we have only the Grutter­like plan.",
  "I know it's not ­­",
  "­­ but ­­ but I'm asking the hypothetical.",
  "But in Grutter ­­ in both Grutter and what Justice Powell said would be proper in Bakke, race was a factor. Race, itself, was a factor. And that's why I'm finding it very hard to distinguish what the university is doing, apart from the 10 percent plan. But let ­­ let me ask you about the 10 percent plan itself, because it seems to me that that is so obviously driven by one thing only, and that thing is race. It's totally dependent upon having racially segregated neighborhoods, racially segregated schools, and it operates as a disincentive for a minority student to step out of that segregated community and attempt to get an integrated education.",
  "But it could work only in the background.",
  "It is created because of race.",
  "Is there any doubt that it was created to increase the number of minority students? Was there any other reason for the 10 percent plan?",
  "But the top 10, you said it doesn't use race. Justice Breyer is asking, you say yes, race can be a factor. It was a factor in Bakke. It was a factor in Grutter. And so far, you're saying that now it can be a factor only if what? I mean, we're not talking about so­called neutral factors. We're talking about ­­",
  "Mr. Rein, because your time is running out, there is one preliminary question I'd like you to address, and that is: What is the relief you're seeking? I take it not injunctive, because Ms. Fisher has graduated.",

  "But what do the damages consist of?",
  "If the ­­ if the university should say, okay, the application fee and whatever else we add to that, we ­­ we offer that so that this contest will be over; if they offered you the damages that you are seeking, would the case become moot?",
  "What are ­­",
  "­­ what are the broad ­­ what are the broader? You gave me the application fee.",
  "What are you reading from?",
  "Can you just tell me where you're reading from?",
  "Mr. Carvin, is it permissible, in your view, to allow the union to be the exclusive representative so that nobody else is at the bargaining table?",
  "What about the Railway Labor ­­",
  "What about the Railway Labor Act?",
  "The Railway Labor Act.",
  "You ­­ you answered Justice Kennedy that, in the private sector, this ­­ this is all right, you can have an agency shop. How about under the Railway Labor Act?",
  "But you don't have any First Amendment argument about that, about the ­­ either the private sector or railroads.",
  "But what would happen then?",
  "What would happen to the employee who said now Abood is off the books?",
  "I want back the agency fee that I was compelled to pay. That was an unconstitutional exaction. So all of the people who paid these fees against their will ­­",
  "­­ have a right to get it back?",
  "Mr. Carvin, do I take it ­­ it was something that Justice Breyer said; you didn't respond directly to it. He said if Abood falls, then so do our decisions in Keller on mandatory bar association, on student activities fee. Do you ­­ you agree that that would be a consequence of your theory?",
  "As opposed to ­­ what is the membership rate in ­­ in the California teachers unions? How ­­ how many are members of the union?",
  "Because you ­­ you've pointed out the membership is low in the Federal sector. But there is no bargaining about pay, right?",
  "Mr. Frederick, you didn't ask for this judgment. It was thrust on you, this judgment on the pleadings. You did say you wanted to make a record in the district court. If you had had that opportunity to develop a record, what would you have put in it?",
  "But here, the issue is, was the defendant convicted on the basis of information that wasn't in the record. And I think you would have to answer that if it's clearly established, that a conviction must be based on evidence presented at the trial ­­",
  "­­ cannot be based on evidence that the judge heard at the local bar ­­",
  "­­ for example.",
  "But what about the presumption that the judge knows and applies the law? And I don't think there's a rational judge who would think it proper to base a conviction on conjecture that has no evidentiary basis. So if we add to this that we presume the judge knows and applies the law, and that is he knows the defendant must be convicted on the basis of evidence presented in court.",
  "But that's not what ­­ what happened. The Seventh Circuit required a new trial, right?",
  "Okay. And what is the posture of this ­­ the case at ­­ at the moment?",
  "Is that ­­",
  "Is that who made this statement? The trial judge?",
  "I thought you ­­ you're conceding that there was sufficient evidence. If all there had been is these two eyewitnesses, there would be nothing you could object to. But what you're saying is that the error that this judge made in confining this motive based on evidence is not in the record, that that error had a substantial influence on the judgment that it rendered.",
  "So indeed, there was sufficient evidence, yes, but the finding of the conviction rested on an error that had ­­",
  "Could you explain how they were able to make that finding that the motive that the judge specified based on evidence that's not in the record, that that didn't have an influence?",
  "Mr. Crooks, you didn't cite 18 U.S.C. 3742(f), and I wondered why, because it reads: \"If the court of appeals determines that the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the Sentencing Guidelines, the court shall remand the case for further sentencing proceedings with such instructions as the court considers appropriate.\" So this seems to say that, if the incorrect ­­ there was an incorrect application of the Guidelines, then a remand is mandatory.",
  "The ­­ the government ­­ the government says that you are, in effect, making this standard harmless. That you ­­ you admit that this is a plain­error case, and yet, your presumption, effectively the burden is on the government, is making this into a harmless­error situation.",
  "How did this ­­ how did this error come to light? Everybody missed it in the district court. It started with the probation officer, the judge, and the defendant. How did ­­ how was it found out?",
  "So the defendant ­­ the defendant brought ­­ detected the error.",
  "It's not disputed here. Everybody missed it. You missed it, and you ­­ you were candid in saying even on appeal you were ready to file an Anders brief until the defendant himself.",
  "Who would apply ­­",
  "Who applies the first prong in the first instance? Is it ­­",
  "So you're saying that even if the court of appeals gets through the first three, it doesn't remand for the district court to ­­ to apply the fourth test. It ­­ the court of appeals does that itself?",
  "And may I just ask you to answer the government's position that if there's no presumption, it's not in your question presented so ­­ so that you will lock into the way you phrased the ­­ the question, that \"should an appellate court presume\"?",
  "Can you ­­ can you give a concrete example of what you mean? I mean, in my ­­ my intuition is the same as Justice Breyer and Justice Kagan, that if you ­­ if you apply the wrong Guidelines, then there's a reasonable probability that he would have received a lower sentence. But you say he has to show ­­ what would he have to show, concretely? Give me an example of what is a reasonable probability that he would have received a lower sentence.",
  "But in ­­ in most Sentencing Guidelines cases, certainly in this case, the judge says nothing. He's told the probation office said these are the Guidelines, and the judge says, okay. I sentence him at the bottom, period. Doesn't explain why. And there's got to be many, many Guidelines cases where that's exactly what happens. The judge doesn't explain it. We have told the judge he doesn't need to explain it if he sentences within the Guidelines. So what do you do with what I think must be the bulk of the cases where the judge just sentences within the Guidelines and says nothing one way or another to explain it?",
  "But you would agree that at least there are many cases where the judge just sentences within the Guidelines.",
  "Does it matter ­­ does it matter that this kind of error is never strategic? This is not an objection that a lawyer would deliberately hold back. This is a ­­ a lawyer making a mistake by relying on what the probation officer said. I mean, there is practically heavy reliance on that presentence report.",
  "Mr. Lamken, is it one case? I mean, this is a consolidation for purposes of reaching assets ­­ it's a consolidation of some 19 cases?",

  "Are there ­­ are there any in this category, that is, cases litigated to judgment for terrorist acts, that are not in this package of 19 cases?",
  "Mr. Lamken, can you tell me about ­­ I mean, when we set up the Iran U.S. Claims Commission, there were a lot of suits pending that had to be stopped. And that legislation told the courts, you have no choice; you must dismiss these cases.",
  "In ­­ in answer to ­­ to Justice Kennedy's question, there might be a problem, but not separation of powers. I mean, there could be an equal protection issue.",
  "Mr. Lamken, you ­­ even ­­ let's assume your argument prevails, your one­case argument prevails. There is still the open question of did TRIA statute, which was decided against you in the district court, right?",
  "So that would have to be ­­ if you succeeded on the issue that you're raising here, would have to be returned.",
  "Mr. Landau, could Congress amend 48 U.S.C. 1704, which covers Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa? Could it amend that statute and put Puerto Rico in there as well?",
  "In ­­ in the statute is ­­ it works both ways.",
  "But is there ­­ is there ­­",
  "Mr. Landau, could you finish your answer to my question? You said yes, as far as what the federal Congress can deal with, what the federal prosecutors do, but the statute works both ways. Are you saying it couldn't ­­ Congress has no power to do that with respect to Puerto Rico?",
  "You're saying it's a hard question, but you haven't given me ­­",
  "Just take the statute as it is. Just add Puerto Rico ­­",
  "­­ not telling prosecutors what to do in a particular case.",
  "Mr. Landau, we have a situation as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. I think it was two of the justices who said we're not going to get into this business about the Constitution. We think, interpreting our own double jeopardy provision, somebody should not be tried a second time. So that's going to be the law of Puerto Rico. That's ­­ if the Puerto Rico Supreme Court said that, then we would have the situation that has led us to grant cert in this case. That is, if you have a prosecution first in the Federal government, then Puerto Rico will not have a second prosecution. You have it first in Puerto Rico. The Federal government is free to institute a second prosecution.",
  "And they could. They could. If ­­ if the ­­ if we told the majority you're wrong, nothing would prevent them from agreeing with those two justices, right?",
  "Then there's no way you could break that situation of having ­­ it depends on which ­­ which jurisdiction goes first.",
  "Mr. Landau, I thought that, in the ­­ in the case of the Indian Tribes, what ­­ what the Court said is they were once sovereign before we got here and we took some of that sovereignty away. That's not the case with Puerto Rico.",
  "But the rationale was that the tribes had this sovereignty, and that's what was being respected.",
  "May I just ask you a question about that? I don't quite understand because this ­­ this whole issue is a result of a five­to­four decision of this Court in the 1950s, right? Bartkus.",
  "So ­­ so talking about cases before that, there was just ­­ there was no issue before that.",
  "Recognized how, because this was ­­ it was a very close case, as you know.",
  "And so I don't think it was settled before then.",
  "I'm questioning you looking back before the Bartkus case, for precedent.",
  "Could you explain before you sit down when and why the United States changed its position on this question? Because as I understand it, in ­­ in more than one brief, took the position that Puerto Rico, for double jeopardy cases, is ­­ for the Double Jeopardy Clause is ­­ is treated like a State.",
  "Is that an issue ­­",
  "Is that an issue ­­ is that an issue in this case? Is there any allegation that there was such a policy of neutrality that no employee could engage in political activity?",
  "You don't have the text of it, do you?",
  "The text of the New Jersey law, so we can know what we're talking about.",
  "Would you ­­ would you say that he was demoted because he gave the appearance of exercising his First Amendment rights?",
  "And those cases, Ms. Anders ­­ I missed what you said those cases were.",
  "You've brought up in your brief, I think, that ­­ that the employer might have had a contract­type policy. I think you said we should remand to determine whether this employer said nobody engages in political activity.",
  "Is it based on the facts up till now to think that there was such a policy?",
  "Can you explain, Mr. Goldstein, what sense it would make to say there are two people, the example Mr. Frost gave. One of them is a big supporter of Spagnola, and he gets demoted. And the other is politically neutral, and he gets demoted because the employer thinks he's a supporter of the rival mayoral candidate. What ­­ how could you make sense to a person of ordinary reason that one of them, the one who was in fact engaging in political activity, can't be demoted but the other one, who just was innocent, didn't do anything?",
  "Mr. Goldstein, let's take a Title VII case, and the employer fires a woman because he thinks she's pregnant. She brings a sex discrimination case and alleges, well, I wasn't pregnant. I just was gaining weight. So she has no sex discrimination claim, then, because she wasn't pregnant?",
  "It's not just something.",
  "It's ­­ the government is taking action against a person because the government thinks that that person is exercising First Amendment rights.",
  "And I thought ­­ and unlike Justice Scalia ­­ that the thrust of the First Amendment is operating on government. It says government, thou shalt not ­­ thou shalt not act on the basis of someone's expression, speech or belief.",
  "Yes, so here, the government acted. No question they demoted the person. This was a detective, and they put him back on the beat. So the government acted. Why did they act? Because they thought that this person was engaging in political activity.",
  "Why should we get to that question if, when this case began, even if you looked only to the citizenship of the trustees, there was no complete diversity?",
  "But didn't ­­ didn't ­­ Carden treated Navarro as a case where the suit was against the individual members, the individual trustees, trustees as individuals, not the trust.",
  "So I thought Carden was trying ­­ was set up ­­ if you're a corporation, that's one thing. If you're any other kind of association, we look to the members, the shareholders. I mean the ­­ the limited partners as well as the partners. Just drawing a clear line between corporations on one side, all other associations, and ­­ with the ­­ with the added notion that, if Congress wants to make it different, Congress can do that.",
  "I thought that the distinction in Carden was quite plain, that Carden was a case against the individual trustees, not against the trust. Carden did say that.",
  "On the ground that the suit there was against the individual trustees, not the trust.",
  "Why should it matter as long as it's not a corporation?",
  "Well, why should ­­ I mean, it ­­ it is the person who's invoking diversity jurisdiction has to show the diversity, and if they can't, then you sue in State court.",
  "And in this case you couldn't sue the trustees individually, right?",
  "If we ­­ if we made the law in the first place, why should we say, well, we made it, but we're not going to fix it? Let Congress fix it.",
  "What does that do to Federal right to control, whether it's titled or not, all navigable waters?",
  "From what ­­ from what you just said and from your brief, I gathered ­­ perhaps I was wrong ­­ that you are arguing for a de facto diminishment test; that is, you pointed out the area has been overwhelmingly populated by non­Indians and they ­­ they ­­ they haven't attempted before to exercise governing authority.",
  "That case didn't involve the ­­ the diminishment. Diminishment was not an issue.",
  "But that's based on what Solem said. Solem did bring up a de facto diminishment. This is on page 471 of the opinion. It says \"On a more pragmatic level, we have recognized that who actually moved onto the open reservation lands is also relevant to deciding whether a surplus land Act diminished a reservation. Where non­Indian settlers flooded into the opening portion of the reservation and the area has long since lost its Indian character, we have acknowledged that de facto if not de jure diminishment may have occurred.\" This was the theme that was picked up in Sherrill, but it's stated in Solem.",
  "And may I ­­ may I ask a preliminary question? We're talking about a liquor license or alcoholic beverage license and a sales tax on alcoholic beverages. Does the State itself impose such requirements, that is, a licensing requirement and a sales tax?",
  "When did ­­ when did this diminishment idea as a legal concept ­­ you said when Congress acted, they weren't thinking in terms of diminishment. When did diminishment become the big question?",
  "But at what point in time? Because you ­­ I thought you just made this statement that in 1882 Congress wasn't thinking in terms of diminishment.",
  "What do you mean ­­",
  "But what do you mean, Mr. Clement, of the language that I read from Solem itself which seems to fit this case?",
  "Except that it's ­­ it's presented before the Court turns to apply the principles.",
  "It's ­­ it's not ­­ it's not tied to the third factor.",
  "Limited to what?",
  "What ­­ what ­­ what does it state beside the alcohol tax ­­ sales tax? What else, on your theory, could the Tribe do in the way of governance in this area?",
  "But the ­­ the liquor tax that we're talking about is not imposed only on Indians, right? It's imposed on everybody who buys liquor in Pender.",
  "That's what ­­ what the State can do, but the State wouldn't be obliged to do that, wouldn't be obliged to provide schools?",
  "We heard about the fuel ­­ the revenue sharing of the fuel.",
  "Mr. Green, you make a point that a person's name is not suppressible, and evidence derived from just knowing the name is not suppressible. If you're right about that, then the police could stop anyone and say, whether I have reasonable suspicion or not, I want to know your name ­­ and that's not suppressible ­­ then does the warrant check, which you say is intervening circumstance. So it seems that your argument is ­­ is arming the police with asking every person what is your name and doing a warrant check.",
  "I thought you needed reasonable suspicion.",

  "Can we go on to the second piece; that is, the ambulatory surgical centers? That was not part of the last case. And your position on that is that that is a discrete claim, so it's not barred by a claim preclusion. Is that ­­ is that your position?",
  "You said you had direct evidence for 12 clinics and you were going to supply us with that ­­ those record citations later. That's ­­ understood you to say?",
  "You ­­ you had ­­ we have absorbed so much of your time with the threshold question. Perhaps you can ­­ can she have some time to address the merits?",
  "You said even if the test is undue burden, not rational basis.",
  "Well, how many women are located over 100 miles from the nearest clinic?",
  "That's ­­ that's odd that you point to the New Mexico facility. New Mexico doesn't have any surgical ­­ ASC requirement, and it doesn't have any admitting requirement. So if your argument is right, then New Mexico is not an available way out for Texas because Texas says to protect our women, we need these things. But send them off to Mexico ­­ New Mexico ­­ New Mexico where they don't get it either, no admitting privileges, no ASC. And that's perfectly all right. Well, if that's all right for the ­­ the women in the El Paso area, why isn't it right for the rest of the women in Texas?",
  "Then why should it count those clinics?",
  "What ­­ what is the benefit of the medical, the two pills that you take, what is the benefit of having an ambulatory surgical center to take two pills when there's no ­­ no surgical procedure at all involved?",
  "On that complication, that complication is likely to arise near the women's home, much more likely to arise near her home, which the 30 miles has nothing to do with.",
  "I'm not ­­ I'm not talking about the prior lawsuit; I'm talking about this lawsuit. You need to have access to a hospital within 30 miles. 30 miles of what? 30 miles of the surgical center when the woman lives at a much greater distance? And if she's going to go to any hospital, it will be in her local community, not near the surgical center.",
  "Well, I'm asking just about the medical.",
  "And ­­ and just it's ­­ I can't imagine. What is the benefit of having a woman take those pills in an ambulatory surgical center when there is no surgery involved?",
  "If it is a complication, it is not going to occur on the spot. I mean, you have to concede that in ­­ in the case of the medical abortion, the complication generally arises after the woman is back at home. And then the nearest hospital has nothing to do with the surgical center.",
  "But what is the legitimate interest in protecting their health? What evidence is there that under the prior law, the prior law was not sufficiently protective of the women's health? As I understand it, this is one of the lowest­risk procedures, and you give a horrible from Pennsylvania, but absolutely nothing from Texas. As far as we know, this is among the most safe, the least risk procedures, an early­stage abortion. So what was ­­ what was the problem that the legislature was responding to that it needed to improve the facilities for women's health?",
  "As compared to childbirth, many, many ­­ much riskier procedure, is it not?",

So how ­­ the as­applied challenge ­­ I mean, the woman's problem would be long over before this clinic, the kind of clinic they had before, could be restarted.",
  "There was a stipulation ­­ there was a stipulation that is \"No currently­licensed abortion facility meets the ASC requirements. Each will be prohibited from performing abortions after the day the law goes into effect.\" That's a stipulation, not a question of what evidence there was for. Texas stipulated that no currently­licensed facility meets ASC requirements, and each will be prohibited from performing abortions.",
  "Random ­­ Texas, under the prior law, has the right to make random inspections. Was ­­ the problem in Pennsylvania was this filthy clinic hadn't been looked at by anyone from the State in 16 years. But Texas can go into any one of these clinics and immediate ­­ immediately spots a violation? It says you can't operate till you come up to speed. So Texas has had, as Justice Kagan pointed out, its own mechanism for preventing that kind of thing from happening.",
  "Well, that's the problem. Once a clinic closes ­­ you said McCallen reopened, but that was very swift. Once a clinic closes, equipment are gone, the doctors are gone, you can't reinstate it tomorrow. It won't be there. There will be no remedy for that woman who succeeds in the as­applied challenge.",
  "May I ask you one question? You earlier in your argument, you were quoting how many women are within a reasonable range of the clinic. But don't we know from Casey that the focus must be on the ones who are burdened and not the ones who aren't burdened? There ­­ there is ­­ and the district court said, you know, this is not a problem for women who have means to travel, that those women will have access to abortion, anyway. So ­­ in Texas or out of Texas. So Casey was quite precise in this, when it's talking about husbands and notification. You don't look to all the women who are getting abortions. You look only to the ­­ to the ­­ the women for whom this is a problem. And so the only women we would be looking at is not all of the women who are ­­ who live in Austin or in Dallas, but the women who have the problem who don't live near a clinic.",
  "Isn't that the clear message of Casey and the husband notification ­­",
  "­­ exception?",
  "But this is about ­­ what it's about is that a woman has a fundamental right to make this choice for herself. That's what we sought as the starting premise. And then this is certainly about ­­ Casey ­­ Casey made that plain, that it ­­ the focus is on the woman, and it has to be on the segment of women who are affected.",
  "Is that ­­ is that undisputed? How did they preserve the core when they shifted something like 180,000 people around?",
  "Was there any holding that that preserved the core?",
  "And how can we take politics when the drafter of the plan ­­ rightly or wrongly, the drafter of the plan represented to the court, I haven't looked at partisan performance. It was not one of the factors I considered in drawing districts. Now, we have to take that. That's what the drafter of the plan said. He didn't take into account partisan performance.",
  "And as ­­",
  "As to the old district ­­ I mean, we do have a rule that ­­ District A is allegedly gerrymandered. Voters in District B can't challenge that. You have to be a voter in the district that's allegedly gerrymandered. So how is it that a voter in District 4 could not bring a challenge, but the representative of the voters in District 4 can?",
  "Wouldn't there be a basis for the legislator who said, the Department of Justice won't accept it if we go below 55 percent? Is it ­­ was there ­­ was it something she made up, or did she have some basis for that?",
  "Suppose the legislature had set the same number as what was referred to as the Benchmark Plan. Suppose, instead of making it 56.3 they kept it at 53.1, kept it exactly the same as in the ­­ the prior plan.",
  "If ­­ if the statute isn't ­­ the statute doesn't say \"domestic injury,\" does it?",

  "That is your position, right?",
  "And not the pattern. It's just that the statute gets at after the individual instance. RICO says when you have a pattern, things are a lot tougher for you.",
  "That's ­­ why isn't forum non conveniens the answer to that?

  "And a claim that could not be brought against the government. I mean, the Bivens claim was specifically saved out of the Westfall Act, so that the employee would have a Bivens claim. The Bivens claim is exclusively against the employee. There's no Bivens liability on the part of the government. So if you follow the ordinary rules of claim preclusion, there would be no preclusion here, because there was no possibility of bringing the Bivens claim against the government, and claim preclusion would apply only to claims that could have been brought. So you couldn't have brought the Bivens claim against the government. It would have to be a separate claim.",
  "No liability on the part of the Federal government under the FTCA, but it's ­­ it's no judgment at all with respect to the Bivens claim which depends on the employee's conduct. There's been no adjudication at all of the employee's conduct in the first action.",

  "But going back to that line­drawing problem ­­ and that is in a brief that's been mentioned several times, the Baptist Joint Committee ­­ our leading proponent of RFRA discusses this line­drawing problem. Do you just say that's wrong?",
  "But it would be just the same, Mr. Phillips, would it not, if the arrangement was that the aggregator gets a piece of the action? Let's take out the de minimis one cent. A significant stake, like the qui tam plaintiff has. So you would have the same problems that you're complaining about with regard to discovery from the individual PSPs, the same problem with respect to counterclaim. That's -- so it seems to me that, as Justice Scalia suggested, this isn't about a whole lot if just by the device of giving the aggregator part of the, a piece of the action, this suit would be okay because the prudential objections that you are making here would apply just as well.",
  "But --",
  "Would there be review? The FCC, you pointed out, doesn't have Article III barriers. So the FCC decides one way or another. One party ends up losing. Is there review in Federal court?",
  "What is the advantage? You have proposed the FCC route. That obviously wasn't taken here. What is the advantage of going to Federal court on claims like this?",
  "Why would the plaintiff make such a choice if the agency --",
  "But you said --",
  "You said the aggregator had -- that the aggregator could sue on behalf of these 1400 plaintiffs naming every one of them as a named plaintiff in this complaint and still the aggregator would run the show because they each authorized the aggregator to conduct the litigation.",
  "Now, it seems to me that it's not very prudential to require that there be 1400 named plaintiffs instead of one.",
  "But I thought your position was they could all join in one complaint just as long as they're all named separately.",
  "Is there any significance to this being the -- this assignment transfers legal title. True, there's an obligation to pay, to pay the separate PSPs. But does anything turn on legal title? For example, suppose the -- I gather the check would be payable to the aggregator if the aggregator prevails. Could a creditor of the aggregator come in and say, stop, you owe me lots of money and I want to reach those proceeds?",
  "No.",
  "These are just the creditors. Or the aggregator goes bankrupt.",
  "I thought it said -- I thought it said, Mr. Englert, that, that the United States has -- is treated as having assigned part of its claim for damages to the qui tam relator, and that gave the qui tam plaintiff a stake in the action, a stake in the proceeds. I thought that Vermont Agency -- and Justice Scalia will correct me if I'm wrong -- was envisioning the kind of assignment that Judge Sentelle was talking about when he said there are assignments and then there are assignments.",
  "Well, what did they do? I mean, you mention necessary parties but these other -- on your own theory the PSPs are not necessary parties, and this -- this is a defendant seeking to join additional plaintiffs, and that's rather odd. And you also talk about interpleader. I don't know who is the stakeholder in this picture.",
  "The significance --",
  "-- to the legal title, would it make a difference if the assignee did not have legal title, was just --",
  "So -- but is that just a formality? For example, the question I asked Mr. Phillips. Could a creditor of the aggregator get at this money when the check is paid by AT&T and Sprint and therefore reduce the amount available to distribute to the PSPCs?",
  "How about for tax purposes? Must the aggregator report the proceeds as income?",
  "But wouldn't you --",
  "Suppose this had been mounted as a class action. I take it you would oppose certification.",
  "And one of the reasons would be that these are all different situations, different amounts involved in each case? Some -- you would have a counterclaim, not others. I assume you would say they're not a lot alike. Not at all alike."
