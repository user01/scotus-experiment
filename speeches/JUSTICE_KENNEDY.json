  "What -- what do we look to in order to verify what -- what you've just said? Do the Michigan appellate courts catch mistakes all the time? And if so, what's the standard that they use?",
  "But what are the standards they use? Where -- where do I look to find out what standards they use, if I get there?",
  "Can you give me an example of where they grant leave to appeal, and if not -- and it's not one of the exceptions listed in the statute such as incorrect -­",

  "Well, of course, in Triplett, the attorneys themselves were subject to discipline. They were raising third party rights in order to defend a proceeding brought against themselves. It seems to me that's distinguishable.",
  "Well, just as -- as to Triplett and Boren, you can't cite those two cases and say those are controlling and then say, well, we've never held it.",
  "Well, we've said that Triplett and -- and Boren are -- are distinguishable, and you said, well, we've never ruled on this point. Well, then Triplett and Boren aren't controlling.",
  "Could -- could you give me an example, just from your experience in practice, where there's an important issue raised after a guilty plea that requires an appeal where it's not one of the statutory exceptions?",
  "Most -- what are -- what are those cases?",
  "That's not sentencing?",
  "Okay, but that's covered by the statute.",

Double jeopardy issues. Double jeopardy issues arise in Michigan all the time; whether sentences should be consecutive or concurrent; whether there's been a breach of the plea bargain.

  "Are there instances where Michigan has denied the right to appeal when those claims are raised?",
  "Did you waive the objection to prudential standing -­",
  "The paradigm that the cases discuss in Blakely and in the cases leading up to it from Apprendi, are facts such as the amount of drugs, was there a weapon, was there violence performed against the victim. And if the Court finds that these are so much like an element that they have to be proved, and adheres to its jurisprudence and invalidates the Guidelines to that effect, is there any argument that either the Government makes or that some of the commentators would make, that there are other kinds of sentencing considerations that can be called factual, to be sure, but that should be the judge: say, lack of remorse as demonstrated after the verdict; the fact that after the verdict, investigation shows that of the two defendants, one was the real ringleader, streetwise, the other was kind of a naive dupe; or that there was a failure to cooperate with the person presenting the -- preparing the sentencing report. These are facts in a certain way. Is it for a penny, in for a pound? Do we have to treat all of these as factual, or is there any progress to be made in trying to see if there are some, some facts that are, are like elements and some that are not. That would be a -- it would take a number of cases, I suppose, to elaborate that.",
  "What, what, what tests would you propose, or the commentators? How do we distinguish the permitted kind of fact that the judge can find, and those that must be for the jury?",
  "Well, have you escaped Apprendi? If discretion is cabined by guidelines and appellate courts review, for the abuse of discretion in applying those guidelines, why isn't that the same kind of entitlement that the Apprendi/Blakely opinion is predicated on to begin with?",
  "If you -- if you interpret \"court\" to mean \"jury,\" how many of the sentencing factors which will be submitted to the jury are -- would be a radical departure from the tradition, the role of the jury in the criminal system in the Anglo-American tradition?",
  "But what is your position if judges simply have complete discretion to sentence within a maximum range, and Judge A gives a lot of maximum sentences, and Judge B doesn't? Is that system constitutional?",
  "What is it in our legal tradition -- what policies are served by preferring unexplained, unarticulated, standardless discretion to a system in which the judge gives reasons and follows careful standards and follows -- and follows standards that give consistency from one sentence to the other? Why should the former be preferred? What are we doing here?",
  "What policies -­",
  "-- are being furthered by that, other than wooden adherence to Apprendi and Blakely?",
  "But isn't that, isn't that ultimately formalistic and contrary to our whole design of our system, which is to learn over experience and to codify and to explain what considerations we take into account in applying the law?",
  "So suppose, in Justice Breyer's hypothetical -- like the California indeterminate sentencing regime which applied until about 20 years ago, after an indeterminate sentence, the parole board interviews two people convicted for the same crime; one was the ringleader, street-hardened offender, and the other was just a novice, a guy that went along, although he -- they both committed the same crime. Under the California system, the former would be given a projected release date of ten years; and the other, a projected release date of about two years. Would that be constitutional?",
  "If I could just ask one more question, because this is important to me.",
  "What about the previous California system in which it was an indeterminate sentence and the correctional authority made findings which set the sentence? They were -­ they were committed to the California -­",
  "-- correctional authority for the term prescribed by law, and that was set after the fact, post hoc, by the California Adult Authority.",
  "They're not increasing it.",
  "It's an indeterminate sentence.",
  "They set the sentence.",
  "Yes. It was just sentenced, the judge, for the term prescribed by law. And an agency, after interviewing the defendant, after looking at the probation report, set the sentence. The term prescribed by law could be for life.",
  "In other words, the tradition was that we asked the jury to determine what crime was committed, and the sentencing judge to determine the context in which it was committed.",
  "Is part or all of the objectives of both the -- the decree and the 10-year model to conserve subsurface reservoirs?",
  "Well, then -- well, then why isn't -- if -- if that's so, why isn't it that Colorado shouldn't get credit for the wet years in -- in -- on an average? You're concerned about the dry years. It seems to me that Colorado should be given some credit for the wet years when the subterranean reservoirs are -- are replenished. Or am I wrong -- am I wrong about that?",
  "Well, then why are you using a 10-year model at all?",
  "It seems to me what you're -­ what you're saying is forget the 10 years. Just do it every year.",
  "What -- what relation do you or -- yes -- working relation do you anticipate, if -- if the river master is appointed, between the river master and the commission? Does he go first to the commission and try to get agreement or -­",
  "Suppose the commission decided to appoint an arbitrator. Would the special -- pardon me. Would the river master then proceed independently and we'd have two different recommendations?",
  "Well, then it would seem to me, procedurally at least, the river master would have if not the legal, at least the practical obligation to refer things first to the commission.",
  "Well, except that, as I read his report, he was simply interpreting our opinion, best he could, on the second go-round.",
  "Yes.",
  "So I'm -- I'm saying it seems to me that's your best argument, but there's a flaw in there.",
  "But we rejected that as to post-'85 damages.",
  "Counsel, your time is running short. This is very important. I think you misunderstood Justice Souter's question. He asked you to give us an example of the Kansas versus Colorado approach as to the 10-year model. You answered him about the interest. Could you -­",
  "-- could you tell us really -­",
  "Give us an example of the difference between the two.",
  "Well, but I'm interested in Justice O'Connor's point. Suppose it's a close case as to whether or not the use is in good faith and it's only discretion. With reference to good faith, suppose there's very substantial confusion that's caused by the allegedly infringing mark. Does that at least bear on a good-faith assessment? In other words, suppose that it were shown that the owner of the non-registered mark, the alleged infringing mark, used the phrase -- not the mark, but used the phrase -- deliberately in order to cause confusion. Would that -­",
  "Well, so that if you know that there's going to be confusion, there is no good faith? You wouldn't go that far.",
  "I suppose if you have a sign that says \"Park `n Fly\" and an arrow, with a capital \"P\" and a capital \"F,\" then it's arguably being used as a trademark.",
  "Whereas, if you say in a brochure, \"Rent a car from us, and park and fly,\" then that's okay. Is that the distinction?",
  "Suppose, in the Coco-quinine case, the non -- the non-holder is doing just fine without using the particular term, and then he decides, \"you know, I'm going to cut into that market, and I'm going to use the term Coco-quinine. And I'm going to do that just in order to get more customers away from the trademark-holder.\" Is that good faith?",
  "But what -­",
  "-- what if he intends to increase his market share precisely by causing the confusion? That would eliminate the good-faith element, wouldn't it?",
  "Yeah.",
  "Right.",
  "No, but that, all we need to decide this case is to assume that it's descriptive.",
  "Let's assume that it was descriptive, would the Ninth Circuit test still apply? That you would have to show absence of confusion before you raised the good faith defense?",
  "Well, would you agree, then, that in a case where the mark is descriptive, the non­ trademark holder, the defendant in the case, can raise the fair-use defense without having to show that there's no confusion?",
  "You -- you were in the midst of telling us why the -- there is a consensus now that it's inappropriate to execute anyone under 16, and I -- I -- you weren't -­",
  "You couldn't finish that answer. I want to know it.",
  "And -- and so you say there's -- there's not so much as a consensus as an understanding of what that decision means.",
  "Let -- let me ask you this. I -- I don't yet have the -- the record showing the full closing argument of -- of both sides, but we do have the portion where the prosecutor says, isn't this scary? Can adolescence ever be anything but mitigating?",
  "But that's not how the prosecution presented it to the jury.",
  "He said -- he -- he almost made it aggravating. Isn't that scary? I don't have the -- I don't have the full argument.",
  "Well, that's somewhat --",
  "Let -- let's focus on the word unusual. Forget cruel for the moment, although they're both obviously involved. We've seen very substantial demonstration that world opinion is -- is against this, at least as interpreted by the leaders of the European Union. Does that have a bearing on what's unusual? Suppose it were shown that the United States were one of the very, very few countries that executed juveniles, and that's true. Does that have a bearing on whether or not it's unusual?",
  "I -- I acknowledged that in -­ in my question. I recognize it is the leadership in many of these countries that objects to it. But let us -- let us assume that it's an accepted practice in most countries of the world not to execute a juvenile for moral reasons. That has no bearing on whether or not what we're doing is unusual?",
  "Do we -- do we ever take the position that what we do here should influence what people think elsewhere?",
  "You -- you thought that Mr. Jefferson thought that what we did here had no bearing on the rest of the world?",
  "Well, in fact, the American Psychological Association is not your brief. You're not accountable for inconsistencies there. But I -- I would like your comment. They came to us in Hodgson v. Minnesota, as I think the State quite correctly points out, and said that with reference to the age for determining whether the child could have an abortion without parental consent, that adults -- that they -- that they were risk -- that they could assess risk, that they had rational capacity, and they completely flip-flop in this case.",
  "Is that just because of -- is that just because of this modern evidence?",
  "Well -- well, surely at the trial, you could have had a psychiatrist testify to all the things that are in your -- in your brief, and in fact the -- it would be another argument, but maybe the -­ maybe the finding was deficient on that ground as well.",
  "Well, he could have cited all the -- all the authorities you cite in your brief.",
  "Suppose -- suppose that all of the things set forth in your brief were eloquently set forth by a psychiatrist to the jury. Could the jury then weigh these things that you're telling us?",
  "But -- but if you're reluctant to give it dispositive weight in an individual case, then you come in and ask us to give it dispositive weight as a general rule, that seems to me inconsistent.",
  "Well, suppose -- suppose I -­ I were not convinced about your scientific evidence was conclusive and I don't identify a clear consensus. Do you lose the case, or can you then make the same argument you just made appealing to some other more fundamental principle that Stanford was just wrong?",
  "I have -- I have one other question I'd like to ask because it's been troubling me and I want your comment. A number of juveniles run in gangs and a number of the gang members are over 18. If we ruled in your favor and this decision was given wide publicity, wouldn't that make 16-, 17-year-olds subject to being persuaded to be the hit men for the gangs?",
  "I'm -- I'm very concerned about that.",
  "I'm talking about the deterrent value of the existing rule insofar as the 16­ and 17-year-old. If -- if we rule against you, then the deterrent remains.",
  "Well, there were a number -- a number of cases in the Alabama amicus brief, which is chilling reading -- and I wish that all the people that sign on to the amicus briefs had at least read that before they sign on to them -- indicates that often the 17-year- old is the ringleader.",
  "Well, are -- are you saying that if an alien on -- who seeks admission and is denied admission and is at Ellis Island or the JKF Airport, that the Attorney General is -- does not have to consult 1231(a)(6)?",
  "But if -- if there's a statute that directs you with reference to a class, that statute is applicable, and this person is within that class. So how can you tell us we can't go or that we needn't go to 1231?",
  "Well, it might be exclusive constitutionally, but the Congress has acted.",
  "And once it's acted, you're controlled.",
  "Well, what you're saying is that even if 1182 comes first, 1231 comes second.",
  "You want us to take -­",
  "You want us to take judicial notice that the Mexican border and American border is impervious?",
  "Well, it's a policy decision either way. I -- I suppose if Zadvydas had come out the other way, the Congress could have responded as well.",
  "Didn't it come from the west -- did it come from the west coast originally?",
  "And then what is the standard you use, the definition to use to get to that result? Is this your practically point again?",
  "You've given us the answer. What's the standard that you use to get to that answer? Do you go back to the definition that it -- it cannot practicably be used?",
  "And then -- and then the riverboat -- it depends on how -- how permanently it's affixed to the land. Suppose it stays there for 10 years. It -- it can go anytime, but it stays there for 10 years.",

  "Is there any argument -- you -- you said at the outset that it has to be an itemized deduction subject to the two percent rule even if we set aside the alternative minimum tax. Is that conceded by everyone, or does somebody -- do some people say this is an ordinary and necessary expense? I know it's not your business, but it seems to me an ordinary and necessary expense to recover the -- the -- for employment discrimination, which is really part of your work. I don't know why -- is it -- does everybody agree that this is subject to the 2 percent rule?",
  "I -- I can't get out of my mind in this case that the mechanics of the particular case may control. I know we need a national rule and so forth. My recollection is that in some States when there is a settlement or a judgment paid under a case where there's a contingency fee contract, the check is made out both to the attorney and to the client and is put in the attorney's client's trust account. So the client never has control over it.",
  "Let's assume that that's true in most of the States.",
  "So in a very real -- in -- in a very real sense, in a -- in the legal sense, the client just doesn't have control.",
  "Well, he -- he did or he didn't, but there was no money there. There was nothing there.",
  "Other -- other than the mercy of the Internal Revenue Service.",
  "Well, but doesn't -- doesn't that indicate --",

  "This is not income in any -­ in any real sense.",
  "What -- so what -- what about the talent scout who tells the celebrity that he'll take 10 percent of the celebrity's movie proceeds or the management search person that's going to take a -- a third of the executive's pay for the first 6 months? Where -­ are all -- all these cases ones in which there -- there's no income to the -- to the principal, we'll call them?",
  "I think probably what's -- what's one of the problems here is that the reason this is income is it relates to employment. And I don't see why hiring the attorney to get that income is not an ordinary and necessary business expense under what used to be section 162. That may be part of the problem. Do you agree that it's not an ordinary and necessary business expense?",
  "I mean, I suppose that's the reason -- that's the reason why it's taxable to begin with, is it relates to employment. If I hire an attorney because I'm wrongfully discharged and I get -- I get my job back, it seems to me that's an ordinary and necessary business expense. That -- that's why -- one of the reasons I have problems with this.",
  "Well, let me get -- get to a different point. It -- it does seem to me that we -- we have to be very careful in this case not to distort the revenue law for other transactions that are not before the Court. And the -- the natural extension of your position is that anytime when the taxpayer enters into an agreement with an agent to pay the agents an amount contingent on the success of the venture, that it's not income, that -- that the -- that the payment is not income to the principal. And I just can't accept it.",
  "But what's the difference in principle. I don't understand the difference in principle when we're talking about who has the income. It's the first thing you ask in -- in a first-year -- in -- in your -- in your first class in tax. Where is the income? Who gets the income?",
  "Under -- under your view -­",
  "-- suppose that the attorney is -- is waiting for payment of -- of his, say, one-third contingent fee, and the client just absconds with the money. How is -- what -- what happens from a tax standpoint under your theory? I take it the attorney has to declare the income on his return and then declare a loss?",
  "I'm asking you about the tax consequences.",
  "Well, but I -- I thought under your view the moment the client gets the check for the full amount, one-third of it is taxable to the attorney. And I have some problems, incidentally, with respect to tax years if it -- if you -- if the client receives the check December 30 and is on vacation and doesn't get around to remitting to the attorney until January 5th, I'm -- I'm not quite sure how your theory works, but -­",
  "But on the absconding theory, how -- how is it handled from a tax standpoint?",
  "That -- that would be the same with the theater agent or the commission agent.",
  "Well, you could say the same thing for the talent scout.",
  "Your client, in effect, earned the money by having this -- undergo this -- this discrimination. That -- that's -­",

  "Suppose you were to prevail in this case and a court were to enter a decree forbidding this practice.

  "Suppose you have a population in which 50 percent of all the members of a particular race are a member of a -- of a gang, a gang such as we've read about in -- in the record, Bloods, Crips, et cetera. 50 percent are members of the gang. Would that allow you to segregate?",
  "Is -- is that because you don't equate race gangs with race animosity?",
  "And -- because it does seem to me that part of your submission, or at least an inference that I drew, was that race-based gangs do not constitute race-based threats. Am I right in saying that that's your submission?",
  "You mean the inference that the -- which inference? That they are or are not a threat?",
  "-- assume that a gang poses an interracial threat?",
  "I -- I asked -- I asked about gang membership. Can gang membership be equated with an interracial threat in any significant number of -- of gangs?",
  "All right. Now -- now suppose -- I didn't mean to intrude on Justice Breyer, but just following this question, suppose that 50 percent of all the inmate population in a particular small prison is a member of one of these gangs. Then could you segregate on account of race?",

  "As -- as a matter of Federal law.",

  "Well, you -- you equate this to a case where the defendant is just accidentally not present. That's -- that's what I got. I -- I had the same problem with your opening two sentences as Justice Ginsburg did. You said if the defendant is absent from the courtroom. Well, in this case, he was absent because he chose to be absent. You're -- you're equating this case to one in which it was as if for some reason they forgot to have him in the courtroom.",
  "I don't know why you're so -­ I thought that the literature was replete with Law Review articles saying that this is the best strategy. Trial judges have told us this is the best strategy. I -- I don't quite understand your hesitation unless it's to build in this -- this factor of consent.",
  "I -- I thought this -- this was something you'd say, well, of course.",

  "No. Well, but -- but Justice Scalia's point -- and I -- I think he's correct -- is that this cuts at least as much in favor of the Government as you and probably more because you would make Federal and State unnecessary surplus.",
  "You don't -- you don't set forth the main qualification to the main definition in a -- in a later subsection.",
  "Well, if it's a -- if it's a matter of notice and -- then that's a separate issue. Plus the Government, it seems to me, should put on its form that this includes foreign conviction, and that solves that problem.",

Then he finds out the driving charge is no good. It can't stand. But then they look at his wallet more carefully and they see the permit is expired. What -- what rule then? At the police station, they -- they see the permit is expired. In other words, they find out a fact after -- after they arrested him.",
  "So you would confine the rule to what the officer has seen at the time of the arrest.",
  "Okay. What's -- what's happening here is in order to avoid the down side of your test -- as Justice O'Connor puts it, her point is that if we adopt your rule, there's going to be an incentive not to state the reason. Now, in order to avoid that -- you haven't really squarely confronted it -- I think you're suggesting that there has to be an additional rule that the police officer must say why he's arrested, and -- and the authorities just don't establish that. Now, if you want us to go on and make up that rule, I suppose we could make up that rule.",
  "And I'm -- I'm sure you'd be delighted. But that's not the case we're confronted with. And if the choice is between making up a new rule to make your test work or rejecting your test, it seems to me that the -- that the latter might be the preferred course.",
  "Under Washington law, is it lawful for your client to have headlights -- wig-wag lights?",
  "But it's unlawful to have wig­ wag lights, and I take it it's an arrestable offense to impersonate a police officer.",

  "Suppose -- suppose in the earlier conviction, the police report is in the court. It's not part of the record, and then the court says, I've read the police report. Is that accurate?

  "But -- but why can you look at what's in the plea colloquy that's in the record, but you cannot look at a document that the judge referred to, if that document isn't there? What's -- what's the common sense argument that you're making? I -- I don't understand it.",
  "No. This is my little hypothetical case so that we can test your theory, just to see the reasons that you're advancing for -- for us to rule in your favor. And I -- I don't see any rationale that you've given us.",
  "But -- but why can't you go one step further and refer to the document that was not in the record but that the judge mentioned in his -- in his findings at the first sentencing? Why? I still haven't had a reason why.",
  "But you -- you still haven't given a reason, other than the one Justice Souter accepts. Look it. This is a case where we all know what the truth is, but you want to argue that we shouldn't find that out. And it seems to me you have to give us a rationale for we shouldn't know the truth here. You -- you don't want us to find it, and there must be some reasons for that. And the law does that once in a while. We all know that something happened, but the law is supposed to pretend it didn't. That's why Justice has a blindfold on. I -- I know that. But you haven't given me one reason yet why I should adopt your theory.",

  "I don't know what we're supposed to do.",
  "So you want us to write the opinion that we can presume that what's in the State investigative files and records was likely before the trial court? I -- I'd like to know what --",
  "I don't know what I'm supposed to write.",
  "I don't want to get ahead of you in taking us through the statute, so you can defer the question if -- if you choose. But it seems to me relevant to (a). Does -- is -- is part of the submission that the Government used some of the funds that otherwise would have gone to you for its own monitoring and -- of -- of health contracts and that that's what's in dispute? Or was it just general overhead for other programs it used?",
  "I -- I stated an or. I -­ what I -- I stated at the outset?",
  "Including contract monitoring.",
  "But further to Justice Scalia's point, don't the contracts in question themselves contain clauses that say this is not a procurement contract?",
  "Oh, the act says that they're not procurement contracts.",
  "Didn't the tribes get notice they might not get the full amount of the -- the CSC, and so they had ample opportunity to cut back on their spending?",
  "So these -- these are reliance damages in a sense.",
  "I mean, they -- they were out of pocket for money they spent before they knew, other than the statutory notice they had, that they wouldn't get the full amount?",
  "Well, you did say the -- these contracts were unique.",
  "Well, the Government says it's unique because the tribes are providing governmental services. It doesn't really cite us a case where, say, a city or a subdivision has sued under a contract.",
  "But -- but I thought the submission of the petitioners' counsel was that some of these funds were used to monitor the contracts which are functions the tribes could have performed. So is there a factual disagreement here?",
  "You're not saying -- you're addressing not what was contracted out, but what funds are available.",
  "That's where your argument is going.",
  "Is the rationale for the rule that enforcement of taxes is so unpopular that we want to minimize the exposure to -- of our judges so that they - - the only thing they have to do is enforce taxes that - - that are paid to our own Government? I'm serious about that. Is that the rationale?",
  "But you would come to that conclusion even if we had a reciprocal enforcement agreement. If this were Country X, where we did have a reciprocal enforcement agreement, you'd come to the same conclusion, no prosecution under this statute.",
  "So, in a sense, the revenue position is irrelevant to your -- to your secondary or your -- or your independent argument on statutory construction. The revenue rule is irrelevant to it.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I think the Government has an interest in saying, \"Look, if you're going to smuggle, have your scheme up there in Canada; don't use our wire systems for fraudulent purposes. We don't like that here.\"",
  "Well, they -- of course, they say that this covers it, and it seems to me that really the -- that turns on the definition of \"property\" - -",
  "-- which is an arguable point.",
  "Well, why isn't the motive irrelevant here? We don't want our facilities to be used for criminal activity.",
  "Any more than in the -- in the hypothetical we don't want citizens beaten up on our soil.",
  "You could say the same thing if it were a building fraud. Suppose there were contractors building a Canadian building for the Canadian Government and they had a big fraud scheme down here, and it was to deprive the Canadian Government of money? I think the statute would clearly apply.",
  "Well, do we take -- do we take the case on the assumption that the trial court erred in not giving a curative instruction and in saying, well, this is a matter for the attorneys to argue? You -- you don't argue about what a statute means. That's a question of law. You don't argue that. You can argue the facts, that it's mitigating or not mitigating or that it's extenuating or not extenuating, which is I think how you can interpret a lot of this. But it -- it seems to me that the trial judge does make a mistake when he says, well, well, this is for the -- this is for them to argue when the -- the point of the objection was that there was a misinterpretation of the instruction. That's a legal point.",
  "Well, I -- I can see that a - - a prosecutor could say, you know, this isn't factor (k) evidence, as a way of saying that this evidence is of little weight. He did say at -- at one -- at one time, you have not heard any legal evidence of mitigation, and -- and that -- that's the troublesome part.",
  "Well, but just on that point, if the prosecutor makes a misstatement, doesn't the trial judge have an obligation to correct it if it's significant?",
  "Or am I wrong? Or am I wrong about that? The judge just kind of watches the ship sail over the waterfall?",
  "Did the judge instruct the jury that you are to consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial?",
  "Oh, are you taking the position that as a matter of California procedure, the jury was entitled to consider matters that -- matter that was not within (a) through (k)?",
  "Have the California courts said that?",
  "Have the California courts said that (a) through (k) are -- is not intended to be exhaustive at the pre-Payton -- pardon me. Yes. Have they said that pre-Payton?",
  "I -- I thought the case was being argued to us -- correct me if I'm wrong -- on -- on the theory that this was factor (k) evidence.",
  "Has factor (k) been supplemented with a CALJIC instruction since Payton?",
  "Excuse me. Do they still call it factor (k) or do they just have a supplemental instruction that follows factor (k)?",
  "And what was the question?",
  "Well, an equal inference is they just felt that it was entitled to no weight at all given the horrific nature of this -- of this crime.",
  "And you have to show there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury might have come to an opposite conclusion.",
  "Well, on -- on that point - - and I -- I recognize it's -- it's not nearly as clean as the hypothetical you present -- he did say -- this is the prosecutor. The law in its simplicity is that if the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, the sentence should be death, and so let's just line these up, and then he talks about the -- the conversion. So there were other parts of his argument that indicated by one interpretation this is not mitigating under special (k) - - under factor (k). But here he does say that you line that up and you weigh one against the other.",
  "Well, they -- they always have to say whether or not we're going to really weigh this or is it just too tangential, and that's one way of saying, well, this really isn't mitigating. And we know as lawyers that it is mitigating in a sense that is -- that is relevant and that it's there for the jury to give it the weight that it chooses. But jurors say, well, you know, this -- this just is not important is what they're saying.",
  "Well, it's a shorthand for saying it doesn't fall under (k) because it just is of so little weight. Now, that's I think how the jury might have interpreted it.",
  "I -- I see where you're going, and I -- I see that there's some parallel. The problem in Penry was that the jury -- the jurors had to actually violate their instructions, and you have to escalate your argument a bit before you get to that point.",
  "Could you help me on that? I thought it was two steps. I thought the question is whether there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury was misled, and then you have to ask whether it was unreasonable for the State supreme court to conclude that there was that reasonable likelihood. Or correct me if I'm wrong.",
  "But you can't overturn it on habeas unless there's a reasonable likelihood.",
  "You -- you answered one of the earlier questions about the possible intrusiveness of dogs everywhere by saying, well, you don't have a privacy interest in contraband, but that's never true. You don't have a privacy interest in the murder victim's body, but you still have to have a warrant to go in and get it. So that -- that just doesn't work unless I missed something.",
  "Yes, but you have a privacy interest in your person and in your place, and that's what we're talking about. So that seems to me that that just doesn't help us.",
  "But that's because of the nature of the place being searched not because of the nature of what you're searching for.",
  "So it just can't be that -- so the fact that you don't have a privacy interest in contraband, it doesn't seem to me -- I -- I don't think you need that argument.",
  "Do you have any authority for that other than Justice Scalia's speculation about how this - -",
  "-- how his Kyllo case might have been written?",
  "Well, do we -- we don't have the probable cause question before us, do we?",
  "Well, so you think if this were a house, that the Kyllo case would apply?",
  "Did you come here - -",
  "Did you come here having researched all about dogs in 1790?",
  "So you -- you give no significance to the fact that this dog sniff was in the course of a lawful stop where the citizen's rights had already been curtailed to a significant extent?",
  "What about a policeman who smells marijuana coming out of a car or a residence. He's walking down the street, public street, and he smells marijuana.",
  "But that never - -",
  "I suppose some -- one answer to that case is the Perez case, with loan sharking.",
  "And is - -",
  "-- this a harder or easier case than Wickard when we know that, in Wickard, it was lawful to buy and sell wheat, and, here, it is unlawful to buy and sell marijuana?",
  "Does this make your case easier, in a sense, or - -",
  "If we rule for the Respondents in this case, do you think the street price of marijuana would go up or down in California?",
  "Well, on your first point, can't we infer from the fact that there's an enormous market, commercial market, for any given commodity, that simple possession of that commodity is a form of participation in the market?",
  "Well, but it's fungible.",
  "Well, I should have thought that regular household chores of -- say, performed in an earlier time mostly by women, was classically economic - - washing dishes, making bread. And now you say growing marijuana isn't?",
  "Thirty-four million.",
  "Are prescriptions, under California law, limited only to those people with life- threatening illnesses?",
  "Justice Souter was -- was a State court judge as well.",
  "But I still don't understand your answer to Justice Stevens' question. I had the -- I had the same problem. The evidence of robbery here was circumstantial, strong, but still circumstantial based on his earlier statements that he was going to make a sting, I think he said, and then the witness saw him outside the window and -- and he stopped the car. And I take it, he didn't take the stand and say, I stopped the car to ask for directions or something. But still it's -- it's - - that's certainly a jury issue as to whether there was a robbery.",
  "But -- but would the State of Mississippi take the position that if there was no robbery, there was no crime in this case - -",
  "-- when a man is shot and killed?",
  "No. I'm talking about just Mississippi law. You're the prosecutor saying, we -- we may not get robbery here. The -- is that the only thing they charge is robbery or let the man go after he shoots and kills the person he doesn't even know?",
  "And if you don't know someone, then it's not murder?",
  "I don't understand.",
  "Well, let -- let me ask -- ask you this. Knowing what we know now, we have the record, we have the benefit of hindsight, we know the evidence, in your view now what would have been the closest lesser- included offense for which an instruction might have been sought?",
  "Well, it seems to me that works against you because it takes away from the jury the option of saying, well, we'll convict him of a serious offense, but we'll be sure not to give him a capital offense. So that -- it seems to me that that argument then works against you.",
  "Well, your -- were the two principal lesser-included offenses in -- in your view your D-13 and D-18 that are in the appendix?",
  "Of course, the question is whether -- that -- that may be true, but there would be an administrative remedy. The question here is a private cause of action for damages.",
  "Even -- even assuming the - - the validity of your premise, you still have another step.",
  "But -- but that's again the question of the substantive scope of the provision, and that's different from whether there was a congressional intent to create a private cause of action for this sort of violation. And was it -- Virginia Bankshares and so forth tells us that this is not the heyday of prior cause of actions anymore. You have to show that there's a congressional intent in the Spending Clause to create a private cause of action for damages.",
  "And that's -- that's quite separate from - -",
  "-- from this -- from the question of substantive liability.",
  "Well, you're saying the coach cares more about it than the Government does?",
  "Well, if -- if the Government is charged with -- with just spending the funds and doesn't think that this is worth its time, why should there be a private cause of action - -",
  "-- when -- when a private cause of action is harder for us to imply than it -- than it is to an administrative remedy?",
  "They have been under title VI?",
  "And we certainly did not with a Spending Clause case.",
  "But what about Virginia - -",
  "What about Virginia Bankshares?",
  "If it were just money laundering, could you charge under 371?",
  "Yes, but -- but it is true you have a strong textual - -",
  "I was a little bit surprised at your opening because it seems to me you have a strong textual argument you're now defending.",
  "What does a holistic reading mean? Can you stay within the - -",
  "-- text and still be holistic?",
  "So the antonym would be parsimonious or something like that?",
  "Well, let -- let me ask - -",
  "-- ask you this. The -- the statute does say that the right to receive a payment is on account of age, and that seems to me to be an argument somewhat in respondent's favor because the -- the payment has to be triggered by the age, if you read it that way, and it seems to me that's a fair way to read it.",
  "Right, and that's not - -",
  "What -- what do the courts do if they say, well, my client might be ill or something like that? It seems to me - -",
  "No, no. They -- they say my client is able-bodied now, but we -- we need something because -- I don't know -- there's a history of family illness or something.",
  "I still don't have your answer to the problem that bothered me at the first. How -- how do you reconcile your positions with on account of language? If the -- if your clients can take the money - - just take the money out of the IRA at any time, then why is it on account of age?",
  "So you say that payment doesn't -- on account of doesn't modify payment.",
  "Well, I -- I think the logical reading is that it -- it modifies payment.",
  "Yes, but -- but there still is a right to take payments at any time.",
  "So -- so then you're - - you're - -",
  "Under that, you're giving the -- the language that follows it no meaning.",
  "But under Justice Breyer's hypothetical, that's just like a savings account.",
  "Well, suppose you have a State and the State has a statute, and the statute says any motion for acquittal may be granted by the -- the trial court at the close of the prosecution's evidence, but that motion shall not be deemed final and may be reviewed by the district court at any time before -- or by the trial court at any time before the submission of the case to the jury. Then there's no repose element because the -- the defendant is on notice that this may not be final. What would be the -- your position in that case if a statute like that were on the books? And if you say that that's different, then I'll say, well, suppose the supreme court of Massachusetts just makes up this rule as a judicial matter.",
  "Okay, well, let -- let's just assume that you've conceded that. Now, you've been guarded about it. If we can do that by statute, why can't we do that by a judicial decision by the supreme court of -- Judicial Court of Massachusetts?",
  "Well, but they put a gloss on the rule by their decision.",
  "Well, but if -- if -- you know, we shape the expectation by what we say. If -- if we say that a judge is always free to consider his ruling and as long as the -- there's a right to reopen, then any kind of reliance is -- is misplaced.",
  "Did the defendant here ask to be -- to have the right to reopen?",
  "The minute - -",
  "-- the minute he - -",
  "Is -- is another -- is another difference -- and I don't know if this -- is another difference that in the hypothetical case with the jury, the jury has not yet deliberated - -",
  "-- in order to consider the facts.",
  "Whereas in your --",
  "-- your case, the -- the judge is -- is - -",
  "-- apparently deliberating - -",
  "Well, under -- under that view of things, suppose in this -- in this case there's a motion for acquittal and the judge says, yes, I -- I think there's no evidence on the gun. Then the prosecutor says I want 10 minutes because I think there's a case on it. Then he says, you know, there's a case and I think it covers this, and the judge says, well, I think you may be wrong. I'll let you reopen to put on evidence of -- of the gun. What would -- what would be the result in that case?",
  "I think you have to say that under your view.",
  "Would -- would you allow a trial judge to reopen -- to -- to permit the prosecution to reopen the case?",
  "You had three -- three reasons you were going to give Justice Souter. One is it's not clear always that it's definitive. The other is that trial judges do make mistakes, and the third is?",
  "Your line would be something like if it -- if -- from all of the transcript, it appears that the judge is -- is giving consideration to the entire case or something like that in a bench trial.",
  "Can you tell us why -- why is it still live when they -- when they already received a second hearing? Or why is not moot?",
  "What would you do if there was an allegation of a serious procedural flaw in a past hearing? The parole commission was -- was drunk or they read the wrong file or something, and it was just a challenge to the invalidity of the past hearing. Would that be 1983 or habeas?",
  "That's why asked you. Why isn't it --",
  "Well, but -- but that's part of the conclusion that we're going to have to reach to - - to resolve the case. Why isn't he? How is that that much different than if a judge -- let's assume, under a proper sentencing guideline scheme, the judge just uses the wrong guideline. The man is going to go to jail for either 5 or 10 years. We don't know which. But that's -- that's a classic habeas case. Here, he's going to stay in a prison for 5 or 10 years. We don't know which. Why isn't this a classic habeas case?",
  "Well, it wouldn't completely invalidate the sentence. We know that he's still going to be held and he's going to be held in custody. It's a question of how long, which is exactly what this case is.",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not sure. It depends how you formulate the order. The -- the judge says, I'm going to order this prisoner released unless, within 6 months, he has a parole hearing under the guidelines I set. That's the way the habeas statute works.",
  "Well, he might --",
  "-- he might shorten the term of his confinement.",
  "Well, you could say the same thing when you're challenging the sentence. He might but he might not. We're just -- we're just hearing the case.",
  "You want a 1983 hearing in which a United States district judge tells the parole commission, now, here are your marching orders for future cases. You have to comply with this rule, that rule, this rule. What is an analog that you can give us where United States courts have done this under 1983? Using an administrative case, if the -- if the agency does it the wrong way, we reverse that decision. It would be like a review of a conviction that's not final. Have we had cases where under 1983 litigants come in and say, now, these agencies are doing it the wrong way? You have to - - can you give me an analog?",
  "Well, what's your position as to whether or not it's moot?",
  "Were there any -- were there any State decisions, or Federal court decisions for that matter, justifying the shuffle on the grounds of -- I don't know -- professional class versus working class or something like that?",
  "Were there -- were there any State court cases said that -- or even in that case you're referring to -- that the shuffle usually is race-based?",
  "If -- if we find or if there is a finding that the -- that the attempted shuffle on this fifth try was race-based, does that win your case, even though the shuffle didn't take place?",
  "I mean, does it show the necessary animus so that it carries through the whole case?",
  "Well, now, Nelson -- there's Macaluso?",
  "Macaluso and Nelson. Nelson wasn't involved in the jury selection in this case, was he? He came in - -",
  "I thought he came in after - - after the jury had been selected.",
  "Suppose that you have 10 white jurors and 10 black jurors. The 10 black jurors are all questioned much more extensively by the State, and in each of those cases, there is a plausible reason for excusing. A relative was -- served time and so forth. Violation?",
  "So -- so then you admit that you have to go one by one. I had thought you would - - would have said that if the black jurors are questioned in a different way and more intensively, that alone suffices even though the questioning in each case disclosed the basis, plausible, non-racial basis - -",
  "-- for excusing them.",
  "Would -- would the statement that you gave -- let's assume there was a -- a working premise that blacks were more -- were less inclined to impose the death penalty. Would that alone justify more intensive questioning of every black juror?",
  "And suppose -- suppose you have a system in which that attempt to find cause is applied much more rigorously to black prospective jurors than to white prospective jurors.",
  "No. The -- the white jurors don't express the views at all because they're not questioned intensively, so you don't know if there's cause for them or not. But the black jurors are questioned intensively, and you find cause or -- or a -- a race- neutral reason for the dismissal. Is there a Batson violation in -- in that instance?",
  "So -- so you say that in any case you can question black jurors more intensively than white jurors and still succeed in excusing them if the result of that voir dire shows some race-neutral basis.",
  "Suppose -- suppose you have a manual of -- from the district attorney's office that says all black jurors shall be questioned more intensively than white jurors.",
  "Well, on -- on that point, this is not exactly like McDonnell Douglas, Burdine where you have some prima facie case, the person was equally qualified, but was of a different gender than the one that got the job, and then the -- you go back to square one. Here, the prima facie case is immensely powerful because of the culture of discrimination in the manuals and so forth, and that -- that, it seems to me, stays in this case.",
  "Is -- is there any - -",
  "Well, were the -- were the cues on the card similar to the instructions in the manual?",
  "Can you quantify the correlation or lack of correlation for me?",
  "Wasn't that 2 months?",
  "Well, under your view, could the three-tier system, itself, be challenged by a New Jersey wholesaler wanting to sell in New York, or a New York wholesaler wanting to sell in New Jersey?",
  "So, under your view, the whole three-tier system has to go down?",
  "Well, under my hypothetical. I don't know exactly how -- the way it works, you have to be a New York wholesaler to sell to a New York retailer. Under your view, a New Jersey wholesaler could sell to a New York retailer.",
  "But so far as -- the rationale is the same.",
  "It seems to me that, under your rationale, that that in-state licensing system has to fall if there's a New Jersey wholesaler.",
  "Well, it's not only temperance, but it's control over revenues. Can you tell me, is the -- is there a New York State excise tax on alcohol?",
  "And is it collected by the wholesaler?",
  "All right. What is it, ten dollars a gallon, or what?",
  "Is it on one -­",
  "It is on one -­",
  "Under our cases, can the California winery be required to remit the tax to the New York State revenue authorities?",
  "Is that consistent with Quill?",
  "But does the federal authority make a routine audit to see that the state tax has been paid?",
  "Well, it's very narrow, but the rationale is sweeping, and that's why I asked. I just don't know if the in-state licensure system, which is the cornerstone of the three-tier distribution system, can survive under your rationale, assuming the hypothetical where a New Jersey wholesaler has all of the -- you know, the physical facilities and so forth that the New York wholesaler does.",
  "Well, I know, but what -­",
  "-- but you're -- all you're asking is for a rationale that's sweeping.",
  "Well -­",
  "-- well, they do today, I'm sure, but -­",
  "Ms. Sullivan -­",
  "-- may I -- may I -- I just want to clarify one point. It was just -- the question Justice Stevens asked. It's your position that if Michigan allows Michigan wines to be sold and possessed and consumed, that it must also allow out-of-state wine to be sold, possessed, and consumed. Would -­",
  "That is your -­",
  "Commerce Clause, in effect, protects consumers in states from entrenched business interests that want to have protectionism, and you're -­ you object to that and invoke the Commerce Clause to do it. Under that rationale, aren't all the California reciprocity laws invalid, as well?",
  "Well, but I think what's fairly implied in Justice O'Connor's question, you have to look at the language of Bacchus, and the language of Bacchus, in effect, restored the anti-discrimination component of the Commerce Clause to liquor control. I think that's a fair and necessary reading of the case. Now -­",
  "And I know it -­",
  "-- involved pineapple wine and all that. I know that, but -­",
  "-- what we're talking about is the language of the Court in that case.",
  "Well, then you have to understand Young in the light of its context, where there was no discrimination -­",
  "Well, let me ask, once we accept the proposition -- I think this is the necessary reading of Bacchus -- that the Commerce Clause applies to liquor and prevents discrimination, it seems to me it's just like any other commodity -- food, milk, et cetera -­ and, in this case, you have a very substantial burden to show that this discriminatory treatment is justified -­ maybe strict scrutiny, maybe heightened scrutiny. And this trial has occurred. You have had that opportunity. I don't see why you have a right to go back.",
  "Do you think -­",
  "-- that Michigan can prohibit the importation of any wine, but still allow its own wine to be produced, sold, and consumed?",
  "Well, you --",
  "-- you say further than that; you say the purpose was to allow that the states discriminate in favor of home industry, if it chooses.",
  "Well, we've also said that mere protectionism is permitted.",
  "Do you -- do you take the position that your colleague on your same side takes, that a state can permit only the sale, consumption, and -- of its own wines, and bar all out-of-state wines?",
  "No -­",
  "-- just for local protectionism.",
  "It's just for local protectionism. We want to promote our wines, and not anybody else's.",
  "Well, I'm trying to understand what your -­",
  "-- what your theory is. And so you are in agreement with your colleague that this could be done, if New York chose. You can only drink New­ York-grown wines in -- sell and consume -- in the state of New York.",
  "But it also goes to the very core of the Commerce Clause. And there are really two classifications of dormant Commerce Clause cases. One is -- and I think it's an improper use of the term \"dormant clause\" -- is where there's discrimination. Only the Congress can allow discrimination against out-of-state products. That's one whole classification. And that's what's -- and that's what's involved here.",
  "Can you make the argument that -- maybe you can't -- that the special trial judge can go to the Tax Court judge, with the permission of the chief judge, and say, now, here's what -- kind of what I'm thinking? It's not my report, but here's what I'm thinking. And then the -- the Tax Court judge says, well, why don't you have some more findings on X and Y and Z? He says, okay, and then he goes back. Can you make the argument that that first document is not the report?",
  "Well, I guess another way of saying it is, do the rules permit any consultation before the report is submitted? I -- I guess that's my question.",
  "Let -- let me ask this question, if I may. Suppose the -- a special trial judge hears the witnesses, makes a report. It's assigned by the chief judge to a Tax Court judge, and the Tax Court judge looks it over it and says, you know, before I -- before I really spend a lot of time on this, you really didn't explore these three problems. Would you please do it over again? Is he permitted to do that or is that a violation of the rule that he shall presume the report to be correct?",
  "I'm asking if it's a violation of -- of the rule.",
  "Because the -- the rule says a special report shall be presumed to be correct.",
  "And if there's this initial review, he says, you know, I think it's really pretty incomplete until you do X, Y, Z, please do it over again, is that a violation of the rule?",
  "Would -- would you comment on that? I -- I understood from the brief there was a suggestion that if you prevail, we're going to have a huge volume of -- of printed material that we're not troubled with now.",
  "Well, but the rule -- the rule says that the first report, the document 1, has to be given deference. Whether it's presumed to be correct.",
  "Sure.",
  "And how do we know that it was -- that it was presumed to be correct under the rule?",
  "You're -- you're --",
  "-- have a condition subsequent. It seems to me that you're saying, Mr. Hungar, that the last sentence of 183 is unenforceable.",
  "Does the statute you just quoted prohibit the disclosure of other reports if we call this first draft something other than a report?",
  "In other words, would -- would the rule go further than the statute?",
  "That's not a -- that's not a de novo -- they can rehear matters de novo on the en banc Tax Court, can they not? That's a de novo hearing.",
  "Well, but if you -- if you say the Act can be -- say, because this is just an as-applied challenge, you're asking us to assume that we can put on a label that's not true, \"This message is brought to you by your friendly Department of Agriculture.\" That isn't accurate.",
  "And you're having us save the statute by just putting a label on it that isn't accurate.",

  "This is a question perhaps more for the Respondent than for you, but I would like your comment on it. Suppose the statute were changed and there was a dollar-a-head assessment on beef, and it just went into the general funds of the United States Treasury, and then they used part of that money -- they had more money for beef advertising, and the government did the advertising. What would the Respondents say about that?",
  "But why can't -­",

  "Why can't the government -­",

  "It's put into the general fund of the -- of the Treasury.",

  "But then you could -­",

  "But what's the answer to my question?",
  "But that goes back to Frothingham and Mellon, and Massachusetts versus Mellon, and United States versus Butler, where we could trace the amount.",
  "It's old stuff.",
  "Well -- well, has the -- the objection to the instruction been preserved here?",
  "Are -- are you saying that the only basis on -- on which the jury could have ruled for the homeowner here, the -- the respondent, is that she was handcuffed for too long?",
  "Well, I think you have to say that. Otherwise, we have to uphold the jury verdict, if we can assume that the jury might have thought, well, you know, the handcuffs -- the police had a right to do that, but she was held too long, she was -- they -- they yelled at her, she was taken into a -- a place that was uncomfortable. If -- if that's true, then we have to sustain the jury verdict.",
  "No, no. But the instruction that was given -- and one was read that's in the briefs -­ it seems to me a -- a perfectly good instruction.",
  "Well, then it seems to me it was the plaintiff's obligation to submit a clarifying instruction and to bring this -- the denial of that instruction here.",
  "Do you find that the -- that the -- do you define the end of the search as before they started videotaping everything they had done?",
  "Well --",

  "I think that is critical to its holding.",
  "And that implies that they have a -- a duty at the outset to determine whether -­ what her status is rather than to go around looking for guns and -- and to secure the premises. That's -- that's one of my concerns with that.",
  "The -- the first ground being? Just an unreasonably long -­",

  "Well, but that was ill individual, a single individual --",
  "-- unclothed, et cetera -­",
  "What -- what will do if we thought the Ninth Circuit was egregiously wrong on that and that its opinion was, to use the most polite word, disingenuous when it talked about a garage? That -- that was somewhat off-putting to me when it was a converted garage with a bed.",
  "I mean, I -- I thought this woman was standing in -- by some grease rack or something and she was --",
  "The -- the problem I have with -- with the Government's case and with the respondent's case is that -- it's really the obverse of what Justice Ginsburg said. Their problem is that they would recast everything as a warning.",
  "Does the restatement have some specific provisions that say no matter how good the warning is, you're still entitled to proceed when there's a -- I don't know -- dangerous product or defective product or something?",
  "Even -- even if the warning specifically covered that design defect?",
  "So even if this product said, warning: may not be effective in high pH soils, that's not good enough?",
  "But it's never a question of the reasonableness or the adequacy of the warning?",
  "So on -- on that aspect of the case, you put in your pleadings that this was a violation of FIFRA.",
  "Well, that's a -- that's a bit different. You were -- you were asserting a moment ago I thought -- please correct me if I'm wrong -- that this was a violation of FIFRA because it was misbranded.",
  "It seems to me that you then have a suit under FIFRA, but I don't think that was the theory of your complaint.",
  "But do you take the position that juries can do what a State regulation cannot do, or are they much -- are they on a par?",
  "Suppose we disagree with that.",
  "And can they -­",
  "Can they do the same thing by -- through jury verdicts?",
  "So now -- so now you say a State can do something by regulation that a jury can't do.",
  "I'm asking if the -- if juries can do anything that the -- are -- are prohibited under your view from doing anything that the State could do by a State regulation.",
  "This is an abundance of caution?",
  "But why -- why doesn't (m) supersede that argument anyway? Let's -- can't we say that, well, you may be right so far as the second clause of (e) is concerned, but you still have to deal with (m)?",
  "Would you -- would you tell us again why, if you do not prevail on this argument, you still go back before the -- the Special Master to show certain facts?",
  "Well, given the absence of a summary judgment, we wouldn't have to address that.",
  "I -- I'd like your help on this. Your interpretation of Totten -- does it say that there is just no actionable contract, or does it say there's no jurisdictions like political question? I mean, you win under any of those theories, if we accept them. But which is it?",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not going away with a clear idea of your position.",
  "Do I -- do I -- does the Government file under 12(b)(1) like a jurisdiction, 12(b)(6), no cause of action? Of course, you'd probably do both, but I -- I want to know -­",
  "-- what your best thinking is of what Totten means. It seems to me that this just means that there can be no contract formed under these circumstances.",
  "If there's no cause of action, there's nothing to -- to claim on, what's -- what's the closest analogy? Is it like a promise to make a gift, which is unenforceable? Is there kind of a contract analogy that we can use?",
  "And you're saying that if there's no contract, then there's no substantive liberty to protect under the -- under due process procedures.",
  "What's --",
  "-- what's your best case for that? What's your best case for that proposition?",
  "Because it sounds to me like due process in -- in the air.",
  "No, no. We know enough at the summary judgment stage for us to -- to decide whether the case can go forward or the dismissal stage.",
  "Or dismissal stage.",
  "Well, that was the firing of a school teacher. There was -­",
  "-- there was -- there was an interest in having your job, contract property, and interest in getting back salary, contract property. Not this case.",
  "Goldberg v. Kelly, welfare benefits, money.",
  "You think that Totten would be decided differently today because of the -- our due process jurisprudence?",
  "I -- that's not my question.",
  "Suppose Mr. Totten is here today.",
  "I'm not quite sure where the Government has said that. You talk about footnote 2. All it said was that they're not appealing the point that you have to go to the Court of Claims.",
  "Well, is it your position that whenever an Indian transfers land in violation of the Nonintercourse Act, that that's a valid transfer? And if not, why is this different?",
  "All right. So if you were to say the tribe does not have a possessory right, they can't go in and eject all the people who are living there and built houses over the last 192 years. That doesn't mean still that you could tax them.",
  "Well, they couldn't be enforced against certain innocent purchasers but when the land is reacquired, then it seems to me we have to ask whether there was an extinction of aboriginal title and whether the reservation was at some point subsequently disestablished by federal act. And if we hold against you on the ground that there was no extinction of aboriginal title and there was no disestablishment of the reservation, then it seems to me that when they reacquire, we get to exactly the point that Justice Breyer raises and that is, once they reacquire the land, why does it become taxable? Why does its nontaxable status not simply reassert itself?",
  "So you're saying if the original establishment of the reservation was simply a continuation, was literally a reservation from a transfer of land to the State of New York and that the Indian title was a purely aboriginal title, not a title conferred by a federal act creating a reservation, that it cannot be Indian country, is that correct?",
  "Let's assume the title is aboriginal. Nothing in an act of the United States says we're giving this land to the Indians, e.g., in the Kansas situation. It's simply aboriginal title and it was never extinguished. Are you saying that if that is the source of the title as opposed to a federal act saying we give this to you, that it cannot be Indian country?",
  "Okay.",
  "So this part of your argument depends on our accepting your position on the Treaty of Fort Schuyler as being a conveyance of all property and a later retrocession, is that correct?",
  "Because otherwise, I don't see what extinguished the aboriginal title.",
  "And I assume it also means that that land cannot be repurchased by non-Indians?",
  "Would it not be odd to have a - - to give assurance that you could buy back what you've lost? Does it -- would that -- that's a very strange construction of the representations attendant upon Buffalo Creek. I understand what you're talking about with the 5,000 acres.",
  "Mr. Stuart, I have one question about Buffalo Creek. If we hold that Buffalo Creek didn't disestablish the reservation, then doesn't the New York Indian case rest on a false premise because that case gave $2 million for failure to give the Kansas lands?",
  "Well, there's no -- there's no abuse of discretion here. Why? Because we have an interest in having all of the claims exhausted? If -- if it's no more -- if it's as broad as that, then there's no AEDPA statute of limitations.",
  "At the price of suspending the 1-year statute of limitations that Congress thought was central to AEDPA.",
  "One of the problems is that the statute encourages prompt resolution in -- in the Federal system as well, and under a stay and abey procedure, you could have a district judge who lets the matter sit for 9-10 months and all of a sudden issues a stay and abey. How are we going to control that?",
  "Well, so then he's protected in the State system, and if he needs Federal review, he can come here on direct.",
  "No. He can come to -- here -­ this Court on direct review.",
  "He can come to this Court on certiorari after the State decision in the second -- in the second habeas.",
  "I take it -- I take it that one of the answers to the observation that the Federal court is closed to a third of the claims is that that's not true with respect to the exhausted claims. The -- the petition can simply be purged as to unexhausted claims and as to the exhausted claims, the courthouse door remains open.",
  "Well, are you suggesting then that we could have a rule, oh, somewhat like the grant of a preliminary injunction? If it's a likelihood of success on the merits, if it's a fundamental right, if there's reason for maybe mistake and not having exhausted, then -­ then you'd allow a stay and abeyance?",
  "Because if you have that, we then have a new Gothic jurisprudence where we're reviewing discretion on a collateral issue.",
  "Well, I suppose the suggestion I made -­",
  "-- is preferable than the one I gave. Would you adopt that or would you insist just that there be no stay and abey at all?",
  "Well, it's one thing to say that there's -- it's utterly without merit and he can deny it, which he's entitled to do under the statute. It's another thing to say that there's a high probability of success on the merits. I'm afraid that most of the claims are going to fall in between. The district judge just doesn't know absent testimony, et cetera, et cetera.",
  "Can -- can you tell me if -­ if we had not granted certiorari in the case and the Ninth Circuit's opinion became final, what would have happened on remand? What would have happened in the trial court?",
  "And -- and wouldn't there have been a -- a motion to make the pleadings more specific and they would have then come up with a measure of damages, or am I wrong about that?",
  "Well, I mean, I -- I assume you say that the trial judge and -- and defense counsel and -- and the trial court would have had real problems with this opinion. What -- what were those problems -­",
  "-- insofar as the measure of loss is concerned?",
  "Under this opinion, how would -- under the Ninth Circuit's opinion, how would the jury have been instructed to come -- to calculate the loss? I assume you have a problem with that and I want to know what it is.",
  "In -- in your view, is the plaintiff entitled to an expectancy measure of damage, or is it more the traditional tort measure which is out-of- pocket losses?",
  "Is the -- is the respondents' position properly characterized as asking for expectancy damages or is that too simplistic a view?",
  "Well, I -- I thought that Judge Sneed recognized that if the stock was sold before any loss was incurred, even if there's been a misrepresentation, recovery should be denied.",
  "All right.",
  "That's not what the Ninth Circuit said in this case.",
  "But I'm submitting it cited it for the wrong conclusion.",
  "Do you make the argument or is it implicit in your argument -- maybe you don't have this concern -- that if you imply a Federal due diligence standard on your duty to vacate the State conviction, that it's just too burdensome on the petitioner who has to begin fighting the vacatur battle at the same time that he has only 1 year to complete his habeas with reference to the other challenges to his conviction?",
  "In those -- in those six States or those few States --",
  "-- have those States all made clear they'd say we will never apply laches, or is it just the case that there have never -- there's never been an instance where the laches issue was presented to them?",
  "But do you have any explanation of why your client waited so long?",
  "Pro se.",
  "Well, are you saying that (4) is inapplicable?",
  "Well, as to your first -­",
  "-- as to your first -- as to your first instance, if there's lack of diligence, then there's laches. If the records are destroyed, somebody sits on their rights and the records are destroyed, then you have an obvious defense of laches.",
  "Well, we're -- yes, I -- I recognize that that's going to be the ultimate issue, but your point was, oh, well, the State is powerless because the prosecutor might not have the records. The States have laches provisions precisely for that circumstance.",
  "Well, I'm not sure I agree with your argument, but I suppose one answer to Justice Souter is that you get the longer of (1) or (4), so that you would always get at least 1 year. If the -- if the State conviction was 10 years prior to the Federal conviction and he waited and did nothing, I take it, he still has 1 year because he gets the longer of the two provisions.",
  "But I -- I thought that you conceded at the outset that the facts supporting the claim is the vacatur. I -- I thought that you opened up with that. And it -- it -­",
  "Well, the minute -- the minute that you -- you say that, it -- it seems to me that you have to accept the petitioner's argument.",
  "I'm not sure which way that cuts. In a -- in a sense, if that set of old convictions is out of the way, then you won't be troubled by the loss of records problem.",
  "Recently I -- I lost my luggage. I had to go to the lost and found at the airline, and the lady said has my plane landed yet.",
  "I was kind of stopped by that question. It seems to me this case is something like that. I mean, this is just not a question the -- the defendant asks until the Federal conviction arrives, which I -­ which I suppose that argues for your 1-year -­",
  "-- position, but it just seems to me that the purpose of this doesn't begin to run until he's been sentenced. And then he has to go through all the -- the questioning as -- as to whether or not his prior conviction is -- can be set aside, and he has to go to State court to do that.",
  "Well, you're asking us, I suppose, to make a rule that you have to get paper records. We've seen a number of capital cases, you know -- as you know. This counsel seemed to me to be quite articulate and -- and had a very sound theory of -- to argue to the jury for mitigation. It didn't work, of course. I -- I just don't know what constitutional rule you want to ask us for, that you have to look at record evidence?",
  "Well, you had three forensic experts, outside experts, and they didn't seem to think the papers were relevant either.",
  "Was there any indication that after the guilt phase was over and before the sentencing phase began -- I take it it was just a matter of hours or almost days till the sentencing -- till the sentencing phase began. Was there any contact with the psychiatrists or with experts after the sentencing phase and the -­ pardon me -- after the guilt phase and before the sentencing phase?",
  "What did the prosecution use? The fact of early -- early conviction and the details of the crime. Right?",
  "I -- I don't like to either direct your own argument or the questions from my colleagues, but the Simmons issue here -­",
  "-- it seems to me is important and -­",
  "If there had been no questions from the jury, it seems to me that you wouldn't have had an argument at all because the counsel was allowed -- the counsel was allowed to argue this to the jury and did argue it to the jury.",
  "Would you -- would you agree that but for the questions from the jury, Simmons was complied with? The counsel argued the point to the jury -­",
  "-- without being -- without being contradicted.",
  "No. So now -- now we have a situation where the case, by my suggestion in any event, was properly presented to the jury, and the only question is what the constitutional obligation is once the jury brings in a question.",
  "And what's the best argument you have that future dangerousness was an issue?",
  "Well, of course, that also bears on the -- on the fact of his depravity, that he was just -- he just didn't learn.",
  "I don't know if that's necessarily future dangerousness or -- it's equally blameworthiness.",
  "Well, that goes to his blameworthiness. He didn't learn anything in prison. I -- I suppose future dangerousness is -- in a sense is always in question, but I think our precedents say it has to be specifically or -- or clearly implied.",
  "I -- I know you want to get to the other issue in this case, but let me ask you. You've, I assume, read these cases. In -- in other States where this instruction is given, is the prosecutor free to say, well, sure, there's life without parole, but that can change? We don't know what the law will be like 3 years from now, 5. Have there been any problems along that -­ along those lines? Have there been any problems generally in giving this instruction to the jury?",
  "This sounds to me like a constitutional argument for serendipity. You're held to be negligent if you don't look at the record for -- for one purpose and -- and discover by accident something that's there for another purpose. I -- I don't know what the logic of that is.",
  "Would a State court be free to award damages or would that be preempted under the view you take of the statute?",
  "If the State court allowed damages -- if -- if the State system allowed -- State law allowed damages, would the Federal court, in an action under this section, be allowed to award damages under that -- under the State statute?",
  "It -- it seems to me that the 30-day provision is inconsistent with the award of damages, but after I say that, I can't tell you why.",
  "Suppose Congress said specifically 1983 applies. That's all it says. Would that carry with it attorney's fees in your view?",
  "Well, I take -- you -- you take the position that 1983 doesn't apply at all. It's not just attorney's fees. It's damages.",
  "Which would be more burdensome? That enactment or subjecting municipalities nationwide to damages? Which would be more intrusive and burdensome on federalism -­",
  "-- and the abilities of local governments to function?",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not so sure because you're arguing that even the smallest municipality can be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney's fees.",
  "And I -­",
  "Plus other -- plus other damages.",
  "But I -- I don't think we -­",
  "I don't think we usually think of -- of judicial review of agency decisions in the ordinary course as being a deterrent.",
  "It's an opportunity to elaborate reasons. It's a safeguard. It's not a deterrent. And you're saying it has to be a deterrent. And as Justice Breyer indicates, it -- it means that there's -- there's another voice in that -- in that administrative hearing room. They're terrified of damages.",
  "And it's going to skew the decisions.",
  "In line -- in line with Justice Breyer's question, does the State of Oklahoma have an interest in insulating major parties from competition for members?",
  "So you have a -- the State has an interest in protecting major parties from losing their members and thereby weakening the two-party system by benefiting a third party. I thought that's contrary to the whole thrust of our holding in cases such as Anderson and Celebreeze where third parties are entitled to special protection under the First Amendment.",
  "Well, even in presidential elections, most people don't get interested until 4 or 5 weeks before the election. Everybody knows that.",
  "Well, I'm saying even in a presidential primary. If they're local races, it -- it takes longer. The public just tunes out until the last -­ last couple weeks.",
  "But that's what they were being used for in Berman and -- everybody knows that private developers were the beneficiaries in Berman.",
  "As I understand, you're test then -- you want me to make a distinction between blight which is a permissible governmental use, governmental objective and economic revival, which isn't?",
  "Is that the line you want me to draw.",
  "Well, suppose an economist or even a judge might say, well, it's very clear that if this economic depression continues for another five years we are going to have blight. Blight is in the eye of the beholder, I know that.",
  "Why isn't it an objective criteria to say that we are going to have economic revival, avoid economic downturns?",
  "That's the same thing that is true in the railroads in the west.",
  "Precisely the description you gave applied to the railroads in the west.",
  "And this seems to be really essential for the purpose of developing industrial property to increase the tax base. The argument is, and I don't know of any reason to doubt it, that doing it seriatim by voluntary acquisition and sale doesn't work. So the rationale for this is essentially the rationale for the railroads, for the public utility line condemnations and so on. There isn't another practical way to do it. And there is a public benefit at the end, and that ought to qualify it as a public use.",
  "In all of those cases, I think the economic feasibility or economic success test would have been easily met. I mean, what you're doing is trying to protect some economic value/ But I think it's pretty clear that most economists would say this development wouldn't happen unless there is a foreseeable chance of success. Let me ask you this, and it's a little opposite of the particular question presented. Are there any writings or scholarship that indicates that when you have property being taken from one private person ultimately to go to another private person, that what we ought to do is to adjust the measure of compensation, so that the owner -- the condemnee - - can receive some sort of a premium for the development?",
  "And you have to prescind the project when you fix the value.",
  "You have to prescind the project -- you have to -- you have to ignore the project when you determine the value. The value is a willing buyer and a willing seller, without reference to the project.",
  "But what I am asking is if there has been any scholarship to indicate that maybe that compensation measure ought to be adjusted when A is losing property for the economic benefit of B.",
  "Well, if that, if that's so then the occasional statements that we see in the writing that you can't take from A to give to B is just wrong?",
  "You think you can't take from A to give to B, that there is some substance and force to that proposition?",
  "But without the addition, I'd please like an answer to your question.",
  "There are statements in our cases that say you cannot take from A just to give to B.",
  "Do you agree that there is substance to that proposition and that that proposition is correct?",
  "But isn't that exactly what happened in Berman?",
  "Isn't that exactly what always happens unless it's for a firehouse or a school?",
  "It does seem ironic that 100 percent of the premium for the new development goes to the, goes to the developer and to the taxpayers and not to the property owner.",
  "The compensation measures.",
  "On that point, just in Connecticut, if the property owner goes to the jury and receives more than the state offered, does the state also have to pay those attorneys' fees?",
  "Under Connecticut law, if the property owner is offered $100 but goes to the jury and gets $200, does the property owner have to pay the attorneys' fees or does the state pay the attorneys' fees?",
  "Really? I thought that that was a fundamental of condemnation law that you can not value the property being taken based on what it's going to be worth after the project. That's just - -",
  "Unless Connecticut law is much different from any other state.",
  "Well, of course, the tax code does have special provisions for involuntary sales and reinvestments.",
  "The tax hypothetical is not accurate.",
  "Mr. Bullock, do you know those four words?",
  "So you want us to put --",
  "Well, suppose it were clear, from what the legislature said, that the only purpose of this legislation was to help out some local dealers who were politically powerful and the gasoline prices would go up. I assume you would be here defending the statute.",
  "And you would be here defending the statute on -- in my hypothetical case.",
  "Well, if you're going to use the public use prong of the -- of the -- the Constitution for what we think are regulatory takings, then what happens is you just invalidate the regulation. You don't pay compensation.",
  "Because if it's not a public use, then you can't --",
  "Of course, when you have a physical invasion of property and a inverse condemnation is tantamount to a physical invasion, then we've built up some doctrine in order to protect the concept of physical invasion so that that can't be avoided. Perhaps that's not applicable to a -- to an economic regulation.",
  "Even though this is a leasehold interest. I -- I understand that.",
  "Is it a regulatory taking in your view because the substantially advances test is not met, or is a regulatory taking and then I ask if it substantially advances?",
  "How do I know that this is a regulatory taking, in other words?",
  "Yes, and in that respect, Holmes did not use the word legitimate. He said just when the regulation goes too far, and if it's illegitimate, that tends to show -- I suppose the jurisprudence is -- that this is not an accepted form of regulation in the usual course and therefore unnecessary. I take it that's your argument.",
  "Well, it's something that I hadn't concentrated on before now, but your position that, well, if you're transferred to the Court -- to the Court of Claims, that you bring with you all of the previous rulings of the United States district court in California and that those are somehow binding because of the law of the case -- what is the authority for that? The -- the court that's transferred has to accept all the rulings that have been made previous to the transfer?",
  "I mean, what's the authority for that?",
  "Well, but the -- the whole point of the district -- correct if I'm wrong. This is your area. The whole point of the district was to make it easier for the United States to know with whom it was dealing to have an efficient system, and if you say, well, that doesn't include lawsuits for damages, it seems to me that destroys much of the purpose of the formation of the district.",
  "May I -- may I -- has that always been your view throughout?",
  "But throughout the litigation?",
  "So money damages -- waiver always used the word money damages. When it says adjudicate the rights under the contract, that doesn't include money damages?",
  "Can the district get damages from the Government?",
  "What about the provision in the judgment at page 110 that was -- that was cited to us, that -- that the parties may obtain other appropriate relief by the filing of a new action?",
  "Well, I think we'd like an answer. Justice Ginsburg gives us -- gives you a hypothetical case. You've got the money. The judgment has been discharged in the State courts. What is left to do in the Federal court?",
  "Now, the one answer I heard you give, well, we're interested in preclusion to say -­ well, that's all historical at that point. Who cares?",
  "We're looking for -- we're looking for something that makes the case live.",
  "But we're -- we're questioning why that is and we're asking you what relief you need to get that you wouldn't get in the hypothetical that Justice Ginsburg posed.",
  "Is your answer that you might want equitable relief, an injunction to continue making payments in the future, or something like that?",
  "Suppose --",
  "Suppose that you lost in the State court and the judgment is final. You then go to Federal court. Are -- is there a context in which Rooker­ Feldman might then be applicable? This is all hypothetical.",
  "In other words, if you had some ongoing relation and, in this hypothetical, the State court ruled against you and you went in to try to reverse that ruling, that would be -- that would Rooker-Feldman.",
  "Which happens thousands of times in -- in all of the courts. It's very common and I don't know why we're over-designing this vehicle. It's simply other action pending. End of case.",
  "Or end of argument, not end of case.",
  "Can you tell me just a little bit about that, how it works? Suppose that you prevail in this case -- and it does seem to me that the -- the charging the double doesn't involve modification of the ship, obviously. How does it work if you have, oh, say, an English passenger who buys an English ticket and is charged double -- I don't know if that's the English law, but let's assume -- then he comes on a cruise ship and he goes to New York and Miami and -- and New Orleans? Can he -- does he -- could he then sue, if -- if we rule for you in this case?",
  "Even in U.S. waters? That wouldn't make sense. An American buys a ticket in -- in Liverpool. He's disabled. He goes to New York, Miami, New Orleans, and he's discriminated at -- at each step. No -- no coverage just because of where he bought the ticket?",
  "Well, you're saying that this is your position, but don't worry about it because we'll reject your position?",
  "Well, let's put it this way. So my understanding of your answer is that we could write an opinion ruling for you but leaving these other questions open? I don't see how we can do that.",
  "But if I'm writing the opinion and I put that down and rule for you, it seems to me that I then answered necessarily Justice Ginsburg's question in the negative.",
  "But these - -",
  "Why -- why can't you just fight that battle by battle on what's reasonably achievable? Because in order to avoid that problem, what you're telling us is that a cruise line can charge a -- a disabled person double the price - -",
  "-- because they're a nuisance. And that's your position.",
  "That happens to every employer under -- in the United States under the reasonably achievable standard.",
  "Well, we -- we do -- we do have the rule if it -- if it applies to the internal operations of the ship, and so far as the crew is concerned, the Jones Act and OSHA, it seems to me, may well be governed by the law of the flag.",
  "That's a part of the case I'm not sure about, and it seems to me, again, it can be fought out under the reasonably achievable - -",
  "And incidentally just for the -- are -- this ship has -- these are regulations that help the disabled?",
  "What -- what does the Pennsylvania court -- law now say with respect to claim- by-claim pleading of the exceptions?",
  "Claim by claim?",
  "Yes. We would have to breathe life back into the stay and abey - -",
  "But let me ask you this. Returning to our earlier discussion about pleading a specific exemption - -",
  "-- are there States, do you know, where that is not required and the State court will go through the exceptions even if you haven't pled them?",
  "Well, but I thought you said Pennsylvania law had changed now.",
  "But my -- my question is do you know if there are other States where they say, we don't care if you plead these - -",
  "-- exemptions specifically or not? We're going to look through it and find it for ourselves.",
  "And -- and if you're tempted to answer, well, people want to get out so they're not going to sit around forever, then we'd ask you what about the death cases.",
  "I'm not sure that would apply to other States.",
  "Under your rule that filing is sufficient, are there any instances of -- of frivolous petition where your rule would not apply?",
  "Well, then Justice Scalia's prediction is -- is right. You just keep filing and filing.",
  "Oh, but if it takes a year a later, then we - -",
  "Then you just repeat the process one step backward.",
  "Well, but if we accept your position, it seems to me that State prisoners are going to have to go but once to Federal court and then they're -- they're going to run into an exhaustion requirement.",
  "Well, we're --",
  "-- we're assuming a late- discovered claim that's within AEDPA.",
  "What do I do it in a State where there is a plausible close question of whether or not the successive petition is barred in the State court? And I interrupted Justice Breyer, but I -- I think it's along the same line.",
  "But no -- there's still an exhaustion requirement.",
  "It seems -- it seems intuitive also that the prosecution's witnesses will be difficult to locate and so forth. Has -- has there been anything written about that, about prejudice to the prosecution from -- from delay, or is it just something we - -",
  "-- we take judicial notice of?",
  "So the principle is there's a right not to be shackled, and when the State says that that right has to be compromised, then the State has to have the burden of proof?",
  "And I looked -- and I find that rule in Chapman?",
  "Back on your earlier part of your answer to Justice Scalia, that it's inherently prejudicial in the sentencing stage, if one of us were to agree or the whole Court, the majority, were to agree with your position and write the opinion out, what would we cite for that, other -- other than our -- our own assumptions as to how the system worked, judicial notice?",
  "With -- with character, we know -- we know he's a murderer.",
  "Does your whole case turn on how shackling affects the argument that you're -- that the accused is making that he's not dangerous, et cetera, or is there some other different standard that we could use to the effect, say, that it's just not consistent with the dignity in an American courtroom, something like that?",
  "Does your whole case turn on whether or not this is prejudicial to the fact-finding process on the specific issues or is there some more general standard?",
  "Well, I mean, I think the -­",
  "Well, I -- I think there is -­ is something to the point that if I'm a juror and the defendant is sitting about as close to me as you are at the counsel table and I see that he can't suddenly jump out at me, I have a certain -- certain security in making a deliberated judgment. I -- I do think it may cut both ways. And that's why I'm asking you is if there are some other considerations here.",
  "Let me ask you this. You, of course, would object to having to show prejudice in any individual case. Then it seems to me, to follow, that that's prejudice -- that that means because prejudice is difficult to show. And if prejudice is judicial -­ difficult to show, why should we rule for you anyway?",
  "I -- I think you have to give that answer to Justice -- to Justice Breyer, and that's why I'm asking. I -- I think you just have to say that this is inherently inconsistent with the atmosphere we want to have in a courtroom. It seems to me -- I -- I'm not quite sure I can find a lot of authority for that, but it seems to me that has to be your argument.",
  "Well, but then you're giving away the Riggins argument, which is that this somehow affects the psyche of the defendant and he can't fully participate, et cetera, which I thought was your argument.",
  "So can every defendant have leg braces in every case?",
  "Do you -- do you take the position that every defendant can be restrained if the restraints are not visible to the jury?",
  "Legirons strapped to the leg of the -- of the table but not visible.",
  "Well, but I want to know what your position is. Traffic offenders?",
  "But the State of Missouri is submitting to us the proposition that every defendant in every case can be shackled so long as it's not visible. And I -- I find that an extreme position because it's an indignity on the defendant and the defendant is entitled to dignity in a courtroom.",
  "Could he be forced to wear prison clothes once he's convicted and it's the sentencing phase?",
  "Could they put him in a cage?",
  "He's -- he's been convicted. We know he's dangerous.",
  "I mean, what did he do? Draw a map or what?",
  "So -- so it's never ground for reversal? I'm -- I'm wondering, in line with Justice Scalia's question, is -- is -- would the calculus be, well, this is not a close case and some other cases are closer? I mean, is that what we do?",
  "Your -- your -- I -- I think first position at least would be that it's never prejudicial. But assume we don't agree with that.",
  "How does harmless error work to -- to pursue Justice Scalia's line of questioning?",
  "I understand that.",
  "Could -- could you comment on whether or not there's harmful error here?",
  "Are you asking us to say that in light of six aggravating factors on which he was convicted, the result likely would have been different?",
  "In other words, you'd have the same issue of preclusion problems if you had done the case from the beginning the way you contend it ought to have been done.",
  "But I mean, Justice Ginsburg's point is you -- you -- even with a -- a few properly named defendants, you're going to have the same issue preclusion problem.",
  "And then you say the civil action has to give -- be diverse as to all claims.",
  "Over every claim -- every claim in the class.",
  "Now, in -- in City of Chicago, we did not give that meaning to the term civil action. Now, then you would say, well, City of Chicago is a Federal question case.",
  "But then I would say then you're asking us to interpret civil action differently in two statutes.",
  "No, but they also use the term, civil action, and it seems to me that your interpretation of the two differs if -- if the City of Chicago -­",
  "-- is -- is correct.",
  "Strawbridge has become less hallowed in light of the new congressional enactment. What's it called? The Sunshine in Class Action? What is it?",
  "Well, I understand in 2005 Congress doesn't necessarily express what was before, but it -- it seems to me there's an institutional judgment that Strawbridge is not that hallowed a -- a principle.",
  "I don't know whether that's any more profound or ultra-religious, super-religious than the prayer that the chaplain",
  "Well, I mean, I haven't read the prayer. So I would be surprised if I went through all the prayers and there was no mention, direct or indirect, of the Ten Commandments or a couple of them.",
  "Well, you know, in the First Amendment speech area, we're very, very strict. A moment's delay in publication is a constitutional crisis. And I'm not sure that we should carry that over to this area, where there is this obsessive concern with any mention of religion. That seems to me to show a hostility to religion. I just don't see a balanced dialogue in our cases or in these kinds of arguments.",
  "This is a classic avert your eyes. If an atheist walked by, he can avert his eyes, he can think about something else.",
  "Well, suppose a non-Christian, say a Muslim, comes before a judge who has very strong Christian beliefs, a very religious person. Does he feel like an outsider? And to require that we pretend that there is no religious motivation, no deep religious conviction on the part of many of our public officials seems to me to be a hostility toward religion.",
  "I think you're telling us that the State cannot accommodate religion. The only way they can do it is to put the Ten Commandments up and insist that it's always secular, whether it's predominantly for a secular purpose. It seems to me that's hypocritical and it's asking religious people to surrender their beliefs and that is not accommodation.",
  "So the word accommodate should not be within our jurisprudence?",
  "So in another case, if a have been very, very important in his or her life as a spiritual or religious matter and wants other people to know how important the Ten Commandments are, he cannot accept on behalf of the city the Ten Commandments. And so you can have no Ten Commandments in city A, but the Ten Commandments in city B. General, that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. And again, you're just doing with purpose what you did in response to Justice Scalia's question. You're asking us to ignore the religious purpose that is the most manifest value of these symbols.",
  "Well, I'm not sure that that endorsement -- in England, there is a square where they have King Charles on one hand -- on one end and he's looking at Oliver Cromwell, who beheaded him, on the other. I don't know if you have to endorse one or the other.",
  "And do you think that it should cross the constitutional line under the interpretational theory of the First Amendment you wish us to adopt?",
  "Are you saying that the purpose is neutral or that the purpose doesn't matter?",
  "And is it your position that no real harm is inflicted on people who do not agree with that message?",
  "Suppose you had a county 100 miles away or a state, a different state, and the same display was put on and the recitation was -- and it was a sincere recitation, that the government simply wanted to recognize that the 10 Commandments has played an important role in the civic lives of our people. Then you have -- they're each up for five years and five years later, some school kids wander by one and they wander by the other. In your view, from what you're telling me, the Commandments are permitted in one location and not the other? I mean, that's the necessary purport of your argument. You may not think that either of them are valid but on this prong of the argument, it seems to me that to differentiate, I just don't understand that.",
  "I take it we've done that in the conscientious objector cases, United States v. Seeger and Gillette.",
  "Well, I -- I take it underlying Justice Ginsburg's question is -- is the concern that this accommodation is unequal because there are other First Amendment rights that are not given the -­ that are not given the same precedence.",
  "That -- that was at least an underlying concern of her question, and I think it's a legitimate concern.",
  "Well, but in Amos, the Court was just -- the -- the government was just saying that one of its own statutes could be accommodated. This is something different.",
  "If you want us to say that --",
  "Well, I -- I suppose you're saying you want us to make the holding that -- one of the holdings you'd be satisfied with is that while some accommodation is -- is appropriate, this is extreme accommodation. What's your best case for that? I -- I just can't remember a case in which we've tried to ask whether every form a request for accommodation has to be acknowledged. Is -- is this the only case that you've come across?",
  "Well, I guess what I'm asking is what's the closest analogy you can -­",
  "You're asking us -­",
  "Are there any extreme cases we could imagine where the police have a duty to protect the citizen? The policeman sees four people beating up on the victim, no race involved, and he just enjoys watching the fight. Does he have a duty under the Constitution to intervene?",
  "Did DeShaney stand for the proposition there could never be an affirmative duty to intervene, under what you're talking about the Constitution here?",
  "But there has to be some State -- the State has to have created the risk somehow?",
  "But then your complaint is the result, not the procedure.",
  "Yes, it's true that the procedural cases are designed so that the right result can be reached most of the time. I understand that. But all we ask is whether or not the procedure was adequate.",
  "Well, if the State cares so little about enforcing what its officers do under its own laws, isn't that some indication that it did not intend to create the property interest that you're arguing for?",
  "Well -- well, your -- your answer should be to Justice O'Connor there is no effective legal remedy under your theory of the case.",
  "I mean, you -- you say he has the remedy of -- of counter-speech. We're talking -- that's really that doesn't answer the question. The question is, is there anything he can get from the courts other than a damage remedy, and your answer I think is no.",
  "Well, it -- it seems to me that that really avoids the problem -- the problem. So suppose we disagree with you about that. Then it's true that there is no -- there is no legal remedy that he can get.",
  "Well -- well, there really -­ there are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer is a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell us that that's not defamatory, I mean, I -- I think we should just proceed on -- on some other basis for this argument. We have other questions to discuss.",
  "Suppose this picketing had taken place in front of his house, every day in front of his house.",
  "All right. Well -- well, then this -- this argument you're making, oh, never, never, the sky is falling and so forth, I -- I think we have to be more precise here. I think if it were in front of his house, it would be different. If he had alleged $10 worth of monetary damages, it would be disparaging the quality of his services, which would be a trade libel, and the Restatement at least -- I don't know California law -- says that you -- would you agree that you can enjoin a trade libel -­",
  "-- that disparages quality of goods to the serious injury of a -- of a business?",
  "What kind of a jurisprudence is it that a person can go to jail but that he's freed from an injunction? I mean, why -- why do we do this?",
  "But -- but why -- is that true in every case? I mean, take the timid person who's not sure -- I know the law doesn't protect the timid person in the first area, but let's -- let's assume the timid person is not sure. So he wants -- he wants to get an equitable ruling first, declaratory judgment. He -- and he would take an injunction. That's certainly much easier than going to jail.",
  "I know, but I'm asking you why that -- why that should be. If -- if you asked a person not familiar with our jurisprudence, which is worse, having an injunction that you can argue about or going to jail, I -- I think they would say that going to jail is worse.",
  "Well, so this finding -- the court shouldn't have made these findings? It was irrelevant?",
  "Was there an objection to the testimony that established this?",
  "Add to Justice Stevens' -- add to Justice Stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he's losing some clients.",
  "You're saying -- you're saying that a State cannot constitutionally prohibit someone from making false statements in front of the business that causes the business to lose money.",
  "So I'm -- my question is, is this constitutional to prohibit this conduct?",
  "That's -­",
  "-- that's not the question.",
  "Have we ever -- have we ever considered a case where there's a strong element of extortion involved?",
  "Well, what -- what you're saying is that an -- an injunction can be overbroad based on past wrongful conduct. And there is simply no authority for that proposition.",
  "But we have just pointed out that it -- that it -- it prohibits lawful, harmless, truthful speech.",
  "Now, let -- let me ask you about that. Let's -- let's assume, for the moment, that a majority of the Court would find that some of these provisions are overly broad. Is there any authority that tells us what to do next? This is not like a statute where we have to save the statute. Do we have any obligation to save the injunction? Send it back and let it be done. Let it be done all over again. I mean, why -- why should we rewrite it up here? Do you have any authority that requires us or permits us to do that?",
  "Well, if -- if that's so, then maybe Mr. Chemerinsky is right. We -- we shouldn't have injunctions. If you're saying that injunctions can't be narrowly tailored, it seems to me that you're playing right into the argument that the petitioner is making.",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm baffled by that. What you're saying is that the injunction -- we're just all wasting our time? The injunction doesn't mean anything?",
  "I -- I fell off the track here.",
  "Oh, yes, but he's different from other citizens because he's at -- he's at risk of a contempt citation.",
  "I mean, his speech is being chilled with -- with respect to protected speech.",
  "So the collateral bar rule doesn't help you at all because he's subject to a contempt citation.",
  "I -- I was going to ask you about that. Were there findings to substantiate the allegations?",
  "Specifically about the extorting money from the bank and the oil company.",
  "No findings.",
  "Does California law require you to label the type of the cause of action or is it notice pleading based on facts?",
  "In those cases, would the Government ever on its own motion have a defendant retried or released? Has that ever happened?",
  "I don't think it has. If -­ let me ask you this. If -- if a decision says that what was a crime, as defined to the jury, is no longer a crime -- the conduct was no longer a crime -- I take it Teague doesn't necessarily apply to that, but this is still a substantive rule that's retroactive. Is that the way it works?",
  "But what -- what interest does the Government have in holding somebody when the conduct for which he was convicted is no longer a crime?",
  "Why don't you let the guy go?",
  "Let's say he's being -­",
  "Let's say he's being held because the Government insists that it's not retroactive and the Government is then proven wrong. Would that let him qualify under (2) because then the -- the impediment to making the motion was the fact that he thought it was not retroactive, but then -- and that was Government action because that's what you insisted on. But then that's removed. So does -- so would -- does entitlement under (2) apply?",
  "I -- I don't think this is going to work.",
  "Well -- well, but it is because he -- it hasn't been found retroactive yet and he can't file -­",
  "-- under your view.",
  "Well, you prevented him from filing effectively. I mean -­",
  "-- the petition has to be dismissed.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's probably right.",
  "Well, what courts in -- in your view have to make the retroactivity finding? The district court? The circuit where he's -- which has jurisdiction over his case? Any circuit?",
  "So that if 10 other circuits have ruled on this but not his own, there's nothing he can do until somebody within the 1-year window files.",
  "Your -- your position is strengthened by the other three provisions of the statute that mentioned this, but it's not controlled by that, I take it. You think it's unambiguous just as it read -- as it's read on its own.",
  "Is -- excuse me. Is -- is it your position that there is an exaction here?",
  "It -- are -- are you bound by a finding in the State court that there was no exaction, or was there no such finding?",
  "Was the -- was the Ninth Circuit wrong in indicating that there was no exaction? That's the way I read its opinion.",
  "But -- but the Ninth Circuit seemed to think that Dolan doesn't apply, and I take it that you would say that it does.",
  "Well, but is there precedent that what is reasonable for the State constitution is always reasonable for the Federal Constitution?",
  "I mean, this is somewhat different than simply a specific factual finding.",
  "Monterey -- Monterey Dunes was from the United States district court.",
  "Well, was there an allegation -­",
  "-- at any point here -- was there an allegation at any point here that the State procedures were inadequate to protect property rights?",
  "Well, it's not so much that there weren't appellate procedures, but that the procedures and the variance procedures and -- and a multiplicity of agencies here were just so complex that it amounted to an -- inadequate remedies to protect against a taking.",
  "Well, can the President give an interpretation of the treaty unilaterally that is binding on us? Can the President sign a treaty and then, a year later, give an interpretation of that treaty that's binding on us, insofar as what the treaty means?",
  "Can he do that?",
  "Right. I would say that that, ultimately, is for this Court. Then, if that's so, how can he agree with the -- to confer jurisdiction on the World Court, which would do the same thing?",
  "What's the case -­",
  "-- what's the case that you're citing for this proposition, that the President and the Senate can, in effect, confer on an international tribunal the obligation to bind this Court with reference to an interpretation of a treaty? What's the best case you've got for that?",
  "So you're telling me you don't have a case.",
  "No, no.",
  "No. No. We can't forego limits on our jurisdiction simply by granting the question.",
  "You don't say, \"Oh, you've granted a question; therefore, you have to decide whether you have jurisdiction or not.\"",
  "See? And, as Justice Scalia indicates, the COA is a jurisdictional requirement.",
  "Well, that was my next -- my question, and it follows on the question Justice Souter asked. Does the attorney general concede, or do you not, or acknowledge that there are Texas procedures in which these questions can be litigated?",
  "And is it also true that, in the Texas proceedings, they necessarily would involve a federal question on which this Court could, if it chose, grant certiorari on direct review?",
  "Have there been any cases in the Circuits holding that the state can waive the jurisdictional limitation on COA?",
  "It's not clear -- it's not clear to me from your brief, focusing on the contributory aspect of it, not -- and not the inducement part of it - - it's not clear to me from your brief what your test is. What do we tell the trier of fact, that if there is a substantial part of the use which is noninfringement, if there's any part?",
  "Leaving aside the inducement.",
  "Well, then we just throw this to the birds on the trier of fact in every case - -",
  "Well, how do we know - -",
  "Well, I don't quite understand the -- I take it, inventors are profit-motive-driven, and if they know that something they're working on is going to have copyright experience, you -- have got copyright problems, you can't just say, \"Oh, well, the inventor's going to invent anyway.\"",
  "Or did I misunderstand your - -",
  "But it is the case under the test you're submitting to us.",
  "And what -- and your test is whether there's a substantial use that's lawful?",
  "Suppose the owner of the instrumentality, the program, thinks that there's going to be a vast area of lawful use, and he knows that there's going to be some abuse at the -- in the short term, but he does everything he can to discourage that. He says, \"This is a two -- P2P is going to revolutionize the way we talk to each other, there's things in the public domain. Please don't use this for copyright.\" But he knows that there's going to be some infringement, let's say that it'll be 50 percent of the use, in the short term. Can he use the program?",
  "Yes, that he can - -",
  "-- use the program.",
  "Well, I don't want to get us too far off the track on this question, but it just seems to me that what you've done before bears on what you know, or have reason to know, on an ongoing basis.",
  "Well, then why don't you tell us what's wrong with the Government's test and with the Petitioner's test, the substantial-use part of it?",
  "But - -",
  "-- but what you have -- what you want to do is to say that unlawfully expropriated property can be used by the owner of the instrumentality as part of the startup capital for his product.",
  "And I -- just from an economic standpoint and a legal standpoint, that sounds wrong to me.",
  "So you think that - -",
  "-- unlawfully expropriated property can be a legitimate part of the startup capital.",
  "Well, what does he -- can you -- can you describe it for us what -- he gets 48 hours notice.",
  "Notice that's there's going to be a hearing. What else does he get? Does he get a summary of the written report? Does he get a -- a statement of -- of the reasons? What --",
  "No. Before the hearing starts, he gets 48 hours notice, but is he -- is he just told there's going to be a hearing in 48 hours and that's it?",
  "So he does get the report.",
  "48 hours -­",
  "Well, those two, it seems to me, are all questions of -- of fact. I mean, ultimately your position may be correct, but I -- I just can't place a lot of store in this predictive versus nonpredictive judgment, and it's contrary to your own argument. You say, well, in almost all the cases, it's because he's been convicted of a crime in prison and so forth. Well, that -- that undercuts, it seems to me, the -- the basic argument that you're trying to make that established this line between predictive and nonpredictive judgment. I -- I suppose you would say even in cases where it is a matter of past effect, these procedures are -- are adequate. Or would you?",
  "Perhaps you can take us through this chronologically. You -- you began at the end.",
  "It -- it seems to me that the -- the facial attack objection would -- would not be -­ carry much weight if what happened was this. There was a trial. The policies were found deficient, and the court said, you devise some new forms. At that point, it seems to me that the facial attack would -- objection would -­ would not be relevant. And -- and your point would be right. You say, you know, they -- they haven't -- this doesn't -- is not going to cure the -- the deficiency. But what happened here was that, as I understand it, midway in the litigation there was a new policy, and it -- it seems -- so we have sort of a moving target that we're working with.",
  "Could you comment on that?",
  "Are you -- are you saying that what we have before us is this, a trial which showed that the pre-new policy procedures were deficient and the trial judge and you and a court of appeals interpreted the new policies as remedies for past wrongs that were established? And the question is the adequacy of that remedy. That's one way to look at the case.",
  "Another way to look at the case is to say that Ohio admitted that there were some improprieties, showed its new policy, and the case turned on the adequacy of the new policies. Now, those are two different things. Which is this case?",
  "And as -- and as to those prisoners, was there a requirement that the -- that the court's procedures be made applicable and so there would have to be a retroactive hearing as to those prisoners?",
  "Can you tell us on -- on the liberty interest where we started with the -­",
  "-- with the Attorney General, is there a liberty interest in not being transferred from prison 1 -- level 1 to level 2 -­",
  "-- level 2, that sort of thing? Why is it that there's a liberty interest in being transferred -- I guess being transferred from 4 to 5?",
  "Did they have reading materials? I --",
  "Well, my --",
  "Please, please. I didn't mean to interrupt you. Did you finish your answer?",
  "No, please. Well, my -- my initial view of this case was much like Justice Souter's and -- and I still think that that may be -- may be correct. But I thought your answer to Justice Souter would be that there are many cases in which there is an antecedent Federal title which then goes down through successive purchasers, mining claims, for instance, and those are always under State law. I -- I thought that would be your answer to Justice Souter and - - and also to Justice Ginsburg.",
  "And you rely on Merrell Dow, which is fine. But I thought there was a separate line of cases that support you, as well as Merrell Dow.",
  "But you can't get anything out of the words of the -- of the statute arising under to help you.",
  "So just the strength of the Federal interest is the --",
  "-- the controlling test?",
  "I know you want to reserve your time. Just one quick thing. The Government makes the distinction between an action to remove a cloud on title and an action for possession. Do you agree that this is a -- a action to remove a cloud on title?",
  "Suppose that the plaintiff here alleged that the tax deed were forged, that the occupant simply forged the tax deed and was occupied under forgery. State cause of action there?",
  "All right. Then suppose he alleged not that it was forged, but that this -- that the occupier of the land had -- had misconstrued the occupier's rights to bid at the tax sale or -- or that there -- the tax sale should never have been held. Then that's a Federal - -",
  "Well, and how is that different from the forgery?",
  "How -- how is that different from the forgery hypothetical?",
  "Why wouldn't that same rule apply in a State where there's a common law cause of action for ejectment and it's substantively under State law different from a cloud on the title? You discuss in your brief, very helpfully I think, the -- the Hopkins and the Taylor line of cases.",
  "How is your statement that you just made consistent with the Court's holding under the Taylor line of cases?",
  "So if we had exactly the facts of this case and there's a common law ejectment, you would not say that it goes to Federal court. It would stay in State court.",
  "Well, I -- I suppose that - -",
  "-- in a common law ejectment action that we are supposing that what's going to come up is the tax sale.",
  "Which is just the facts of this case. And I suppose that if the plaintiff prevails on the common law cause of action for ejectment, he's got a -- a res judicata defense if the -- if the present occupier then makes another suit based on the tax deed.",
  "Is the test for going to the jury the same as the test for whether or not discovery can proceed?",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm surprised you set the bar that high. If we're going to --",
  "Are you going to say that if -- if there's no answer, then the challenge is presumed to be correct?",
  "All right. So the trial judge can -- can overrule the challenge.",
  "It seems to me that's quite different from the standard that requires it go to the jury. You send a case to a jury if there's evidence from which the jury could find for the plaintiff.",
  "And that's -- it -- it seems to me that's a -- that's much more rigorous than the standard that you've proposed in -- in your brief, and that -- and that other courts use in the Batson case. The Batson inquiry, as -- as I understand it, is -- is simply that, an inquiry. There's a basis to ask the prosecutor the reason. That's all.",
  "And -- and that's quite different than sending a case to the jury.",
  "And -- and it seems to me the -- your -- there's some difficulty in -- in trying to equate Batson challenges and -- and title VII, and that's because your beginning point is that you base -- you - - you require too much of the prima facie case. It -- it seems to me all that's required under Batson is reason to inquire.",
  "And that's -- that's a special use of the term prima facie. Now, if -- if we want to be consistent with the use of the word -- of the term, prima facie, from Batson to title VII, then it seems to me this inquiry is necessary. But -- and you're the one that puts it in motion by setting this rather high threshold that is the same as to go to a jury. I disagree with that.",
  "And -- and is that like permitting discovery to go forward?",
  "And -- and is that standard less than going to a jury?",
  "All right. So that -- that's -- I recognize that it's been difficult for us to find an analog. It may be that Batson is sui generis. It may not be. If we're going to talk about what judges are familiar with, then it's prima facie case and it's title VII.",
  "I -- I take it in your view the California standard is more strict than the title VII standard for prima facie case.",
  "And do we say that that equates to a standard of more likely than not or do we not say that?",
  "Is -- is step one of title VII more likely than not?",
  "Well, I don't see how that's much different from what California is doing.",
  "Well, do -- do you agree that the California standard is more rigorous than the standard applied by the Federal courts and by most State courts?",
  "Do you think the California rule is the same as the Federal rule?",
  "Well, what about Hanson, and is it Purkett v. Elem?",
  "Why -- why is the defense attorney in a better position to explain the -- the motives of the prosecutor than the prosecutor?",
  "I don't understand that.",
  "The question is what motivated the prosecutor. Correct?",
  "It's hard for me to see how the -- the defense counsel is in a better position than the prosecutor to show that.",
  "But, of course, you can afford to be very rigorous at step two because your threshold at step one is high. The threshold is -- if the threshold at step one is -- is easier to cross, then we could be more rigorous at -- at step two.",
  "But -- but your test is -- is that the judge under California law is required to find that there's a strong likelihood or a reasonable likelihood, but he must do that without hearing the prosecutor's reasons. That's your position. Right?",
  "Could I -- I just confirm my understanding of how the jury selection process in California works? All the for-cause challenges are -- are made and ruled upon. Then there are 12 jurors in the box, and then you make the peremptory challenge juror by juror. Is that correct?",
  "After the for-cause challenges have been - -",
  "been exhausted.",
  "Well, of course, I take it the issue doesn't even arise unless the amendment is accepted under 15(a).",
  "And if there's been lack of diligence, et cetera, and -- or some prejudice to the State in the delay of the amendment, the Court just won't accept the amendment.",
  "Or am I wrong about that?",
  "How long does it usually take to file a responsive pleading?",
  "Well, just before we leave 15(a), let's assume that we do not accept your position in this case and there's potential for a gaping hole in AEDPA. Does the State have some ability to protect itself by filing a responsive pleading and cutting off the amendments, or must it do so only if it is ordered by the Court to file a response?",
  "Do you see what I'm - -",
  "The successive petition rules, or the rules prohibiting successive petition, seem to treat the entire attack as one -- as one legal theory, as one case. And it seems to me to be in -- somewhat intentioned for that, for you to break it down the way you want to under Rule 15(c).",
  "It's a -- it's a little odd for the statute to say that the rules apply; and then we look to the rules, but we interpret it differently. I certainly see the common sense of your position, but I'm just having a problem with 15(c)(2).",
  "If I sue for negligence or, in any civil action we might -- we might imagine, there might be three or four ways in which the Defendant has injured me, and the Tiller case, the railroad case, tells us that it's a single action. And do you concede this, that you're asking us to interpret this differently and more narrowly than in the civil context?",
  "Or do you concede that?",
  "Well, it's hard for me to figure it out, too, but it seems to me that what you're saying is that we have a different rule, because this is habeas.",
  "So to complete Justice O'Connor's -- the answer to Justice O'Connor's question, you say, \"And we interpret this differently in habeas than in other cases, because of finality concerns.\"",
  "You want us to interpret it differently.",
  "Well, I'm sure it would be acceptable, but what's the authority for interpreting the rule two different ways, depending on the case?",
  "Let's - -",
  "Let's take - -",
  "Let me -- let me ask you. Take the two events in this case, and as explained by Justice Breyer, a Miranda violation in the questioning and then a problem with the confrontation clause in the trial, two years later. Let's assume that there was a 1983 civil action for those violations, and let's assume that both are actionable. Different cause of action. Is that - - how would -- how would an amendment be treated in a civil action? Based on most of the lower-court precedents you've been-- would the amendment related back?",
  "You would think no relation back, in the case I put - -",
  "Well, what -- what is the rule if there are two successive -- there are successive trials with different defendants and there can only be one shooter and in each trial it's found that the defendant is the shooter? What should be the rule, or does the -- does the second person get the advantage? Does the State have to begin all over again with both? Or -- or does the State have no obligation to correct either?",
  "Well, it isn't that -- isn't one of the answers to Justice Breyer's questions that you -- you never know exactly what a fact finder would do. What you have to deal with are reasonable likelihoods and reasonable possibilities.",
  "And when -- and when you have someone who shoots the first person and is obviously attempting to kill him, and then there's an apparent discussion -- not -- not 100 percent clear that those were the two voices. It's pretty clear because there were only two other people there. So we talk about reasonable likelihoods, don't we?",
  "Yes. Now, the -- the jury in the Wesley trial rejected that position.",
  "Well, but it's at the bottom of page 187. We're on this same point. Given these circumstances - -",
  "187 like the -- of the joint appendix. Given these circumstances, although we believe the evidence does prove he was the shooter, I don't believe it makes any difference when you have two people acting in concert for the joint and unlawful purpose of committing an aggravating robbery. That's at the top of 188.",
  "Well, I think there's quite a difference in -- in case A where you say our position is that Stumpf was the shooter, pure and simple. That's it. In case B, they say we think Stumpf was the shooter. We're not 100 percent sure, but he should get the death penalty. The alternative is before the sentencer and the sentencer can make that determination.",
  "Suppose the State had said on motion for resentencing in Stumpf's trial, Your Honor, we took the position that Wesley was the shooter in Wesley's trial. The jury disbelieved that. We accept the jury's verdict. Our position now is that -- that Stumpf was the shooter. We've learned from the jury verdict in the Wesley trial. We've had 12 people. They heard the evidence. We'll accept that. Any difference in that case and what we have here?",
  "It -- it would -- in the case I put, would your argument be the same, and if so, why?",
  "Would that -- would that - - would that be explained by the research-tool doctrine, or not?",
  "I guess what I was asking, Would you ever use the peptide as a research tool, was my -- was my question.",
  "Did the earlier process that you described, the basic research, is that within the common law research exemption?",
  "How does the common law research exemption figure into this case, if at all?",
  "Does Scripps -- is Scripps in the business, too?",
  "Is it just before the letter \"b\" on 14a?",
  "Is there a difference between you and Merck concerning the scope and extent of the common law research exemption? And if there is, does that even enter into our case?",
  "And -- and where the time limit begins to run even before the act occurs?",
  "Well, did we take this case on the ground that he wasn't adequately advised or did we take the case on the ground that even if he were advised, he'd still have his right?",
  "Well, I -- I take it you would challenge the validity of the waiver even if he were advised?",
  "And even if he said, I hereby waive?",
  "How -- why is that prejudicial to him? He says, okay, I can't plead guilty. I really did it but I can't plead guilty. Go ahead.",
  "Why doesn't he just have a trial? He says, I'm not going to contest the trial.",
  "Now, is that what you were going to say to Justice Souter, before I interrupted, that it's - - that it's far-reaching.",
  "Can -- in your view, can the State require a waiver of the right to appeal for everyone?",
  "Well, I'm not so sure. It certainly goes to the importance or the significance of the underlying right. My understanding is -- correct me if I'm wrong -- that in the Federal system, we require waivers of the right to appeal frequently, even waiver of the right to appeal the sentence even before the sentence is calculated, as I understand it.",
  "And do you question the lawfulness of that?",
  "Well, he does --",
  "-- he does go on to say that -- that he can appoint a lawyer for -- in certain instances. He doesn't complete the explanation by saying there are other instances and when I will not appoint one. That he leaves out, although this a represented defendant.",
  "He had a counsel at the plea hearing.",
  "Appeals as of right?",
  "At that point when the court makes that examination under your rule and it comes to point six - -",
  "-- does it refer at any point or in any circumstance to AEDPA?",
  "I was going to ask the same question. It's about as pedestrian an issue as you could get. It comes up all the time. I mean, this is not a cosmic legal issue.",
  "But you're -- you're saying it is extraordinary.",
  "Well, I had the same comment or the same reaction as Justice Ginsburg. Forget about the habeas area. Just in -- with general civil judgments, have there been Law Review articles saying that rule 60(b) undermines finality? People kept going back, back, and back. I -- I thought quite the opposite, that we were living very well with rule 60(b).",
  "Where -- where do you disagree with Judge Carnes?",
  "With -- with the majority of -- in -- in the Eleventh Circuit.",
  "And your fee applies to all Michigan-plated vehicles. Am I correct about that?",
  "Yes.",
  "I'd like to get back just for a moment - -",
  "-- to the answer you gave about apportionment because I wasn't quite sure I understood the answer. You said, well, apportionment is very difficult. What are you supposed to do? What are you -- what's the base? Well, and you said, should we apportion against -- between in-state and out-of-state, and I would think the answer is yes. That's the whole point.",
  "And if we're talking about mileage here, maybe this is something that's eminently susceptible of apportionment. Now, it may be that administratively this is just too expensive. That may be -- that may be a very valid argument. But so far as saying that there's no basis for apportionment, I didn't understand your answer.",
  "It would be difficult to do administratively. But -- just because of the cost of collecting all the - -",
  "That -- that -- I agree that that is expensive. However, it seems to me that it would be easier to do it with trucks which have miles than with - -",
  "-- than with, say, attorneys or accountants or whatever.",
  "Of course, it -- it does. Number one, it's somewhat suspect at the outset because it applies only to interstate travel.",
  "And -- and then the -- the other vehicles pay $100 for the -- for the in-state fees, and so this seems to me that -- that on -- on its face shows that it's like a registration fee.",
  "Well, there are -- are they any - -",
  "Well, are there any circumstances in which the court can -- and let's again, as Justice Souter said, say that it put it on the record what it was going to do, that we hereby, after the Supreme Court has ruled in the case, will withhold -- order that the mandate shall be withheld for a period of 30 days because there is a -- a new case coming out on a different issue that may affect our -- our holdings?",
  "Or that a new case has been - - has been released and we think that bears on -- on the outcome.",
  "And we want to consider that.",
  "Yes, or after disposition by this Court on it - -",
  "-- when cert is granted.",
  "No -- so no circumstances can the issuance of the mandate be extended after this Court has denied the petition for writ of certiorari?",
  "Under no circumstances?",
  "I just want to get -- if I may just get -- you say there are no circumstances in which - - where (d) is otherwise applicable, the mandate can -- can be -- the issuance of the mandate can be extended.",
  "Let -- let me ask you this. Your -- I think you say that you -- you cannot extend the period for issuance of a mandate after the Supreme Court has denied the petition. Could the court then issue the mandate and then recall it under Calderon?",
  "Let's -- let's take the hypothetical where there is an extraordinary -- where it -- it does rise to the very high level. And then you have these facts. They just don't say anything and -- and they keep the case. If they could have issued the mandate and then recalled it, what difference does it really make, assuming there is an extraordinary circumstance? I know you deny that.",
  "Was -- was it before the - -",
  "-- court of appeals in the petition for rehearing after the court of appeals made its decision?",
  "So -- so it was referenced in the petition for rehearing.",
  "You're on -- you're on the court of appeals. They're proceeding for execution. The families of the victims know. The -- the accused, the condemned man, is being -- you tell your colleagues, let's just say nothing about this. You think that's good practice?",
  "It's consistent with the rule not to enter an order that you're extending the time?",
  "That's a very strange reading of the rule.",
  "Well, we might address the - - the issue of whether this is that extraordinary. Number one, the court of appeals did have reference to this deposition in the petition for rehearing that was filed with it. Number two, the -- the testimony of -- of the psychiatrist bears on the issue but the -- there was a hearing on that point and another psychiatrist disagreed.",
  "Well, but let's -- let's assume for the moment -- you may disagree. Let's assume for the moment that the Calderon standard applies. There has to be an extraordinary showing. And the State has made an argument here that this isn't that extraordinary. We see these cases all the time.",
  "Well, of course, this court - - this -- in this case the State court thought it was in the system. It -- it set an execution date.",
  "Did -- did the stay remain in effect in the district court, in your view?",
  "Yes. Respondent represents that the stay of execution was entered in the district court and it stayed in effect.",
  "At what point in your view did that stay become dissolved?",
  "But suppose you persuaded -- and I know that is not this case -- suppose you persuaded the person to destroy the documents in order to conceal a fraud. Would that be corrupt?",
  "Well, in order to -- let's say it's a revenue audit, and you know that it's a fraud, and you persuade somebody to destroy the documents in order to conceal the fraud.",
  "Yes.",
  "My question is, Does that give -- would that give some content to the meaning of \"corruptly,\" in your view?",
  "Suppose you're anticipating a revenue audit from the Internal Revenue Service or from the SEC, and you destroy certain documents that you're not required to keep, but that would make the officials' task easier; he you could perform the audit in just a couple of days, instead of -- it's going to take him a week. Can you make it harder for him?",
  "There is, in the case, this lingering feeling that something's wrong out there. I know that we don't -- we don't convict people on that basis; we require something more specific.",
  "Suppose I just don't like the IRS, and I know they're coming. I have some very detailed summaries which will give them the answer they need right away. I throw away those summaries and make them go back to the original records just to make it tough for them. Can I do that?",
  "But I -- just to make it clear, I take it you would still have the same objection to the deficiency of the corruption instruction, even if a proceeding were pending, or am I wrong about that?",
  "Suppose I have a company and I know that the pattern is, I'm going to be audited every five years by the IRS. And in year four, I -- one year -- one year before the investigation, I instruct my bookkeeping staff, \"Keep everything you need to document our expenses, but destroy everything that's remotely related to that, or indirectly related to that. Give them just a clean, simple file. Destroy anything that's -- all supporting documentation. Give them what they need and what they're entitled to have, but nothing else. And step up that policy, because they're going to be here next year.\" Under your -- it seems to me that that violates your rule.",
  "But your definition of \"subvert, undermine\" is, if you destroy any document that might raise a question, say, in the IRS audit. It seems to me that is a sweeping position, which will cause problems for every major corporation or small business in this country. I just -- I just don't understand it.",
  "Well, that's like in -- the old -- the rule in the Army, \"Make two copies of everything you throw out.\" I mean, that's what they're going to have to do.",
  "If you -- if you had alleged that they did this in order to cover up a fraud, there would be no problem. But what you're doing is to say it's illegal to do what every other company in the country can do if they don't have an audit immediately on the horizon. I just don't understand it.",
  "So, you think Steiner is irrelevant?",
  "But do you have compensated activities that do not begin the workday?",
  "What happens with the microchip or a laboratory with highly contagious viruses where there's got to be two hours of scrubbing and then there's a walk? What do you do with that?",
  "Two hours of scrubbing -­",

  "-- but then there's a walk. What about the walk?",
  "No, no, no.",
  "But that's -- but suppose -­",

  "My problem with your argument is Steiner.",
  "Well, what about the dog grooming cases?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, but aren't they going to tell us that -- as a practical matter, that the tax is really being collected for the retailers? It's just being passed on to the retailers, but paid by the -- I take it that the distributor -- the way this works -- I, again, had problems with effect -- I take it the distributor sends out a truck. And if he sends out the truck to the tribe, then the distributor just pays the tax, and the tribe would want that tax to be -- that fuel to be distributed, less the cost of the tax.",

Why can't the tribe say, \"We're not going to tax you if you come to the reservation. Come on in and buy our gas. No tax\"?",
  "Why isn't -- why isn't that part of the tribal sovereign right?",
  "And I just don't -­",

But then, my question -- and if -- if you had, in fact, given that answer, my question -­",
  "-- my question would then be, Isn't that an odd statutory scheme, where the Attorney General can find it to be an abuse of the use of the drug if the State of Oregon has specifically told its doctors, under special procedures in defined circumstances, that they can administer it?",

  "-- that's -- that's a -- the slipper-slope argument that I wanted to explore a bit. If we do rule against you, and for the State of Oregon, on the statute, you do think that there will be some other serious consequence which will hinder the Department of Justice in an orderly implementation of this statute, particularly under the abuse formulation?",
  "But part -­",
  "-- part of the regime referred to under the statute -- and it's 801(a) implementing the convention on psychotropic drugs -- and there, the implementation incorporates the treaty -- but it says that, \"This shall not displace the judgment of the medical community, as determined by the Secretary.\" And it seems to me that that cuts against you in this case.",

  "Well, it seems to me -­",
  "-- very odd to have a regulation on dispensing that takes no account of the purpose for which the drug is being used.",

  "In all events -­",
  "-- in all events, it seems to me that it's still cut against you. This is a statutory scheme where, you point out, the parents have access to some initial consultation. In most instances -- or in many instances, people who are suing an institution don't have that initial access. Here, the parents get much more initial information than most -- than most petitioners do --",
  "-- than most -- than most complainants, than most aggrieved persons do.",
  "Then let -­",
  "-- let me point -- let me point out something else. Let's assume a state of affairs -- just assume that school districts -- many of them -- independently and, I think, collectively, because school districts talk to each other -- have a growing body of data and expertise about IEP. And this is the basis on which you say that they should come forward. It seems to me that, too, though, cuts against you, because when a school district has expertise, I think it's entitled to a presumption of governmental deregularity. And you have to challenge it.",
  "Well -­",
  "-- to the -- to the extent that we're concerned about unnecessarily increasing costs on school districts, and burdens on school districts, why shouldn't we have a uniform Federal rule? In other words, if we agree with your position that ordinary allocations puts this on the complainant, we have to conserve resources, and so forth, why should we allow States to have a different rule, when we're dealing with the administration of a Federal program?",
  "-- there hasn't been finding of any violation by the school district. The school district -­",
  "But I -- but I'm interested in --",
  "-- I'm interested in Justice Ginsburg's question. Let's assume you show a violation. Is there -- is there any law on who has the burden of showing that the remedy is sufficient?",

  "You're asking about the -­",
  "-- about the -- wait a minute. Let's say that the -- we find that there's a violation.",
  "Well, I suppose the reason behind this distinction -- and it's, in a sense, artificial, because we made it up -- I suppose the reason is that, in the \"weighing\" State, the concern is that if there is an ineligible -- or an invalid factor in the eligibility determination, it carries over with a degree of force and weight -- it's almost -- it's a presumption that the jury is liable to treat it -- or, at least the jury is liable to treat it as such. And I see that same aspect to this case, when the instructions refer -- as you indicated in your colloquy with Justice Souter -- that the instructions specifically say \"any special -- any special circumstance which has been found.\"",
  "Am I right that the special --",
  "I have one background question. And maybe I've missed something. Number 14, \"murder was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel\" -- taken alone, that would be vague. But I thought that in Profitt we said that if it were -- if there were a gloss given by the courts in interpreting that standard so that it was made more specific, evidenced in a pitiless attitude, pitiless crime, that then it was valid. Has a Federal court, or have we said, that this provision is unconstitutional? Or do we just assume that in this case?",
  "Or am I missing --",
  "Yes.",
  "Invalid as a matter of Federal law?",
  "Okay.",
  "So, now we have an extra layer of complexity, because something that's been held unconstitutional under State law is said to skew the weighing, if it is weighing, as a matter of Federal law.",
  "All right.",
  "Was it --",
  "-- was it this case in which the Supreme Court of California made the definitive interpretation --",
  "-- that this is -- what was --",
  "Engert. I can find it, thank you.",
  "Well, of course, this goes to a question, really, for the Respondent. It helps -- there is a paradox here. To the extent that a State attempts to guide and to limit what the jury can consider in the selection phase, it's held to a higher standard. There is -- there is certainly a paradox there.",
  "Maybe --",
  "-- so, in this -- or, weren't there previous California cases -- or, again, correct me if I'm wrong -- where California says the reasonable- possibility test requires the defendant to establish that the error was prejudicial? I thought that was the California law. Or am I wrong?",
  "But it's not -- it's prefaced by circumstances of the crime.",
  "And this State, and other States, can determine, \"Oh, the victim was in fear for a long time, or was tortured.\" It seems very odd that a State, which is a so-called \"non-weighing\" State, could allow all of this same evidence to come in, but California, which tries to give some structure, is suddenly held to a higher standard. That's paradoxical.",
  "Of course, it's -- it's invalid only because it's too vague for eligibility. It's not invalid because it's too vague for selection.",
  "Do you -- do you defend that the difference in -- our distinction between balancing and non-balancing -- or, pardon me, \"weighing\" and \"non­ weighing\" States -- your answer to Justice Breyer indicates the -- that you would not be disconsolate if we jettisoned the whole -- the whole distinction. And isn't it true that it's paradoxical that a State which tries to structure the selection phase by giving specific factors as held to a higher standard than a State that doesn't? That seems to me very odd.",
  "But it is within the contours of the Constitution if, in a \"non-weighing\" State, the same evidence could be considered.",
  "In that --",
  "-- analysis, would you use, as one factor, the circumstance that an eligibility determination was made by the jury, was focused on by the prosecutor, and that that was impermissibly vague? Would that be a component of your harmless-error analysis?",
  "Would it be a --",
  "Well, we have the rule, already, that if there is an invalid eligibility factor and it's a \"weighing\" State, that there's -- that the process is defective. Would you carry over that same argument just as one component of the harmless-error analysis?",
  "But that was the whole basis -- correct me if I'm wrong -- for the Ninth Circuit's case in your -- Ninth Circuit decision in your favor in this case. In this case, it certainly --",
  "-- is an accurate description of --",

  "I suppose it's a hard case - -",
  "Well, I'm not sure that that was clear from the decisions of this Court. Certainly, that wasn't what was involved in Pickering. That was outside speech.",
  "And the same -- and the same with Connick. So, I'm -- if you're saying that this is what the circuits have understood, fine, but that's not this -- that's why we took this case.",
  "Well, let's assume that - -",
  "-- I think that that's an open question under Pickering, and that this case presents it. Do you -- do you concede -- and maybe you don't -- that there is any category of first amendment speech, as a matter of public concern, which an employee cannot direct to the employer? Are there -- are there some matters as to which the employer can protect its own interests and stifle the employee's speech?",

  "What - -",
  "-- what you're saying is, is that the first amendment has an office and a function within the confines of a Government agency that it doesn't have outside. That's a curious calculus. It seems to me that the first amendment has its most application when you talk to newspapers, when you talk outside. That's what the first amendment's about. The first amendment isn't about policing the workplace.",
  "So, we do this - -",
  "-- so we do this as a -- so we do this as a matter of what is sound management principles for a Government agency? How does that relate to the first amendment?",
  "Well, that - -",
  "There would -- in this case, unlike any other case I've seen in the employment area, there is a hearing in -- before a court of general jurisdiction, who goes into this. That's what the criminal trial is for. And he did. There was also a grievance proceeding.",
  "Do I understand that you would accept the rule that if Arizona held a private inspector liable to third persons for their injuries, then the Government of the United States would be liable? It's not quite the Good Samaritan -- not quite the Good Samaritan type, but you would accept that as the proper measure of your liability in a case like this?",
  "Yes.",
  "It gets ahead of the argument just a little bit, but you had a footnote about police officers. You have a park ranger, Federal employer. Is the analog there that we look to -- what the duties of a private security guard would be -- what do you do with those cases?",
  "So, even with the police officer, I have to find a private analog.",
  "Well, but it seems to me that that's quite a foreseeable possibility. If there is such a thing as private safety inspectors in Arizona -- I'm not sure, but if there are, I assume that what they do is, when they go into a particular industrial area, they look at the safety standards for that industry, including Federal and State regulations. So, if you have a mine inspector, then it seems to me that his liability might very well be measured by whether or not he's inspected the mine in accordance to Federal safety standards.",

  "It's just a background question. I'm curious, was ASARCO sued here, or -- and is its liability capped by workmen's comp laws, or?",
  "But we can remand for that. What's here is, the Ninth Circuit held that there's liability based on what the liability of a State agent would be, and that's just not the rule.",
  "So, we have to give some instructions as to how the -- as to whether or not the Ninth Circuit is right about that.",

  "Well, do you think the waiver argument that's made is properly before us?",
  "You may be right about that, but, while I've got you here, let's assume just one State entity, not multiple State entities. And the State has received a preferential transfer of $2,000. It still has an outstanding claim -- a different claim against the same bankrupt for $1,000. And it goes in to enforce its claim for $1,000. Could we hold, consistently with the eleventh amendment, that that is a waiver?",
  "No, different claim. The --",
  "One, the State received $2,000 worth of taxes, but it -- still have its $1,000 contract claim.",
  "I'd like to get away from in rem and back to the waiver aspect that's being argued here. Let's assume that there is an offset obligation that the State has to comply with, that there's been a preference and it has another claim, and with just one entity. If that's true, it seems to me somewhat unfair to say that the State can proceed on multiple fronts with different entities and fractionate its immunity so that if there are more than three entities -- or if there are three or four entities, each one is judged separately as to the offset obligation. It seems to me that if one State entity is subject to offset, then all of them are.",
  "Otherwise, the State immunity, it seems to me, can be -- can be fractionated.",
  "But I -­",

  "And now -- and now I want to extrapolate from that to multiple entities, each of which asserts its own immunity.",
  "Take your time. We're interested --",
  "Well, it's the same question. But let's say that the court thinks there might be merit to the argument of waiver, that the State entity comes in asking to be treated as a creditor, and its preference is then before the bankruptcy court. How is that issue preserved in the question you raise? You say, maybe the Congress used Article 1 to abrogate the State's sovereign immunity.",
  "It just seems to -- seem to me to be part of the question presented.",
  "Well, you asked -- you framed the question.",
  "Oh, no, you -- you're right. You're right. You're exactly right.",
  "And the proof of claim in VMI was $43,000, and the preference was $25,000.",
  "Well, but -- I mean, you say that, but the title goes to the dealer. The dealer makes the purchase. Aren't you -- as I understand your answer to Justice Stevens, and also your answer to the Chief Justice, if these were automobile dealers that sold some inventory, there would be a cause of action if you extrapolate this -- these kind of facts. One dealer being discriminated against, vis-a-vis another dealer.",
  "Well, of course, if we can go back to the language, it's between different purchases of commodities of \"like grade and quality.\" And that seems to me to indicate that Volvo Trucks, generically, must be looked at -- the policy, with reference to Volvo trucks, generically.

Is there a middle ground that there -- which I think would allow you to prevail here -- that there is a presumption that there is a compelling governmental interest when it's in Schedule 1?

But what we're -- what we're talking about, it seems to me, is, rather, a commonsense inquiry as to whether or not it was voluntary, as to which I don't think you necessarily lose your case, but it seems to me that at least these have to be considered in determining whether or not it's voluntary.",

Otherwise, you're double counting.",
  "I agree with that. But I want -- what I think the Court is trying to find is some explanation of the threshold test for determining whether or not there was a voluntary initiation.

  "Well, I -- I take it Justice Ginsburg's point -- and it's my concern as well -- is that if the Bivens action is brought first, there's no protection of the Government against multiple actions. So -- so the policy that you're arguing for just is dependent on which suit happens to be brought first.",
  "And that's not -- that's not a very strong policy interest to vindicate by expanding the collateral order doctrine.",
  "Well, it depends on -- it depends on -- on how the case was resolved.",
  "But what -- what significance do you give to the word to complete, as to whether it's a complete bar? Doesn't that indicate that the -- the statute is -- is a bar to all -- all further actions after a judgment?",
  "Yes, but the petitioners requested it. Did -- did you oppose that request below?",
  "Yes. I -- I thought -- I thought the district court said I'm going to deny the motion to certify because the issue is clear in my view, but if you think you have a collateral order doctrine, then go ahead and take your appeal.",

  "Do you think the existence of the laws of -- of -- the existence of the lawsuit -- of -- of the presumption is what drives a lawsuit?",
  "Well, except that the -- the Chief -- Chief Justice's question -- and it -- it's the same question as Justice Souter had and is what concerns me. My -- my understanding -- and it's not an understanding based on any experience litigating in this area -- is that when you hire economists, in order to establish market power, this is a substantial undertaking. It's -- it's a significant part of litigation costs. And what you're saying is that this is an important rule so that we -- we vindicate the important rule by putting the presumption on -- on the defendant. But you can say that with many important rules in many other areas.",
  "Your first answer to Justice Souter was that the physician would say you can't be prosecuted under our law. Do you mean this act that we're looking at here? Or do you mean the law generally including constitutional protections that this Court has proclaimed?",
  "Because of the text of the act or because of some policy that the attorney general would follow in order just to decline to prosecute? We want to know what this act says in the instance posed by Justice Souter.",
  "Suppose I were to conclude that under Casey, this fraction test applies to this case. Suppose I were to say that Salerno should not be applicable in this case. How should I rule in this case?",
  "Could the plaintiffs have filed a narrower action attacking the adequacy of the bypass procedure?",
  "Suppose I am concerned that the record doesn't explain to me one way or the other whether or not your and the medical profession's definition of immediate allows time to make one telephone call to a judge.",
  "Well, there can be nurses or attendants that can get the judge on the line.",
  "Well, I've looked at those procedures and it seems to me that those are interpreted as what should happen in the ordinary case. They certainly don't preclude making a phone call and there can be phone calls for warrants in criminal cases in New Hampshire. That's specifically provided.",
  "The problem was, it seems to me, that the bypass procedure can go a long way toward saving this statute, but this was not litigated in the trial courts. We don't know what New Hampshire's position is going to be. We don't know what the facts are.",
  "The purpose is to save the statute which has thousands of applications that are valid.",
  "But that's what happened and you're here defending that judgment.",
  "Well, I'm with you --",
  "-- up to the point where you say it went as far as it possibly could. As Justice Scalia indicates, why didn't it say, \"This is the way the Act must be interpreted,\" period? So, it didn't go as far as -- I'm just quibbling with your -- I'm just quibbling with your statement that it went as far as it possibly could. I don't think it did. That's the problem.",
  "We got you off of --",
  "We got you off of your first point, but I'd like to just loop back to that for a minute, at this point. Is this imprecision, this ambiguity, grounds for our reading -- our insisting on reading our earlier remand and judgment literally and saying that there are no predicate acts -- there are no predicate acts that support this judgment?",
  "Do -- is there some prudential argument for us not to reach this issue and just insist on the wording of our earlier mandate?",
  "What do you mean? It's a separate --",
  "-- a separate offense?",
  "So you charge two counts for violating the same section?",
  "Two separate violations, each of which violates the same statute?",
  "I have -- just have one question. If we were to adopt the Petitioner's first suggestion that we should simply have a strict reading of our mandate, would that cause problems, so far as people interpreting our precedent and indicating that, by implication, we've reached this Hobbs Act question?",
  "Was it raised? Was that objection, the jurisdictional question, raised in the briefs and --",
  "But the grievance procedure covers it, and you took pains to point out to us that necessarily entitled to findings and -- and written conclusions, et cetera. But there’s a reason for that. The reason for that is that these things can be very, very minor. So now you’re saying that just because of -- the grievance procedure doesn’t entitle you necessarily to findings, et cetera, that you can go into court. But the only reason you don’t get those findings is because we know, going in, that they’re so minor. So now the most minor things go to court. That seems very anomalous.",
  "But I’m -- I’m not sure constitutional and the statutory claims, especially if they’re the same thing. necessarily an intent to bifurcate, but I think we had the same --",
  "Well, that’s what -- that’s what you’re asking us to say.",
  "Well, that’s what I mean. This is a very odd system where you have to immediately go to the constitutional claim and you’re foreclosed from looking at the statutory claim.",
  "In -- in those circuits which allow these cases to go to courts, has there been any indication that the courts are flooded with a",
  "Just at the -- at the outset -- and I’m -- I’m not sure you’re prepared for this, but the joint appendix, volume 2, is under seal, right?",
  "In the course of the argument, I think we’d be very interested in knowing about the colloquy that the trial judge had with the attorneys, and if it’s under seal, it’s a little bit awkward to do that. Is there any reason that it has to be kept under seal?",
  "I -- I take it --",
  "-- I take it that the -- the names of the jurors we don’t know because they’re given numbers.",
  "So far as you know, the counsel for the respondent would also have no objection?",
  "Yes, it was then quoted extensively in the Ninth Circuit I thought.",
  "Thank you.",
  "And I -- I noticed the defense attorney, respondent here, did not comment in any way on the -- the demeanor of the -- of witness 16, which means either the -- he -- he saw it and said nothing or he -- he didn’t see it at all. We don’t know.",
  "What -- what is the obligation that we impose on the prosecution in this case to give a coherent explanation of why there -- the juror was excused? That step has proceeded. We’re at that step in Batson where an explanation has to be given. What -- what have we said about how coherent and complete that explanation has to be?",
  "Here, it seems that the prosecutor was somewhat caught off guard or -- or certainly was not extremely clear.",
  "Well, I’m not so sure quickly. They gave notice that there’d be a Batson hearing. She should have known what’s going on.",
  "But the point is once there’s a Batson challenge, it has to be articulated.",
  "Well, the question is would he --",
  "Well, I -- I read it as saying, and therefore I’m going to be careful about finding that there’s been a Batson violation. And I wonder if that’s consistent with what we want trial judges to do when they’re hearing Batson challenges.",
  "Well, what -- what should happen if the trial judge doesn’t see it and a counsel, who’s observant, said, judge, I’ve got a problem with this juror? I don’t know that the trial judge has to -- has to see it, if he believes the counsel.",
  "We’ve -- we’ve all been -- been in court and -- and noticed that sometimes witnesses or jurors or parties or even attorneys will make faces and so forth that’s not consistent with -- with proper demeanor in a courtroom.",
  "Maybe the judge is reading. A judge doesn’t watch -- watch the witness 100 percent of the time. That’s not credible.",
  "Now -- now, number 19 was excused and was a black person.",
  "And -- and a woman. And if that too had been suspicious and challenged, then you might have had a pattern, a pattern of two people, which could have overcome the demeanor testimony -- demeanor claim. But I -- I think on this record that we have to assume that there is nothing wrongful about excusing juror 19 merely because respondent’s counsel here -- you did not pursue that. I -- I read the record as -- as telling us that so far as juror 19 is concerned, there was an adequate reason for excusing that juror. At least respondent’s counsel -- you have not said that there wasn’t.",
  "Well, but number 6 was a young white -- young white male, I believe, and he was excused on the ground of youth. So it’s consistent.",
  "Would you say the same thing about the defense counsel confusing jurors 16 and 19 on page 9? The bottom of page 9, it seems to me Ms. -- Ms. Nachman is confusing juror 19 with 16. They’re talking about 16 and 6, and then Ms. Nachman ends by talking about juror 19. That seems to me clearly to mean number 16.",
  "Well, I -- I don’t think it’s a necessary reading.",
  "In -- in a sense, the standards perhaps ought to be reversed. When you hear the evidence, which is what you do under (e)(1), that is when you’ve determined -- should determine whether it’s unreasonable. You should presume that it’s correct before you decide whether you’re going to hear. So you could argue that they should be --",
  "If -- if I might ask. You have no objection to our unsealing the joint appendix, volume 2.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Well, that's fine, but you were the one that made the argument that they want the same access as other employers. That's --",
  "-- when you -- I just --",

  "But the --",
  "-- the resistance to any statute, I assume, could be justified as symbolic speech.",
  "You mean, they could organize a student protest at the hiring interview rooms, so that everybody jeers when the applicant comes in the door and the school could organize that?",
  "As -- when it's --",

  "Well, --",
  "You think if you --",

  "-- about the practical meaning of \"equal access.\"",
  "What --",
  "What you're --",
  "What you're arguing is that what is, for all intents and purposes, \"conduct\" can be infused by the school, at its option, with a first- amendment quality. Yet your argument would allow schools to exclude anybody in uniform from a cafeteria.",
  "Why not?",
  "What's the point?",
  "It's an express -- it's an -- it's solely for an expressive purpose.",
  "And so for members --",

  "And that's --",
  "-- that's all for an expressive reason.",
  "What's happening here is the perspective employers, the recruiters, are proposing a commercial transaction. And it seems to me quite a simple matter for the law schools to have a disclaimer on all of their e-mails and advertisements that say, \"The law school does not approve -- and, in fact, disapproves -- of the policies of some of the employers who you will meet.\"",
  "That's the end of it.",
  "Do law schools have an interest in the Constitution that other people don't?",
  "All right. Well, I --",
  "-- I suppose, under your view, law schools really shouldn't permit firms -- law firms on campus if those firms, say, oppose -- take litigation positions opposing gay marriage.",
  "That's --",

  "Even with reference to commercial -- proposed commercial transactions?",
  "Can -- can you tell me, Ms. Mahoney, just in -- in a case where the person is directly implicated -- he was the one discriminated against. He obtains in a suit the damages for the loss of the profits in the contract. What are the other damages? Does he get emotional distress?",

  "Suppose that McDonald had had a contract with the corporation that he gets 80 percent of the gross from every contract. Could he then sue?",
  "Well, but -- but in this case, it's pretty obvious they didn't care about the corporation. They cared about him. He was the target.",
  "Are there any --",
  "-- are there any cases where we pierced the corporate veil in order to help the shareholder?",
  "This is kind of an inverse --",
  "-- corporate veil piercing.",
  "Well, in a -- in a sense this is stronger than some tortious interference claims because here the target is this -- this party.",
  "You mean that -- that the injured party has to be the target?",
  "To interfere but not necessarily to injure him.",
  "Are you referring to Runyon, for instance? The parents always had a special relation to the child. It's something of a stretch to say that the corporation has that same relation with its own shareholder.",
  "There's no doubt he's the target. That's the --",
  "Well, let me ask -- ask you this. As a -- rather than presumptions, can we look at this case as a matter of shifting burdens of proof? I -- I take it the Constitution does not require the State to introduce mitigating evidence. That's -- that's the responsibility of the accused.",
  "And so what we're saying here is that when a State shows that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators, then it's the defendant's/accused's burden to go forward and show that they do.",
  "Well, but -- but I take it the State has no duty to adduce mitigating factors.",
  "Well, that's because the defendant hasn't introduced enough evidence of mitigation and that's the duty of the defendant to come forward with it.",
  "Well, you say it's a state of indecision. The jury has decided that aggravating factors have been established.",
  "Why isn't it a reliable determination that, number one, it's a death-qualified accused in -- in any event, and there have been specific aggravators proved? That has been determined. It's now for the defendant, in effect, to show that the mitigating circumstances outweigh this. The -- and you have the bonus that the State has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators have not outweighed the aggravators.",
  "They have made the decision. They have made the decision that the aggravators are there and have not been outweighed. They have made that decision.",
  "That's because the mitigation case hasn't been made.",
  "Well, it's terminating it because there's not enough mitigating evidence.",
  "Well, but in the case before us, the court -- the Kansas court said -- I think it's 24 or 25 of the -- of the headnote -- we are reconsidering the issue.",
  "And made a reasoned judgment about it.",
  "Well, they reopened it to the extent as Justice Scalia has indicated, but they now take a different view of the validity of the State statute.",
  "That's -- that's a decision following a reason, and the reason is a Federal reason.",
  "Well, I -- may -- I want you, perhaps, to elaborate on that, as well. And perhaps the Respondent is the one to answer this question. Do you understand that they, on remand, if they prevail in this case, would want to introduce the mother's live testimony?",
  "We're not sure --",
  "-- all right.",
  "You want --",
  "You want us to hold that. You want us to say that a defense counsel can be admonished by the judge not to make the argument that, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the final penalty. My client claims he's innocent. If, in 20 years, it turns out that there is evidence exonerating him, it will be too late. I want you to consider that and give him life.\" You can't make that argument.",
  "Let me --",
  "-- ask you --",
  "Well, on that --",
  "-- on that substantive point, it does seem -- I assume a Governor could take this into account in clemency?",
  "And I suppose the Governors can do more than juries can. But, still, it seems odd to me that a jury cannot consider that this is a close case. It's been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, of course. It goes at least to whether or not the defendant is obdurate in not accepting guilt. He says, \"I didn't do it.\"",
  "Well, no, the evidence goes to explain why the defendant is taking the position that he does. He said, \"I wasn't there.\" Now, it's true, the jury, in the guilt phase, found that he was ­ -",
  "-- at least it explains his attitude, his demeanor, his refusal to accept responsibility. There's a reason for that.",
  "Well, it would follow from that, that if a State wanted to exclude the defense evidence on alibi from a sentencing jury's consideration -- let's assume it's a new -- a new sentencing jury -- they could do that.",
  "I don't understand that answer, in light of the previous discussion about the deliberate -- deliberately.",
  "Did the Oregon courts take the position that, in the sentencing phase, the \"deliberately\" requirement must be judged just by what was in -- introduced in the guilt phase?",
  "But I thought that --",
  "-- you told us additional evidence on deliberation can be put in the -- in the sentencing phase. But then you're saying that you're not going to do that.",
  "Well, but just --",
  "-- just on the point of the causal relation that the Chief Justice was exploring, I mean, there is a causal relation in a but-for sense. We know that.",
  "I suppose the position of the Respondent is that the minute there's an entry after the knock violation -- the no-knock violation ­ - the minute there's an entry, that injury ceases, so that it's different from a warrantless rummaging- around through drawers and so forth. I suppose that would be their argument.",
  "We've been down this route before in other cases, like Wilson, but it's still a troublesome measure. It's hard for me to believe that if a person has drugs in the pockets of his trousers or on the -- next to the chair where he's sitting, that he wouldn't immediately run and try to dispose them. I just think that it's ordinary behavior. And, if that's so, then it would follow that you never have to knock if you're looking for drugs that might be on the person. Do you have any comment as to that?",
  "But --",
  "But if we say that a likelihood -- or that the -- or substantial probability that the evidence will be destroyed allows the no-knock, why won't that be true in every drug case, other than for what we said in Richards?",
  "I mean, do people say, \"Oh, they've got me now. I won't get rid of the drugs\"?",
  "Well, when there's probable cause to enter, there's no presumption of innocence, is there, or am I wrong?",
  "Suppose there is probable cause for a prosecution, but the prosecutors are extremely busy and they -- they have to select their cases and they select one in which they bring the prosecution against the defendant on account of his speech. Is that a violation of the prosecutorial duty?",
  "Yes.",
  "I'm -- I'm asking is it a violation of the prosecutor's professional obligations and his professional duties?",
  "Just going back to the hypothetical, if -- if you acknowledge -- and I think you must -- that there's a violation of the prosecutorial duty in -- in the instance I suppose, then why shouldn't the law recognize it and -- and give force to that sanction and give force to that rule?",
  "All right. Well, then we'll just change the hypothetical to make it the investigators. The investigators select their case based on this speech that they consider unwelcome.",
  "Well, does he have a right not to be singled out because of his speech?",
  "I asked does he have a right not to be singled out because of his speech.",
  "In other words, you -- you would advise law enforcement officials that they can single out persons for prosecution based on distasteful speech.",
  "What I want you to do is to agree. I -- I think you have to concede there is this principle in the law, and I think your answer has to be even though there's that principle, there's a lot of problems with enforcing it because there are going to be too many suits, it's hard to -- it's difficult for the Government to defend, and -- and so forth and so on.",
  "Have there been cases where in the context of the prosecution, there's been a motion to dismiss the prosecution because it was brought in retaliation for the exercise of the First Amendment right?",
  "Have there been cases in the other courts?",
  "My -- my question was directed to the First Amendment.",
  "Yick Wo.",
  "Yick Wo.",
  "Let -- let me ask you this. Suppose the law enforcement official -- the postal inspectors bring the prosecution to the prosecutor because of their disagreement with his First Amendment views. The prosecutor said, I don't care about the First Amendment views. I'm glad you brought this to me. I'm going to prosecute because there's probable cause here and this is a bad actor. What results?",
  "That's why --",
  "Suppose the prosecutor said, you shouldn't have brought this to me because you -- you're -- you're motivated by the First Amendment. But now that it's here, I have my own independent interest in going ahead.",
  "Now, that -- that means one of two things: either what you're arguing for is not going to bring a flood of litigation, or everyone has assumed that probable cause is a -- is a requirement.",
  "Well, but -- but I'm not sure that that proposition has been established in the cases.",
  "No, no. But the point remains that if in the prosecutorial context that the immunity exists whether or not there's a constitutional violation, then that teaches us that the same rule should apply to this case. That was Justice Scalia's --",
  "Well, taking that point just a bit further, your reply brief -- the reply brief for -- for Shell says that the respondent has conceded that the pricing decision to sell at the same price was not made till 8 months afterwards. I'm not sure that that's quite a fair statement. That isn't inconsistent with its suggestion that there might have been an agreement even before the joint venture to have single pricing. They just waited until 8 months to do it. So I'm not sure that your yellow brief correctly characterized their position. Tell me if I'm wrong.",
  "Were the parties indifferent as to how much of each brand was sold? Texaco didn't care if Shell got 90 percent of the sales? It just didn't care?",
  "But -- but if they cared, doesn't that show that there was still an element of competition, but the competition is suppressed if the price is the same?",
  "One more question and then -- how was it decided how much raw gas would be delivered to the venture by the two parties?",
  "Mr. Minear, you've indicated that in the first 8 months, when there was differential pricing, you said that was the way to allocate profits. I thought they shared the profits on some other basis.",
  "But I don't -- I don't understand, Mr. Alioto, if the profits are -- are not traceable to how much of -- of the two products are sold, if the profits aren't divided that way, why should the two lines be continued to be marketed independently? There's no other analog I can think of in -- in the business world for that. There -- there's no motive to make one any cheaper than the other once the profits are shared evenly, and that's the structure of the venture.",
  "I have two questions on the blood, and there's a lot you want to cover here, so I won't take too much of your time. One, is it significant for your case that this was a very small sample? Two, was the evidence about the enzymatic degradation -- was that available? Was the science about that fully available to the defense at the time of trial? I had those two questions.",
  "But -- but isn't there also evidence that the spillage in the Styrofoam container seemed to be inadequate to account for all of the blood that was missing from the vial?",
  "Well, but that's important for this whole question. Quantity relates to chain of custody.",
  "But there was a finding that it was in the course of the rape.",
  "That was part of that. That was -- that was one of the -- was it one of three aggravating circumstances?",
  "It was found at the guilt phase or the trial phase, the aggravating circumstance?",
  "Well, then at -- at a minimum, it seems to me that the sentencing phase is -- is in question by that. But also, it seems to me if I were a juror and was faced with these conflicting things, I would look for motive.",
  "But -- but the semen was used to -- to connect it to the -- to the defendant, and we now know that that's wrong.",
  "In the first sentence, but not in the venue part.",
  "I was going to ask what -- how does the waiver work? Suppose the judge pre- verdict says, you know, I'm concerned that there are less than 15 employees. Can the plaintiff say, oh, well, now, Your Honor, you can't get into that? They waived that. They didn't raise it. I mean, how does that work?",
  "Under your theory of the case?",
  "You mean the judge just has to watch the case sail over the waterfall and --",
  "Well, in my case nobody mentions it but the judge.",
  "Yes, and the -- and the judge calls it sua sponte to the attention of the parties.",
  "Does -- does it follow from your argument that someone who purchases at a tax sale, before they conclude the purchase, should find out what the State has done?",
  "And the purchaser from that purchaser the same. In other words, if Flowers had sold to X, then X has to make the same inquiry because he sees I guess what, a quit claim deed or a tax sale. So before a purchaser can purchase from Flowers, that purchaser too must see whether or not they hired an outside agency and so forth.",
  "Well, isn't it required to do that under your title, if you're going to have your title set aside by Jones?",
  "Well, what about the purchaser from Jones? If -- pardon me -- from Flowers. If Flowers has spent the money, then that purchaser is out of luck.",
  "So one of the consequences of your rule is to devalue any property sold by the government because it is open to this kind of challenge for deficiency in title. So you've now devalued the property in the hands of the State.",
  "This is the FedEx rule of due process.",
  "This is the FedEx rule of due process.",
  "Can --",
  "Is it of any --",
  "Is it of any relevance to consider the burden or the obligations this rule that petitioners advocate place on downstream purchasers?",
  "I -- I beg your pardon. I didn't hear the names of the cases.",
  "Well, it might have been that 90 feet included a public street and you couldn't go down a public street without -- so -- and so --",
  "It -- it does seems strange to me in a speech case to say we're foreclosing as- applied challenges.",
  "So you think there is a compelling interest in preventing people from thinking about an issue and then calling their Senator during the blackout period. That's the compelling interest that, in effect, you are arguing for.",
  "Are -- are Web sites and chat rooms covered by the McCain-Feingold?",
  "But certainly under your view, they ought to be. If you funded a Web site which was very popular or a chat room, I certainly think it should come within your proscription so that we can't talk about issues during an election.",
  "Well, why -- why not? Suppose -- suppose most people look at the Web site and they don't listen to the -- listen to the radio. I think certainly McCain-Feingold should be extended to that under your view.",
  "General --",
  "And they -- and they could have -- they could have named Senator Kohl, I take it.",
  "It's such an odd calculus. Who is the person more likely to be influenced with an issue ad? The person who's running or the person who's not going to run for 4 years? Obviously, the former.",
  "And that's -- and that's the one area where the ad is prohibited.",
  "So you do -- you do an ideological history, an ideological pedigree of various speakers. You think that's consistent with the First Amendment? That -- that was the ACLU's suggestion which, it seems to me, shows you how far we've gone down this road.",
  "And -- and the difference -- the difference is this is a content-based inquiry.",
  "Can you tell me, do you agree that a holder action falls within 10(b)(5), generally?",
  "But what about enforcement actions taken by the - -",
  "But then, the - -",
  "-- then it does fall within - - holder actions do fall within 10(b)(5), for some purposes.",
  "So, you want us to interpret the text two ways, depending on the purpose.",
  "What would prevent the issuance of just a blanket warrant? We have a warrant for this -- for this premises to be searched.",
  "If they become aware, but the -- it's a big leap from that to say that they must make their own determination of probable cause.",
  "You -- you indicated a warrant can't be served unless they determine there's probable cause, but that's for the magistrate to do, as Justice Scalia --",
  "Well, there's no -- there's no authority for that. I -- I thought warrants were issued to police officers all the time without knowing the -- the precise reason. It's to search the house to try to find X, and the warrant speaks for itself. A judge has made that determination.",
  "I mean, if you want us to write the opinion with this qualification in it, it seems to me that you're making a big change in the way search warrants are used.",
  "Of course, that's not what the -- what the warrant says. The warrant says I'm satisfied that the person or the property so described is now concealed on the premises.",
  "Well, it -- it seems to me that what works in your favor is -- is it SWANCC? I don't -- I'm not quite sure how to pronounce the case.",
  "The Migratory Bird Rule case where we said there had to be a significant nexus. But I think what the Court is asking you is -- is how to define significant nexus. We're -- if you want us just to say, well, this case is too much, but then the Corps of Engineers should use its expertise to come up with a new regulation, that's rather an odd opinion for us to write.",
  "And it seems to me that that's what you're asking us to do here.",
  "Was it -- was it also clear that after the improvement, there would be no drainage?",
  "I'm --",
  "-- I'm still not clear as to what the findings were, if there were findings, as to what the condition would be after the improvement. Would there be an increased likelihood of drainage into the ditch after the improvement?",
  "And -- and if that were so, would that be sufficient for jurisdiction?",
  "But, well -- suppose the interaction were automatic. Would that suffice to make this a wetlands after the improvement?",
  "But your -- your theory is there is regulatory authority because there's an interaction between the wetlands or the lands in question and the navigable waters.",
  "Well, but -- but wasn't -- wasn't the reason for including the adjacent wetlands because of -- of the likelihood of an interaction?",
  "Well, let -- well, please finish.",
  "Your assumption --",
  "-- but this -- this is preliminary to my question. In SWANCC, we said there has to be a significant nexus. It seems to me that you have to show that there's some significant relation between the wetlands you're regulating or seeking to regulate and the navigable water.",
  "And I -- and that's just, it seemed to me, so far been missing from the discussion.",
  "What -- what about the Chief Justice's question, wetlands next to wetlands?",
  "But the Congress in 1972 also, in its statement of policy, said it's a statement of policy to reserve to the States the power and the responsibility to plan land use and water resources. And under your definition, I -- I just see that we're giving no scope at all to that clear statement of a congressional policy.",
  "Well, this --",
  "But this is an important point for me, and I wasn't quite clear what the briefs told me about it. My understanding was that there is an argument that when the water stays in the reservoir, the impoundment area, that there's a stratification, and the oxygen components at different levels change, so that when the water goes back into the dam, it's qualitatively different. It's the same water, in a sense, but it's also qualitatively different in its oxygen and other characteristics. And that sounded to me like a discharge.",
  "So, if --",
  "So, if it were established in this case that the water is qualitatively changed in a significant degree because of its oxygen component, that would be irrelevant to the question you're asking?",
  "Are you --",
  "So, what's --",
  "So, what's the definition - - what's the general definition that you're giving us that describes this result you've given?",
  "It --",
  "It is a discharge, because a \"discharge\" means what?",
  "Well, I -- I suppose that in a purely discretionary system -- I -- I can't quite think of the hypothetical -- the strength of the prosecution's case may bear on the assessment of relevance and materiality as to the evidence the defense wants to introduce. If -- if the evidence of identification is -- is quite clear -- is quite clear -- and then there's some witness of marginal credibility that says he was in another city, I think that may affect the trial court's balance. I -- I take the thrust of your point, that the strength of the case makes it more important to introduce the third party evidence, not -- not less. I -- I take that point. But just as -- as an absolute rule, I'm not sure that the strength of the case is always irrelevant. That's what I'm saying.",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm just not sure that's the case. We're asking about 403. In order to completely exclude and prescind, in Justice Scalia's word, that the -- the nature of the prosecution's case just doesn't seem to me right.",
  "Now -- now, if you want to say there's a more wooden rule and a -- and a more iron rule here that was prejudicial, I think that's something else.",
  "Well, I -- I guess my -- my point -- maybe it's some of my colleagues' point -- is that really the strength of the government's case is subsumed within the general calculus of whether or not this would cause a delay of -- of time, whether it would get into extraneous issues, et cetera.",
  "It's a way of phrasing it.",
  "But quite apart from that, it seems to me that the statement is questionable as an empirical matter. Why is it that forensic evidence somehow should be used to exclude third party guilt evidence as -- as a universal proposition? Maybe in some cases yes, maybe in some -- but this is a universal proposition.",
  "Well, if I were the trial court, in a subsequent case in South Carolina, I would -- I would have to read this instruction of the South Carolina Supreme Court as saying I simply could not admit this evidence when there's forensic evidence. And that's a very strange proposition.",
  "Suppose there had been evidence that the time of death testimony had been contrived, planted, fabricated. Then what? Or suppose that was the allegation of the defense.",
  "But there is a dispute here as to the forensic evidence. The suggestion is it's planted.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I suppose, can pursue her own line of questioning, but let me ask you this, because I -- her question suggests this, to me at least. Suppose the parole officer said, \"Now, look, I'm going to search you. If you don't consent, then I'm going to revoke your parole.\"",
  "I -- my question was a parole officer, and I'll get to police officer next.",
  "When you see the --",
  "-- person on the street, et cetera, et cetera.",
  "Well, so that a --",
  "-- so that a burglar could be searched for burglar tools --",
  "-- but not for drugs? And the drug addict can be searched for drugs, and not burglar tools?",
  "I have one --",
  "I have one --",
  "I have --",
  "But not the consent --",
  "-- not the consent approach, I take it. I didn't get an opportunity to ask the counsel who argued just previously. Seemed to me that he argued consent when he answered Justice Stevens's question about the tax-evader. But he argued the overwhelming practical needs when he argued the rest of the case. And I thought I saw some tension in the argument there. And I take it the Government does not embrace the consent argument?",
  "But you --",
  "-- just --",
  "-- put it in number --",
  "-- you put it --",
  "-- in number three?",
  "In --",
  "But in your view, if the consent was straightforward in the documents, would that be the strongest argument or the weakest argument?",
  "I mean, I take you'll win on any --",
  "-- argument --",
  "-- you can take.",
  "The Government -- is the Government of the United States somewhat behind the State of California? It's not efficient in -- as efficient as California in supervising its parolees? Because you don't have this rule.",
  "So, the -- it's right that there's an obligation if it notices it in the first instance on its first review.",
  "And suppose, under the review proceedings, that District Court is looking at it for the first time, without yet having required a response, and he sees a statute of limitation. I assume there's an obligation.",
  "Sure.",
  "I mean, if -- suppose it's an open-and-shut violation of the statute of limitations, or barred by the statute of limitations ­ -",
  "-- does District Court have discretion to refer to the State for a response?",
  "Really?",
  "No, my --",
  "No, my --",
  "-- my hypothetical is that it is.",
  "Can you tell me? It's my -- excuse me. My understanding was that Arkansas had intervened in the suit.",
  "So after the settlement, I take it Arkansas would -- still would have had the right to -- to pursue its claim in the litigation, or am I wrong about that?",
  "That's what I don't understand.",
  "How can they do that with -- with a party? I mean, the -- and the reason -- the reason I ask is it seems to me that you still have the cause of action left. Maybe that would be my next question. Suppose there's a settlement and you don't get, in the settlement, even earmarks, medical specialists, plus general damages, and you're -- you're unsatisfied. Don't you still have the right under Arkansas law -- or do you -- to pursue the tortfeasor for the balance that's owed to you?",
  "But we're asking how that can be.",
  "We're asking you as a matter of Arkansas law.",
  "Let me -- let me ask you this question so far as the rights of the assignee and the assignor. Suppose it's a very weak case and the litigant says I want to settle for 20 cents on the dollar. Are you saying that there's some kind of duty to notify the State and -- and to consult with the State before this is done?",
  "Okay. Suppose the -- the State says, well, we -- we don't -- we don't agree with you. Then -- then what happens? Then they're at loggerheads and you go to Justice Souter's position I suppose.",
  "Would -- would it -- if -- suppose in the instance I put they -- the -- the State has -- has an objection, but the settlement is made, nonetheless, for 20 cents on the dollar. Do you still think you have the right to receive 100 percent of your payment from the proceeds in the case that I put?",
  "Assume that it's a very weak case. They settle for 20 cents on the dollar. Do you have the right, as you understand the law, to insist that you receive 100 percent of your payments from the gross settlement?",
  "The answer is yes, I take it.",
  "The answer is yes, I take it. In the case I put, the answer is you would think that you're entitled to 100 percent of your payments. So that eats into her general damages.",
  "Well, I mean, why does there have to be enough money in the -- take -- take the -- the case that we -- we put to your co-counsel. Suppose it's a settlement for 20 cents on the dollar. Does the -- does the State have an absolute right to get reimbursement for 100 percent by invading the general damages portion of the settlement?",
  "No, but in my -- can you answer the -- the question? You have the problem. They settle for 20 cents on the dollar. Does the State in that case have the absolute right to a lien or a claim or to a demand for the -- for the proceeds in -- for the balance of the 80 -- for the 80 percent balance of the medical costs?",
  "But that is -- that is as between the State and the third party tortfeasor, not between the State and -- and the Medicare recipient, I should think.",
  "Well -- well, if your rule is just one that you have to pay the 100 percent if there's non-cooperation and a non-notice, that's one thing. But the briefs, it seems to me, indicate that you have an absolute right to 100 percent. And those are two very different propositions.",
  "I -- I know in the case of a jury. But our question is what happens if there's a settlement.",
  "Suppose the State was involved but disagreed.",
  "Suppose the State -- suppose the State is involved in the negotiations and they disagree. The -- the parties in good faith say, we've got to settle this for 20 percent. The State said, oh, your case is much better than that. Please don't settle. Then what?",
  "It has notice. It's involved, et cetera, et cetera.",
  "Do you think under Arkansas law that the injured party as an assignor has a duty to cooperate with the assignee in pursuing the claim?",
  "Is that duty fulfilled by -- by entering settlement negotiations and not even notifying the assignee?",
  "Well, but what you're saying is that there's no duty to notify the assignee if you think you might get a pretty good result for yourself. I don't understand that as much of -- much of a duty.",
  "Well, it certainly would have avoided about 20 minutes of questions in this Court.",
  "Well, just --",
  "Well, to get back to Justice Souter's questions, could you answer it this way? Let's assume that some members of the Court simply accepted the proposition that money buys access. And -- and I don't think maybe we can take judicial of that, but I -- I think that's a common sense conclusion that we can reach. And you tend to fight this in your brief to say that this doesn't happen. I tend to doubt that. I tend to think money does buy access. What -- if -- if we or I were to conclude that, what would follow?",
  "All right. Let's say it's privileged access.",
  "I mean, isn't the answer that the -- that this is up to the voters. The voters can see what's going on and throw the legislator out if they choose.",
  "It -- it is true that all the polls say that there's public disaffection and cynicism. Does that translate into action to defeat incumbents who take particularly large sums of money? Is there -- is there statistical evidence to show that?",
  "Well, suppose three legislators had been corrupted, venal, criminal corruption, actually taking no wink-wink, nod-nod, a specific agreement to vote for money. So what? Does that change your case?",
  "Suppose -- suppose that had been demonstrated in -- in a particular State. Does that mean, in your view, that a State can have strict contribution limits and support?",
  "No. It's true. It's -- it's done. There have been criminal convictions.",
  "Well -- well, if -- if you -- if you concede and -- and you tend, at least, to back away from the proposition that the case I put would be an inadequate ground or an adequate ground for legislative limits, then I suppose you can say the State has the power to prevent this from happening to begin with.",
  "But in -- in any -- or in many campaigns, the -- the issues take shape during the process of the campaign, and there are historical events, national events that suddenly occur that people want to comment on. And I -- I just don't see that there's any capacity for adjusting so that the public can know how candidates are facing issues that are beginning to emerge that the public has a vital interest in. My understanding was that a quarter-page ad in the Burlington newspaper was, I think, $1,400. Now, it's -- it's gratifying to know that Vermonters are splurging on cable television, but it -- it --",
  "-- it seems to me that this is a highly restrictive rule insofar as having the campaign be able to address the issues that the voters say that they've become interested in.",
  "Well, I suppose the Vermont courts could construe it more narrowly at some later point. I would hate to rest the opinion on that.",
  "Well, it did involve, at least the bankruptcy court thought, the judgment invalidating the inter vivos trust. Was that necessary to the decision? Or am I -- correct me if I'm --",
  "-- correct me if I'm wrong about that.",
  "Well, you say -- you say an -- an estate plan. Most people would think insurance policies are part of their estate plan, and if it's alleged that there was a fraudulent alteration of the beneficiary designation in the insurance policies, is that within the Texas probate court jurisdiction?",
  "Well, there's -- there's a further irony here in that revocable trusts are always promoted on the grounds that it keeps us out of probate. And now you're -- you're insisting that it has to be in probate.",
  "Well, but as Justice Breyer indicated, can't you just, for purposes of understanding the cause of action as asserted by Vickie Marshall here, just say, we will assume the trust is valid, we will assume the will is valid? All we're saying was that there's a tort and he's going to be liable to us in tort.",
  "Is -- is the failure to extend immunity to counties and municipal entities in a State just a historical relic? It depends on semantics. Or is there some normative or good government policy that dictates the distinction?",
  "So it's -- it's a matter of respecting the dignity of the States because they participated in the Convention, the plan of Convention?",
  "So it's a historical relic based on the dignity of the State, or the king in one case, and of corresponding lack of dignity of the entities on the other?",
  "Would you -- would you say thoughtful rather than inflexible?",
  "Did the case use the phrase \"capable of repetition and evading review,\" or -- which is a mootness --",
  "I just have to read Craig --",
  "-- on the --",
  "But what's the -- I'm -- as Justice Scalia, I'm interested in the section 25 problem. The briefs --",
  "-- for your co-counsel don't talk much about it, and it's -- it's a problem for me. Justice Scalia's point was let's assume -- and I have some doubt about it. Let's assume that there's a valid reason for redoing section 23. That means you need another district to avoid retrogression. What is -- what is your position as to district 25 on that assumption, based on that assumption?",
  "Well, can the -- can the State by its action with one district, i.e., 23, in effect bootstrap itself in a position where it's entitled to use race where -- in a -- in a predominant and I -- I think insulting way and -- and then have a defense?",
  "And that's a --",
  "But you don't think that's a defense. It seems to me the State creates the very problem that it claims that it must use race to settle.",
  "Well, but let's get back to the -- to the principle without just talking about these -- these factfindings. It -- it seems to me very odd for you to be telling us that partisan gerrymandering is -- is improper when that's the sole or substantial, predominant motivation, but then saying that we can't correct it when it's happened. Let's assume that the 1990 legislative plan was one that was done with -- without a wholly partisan intent, but over the years, it -- it now freezes in the Democrats or party X to having a much greater advantage than the general registration would give it. And if it leaves it in for a particularly partisan purpose, why -- why can't it be redone?",
  "I just don't understand that argument.",
  "Well, if you say that mid- decennial districting is suspect or subject to some special rules, then it seems to me that you're -- you're taking away a very important deterrent that works on legislatures when they do decennial districting. If you know as a legislature, when you do a decennial districting, that your program is going to be presumptively valid or not subject to partisan gerrymandering, then -- then you're -- then you're liable to overreach. And it -- it seems to me very dangerous for this Court to take away that control mechanism that exists so that legislatures know that there's a possibility that if they overreach, they can be corrected.",
  "Well, we're not -- we're not trying the court for a bad intent. We're looking at the effect of what it's done, and if the effect of what it's done is to leave in place something that's slanted based on -- on statewide registration in favor of the Democrats, then -- then, it seems to me, there's -- there's a ground for the new legislature to act. And -- and one -- one reason legislatures may not have redrawn plans often is because they always protect incumbents.",
  "But you're making the assumption that a mid-decennial districting is not interested in compactness, it's not interested in counties, it's not interested in keeping a university within one -- within one district. That's -- that's just simply not true.",
  "But -- but if -- if your -- if your test is that section 2 ought to be opened up to any racial group that could influence an -- an election, I don't see the limits on your principle.",
  "No. Suppose there's a primary where it works that they can get on the ballot. Suppose we're looking at the general election.",
  "Accept the hypothetical.",
  "In 23.",
  "Focus for a minute just on the -- what we can call the removal, the drawing of the lines to exclude some Latino voters. Just focus on that, not the later justification. The district court found that this was for political reasons, not racial reasons, even though it was a largely racial group that was removed. Do you attack that finding as clearly erroneous?",
  "Well, but -- but that was because it was deliberate in that case, and that's not the hypothetical that Justice Scalia has posed.",
  "But that's not the hypothetical that was posed to you by the Justice.",
  "As I -- as I understood it.",
  "Well, can -- can the State use race as the means to an end of electing a new candidate that the race wants? And what should be the difference?",
  "I mean, it sounds like you're going to say race cannot be used as this basis, but how can race be used not to protect an incumbent but to allow the group to choose the representative of its choice and then reelect him every year?",
  "And -- and in your view, that justification allows the creation of district 25, which has, as far as Latino population, people of quite different economic backgrounds and so forth, you know, the -- the two-ended -- the district on the two ends.",
  "That -- that to me was -- was not discussed much in your brief, but it's a serious Shaw violation. And -- and the two are really linked, 23 and 25, in this respect because it was by virtue of what it did in 23, that the State claims a right to do what it did in 25.",
  "And as to 23, do you want this Court to say that it's constitutionally permissible to take away a number of minority voters from the district, but leave just enough so that it looks like a minority? Is that a permissible use of race? It -- it seems to me that's an affront and an insult.",
  "Well, but -- but the additional finding is that 50 percent were kept to make it -- to make it look good.",
  "Well, of course, the reason the lines are straight is nobody is there.",
  "Well, Justice Stevens --",
  "The compactness standard.",
  "Let -- let me ask you this. Suppose you have a court that's required to redistrict, and the court has two experts. Expert number one says, here is a plan. It's totally partisan in its orientation, but it balances the Democratic and the Republican registration. It gives them exactly proportional representation. Plan number two gives minimal consideration to this, but it's compact. It takes into account geography, communities of interest, and so forth. Would the district court be in error if it adopted the first plan?",
  "Well, but my hypothetical is designed to suggest that partisanship, political lines should be certainly a secondary consideration to a valid principled scheme and that perhaps in the hypothetical case, you could reverse a district court for abuse of discretion in -- in overemphasizing political considerations. And then if that's true, it means that there is some standard lurking out there indicating that political considerations should be of at least secondary importance.",
  "You mean 25 -- the -- the Latino makeup of 25 is accidental?",
  "It's accidental.",
  "Are there cases that -- that we've issued from this Court that address what happens in a case like this where the economic circumstances and many other circumstances of the two Latino populations are very different? The border Hispanics and the Hispanics in Austin have very -- very little in common other than -- than the Latino background. Are there -- are there cases that address whether or not these populations can be combined in -- in order to satisfy the -- the Voting Rights Act requirements?",
  "Have we talked about that?",
  "How does the fact that it's sole proof mean that it's testimonial?",
  "I -- it -- it adds to the general appeal of your case I -- I suppose, but what does that have to do with whether or not it's testimonial?",
  "Did -- did she wait until after the 4 minutes to call the police, or did she -- she have the police on the way after the first minute?",
  "She -- she's just typed that out on the computer or something like that?",
  "And then what -- what's your position if she says he beat me 2 minutes ago, he's left, and he's running down the block?",
  "Well, suppose -- suppose it's a thief, and she said he's taken the diamond necklace and he's running -- and he's running away. We know he's not going to come back.",
  "So the -- the jewelry store owner who reports to the -- the police is fleeing on a 911, that -- that's not -- that's not admissible under your view?",
  "Well, what -- what about the -- my hypothetical?",
  "But I'm concerned about the rule you're arguing today because it -- it seems to me there's a good case for allowing the -- the statement by the jewelry store operator.",
  "And -- and I want to know what your position is so that you don't come back next week and say, well, now we want the jewelry store --",
  "We'd rather you analyze the case now and then we'll analyze it later.",
  "And -- and what -- what is the theory on which the statutes are -- are adopted?",
  "What's the argument that they propose to say it's not testimonial? I know you disagree with it, but --",
  "I'm not sure what -- what sense it makes. Two cases. The woman runs out and -- and says, he -- he stabbed me and I'm dying, he's a murderer. Case one, it's a -- a neighbor. Case two, it's a police officer and she sees that he's a police officer. Why -- why should there be a difference? It doesn't make any sense to me.",
  "Well, I thought your test was if she knows that he's a police officer, it's testimonial.",
  "Well, let me put it this way. I don't know why one case is so easier than the other.",
  "But one of the reasons for that is -- let's assume you had a completely honest police officer. You may have a motive on the part of the witness to frame the defendant. I mean, that's another reason.",
  "But I'm suggesting to you that it often happens that there are false charges made that the -- that the police believe to be true.",
  "And this is fully consistent with prohibiting testimonial statements.",
  "Well, I --",
  "-- I suppose the public might have an interest in knowing about this debate. I don't know if you can say there are no public interest served. It might be that there are other counterbalancing first -- interests, but I don't think you could say we have no interest in speech. This was -- this is a -- on its face, a rather interesting -- a rather interesting argument that they're -- that they're having.",
  "They're interested in criminal law, criminal procedure, et cetera, et cetera. speech by public employees cannot fairly be said to be speech as a citizen, then the Government should have a presumptive right to manage its personnel affairs and internal --",
  "Well, that -- yes, that's something different. But your statement, that there's just no First Amendment interest --",
  "Well, no, that's not --",
  "-- that's not -- that's not the hypothetical. So, suppose that a supervising district attorney tells the deputy district attorney, \"Go in and make a misrepresentation to the court, or conceal evidence,\" or whatever --",
  "-- and he refuses to do that, or he goes in and he says the opposite, he tells",
  "Oh, so --",
  "-- so you're saying that there's an exception to your rule, so that if, in this case, he has a -- he has a defense if he said, \"Well, it's my duty to call it as I see it\"?",
  "Then --",
  "Well, then, if that's so, you ought to remand this case.",
  "And -- and I suppose, in California courts and the California bar would have disciplinary mechanisms against the senior attorney who",
  "Does California have, or have not, disciplinary procedures in the hypothetical case where a senior attorney who tells a junior attorney lie to the court --",
  "All right.",
  "Pickering balancing, I take it.",
  "And you concede that's Pickering balancing, anyway.",
  "And --",
  "-- perhaps, 1983, if you go in 1983 -- or arguably a civil rights prosecution against the senior who ordered -- would be those sorts of restrictions. My only point is that the First Amendment is not addressed to speech or writing that an employee undertakes in the -- in the -- in the course of his official duties. This --",
  "I mean, that's the interest that we're concerned with, is of having the Government have the capacity to be able to control the speech of its employees so they could have a consistent policy and so that it can explain to the people what it's doing.",
  "But you're the one that's that there is an interest that's sacrificed by the rule that you request, and that is the Government's interest in regularity and consistency of its speech. They don't have to claim it on a case-by-case basis. You're the ones that are asking us to make this rule.",
  "Are you saying --",
  "Are you -- are you saying the California courts would tolerate a situation where a member of the bar told one of his employees to misrepresent to the court?",
  "The California courts --",
  "The California courts are certainly not tolerating -- and, in fact, this case was heard by a California court, and the -- and the judge, as I read the record -- it's not altogether clear -- seemed to agree with the -- with the police officers.",
  "Is that second point -- is that second point definiteness?",
  "Does definiteness describe this second aspect that you've just --",
  "Just part of it.",
  "It's indefinite because we don't know where our thoughts will take us? Suppose there a patent which requires looking at the clouds in the sky for 10 minutes. I mean, that's maybe absurd, but it's certainly definite.",
  "The opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the appendix begins discussion of claim 13 about page 16a. Are there some, one or two sentences there or a paragraph that you can tell me is completely wrong?",
  "Yes. You're asking us to reverse this court of appeals decision and I'm looking, and particularly with reference to claim 13, the one we're talking about, I assume, and I'm looking through pages, say, 16 and 21 to find something that's absolutely wrong.",
  "You want me to tell the court of appeals, well, you can't do this. But where is it wrong?",
  "So you can't point me to any particular sentence that -- that's absolutely wrong?",
  "And where does it say this?",
  "You see my point? I'm not sure what it is you want me to say went wrong, other than the fact that this patent is, should never have been granted to begin with but that wasn't raised.",
  "Well, if that's -- if there is some likelihood or possibility of this that we should assess, it seems to me that it's imprudent for us to discuss it here when it hasn't been discussed in the court of appeals.",
  "You're urging on us something like plain error, is about what you're telling us.",
  "So you agree or you submit that you can have a definite description of something that's unpatentable because it's too broad?",
  "But, but, but -- well, let's assume that there is a claim that includes something that should not be patentable, because it's too broad or it involves the scientific phenomena, the mechanics of the universe. Can a patent still be definite if it includes that sort of unpatentable claim?",
  "Is there anything in the statute which says how promptly the premiums have to be paid as it -- to -- to make it analogous, say, to withholding where you might have to pay every quarter on -- by a certain day? Does -- does the statute regulate when and how promptly the premiums must be paid, or is that just all comprehended in the terms of the policy agreement?",
  "No. I meant the State workmen's comp law.",
  "Well, I recognize there are different schemes. The only one I'm familiar with is my former State. But did I understand from your answer that in some or many of these States, the employer is free not to have insurance? He can be self-funded?",
  "And is there any requirement that there be an actual fund in place or is it just a general liability?",
  "A bond.",
  "Well, if there were letters of credit, why is Zurich injured? Because the letters of credit were not large enough to cover the premium liability?",
  "What -- what about the -- the example we discussed, payment of a bond premium if you're self-insured?",
  "But I was -- can -- can I -- I still don't quite understand the answer to the bond premium question.",
  "No. No, it wouldn't be subrogated. The bond premium -- the bonding company says we're entitled to priority.",
  "And it files the claim directly with the bankruptcy.",
  "Well, in this --",
  "-- in this case, he was married after the effective date of the new statute.",
  "Did Judge McConnell, in the Tenth Circuit, suggest -- because he discussed this -- suggest that the result might have been different if the marriage had been before?",
  "Why would that be consistent with his -- with his analysis?",
  "Well, but --",
  "-- it does point out that your argument is a difficult one, because this expectation that you argue for is that, number one, he has an expectation that he'd be able to adjust his status even after Congress has changed the law respecting reinstatement.",
  "This is --",
  "-- this is a far-reaching expectation on his part.",
  "And --",
  "And the executive couldn't weigh that. You say, categorically, it -- there's no - -",
  "-- no possibility for discretion.",
  "Well, could the -- could the INS have just stayed its hand for -- in --",
  "No.",
  "Do you read the Tenth Circuit opinion as indicated it might have had a different result if he had been married before the enactment of the statute?",
  "How does that fit with the court's theory?",
  "Yes.",
  "How does it --",
  "Would you agree that there's a requirement that the exhaustion period be reasonable?",
  "Is his best case, your brother's best case, in your view -- and you probably -- may not think of it as a very persuasive case -- Fay and Noia, is that the closest Respondents can come?",
  "You --",
  "Could --",
  "Would Respondent tell us, well, that at least in some administrative law schemes, generally there is a requirement that the exhaustion period must be reasonable?",
  "Well, I'm not sure. It seems to me, as Justice Scalia's question indicates -- I was surprised that we're talking about procedural default. I, too, thought this was an administrative law case. And it's an administrative law case, because we want the input of the administrative -- of the administrative body. In the habeas cases, we're simply giving deference as a matter of comity and courtesy to the State Courts. Is it --",
  "Well, not so much maybe input, but so that they can -- they can resolve the program -- the problem within the institution, and not have to come to the courts.",
  "Well, but --",
  "-- but as I interpret your argument, you're saying that there is some merit, some benefit, to avoiding the State administrative procedures. What you're saying is that, \"You know, these\" --",
  "-- \"administrative procedures aren't all that -- they're cracked up to be. There's a good reason to avoid them.\" I --",
  "That's a --",
  "-- that's a -- that's a difficult argument for us --",
  "-- to accept.",
  "And I suppose you could add to that, that Mr. Himmelfarb wouldn't even accept \"reasonable.\" He said it has to be \"impossible\" to comply with.",
  "And is that true even if the State does not have a procedure for reopening for late claims?",
  "Well, suppose --",
  "-- the State says, \"We don't consider late claims.\" As they do here.",
  "Suppose the State says, \"We don't consider late claims.\"",
  "Were there any prisoners, since the inception to your program, that have been in there for the whole 2 years?",
  "Yes.",
  "Are -- do -- is -- is Pennsylvania alone or nearly alone in imposing this rule, or is this typical of the restraints imposed in -- in this maximum restrictive confinement?",
  "Is this one of the most severe restrictions in the Nation with respect to reading material and photographs?",
  "Well -- well, it seems to me that that's an as-applied challenge. If -- if a particular inmate -- the terms of -- the conditions of confinement are particularly harsh and he -- he or she has an unrealistic opportunity to get to a less restrictive confinement, then -- then he can bring a suit.",
  "But -- but -- the whole rationale of your case -- if I were you writing your brief, I would have this problem. This really matters to the inmates, but that's exactly the State's point. That's the reason it's taken away. It really means something. And I -- I just -- I just don't know what to do with that conundrum.",
  "And -- and it seems to me it's the heart of your case and that it surfaces here in the answers you've attempted to give.",
  "But the whole basis for the suit is that it matters to the prisoner, and that's exactly why it's been taken away because there's nothing else left that we can do with these prisoners.",
  "But -- but the State's position is that it wants to avoid that ultimate deterrent. It -- it wants to take away privileges for a while to see if he can conform. You're depriving the State of the -- of the option to avoid the most extreme circumstances of forgetting about him altogether forever.",
  "And it seems to me that -- that your -- your argument is -- is at cross ends with its own purpose.",
  "Well, why -- why is that true? Let's assume that they could establish that there was a purpose and an intent to adopt this -- this tax evasion scheme and that the whole object was to undermine and -- and injure the competitor, and they show that this scheme began to work and that their reputation as a lower-cost competitor was -- was well established. Why -- why isn't that enough?",
  "And suppose you had a tribunal that was properly constituted, as you contend that it ought to be, and then the charge was conspiracy. Would the -- would the courts then have review before the trial proceeded? And let's assume that it's a conspiracy and some other charge. Is there some analog in ordinary criminal proceedings where you challenge, in advance, the validity of the charge?",
  "Could the tribunal interpret the conspiracy charge to mean joint enterprise, which would be closer, at least, to accepted practice in the international tribunals?",
  "I'm still not sure why, if we think that there is merit to your argument that the tribunal is not properly established anyway, that you -- we have to reach the conspiracy charge.",
  "And if we -- and if we think that you're wrong on that, I don't know why that court can't hear the conspiracy argument.",
  "Well, suppose that proof were to show that there was very substantial and knowing involvement rendering him basically an accomplice or a principal, but it was -- it was still found under conspiracy. Would international law violate that?",
  "Assume that he's been given notice of -- during the -- during the course of the proceedings as to what the charges specifically are as the proof is adduced.",
  "Well, let me put it this way. If we were to find that the Geneva Convention or other settled principles of international law were controlling here, why couldn't we just remand to the D.C. Circuit and let it figure that out? Or let it -- have the tribunal figure it out, in the first instance, assuming the tribunal is properly authorized.",
  "Well, suppose we told the D.C. Circuit that the Geneva Convention or some other body of international law controls, and just remand it for it to go into all these arguments?",
  "What fundamentals, other than personal presence, are you concerned with in this case?",
  "Or is that it?",
  "I understand --",
  "-- the nature -- the appointing authority and so forth. But so far as the rights of the defendant at the proceeding --",
  "-- just right to be present? Is there a requirement of prompt convening of the proceedings?",
  "Do you think, as a minimum, that they authorized a military commission?",
  "How do you want us to view his status? Do we accept the Government's submission that there's probable cause to believe that he was not of -- in a formal uniform, that he was not a formal combatant, but that he was aiding and abetting, or conspiring, with al Qaeda? Can we accept that, that there's probable cause for that?",
  "I mean, in -- particularly based on the CSRT hearing?",
  "But you have to --",
  "-- you have to give us --",
  "-- a beginning point. You have to give us a beginning point.",
  "But I have --",
  "-- I have -- I have trouble with the argument that -- insofar as he says there is a structural invalidity to the military commission, that he brings that before the commission. The historic office of habeas is to test whether or not you are being tried by a lawful tribunal. And he says, under the Geneva Convention, as you know, that it isn't.",
  "Well, it's not some --",
  "-- procedural -- it's the structural requirement of the composition and the -- and the appointing origins of the court.",
  "Well, is --",
  "-- is that -- is that true? If a group of people decides they're going to try somebody, we wait until that group of people finishes the trial before the Court -- before habeas intervenes to determine the authority of the tribunal to hold and to try?",
  "I had thought that the historic function of habeas is to -- one of its functions -- is to test the jurisdiction and the legitimacy of a court.",
  "Mr. --",
  "Mr. Clement, I, for one, have lost track of your time. I'm interested in your arguments on the -- on the legitimacy and the regularity of these commissions.",
  "And, in particular, why isn't he part of the Common Article 3 under the Geneva Convention, as Judge Williams found? That's part of the same question.",
  "Your time is -- why isn't Hamdam a uniquely vulnerable individual that -- you used the phrase \"uniquely vulnerable individuals\" were involved in another case, but not here. Why not here?",
  "But I don't understand. pending litigation? Is that the idea just until you resolve whatever claim it is they have to -- to the money, determine it. It may be a legal claim, an equitable claim, but until you sort it out, you can get an injunction to prevent them from dissipating the -- the claimed funds.",
  "But I -- I still don't understand. If I'm the -- the trial judge and you ask -- and I'm asked to enter an injunction, I enter an injunction knowing that in the end it's going to be to no purpose? I have to -- I have to be enforcing some ultimate injury of -- of which the plaintiff has standing to assert.",
  "So that's why I don't understand your questions. I would think you'd say no injunction because, at the end of the day, it amounts",
  "Can you cite us to something for the -- can you cite something to that effect?",
  "For your answer.",
  "Would California allow you to intervene when it has a no-subrogation rule?",
  "Well, then how are you going to prevent the funds from being commingled or being assigned immediately to a trust?",
  "I'm not sure how you can avoid also the trustee being one of the named plaintiffs. under (a)(3), Your Honor, and that we would -- we would try to act under (a)(3) in terms of enforcing our",
  "Was there a showing of prejudice in that case or just automatic exclusion?",
  "Well, of course, that's assuming a causal link, which is an altogether different problem. But it's still not clear to me. Are you saying that we should require the States to follow and the United States Government to follow an exclusionary rule because that's what the treaty requires or because this is the remedy that we ought to devise in the exercise of our supervisory powers? And if it's the latter, it seems to me surely there must be some causal linkage between the violation and the -- and the statement at -- at a minimum.",
  "One of the things -- and I -- I really have this question for all counsel. If the Miranda warning is given, it seems to me that that comprehends the relief that you need. If the accused talks with his attorney, his attorney is presumed to know the treaty's -- the provisions of the convention. If he does not, he proceeds at his risk. Attorneys have lots of things they can tell clients, and if you don't have an attorney, you proceed at your risk. I just think this is a very important point here.",
  "Well, but you -- you want us to write an opinion to say that we're holding our attorneys to the same standard of evaluation as the attorneys in Syria --",
  "-- and -- and our bar is -- is not to be trusted to have the expertise that's at least equivalent to that of the foreign counsel?",
  "But the question is who tells you about that choice, and your attorney can tell you about that choice.",
  "Has the Honduran Government offered to arrest and extradite that witness from Honduras to bring him back to the United States?",
  "Well, it's the same point we've been covering, but all seem to concede that the particular characteristics of a national system have to be taken into account. And the distinguishing feature of our system is that it's an adversary system. And you're asking us to make an exception to that system --",
  "-- an exception to the usual rules that prevail in that system, and that's not consistent with what the treaty requires.",
  "Well, but that's because in Brady, as Justice Souter has already pointed out, there's a factual piece of evidence that the State has withheld. Here, the lawyer is presumed to know the law. It's just not an apt analogy.",
  "Can you tell us what the State of Oregon has done in this regard --",
  "-- or other States?",
  "Well, how do you think it should -- you think the police officer should give it as part of the Miranda warnings, or what's -- what's your conclusion as to how it should be implemented?",
  "Does this mean that the -- the desk sergeant in the police station or who?",
  "So you think it's -- it's not -- it's not required for police interrogators in the station to include this? They can -- they can wait?",
  "Well, how about during the interrogation?",
  "I mean, it seems to me it's not like rocket science. You've had study groups and everything. Well, you just tell the policemen give them -- give them the advice. End of case.",
  "Well, that's easy. If you are a foreign national, you -- that's easy too. I don't -- I don't see why this is so complicated.",
  "That's their problem.",
  "Your answer -- your answer doesn't give me confidence that you're implementing the treaty.",
  "In your view, just as a practical matter, what we have here, how -- how should the States enforce this obligation?",
  "Do they have any obligation to inquire whether he is? And -- and can you be more specific? Should it happen --",
  "-- when you first give him the Miranda warnings, or tell me how you think it should work?",
  "Do you think they have the affirmative obligation to ask him if he is a foreign national?",
  "Well, I thought you indicated that you advise the States that they do have to advise him of this right during the booking process or the interrogation.",
  "Well, but --",
  "Well, I'm -- I interrupted But the -- the business process point you give away fairly quickly. I -- I thought that was rather substantial. The whole point is, is that a business process patent is -- is difficult to define and could be very -- it can be very restrictive.",
  "My concern is if you take that away, I don't know if you've got a lot left for the -- saying no injunction in this case.",
  "Well -- well, tell me how -- how this works. It seems to me that an injunctive to -- to sort out whether there's going to be a violation. You call the parties in and they indicate what -- what they propose to do, and the judge says, well, this is within it or it's without it. It's -- it's much cheaper than a -- a new lawsuit.",
  "Well, but this gives you the advantage of coming in in advance saying, I want -- I -- I want a ruling in advance that I'm not going to violate the injunction. You've got a cheap lawsuit.",
  "Well, is -- is the troll the scary thing under the bridge, or is it a fishing technique? I -- I want --",
  "I mean, is that what the troll is?",
  "Is there a classic case where the injunction should not be issued?",
  "Business processes? -- the district court clearly erred here in saying that the mere debate about business process patents is a a sufficient view -- reason in our mind for weighing against the general public interest and the enforceability of patents and the use of injunctions to make sure that those property rights are secure.",
  "Well, how about excluding from the forklift forever or a year? You can't work the forklift for a year.",
  "Well, it has an effect on your back.",
  "Yes, but you've got a jury --",
  "-- you've got a jury finding here. You've got a jury finding this was discriminatory.",
  "On -- on that point, I have -- I have one question. At page 3a of the petition appendix, the Washington Supreme Court's opinion is set forth, and in the course of that opinion, it says, to the contrary, when defense counsel argued the definition should have been submitted to the jury, the prosecutor explicitly stated that the method under which the State is alleging and the jury found assault was committed was by the use of a deadly weapon. And then he goes on to say, in the crime charged in the enhancement, the State alleged there is no element of a firearm. The element is assault with a deadly weapon. I don't -- this was at the sentencing proceeding, I take it?",
  "Yes, because I couldn't find it in the sentencing proceeding.",
  "It does sound as if he thinks there was -- the prosecutor thought there was no error. A deadly weapon is a deadly weapon, and then --",
  "Well, would it be either proper or required by the Washington trial court to tell the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the charge is assault? There is also the possibility of a sentence enhancement. It's a 1-year enhancement if it's a deadly weapon. It's a 3-year enhancement if it's a firearm and a pistol is a firearm. Would the judge err if he did that? Or another way of putting the same question, would it be proper for the judge to leave out the 1-year deadly weapon instruction and just instruct you can -- you must determine whether it's an assault and you must determine whether there's a 3-year enhancement for the use of a firearm?",
  "No, no. My hypothetical is he says it's a 3-year enhancement if the deadly weapon is a firearm. That's -- what I'm asking is, in effect, under Washington law, is it error if the judge allows the definition of deadly weapon also to go to the jury so it can find a lesser included offense.",
  "Well, then you're saying the instruction here was proper.",
  "Do you agree in this case that the court did have the obligation to submit a special verdict form indicating that the defendant -- asking whether the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon?",
  "No. As a matter -- a constitutional matter.",
  "Suppose the -- suppose the judge didn't ask about deadly weapon at all, just -- just asked whether there's an assault.",
  "But you -- so -- so there had to be an instruction that there was an assault in the second degree?",
  "But the statute does say deadly weapon other than a firearm.",
  "But the enhancement section does.",
  "Well, do you think in this case you'd be entitled to a lesser included offense instruction as a matter of law?",
  "Well, was there any evidence that it didn't have the capacity to fire?",
  "You're not entitled to -- you're not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction for which there's no evidence.",
  "Do you think it would have been error in this case based on the evidence presented and the way the -- the case was argued -- would it have been error for the judge to instruct the jury that if they found that there was a firearm involved, they should make a -- they could make a -- a finding on that?",
  "But as a constitutional matter, would it have been error for the judge to instruct the jury in this case, based on this evidence, that they could return a verdict that a firearm was used as part of the assault?",
  "You say regardless of the strength of the evidence. How about no evidence at all?",
  "Well, the question is whether or not it requires it.",
  "In the charging document, where it says that he was armed with a deadly weapon, to wit, a handgun, and then it cites the Washington statutes, those citations include the 3-year enhancement provision?",
  "It cites RCW 9.994A.125 and 9.94A.310. Is one of -- is one of those the 3-year enhancement?",
  "So it includes the 3 years.",
  "But it does include it.",
  "Well, I -- I take it Washington wouldn't have the option -- suppose that you prevail. Washington doesn't have the option to give him a whole new trial, do they, because there's been double jeopardy, I take it.",
  "What I'm saying, you don't concede, do you, that Washington would have the option to retry him to try to obtain the 3-year enhancement.",
  "I wouldn't think so.",
  "Well, suppose under Justice Scalia's hypothetical, aggravated murder is -- is in the charging documents, but the judge doesn't say aggravated murder when he submits it to the jury.",
  "Well, that was my -- even in the Chief Justice's hypothetical, I -- I take it the client has a right to direct the attorney what defense to present, or am I wrong about it?",
  "What would the Government's position be if the disappointed client whose choice of counsel was rejected by the court applied for mandate review in the court of appeals?",
  "Well, we don't know -- we don't know if that's the case. He -- he wants to go immediately to the court of appeals. What would the Government's position be?",
  "But the Government always acquiesces in the propriety of seeking mandate from the court of appeals?",
  "Well, I mean, I suppose the Government can object that it's improper or that it's unnecessary or a waste of time. I'm asking what the Government's position is.",
  "Well, if -- if the question is fairness, as you -- as you propose, then it would seem to me that there would be no need for the extraordinary proceeding.",
  "Would you say that presumption is sufficient so that mandate should be entertained by a court of appeals anytime this question comes up?",
  "Well, in -- in hindsight, you've always made a mistake if your client is found guilty. I -- I'm just not sure how this inquiry would proceed. It seems to me that there ought to be either automatic reversal on one -- on one hand, or the other rule ought to be incompetency of counsel. But you're -- you're going to have satellite litigation with speculation, and it seems -- it seems to me not a good remedy.",
  "Well, it's not just disqualify. Suppose he denies a motion for continuance. The counsel is in another trial and he said, I can't be here for another 10 days. And the court says, I -- I deny that. I -- I assume if it's an abuse of discretion, the result would be the same under your view.",
  "Well, you may leave the jurisprudence where you found it, but other attorneys might not. And I'm -- I'm concerned with the consequences of your rule. There are many reasons, it seems to me, why a counsel may not be able to represent the -- the client that has chosen him as -- as the first choice.",
  "And if -- if you prevail here, it seems to me that counsel can come in and say, now, Judge, I've looked at your calendar, and you can certainly wait for another 2 weeks, and the judge has to do it.",
  "And I don't know why he wouldn't.",
  "But it seems to me that would happen if there's an autonomous, structural right of the kind you -- you urge.",
  "So I want to control the case by having a different appointed counsel.",
  "Well, but -- but this is all subject challenge as an abuse of discretion.",
  "Are there cases in the records where it shows government overreaching or bad faith and so forth in trying to get rid of the counsel? That just doesn't happen?",
  "What are the -- what are the practicalities or impracticalities, as the case may be, of seeking immediate review from the court of appeals by writ of mandate?",
  "I think it would be easy for us to make a distinction between the right and the remedy.",
  "Well, but in all events, we could structure the decision to make -- to make sense, and if these instances happen, as you indicate in your brief, very early, it seems to me that the answer is mandate in a court of appeals.",
  "You're not quite through your answer yet, but is there also a requirement that the competency determination be made within 30 days? Or am I -- am I in error on that point?",
  "But that -- but that's different, I take it, from the judge's delay in making the finding of competency.",
  "And I take it the trial -- the Speedy Trial Act doesn't say if the judge is thinking about something, it requires him to make an order.",
  "Well, I was going to ask you about that. Or could he vacate submission because he wants new evidence or something? Could you vacate submission of the -- of the first competency hearing in order to take new evidence?",
  "Now, we've been talking about the competency period. I take it the first period was one of just repeated requests for extensions. That's January '97 until May '97.",
  "And that's this -- that's the first of the two periods that's involved here.",
  "I don't know if it makes any difference to the case. Do you -- do you think the court could have made findings that would have been justified? I mean, it takes a while to find an expert to say that a bond is genuine when it spells United with O, but --",
  "Are there -- are there cases in which the judge's findings -- let's assume that he made the findings -- are set aside for abuse of discretion on -- on review for a violation of the Speedy Trial Act?",
  "I was going to ask what is the date of the Speedy Trial Act? 1975?",
  "And it was widely publicized among the judiciary then.",
  "But -- but as we've indicated, the -- the judge was the one that opted out of the act by this regular practice of requiring the perpetual waiver, or whatever we call it.",
  "Did the Government at any point tell the -- tell the court, Your Honor, we think the act requires you to make a specific finding and we request you do that?",
  "Because, I mean, you're -- you're coming in and saying, oh, well, he waived, but certainly the Government could -- could have asked the -- asked the district court to make the necessary findings.",
  "Well, it seems to me the Government is equally remiss for not pointing out the obligations of the court under the act. But let me ask you this. Probably you can respond to that as well if you like. What are the problems with reindicting -- I mean, how -- how is the Government hurt if it can reindict? I recognize that it's costly to the system, et cetera. But is there any real prejudice there?",
  "Well, of course, I'm -- I'm supposing that after this rule, there would be no trial because there would be -- if -- if you don't prevail, there wouldn't be a trial.",
  "And I'm asking are there -- are there severe costs with that when there's been no trial?",
  "There's -- there's no trial.",
  "The -- the action is dismissed for a Speedy Trial Act violation because the position of the Petitioner here is accepted by this Court and the Government just reindicts.",
  "I'm hypothesizing that there hasn't been.",
  "The case is dismissed.",
  "And there is a reindictment.",
  "How costly is that to the system other than getting the grand jury together?",
  "It's harmless error because he -- the evidence of guilt was substantial? What -- how does the harmless error work?",
  "I -- I would have thought that your answer would be that the Congress was interested in finding out the cost of this act, and it's very clear that school districts hire consultants to assist them in -- in these cases, and it wanted to know the amount they were paying to the consultants. And that's also why it used the word personnel, which -- which is a word usually reserved for a government agency.",
  "Well, but I'm not -- I'm not sure that you don't have a further answer to Justice Stevens because there's (3)(A) and (3)(B). (3)(A) talks about costs and expenses awarded to the prevailing party. (3)(B) says, for the same sample the number of hours spent.",
  "I think we have said that conference reports are more valuable than the reports of a single house. I think we have said that.",
  "Does the gravamen --",
  "-- does the gravamen -- well, I'll let you finish your answer.",
  "Does the gravamen of the argument -- is it that this phrase is unambiguous?",
  "Casey -- Casey is very clear in saying the judicial background against which Congress enacted 1988, talking about 1988, mirror the statutory background, and it says the judicial background was that expert fees were quite different than attorneys' fees. They were not a subset of attorneys' fees.",
  "But -- but the word consultants appears in subsection (B) of the statute.",
  "And that specifically refers to the State educational agency and local educational agency.",
  "And it uses personnel, which sounds to me a very odd way to talk about private experts hired by an attorney. You don't talk about them as personnel.",
  "Well, that's before the Magna Carta you're asking for in this case which would establish a whole -- a whole --",
  "-- new profession of experts.",
  "Did the -- did the final bill say we adopt the findings of the conference report?",
  "And other bills have said that.",
  "Like in -- as in Nofstiker.",
  "Don't the school boards have some consultants and experts in this area other than the teachers?",
  "Is --",
  "-- the State telling us -- and we'll ask the State when they argue -- but is the State telling us that it has defined \"intent\" in a particular way for this, so that \"intent\" is just having the purpose to cause the result --",
  "-- and, therefore, that this testimony is irrelevant? Is that the State's argument, as you understand it?",
  "Well, I guess maybe the question is, What is your point? And I have the same question as Justice Breyer, and I'd just like to pursue that. If a case, a hypothetical case, is one in which the second prong of M'Naghten, knowing the difference in right and wrong, gets to the question of his capacity to form an intent, isn't that sufficient? I think that's Justice Breyer's question.",
  "But let's --",
  "-- let's assume that it can consider the evidence as to -- on the right-and-wrong prong.",
  "Does the hypothetical state --",
  "-- that says, \"We'll let this evidence\" --",
  "-- \"in under the right-and - wrong aspect of M'Naghten, but not under the nature and quality of the act.\"",
  "Why that isn't sufficient to answer your contention that his intent is not -- has not been subject to question.",
  "What they said --",
  "Well, I'll look at M'Naghten. I had thought it was whether or not the action was right and wrong, whether -- rather than the -- than the -- than the moral command was wrong.",
  "Well, but --",
  "-- if Justice Breyer --",
  "But if Justice --",
  "-- Breyer's explanation is a correct statement of Arizona law, do you still have an argument that your proof should have been accepted, on the first prong?",
  "And what is that argument?",
  "Is it your argument that it -- under Arizona law, it goes to excuse the conduct, but not whether the conduct, in fact, occurred?",
  "I mean, is that your argument?",
  "Is that your argument?",
  "Well, to prevail, do you think you have to show that, under prong two of M'Naghten, the right-and-wrong prong, that the defendant can prove really everything, and, in fact, did have the opportunity to prove everything, that he seeks to prove under prong one? If it's -- do you have to convince us of that in order to win?",
  "But I am correct in assuming that it is -- and tell me if I'm wrong -- that it is your position, the State's position, that, under the right/wrong prong-two part of M'Naghten, and under the evidence in this case, the court was able to consider, really, all of the evidence that's necessary in order to meet this defendant's defense as to -- as to intent.",
  "I agree with you. I'm trying to think of some theoretical case where it would make a difference. I can't quite come up with a hypothetical.",
  "Does that mean that it could also exclude the testimony from the lay people or the friends who talked about this person's illness?",
  "Or are we just talking about the expert testimony?",
  "Is this an alternative argument, so that, if we accept this argument, we need not ask whether the evidence comes in under prong two, or is this complementary to the argument that the evidence comes in under prong two?",
  "Could the State say that it's the defendant's burden to show that it was not a police officer?",
  "Yes.",
  "Because the next question is, Why didn't they -- isn't that what happened here?",
  "It seems to me that you introduced the -- my concern by saying that they -- the State can put the burden of proof on the defendant, which we know is generally true in many States with reference to the insanity defense. But when you link it with mens rea, then it seems to me you have a problem.",
  "It does seem as if the argument, that, \"Oh, this all comes in under second -- under the second prong,\" means that if there's a -- there's another inference. It's a -- it's a secondhand argument about lack of mens rea.",
  "Kind of, the second-class --",
  "-- sort of evidence.",
  "And for this Court, I assume, at least theoretically, on petition for certiorari?",
  "What -- what was the basis then, or was there a basis, for Judge Easterbrook's comment, it's now or never?",
  "Do we have a standard --",
  "And your best case on that is Munsingwear?",
  "Oh, the Missouri Pacific case.",
  "On -- on the merits of the issue as opposed to diversity?",
  "Is part of the dynamic here, Mr. Perry, that if this goes back to the State court, that affects the dynamics of the litigation because you now have a class action that has to proceed, and that a large part of the litigation strategy in these cases is determined by whether or not there's going to be a full trial on the merits of the class action to effect a settlement, and so forth, so that Congress wanted to have this reviewed quickly and in the Federal courts?",
  "Do you agree that there would be Federal court review in this Court from a State court determination on the applicability of SLUSA in this case?",
  "Did they know that minors were involved? The record doesn't show that, at least in the preliminary direct exam of the officer.",
  "Yes. I mean, they knew that once they got into the backyard. Did they know before they got into the backyard?",
  "Or did they just know that minors stay up late at night?",
  "But that's after they went into the backyard.",
  "They could see that they were minors.",
  "Well, that's just because it's loud? Suppose they were just singing and laughing?",
  "So there has to be some indication of the likelihood of escalation into violence?",
  "So then it does matter.",
  "Necessary.",
  "No. It involved -- it involved a homicide, but there, the search in question took place after the premises -- after the entry, after the premises were secured. The entry was never in question in Mincey.",
  "What was in question was the search after the premises had been secured.",
  "And I don't see how that helps you because here, in the course of securing the -- the premises, they had all -- all the evidence they needed.",
  "So Mincey doesn't help.",
  "Well, you began by saying that there's three different measures, I think -- I think was the word you used. And the State, I take it, must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, (a) that it was an aggravated -- or, (a) that it was an aggravated murder, (b) that there was another crime involved --",
  "-- sort of --",
  "-- if you could just walk me through that.",
  "And --",
  "-- capital murder includes, in this case --",
  "Involved more than one person. Then, second?",
  "You had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors that have already been established.",
  "And I take it --",
  "-- the moral answer is also, \"He stands before us with the scales already tipped. He stands before us having been shown, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed aggravated murder. He has the obligation to show us why he should be excused from that penalty. He has not done so. We can take anything that he came -- brought to our attention, and we can say that this outweighs.\" It does not.",
  "We are confident that the jury found aggravating factors. We know that.",
  "And we know --",
  "-- that they found them beyond a reasonable doubt.",
  "And we know --",
  "-- we --",
  "-- and we know that they found that the defendant had not shown that mitigating factors outweighed those aggravating factors.",
  "It seems to me that --",
  "-- that that --",
  "-- that that hurts you somewhat. If you want to give us this visual metaphor of a scale, or a football field, where you move it beyond the 50-yardline, whatever visual metaphor you want, and you weigh, you balance where the scales of justice balances, it seems to me that that's a stronger case than saying the jurors can establish their aggravation, then they can take any mitigating factor they want, for any reason, and apply it. And they can't do that, because the defendant hasn't shown it. It seems to me that that's -- that that's a weaker argument than if you had this balancing mechanism that was our controlling metaphor.",
  "They've already decided aggravating circumstances, you can't say they can't decide it. They've already decided aggravating circumstances.",
  "And what they're deciding is that there's no mitigating circumstances to outweigh it.",
  "But haven't the jurors made the decision that, \"We have looked at all of the moral arguments that he has presented. Each of one of the -- of us has individually weighed them. Each one of us know that if we have any moral reason not to impose the death penalty, we can do it. And we make the moral judgment that we cannot make that determination.\"",
  "Moral judgment, from beginning to end.",
  "No, but that's -- your term is \"equipoise.\" You say the jury has done nothing --",
  "-- you say the jury has done nothing. What the jury has done is, it's weighed all the evidence with great care, and it's said that, \"Beyond a reasonable doubt, the mitigating circumstances do not overcome.\" That is a moral judgment.",
  "And you label it \"equipoise.\"",
  "You think that under this instruction, a Kansas juror could say, \"You know, I'm not interested in deliberating more. I'm not going to participate\"? That's what you're want -- that's what you want us to believe, right, based on this argument? I -- that's just -- any juror -- any jury can ignore its instructions. There's nothing I can do about that.",
  "Here, they are instructed to consider every mitigating circumstance that's presented and determine whether or not that should be a factor in their decision.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, but you're suggesting that they kind of --",
  "-- that they can tune out.",
  "Well, I thought -- I thought it defined a duty. I -- I agree with Justice Stevens. I -- I've never seen it -- are there other statutes where the contracting parties can decide whether or not they're going to oust Federal law -- or State law?",
  "But -- but there's uniformity because the Government wins in both cases.",
  "There's uniformity because the Government wins in both cases.",
  "I mean, that's the kind of uniformity the Government loves.",
  "But I take it you're not foreclosed from making your defense or your claim in the Federal court.",
  "Which is the easier of the two cases for the defendant? A, the case where the argument is a burden of proof should be on -- on the -- the State as a due process matter or a common law matter in an insanity defense and, B, in a duress defense?",
  "Well, either way.",
  "But -- but we've held, at least under the M'Naghten version of the defense, that the State -- that the burden can be put on the defendant to show that he was not insane under the M'Naghten test.",
  "And as Justice Scalia said and as I was considering in asking my question, in your case we know that there was a conscious, knowing and intentional, in some sense, act when -- when the person bought -- bought the weapons. She says the intent, of course, was induced by -- by the threat. It seems to me you have a more difficult case than in the insanity case.",
  "The phrase Justice Harlan used in the Davis case.",
  "What -- what is the threshold test that the defendant has to cross before the judge will give the instruction to the jury? Obviously, the burden of production is with the defendant. When can a judge say, well, you know, this -- this is just too flimsy for a duress defense? I'm not going to instruct a jury on that.",
  "You could almost argue that the other way. I mean, it -- it seems to me on predisposition that the defendant knows more about it than the Government does.",
  "I'm not sure what the criteria are that I have to follow -- that we have to follow in deciding the case. Just count up all the cases and --",
  "Let me ask -- let me ask you this. Is -- is there any evidence that -- that we can take account of, commentary, law reviews, to show that the Government has difficulties in -- in meeting a duress defense?",
  "Is -- is --",
  "Is the test proposed by the Petitioner that -- that you have to prove non-duress by beyond a reasonable doubt?",
  "And your test is that the defendant would have to prove it only by clear and convincing evidence?",
  "More likely. More likely.",
  "Do you think a State could put a burden on the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt for entrapment, duress, insanity?",
  "Can the judge ask the defendant to produce evidence that there was no possibility to go to law enforcement officials, and if she does not produce that evidence, then refuse to give the defense?",
  "If we were --",
  "Still, it -- it -- you know, we usually talk about person can mean a corporation. This says individual. A person is defined in -- in sub (3) just above it. A person includes any individual or entity. Then the next thing says individual. So it's not a -- it doesn't sound like a corporation.",
  "Well, what we're reviewing is a ruling, not a question. You certify a ruling. Now, it's usually set out for the court of appeals so they know what the question is.",
  "What you're reviewing here is a ruling.",
  "Well, do you have confidence --",
  "-- do you have confidence that Florida can do that?",
  "Well, one -- one of the circumstances that -- that was raised by the questioning is this. States generally have the defense of laches. They -- they require the petition to be filed within a reasonable time. With changes in pharmacology, the laches defense will not usually be available. And under the proposal that the -- the State resolves it once and for all, I suppose the State couldn't adopt a new protocol that it thought was better, more humane, without risking more litigation. So it -- it really is a disincentive for the States to try to make the procedure less painful for the -- for the accused.",
  "Precisely. And that's going to be true with every new protocol.",
  "No. Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg can protect their own questions. Part of that allegation in here is that the State wasn't forthcoming with the -- with -- with the information requested, and you're not very forthcoming with the answers. What is the source, what is the legal source, what is the precedent for the proposition that the -- that the condemned man has to come up with an alternative? What case do you cite? What principle do you cite?",
  "That's what we're asking.",
  "This -- this is a death case. It was not that amusing. Let me ask you this. Doesn't the State have some minimal obligation under the Eighth Amendment to do the necessary research to assure that this is the most humane method possible? Doesn't the State have a minimal obligation on its own to do that?",
  "Well, I can define gratuitous -- I don't have the dictionary here. But gratuitous means essentially unnecessary. If there were other -- other means, other alternatives, that might be used, it seems to me that the State might have some minimal obligation to investigate those.",
  "You know it -- it is true that the 1983 is a civil action, and the plaintiff has the burden of proof, burden of producing evidence.",
  "Well, it seems to me that you might -- you might have alleged that -- that you've read articles, Lancet articles, and so forth, and that there is a substantial risk that they're going to do this. I think that might suffice.",
  "And -- and it would -- it would mean that the -- as the Chief Justice indicates, the court has more time to look at this.",
  "So -- so in your view, there has to be a 4- to 6-hour search for complex financial records, business documents. There's a warrant. The search is otherwise proper. They forget to knock. They say, oh, you know, we are police officers. There's a discussion for a while. But -- anything seized after that is -- must be suppressed.",
  "It just seems to me in the hypothetical I put -- and there's obviously a reason I put it -- is there's just no causal link between the -- the suppression and -- and the failure to knock.",
  "Well, but you say directly related. That -- that assumes the very point that I have in mind. I don't know why it's directly related.",
  "It depends -- it depends in part.",
  "Suppose the -- suppose the officer -- excuse me, we forgot to knock, but we are police officers. We do have a warrant. We're going to proceed with a search. Please don't be alarmed. We're going to -- does that do it?",
  "Well, but your -- your point is -- is there -- is that they have to go out and come back in again.",
  "I agree. Segura -- I forget what it is in torts. It's kind of a supervening, independent cause or something like that.",
  "Well, what about in this case, which is Justice Ginsburg's question? If the police said, we have reasonable grounds to -- to believe that he has a weapon and we're also looking for drugs that are easily disposable, would that be grounds for knocking -- for not -- for dispensing with the knock requirement?",
  "Well, let's take it step by step. Suppose the police articulate this at the outset --",
  "-- and under -- under State procedures, they're allowed to make the on-the-spot judgment. Would that -- would those facts suffice to allow them to enter without the knock?",
  "Well, so in -- in this case, they could have entered in your view if they had specific knowledge of the gun and disposable contraband.",
  "Well -- well, do you think just as an empirical matter that in most cases where there's known to be guns plus drugs, the police will enter without knocking?",
  "There's -- there's specific knowledge.",
  "It's in the warrant.",
  "I still don't understand where -- where we are with guns. You -- you have a specific finding in a warrant that says there's probable cause there's going to be a gun, and there's drugs. I take it your position is that this allows you to enter without knocking.",
  "Can you tell me what -- what happens if there's a violation of the daytime warrant provision in -- in a search warrant and the search is at night? Do we suppress?",
  "Are there cases -- are there cases on that?",
  "I'd to get your -- I'd like to get your position. I -- I think Justice Souter is correct, that under the theory you're arguing to us here, the violation of the daytime warrant rule is not grounds for suppressing evidence. So we can have nighttime searches with no suppression remedy.",
  "Well it was - -",
  "-- it was addressing itself to the fact -- to the words of the factor (k) instruction. How does post-crime prison conduct reduce the seriousness of a previous crime?",
  "Well, I mean, it has to relate to the gravity of the crime, under the words of factor (k), doesn't it?",
  "Well, now, do you - -",
  "-- do you have an instruction that supports what you've just told us, that the jury is told they have to make a single moral determination? Is that what the court instructed the jury? Or was --",
  "-- instructed in items of factor (k)?",
  "And I think you have to rest on your argument, that what we are talking about is the gravity of his crime \"for purposes of sentencing.\" I understand that argument. But then, when you go on to make the argument you just made, the jury understands it is a single moral judgment, what -- is there some specific instruction you can point to, other than the factor (k) instruction itself?",
  "And that page --",
  "-- where he says that is where?",
  "But in - -",
  "-- but, in a sense, that's right, just like remorse. Remorse doesn't excuse the crime. It's a consideration that you take into account in assessing the gravity of the crime for purposes of punishment.",
  "Well, of course you - -",
  "-- don't you -- excuse me. Excuse me.",
  "But we have said that remorse extenuates the gravity of the crime, for punishment purposes, under factor (k).",
  "And that - -",
  "And that -- and that -- that's post -- that's post-crime.",
  "Oh, you think pre- and crime -- pre- and post- distinction has no bearing on this case? I thought that was really the linchpin of your argument?",
  "Well, do you agree that if there were a State conviction for an offense that would have been punishable under the Federal law, their both being felonies, that enhancement can apply, in that instance, and that that does meet the definition?",
  "But I thought that - -",
  "-- was the concession you made in response to my - -",
  "-- question.",
  "You've - -",
  "-- answered Justice Breyer by citing the Jerome case. After Jerome, we decided United States vs. Gonzales, having to do with the consecutive or concurrent sentencing terms. And it -- are those two cases in some tension? Gonzales didn't mention Jerome. And I noticed that none of the briefs mentioned it either. Is there some tension in the cases? And, if so, is this a case where, when we write an opinion, whatever the outcome, we should talk about that? And, if that's so, what should we say?",
  "But it does - -",
  "-- it does seem to limit the broad statement in Jerome, without mentioning Jerome.",
  "Why don't you say \"it just happens\"? I mean --",
  "-- it's there in the statute.",
  "That's why you're here.",
  "Well, but as a matter of policy, we, at some point, either in this case or some later case, may have to address the question of whether or not such a provision is enforceable. If it is, we may be -- not be talking about much. It's just going to be boilerplate in every license agreement, and that's the end of it. And it - -",
  "-- but it -- on the other hand, it may be that there are reasons not to enforce this, so that we don't have courts flooded with lawsuits, et cetera, et cetera.",
  "Suppose they didn't have all the information. Suppose you enter into a license agreement -- you're convinced, as the one that's going to pay the license fee, that it's a good patent -- after the agreement's signed, the technological advances, other disclosures, indicate that the patent is deficient. Could you sue then?",
  "Well, but then -- so then, the argument that you've made is just not - -",
  "-- relevant for us, the fact that they knew everything --",
  "And it also means that this isn't really a settlement, in any respect.",
  "Well, Poe versus Ullman was a case in which, even if there was a violation of the law, there was going to be no prosecution.",
  "He -- but, in this -- in this case, if there's a failure to -- of -- conform to the terms of the license agreement, there's going to be a lawsuit. So, I think Poe versus Ullman is just not relevant.",
  "No, but - -",
  "-- but, in Poe versus Ullman, the ultimate action was basically like violating the contract here, and that's why it's not an applicable precedent.",
  "Well, if that's so, and it's a super-violation of an implied covenant, and I guess you could get damages.",
  "But I think that your theory is that it's a super-violation of an implied covenant.",
  "\"Not only did we agree to it, but we you can't even do it if you agree to it.\"",
  "Mr. Lamken - -",
  "-- could we go back to Section (i) for a second more? Is it also possible to say that there was this disagreement between the Department of Justice and the Comptroller General, and Congress decided that the Comptroller General was right? And, if that's true, should we not accept the Comptroller General's reading of the entire statute?",
  "Well, there's a case involving the Oneida Indians, that went back quite a ways - -",
  "-- 200 years - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Suppose it issued the regulation after notice and comment, and said -- violation of the pay phone order is an unjust and unreasonable practice, would the case be different?",
  "But I thought you argued the Rogers standard was a correct standard in the Missouri court?",
  "How is the blue brief in response to Respondent's argument?",
  "And I would add to that that we don't usually look at a BIO to see the issues that the Petitioner is presenting.",
  "Well, two things you might comment on. First, the in whole or in part, you might take account of the fact that there are other negligent actors, third parties, who have contributed to the injury to the employee. Secondly, Section 53 does not contain the language in whole or in part.",
  "I suppose employee associations, workman compensation schemes and Congress have all relied on it.",
  "I'm not quite sure if this works, but at the trial before a petit jury there's an opportunity for counsel to object. There isn't an opportunity to object when the grand jury indictment comes down. Now, I guess you could move to quash.",
  "I have the same problem. It's such a difficult requirement to get a hold of. I mean, he drives the car, he walks, he breathes. I mean, all of these things enable him to get into the country. I just don't understand the basis for the rule.",
  "He wasn't forced to go over. He did it on his own. It seems to me that's - -",
  "What would that be here? That he drove the car to the border? That he got out of the car? That he presented a document? What -- if you could do it over again, what would the indictment say?",
  "So it's just a metaphysical inquiry, when is an indictment not an indictment? It's not some other standard of what's fundamentally unfair or, from the Sixth amendment, whether or not there's notice?",
  "You say poetic, I said metaphysical. When is an indictment not an indictment?",
  "I'm still not sure of your test. It's whether or not it's fundamentally unfair, whether or not there's notice, which sounds like more Sixth Amendment than Fifth. Or whether it's not an indictment, a rose is a rose type of thing.",
  "You could say the same thing about a petit jury. And in Neder we use the harmless error standard.",
  "Well, can't you allege that the means by which it was done are unknown, but that it was by one or more of the following?",
  "But you come back and you tell Justice Breyer, well, that's because we had no notice. But that's a different argument than the fact that there was no indictment. Notice can be cured by a bill of particulars, by the fact that you've had a chance to contest the evidence at trial, that there was no error. That's a quite different rationale than saying that this is not an indictment.",
  "But that, it seems to me, is your argument, not lack of notice.",
  "If you concede there was an error, is there anything to prevent us from saying we don't accept that concession, and have you rebrief and argue the question of whether or not an overt act is required?",
  "But can we do that in the face of your concession without having reargument?",
  "I thought your position was that aggravation must be reasonable. What the court in Black indicates is that it is not going to consider anything reasonable unless there's a fact to support it, unless there's a finding of fact to support it. Is that the position you take?",
  "But I think that there's the further indication that it is not going to be deemed reasonable unless it is supported by a finding of fact, as indicated in order to support one of the specific guideline aggravators.",
  "I'm not sure that that's the way the Black court interpreted it. The Black court talked about a requirement that the upper-term sentence be imposed only if an aggravating factor exists.",
  "That's the whole problem with your case.",
  "That there's -- and incidentally, under the rules, under 4.410, those are general objectives of sentencing.",
  "And that is a term of art that's different from circumstances.",
  "So it's only the circumstances that have to be found by a preponderance of the evidence. The general objectives can still be considered.",
  "But what we are involved with in this case and with this criminal, whose conviction and sentence we're reviewing here, are circumstances that aggravate, and these do require findings.",
  "If those findings aren't there, it's not reasonable.",
  "Well, it is the same old record we've been playing. But the reasonableness requirement has to be explained further. And when you explain it further, you find that there must be findings by a preponderance of the evidence for any of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances that are set out. That's different from the objectives of sentencing.",
  "But the objectives of sentencing are not what's involved in this case.",
  "May I ask you this question? Excluding capital cases, in your view -- anecdotally, if it has to be that -- what percentage of cases that go to juries, that go to jury trial, result in bifurcated proceedings for sentencing purposes? 10 percent?",
  "Yes. You had 200,000 incarcerated when I last looked.",
  "No, but a reading of the rule indicates under (b), as the Chief Justice points out, that the judge could take into account these policy objectives.",
  "Well, I think it is true that it doesn't seem to be involved in this case. In this case, we're under 4.420.",
  "Well, I suppose if the court of appeals had case A, and it said, we interpret the Supreme Court rule to be as follows, it could then later say in case B, this is how we've interpreted the Supreme Court rule, and we're bound by case A. This is the elaboration we've given to it. And we have to find that the state court, of course, isn't bound by what we do, but we're bound by what we do when we review what the state court has decided.",
  "Suppose all of the -- suppose there are five circuits. They're the only ones that looked at the issue. And they all say, we think the general rule of the Supreme Court is as follows, isn't that entitled to some weight? You're not supposed to cite that when you go to the Sixth Circuit court or you go to the state court?",
  "Can you tell us -- let's assume for a minute that this case were on direct review, that we don't have AEDPA. What is the standard that should control? Whether there is an impermissible -- an unacceptable risk that impermissible factors will be taken into account by the jury? Is that the test?",
  "Well, but you should make it more specific for us. You say general due process. How does that work in this case? I want to know whether or not I can order or must order someone to remove a sign, a button, a piece of clothing. What's the test that I use?",
  "That -- unless you want to go on, that doesn't help me. We just tell all the judges in the country to assess all the circumstances, we say no more?",
  "What about banners? What would you do with banners?",
  "What would you do with banners? Would it make sense to say all banners are banned from the courtroom? I thought you would think that would make a lot of sense.",
  "Yes. Signs, placards.",
  "I think I know why. Because it affects the atmospherics of the trial.",
  "I'm not so sure. You think that we could just say we're going to exercise our best judgment, not necessarily amend the Constitution, just because it is a good idea, banners and buttons are hereby banned forever? Do we have the authority to just say that?",
  "We're exploring initially what the rule ought to be.",
  "Falls within the ambit of what? Of a mob-dominated atmosphere or -- your answer to Justice Souter was AEDPA would -- was that this would require reversal even under AEDPA; is that your answer?",
  "That was quoting Holbrook and Flynn.",
  "Yes. And you're having the judge say that you can't wear certain signs, you can't make certain demonstrations. If the family were there and they -- and one of the members of the family was sobbing, with tears coming out of her eyes, I -- that - -",
  "-- much, it has much more impact than a button.",
  "The record is confusing, at least as I read it -- please correct me if I'm wrong -- on the showing of how many days these buttons were worn. A, is it clear from the record how many days the buttons were worn?",
  "So it may have been for just one day of the trial?",
  "Where does it say that?",
  "These were declarations filed with the United States district court in habeas?",
  "But I think Justice Ginsburg's point, and it concerns me as well, is that the Government is entitled to say that during the time the event occurred, i.e., the firing, he was on duty and he refrained from committing any unlawful act.",
  "Well, but the question is what the district court should examine, and the statute talks about the incident out of which the claim arose. So that necessarily requires the Government to look at the complaint, see the incident out of which this claim arises, whether or not the claim is true, and to certify it.",
  "\"Out of which the claim arose\" it seems to me is of some importance. But the dissenting judges in the First Circuit case, Wood, didn't think it was important. I'm not sure they were right about that.",
  "What happens if the Attorney General doesn't certify and it goes to State court? I take it one of the concerns we have here is that there will be a deprivation of jury trial if the certification is wrong and if it's in Federal court. Suppose that there is a denial of certification. Then under (d)(3) - -",
  "-- the employee can ask for a certification decision. I take it that's a Federal law defense that the, or a Federal law point, that the State court must hear and so now we're back in State court?",
  "And we still don't have a jury trial and if that's so I'm not sure if that helps you or helps the Petitioner.",
  "But in my case I guess I don't think it ever gets to district court because there's no certification, but then the employee can ask the State court to have a bench trial on the scope of employment. Am I right about that?",
  "But my point is I suppose the Government can just say, we're not going to make the certification and we're not going to remove.",
  "So then the State court still has to have the bench trial on the scope of employment.",
  "I'm not sure if that helps. It seems to me that might be an argument for limiting the inquiry just so that we can avoid having bench trials in almost every case.",
  "Suppose the district court finds that in its experience, 80 percent of the claims are ones that are unexhausted, just assume that. And the district court said, the only way I can figure out the good 20 percent from the 80 percent that are going to ultimately be dismissed is to have a motion for a more definite, an order for a more definite statement, because I'll do it sua sponte under 12(e), I think. Can the district court do that?",
  "The court could ask for a pleading which set forth the facts of exhaustion?",
  "Then why isn't this - - this is just the same if the court has said, you know, in order to make our screening function efficient, we just have to know about exhaustion.",
  "How about, what, if you concede the district court could do it in individual cases or in most cases, why can't the Sixth Circuit do it? That's my question.",
  "Is there any argument that if the state does not insist on exhaustion or plead exhaustion, that it just drops out of the case? If the state resolves the case on the merits even though there is no exhaustion, can the Federal court hear it, that there is general agreement about that?",
  "Well, no, it's standard law of agency. It doesn't make any difference. The prisoner is denied his rights. As Justice Stevens said, there may be three or four different people who concurred. Do your rules say that if he can't find out with reasonable efforts that he doesn't need to, or does the Sixth Circuit rules say that the delegation of the names is not required?",
  "In that respect, how does the -- there may not be a definitive authority by this. Oregon says that if a corporation commits manslaughter it's required to pay up to twice the amount the corporation gained by committing the offense - -",
  "-- is my understanding. Suppose a corporation in a hypothetical case commits five manslaughters. Would they be liable -- and gained for $1 million. Would they be liable for twice a million dollars in every manslaughter case?",
  "Do you say this after the fact? The jury doesn't hear this?",
  "It seems very odd that a major argument for constraint is something that the jury can't hear. It just goes to show, really, the irrational nature of the exercise.",
  "I suppose you'd have to file a protective petition with the district court saying we won but we might still lose.",
  "Provided equitable - -",
  "But you're asking us to say that the Congress has written a statute which doesn't take account that the state might sometimes file a petition for certiorari that would be granted. And you say oh, that's so rare, that's so extraordinary. It happens. It's part of the system.",
  "Well, I'll accept your view as being the personal experience. I'm rather surprised that district courts would go through all of these preliminary steps when the case is on cert and they may not have to.",
  "I'm not sure if I would tell the district courts that's what they ought to do, is a wise expenditure of resources. I'll think about that.",
  "What is the source of the rule in Teague? Could Congress overturn the rule in Teague if it wanted to and say that nothing is retroactive or that everything is retroactive?",
  "Crawford did use the term bedrock?",
  "Well, there is a new emphasis on cross-examination.",
  "Well, there wasn't cross-examination by defense counsel.",
  "In this case there wasn't cross-examination by defense counsel. Or am I incorrect?",
  "Oh, oh. No, I mean of the witness.",
  "Well I guess you're asking us to say Crawford, get one, take one, it is really not that important. If that's so, I suppose we shouldn't have overruled Roberts.",
  "But that's not this case.",
  "I'm talking about the daughter's testimony.",
  "That's in an instruction, like Toomey versus Ohio. The judge is corrupt. It is just structural. You can't say that about Crawford, or can you?",
  "The problem with your case -- maybe it's our problem because it was our rule -- is that we're asked to adopt an across-the-board calculus as to the rule. In some cases, as I think you will have to concede, under the Roberts jurisprudence, the fact finding was more accurate. In your case, what you are telling us is that the fact finding is far less accurate. But I think you are stuck unless you can give us some reason that we depart with it. With a rule-made jurisprudence, we have to look at the rule in the whole universe of cases, not just your case. It seems to me that was the problem you had in arguing in this area, and maybe you can suggest some way out. I don't see it.",
  "Adequate indicia of reliability.",
  "But could Duke have had a challenge to the 1992 or 2000 regulations? Could they have reopened the issue at that point?",
  "I don't want to jump ahead to the jurisdictional argument if you want to talk about the modification substantive point first, but it is not clear to me whether Duke should have acted in 1980, 1992 or 2000, or all of the above.",
  "Well, what exactly are you seeking in these enforcement proceedings? An injunction to install the BACT or criminal fines or civil fine, or what?",
  "If you have an enforcement proceeding and there is a legitimate question of whether or not the agency's interpretation is consistent with the statute with Chevron deference and so forth and the court looks at it and says, you know, I have a real problem with the way the agency interpreted the basic statute when it first issued the regulation, the court can't get into that merely because the parties didn't present it earlier?",
  "The court's almost issuing an advisory opinion in a way.",
  "Are there other areas in the law where courts have to take as binding a legal proposition that they think is dead wrong when they - -",
  "Well, is what the government is saying here is that suppose the regulation can be interpreted to say X or Y. X would hurt the company; Y would not. Is the government saying, if it is foreseeable that the agency might take the unfavorable position, you then must challenge it in the D.C. Circuit?",
  "Well, could they have said that construction means both modification and then come up with a new word, alteration? Because the statute says the term construction includes modification, so I -- construction can be broader. Could it be an alteration, they would come up with a new term of art, and add that - -",
  "But, but you presume in your last answer that other than that, there is an absolutely fair prosecution.",
  "I mean, why do we make that assumption when we start out with the allegation of a tort and a violation of the Constitution? I don't understand.",
  "What about the fact - - suppose that there were even a more serious battery here, a broken limb or something. Would you have to sue for the damages for the battery right away? The police officers injured - -",
  "Well, what about this case?",
  "I'm still, I'm still puzzled about my question. Suppose there's a battery resulting in a serious injury to the defendant.",
  "Why is that the situation?",
  "But if does, then you wait?",
  "Are there many cases in which the rule of Stone versus Powell is inapplicable for that reason?",
  "What about the beating of the defendant?",
  "Well then, my question is going to be along the same lines. Suppose -- I assume this is a rather frequent case -- the confession is alleged to be the product of a beating. The two are merged. If we have to wait for the Fifth Amendment claim anyway, then as a matter of policy, matter of convenience, why don't we wait for the Fourth Amendment as well?",
  "Well, we're making up the rule of accrual, Ms. Solomon. I'm asking, if we have to wait for one, why not wait for the other?",
  "I suppose -- correct me if I'm wrong -- when the district court wants to determine if he should hold something in abeyance, this is not necessarily abstention; this is what courts always do when there are multiple actions. Other action pending is a general ground for a court to stay its hand.",
  "I had missed Mr. Flaxman's point that this would an advantage to the prosecutor to say, aren't you going to make a lot of money about this case? My initial reaction as the defense counsel, I would love that comment. I would tell the jury: Of course, it's our duty as counsel to point out that my client was beaten, he was terrified, he was beaten again, he had a false confession, and the damages we're not interested in; we'll get much more damages if you convict and we show this 15 years later because the policemen lied as they always do. You know, you hear it.",
  "But he has tried more of these cases than I have and he indicates this is a serious concern.",
  "No, no. This is the Cook County. This is the Cook County court.",
  "No, but he says the fact of the complaint the prosecutor's going to use in order to show that they're trying to profit from a false claim of a beating.",
  "No, but the point is if the complaint is filed then the prosecution can makes that point.",
  "Would it ever be proper for a district court to insist on proceeding to the merits of the claim, to dispose of the merits of the claim, while the prosecution was pending? Suppose the district court thought that it was seeing too many of these claims and it wanted to get to the bottom of them?",
  "We haven't written about that other than in Heck explicitly and implicitly, and in Younger? That's about it?",
  "That in effect is saying we can't have a statute of limitations rule; we're just going to laches, we're just going to an equitable rule.",
  "We're just throwing up our hands and saying there is statute of limitations statute of limitations.",
  "Could the district court -- pardon me. Could the bankruptcy court make that same determination in deciding whether or not to allow the Chapter 7 proceeding to be converted? He could make this inquiry in a Chapter 7 proceeding? He says: I don't think you should be able to convert because there's a fraud, but I'll look at how the creditors come out. Could he do that? And then you don't have the specter that Justice Souter referred to of this transfer back and then the transfer back, which is a waste of time.",
  "Why can't they just have an order to the bankrupt -- to disclose the asset in the Chapter 13 proceeding?",
  "In the Chapter 13 proceeding.",
  "Well, in this case they knew about it, didn't they?",
  "So you think there can always be two petitions, one -- of sentences on review?",
  "Bit is that also your theory?",
  "But are you -- are you asking us to say that while the sentence is still under review, there can be no habeas petition filing?",
  "Why isn't that up to the option of the petitioner? He can take his chances or he can wait.",
  "I'm asking if it is your position whether or not he properly can do that?",
  "I suppose that doesn't make the dissenters in Blakely feel very good.",
  "Of course you have to show that the result was dictated by the prior precedent. That's a strong phrase. We said it in Stringer - - Stringer versus Black. But if it has a new application, that's -- that's new. Even though the principle is the same.",
  "You mean no facts in the indictment or charging documents?",
  "But there is in the presentence report?",
  "Well, could you tell us what your position is if we choose to use the noncategorical or the modified categorical approach? Is there a nexus between what's in the presentence report and some other charging documents, or is it just in the presentencing report?",
  "Do you agree that this presentence report cannot be consulted under the reasoning of Shepard, we need more?",
  "You don't think the PSR has some kind of significance that the police report did not?",
  "Well, my question is the same as Justice Breyer's. Is there anything in the literature, including medical literature, that talks about significant or minor risks? I mean, you fill out forms when you go to the dentist about risks. Now, if -- if the chance of death is one out of 100, is that significant? I mean, I don't know.",
  "Well, but there is a risk if the uterine wall is compromised by cancer or some forms of preeclampsia and it's very thin, there's a risk of being punctured.",
  "Suppose the doctor has the intent, the good faith intent to perform a standard in utero D&E, and he knows because of what's happened in the last three months, with women with this particular shaped fetus and particular position of the fetus, that the chances are 50 percent, 60 percent that it's going to be an intact delivery, at which point he is presented with the problem. Does he have the prohibitive intent? Because aren't you, don't you have an intent to commit the, most likely consequences of your acts?",
  "Well, that's important to me because you seem to think that there is a standard D&E. In reading the medical testimony it seemed to me that D&Es ought to result in result in intact deliveries quite without the intent of the doctor. Now maybe that's wrong.",
  "But then you pin your whole case on the availability of D&E even though D&Es sometimes inadvertently turn into intact D&Es.",
  "Did you understand the government's argument or answer to that to be, well, if the intent did not exist, if there was not an intent to do that, then the doctor is not liable?",
  "I don't want to misinterpret the Attorney General, the Solicitor General's remarks but he indicated in those case there could be an as applied challenge.",
  "Well, the answer that the Solicitor gave -- General gave to that was, you could have a pre-enforcement proceeding. That you can back up the clock.",
  "Well, those doctors testified in the congressional hearings or in the Eighth Circuit or Ninth Circuit or the Second Circuit? There are so many doctors here. Which are the two that you're referring to that do not dilate the cervix fully? Did they testify in any of the district court cases?",
  "Can you tell me a hypothetical instance in which where an as applied challenge could be brought if we sustain the statutue on its face? The procedure has to take place within 24, 48, 72 hours. How would as applied challenge take place? You know, I read all the doctors' testimony in this case, hundreds of pages, and I'm familiar with the area generally. But it takes a while to get up to speed. I don't know if you could just go to a district judge and say I need an order, the judge would take - - would have to take many hours to understand that.",
  "Why isn't that already in the record in the Ninth Circuit, in the Second Circuit and in the Eighth Circuit, in the district courts, proceedings in those circuits?",
  "General Clement, I'm just thinking, trying to imagine how an as applied challenge would be really much different from what we have seen already.",
  "Can you tell me -- I didn't find it in the materials. Maybe the statistics aren't available. In the cases where intact D&E or D&X are performed in the period I guess, what, 16 through 20, 21st, 22nd weeks, in how many of those instances, do you have any idea, in how many of those instances is there serious health risk to the mother that requires the procedure as opposed to simply being an elective procedure? Are there any statistics on that?",
  "I have just one other question that, it's generally related to the first. If there is substantial evidence that other procedures or alternate procedures are available, alternate to D&X, alternate to intact D&E, is your response that, although they're available as a matter of science, as a matter of, of medical expertise, they are not available because hospitals don't allow the patients to be admitted? I was going to ask that same question to the Government, because there is some indication in the record that certain hospitals just don't admit patients for this purpose, which is -- goes back to my earlier question. I was wondering if that's because it's surely elective.",
  "Because it's purely elective and not medically necessary.",
  "Well, it might be related in the sense that the Government's argument that there are alternate mechanisms is not a practical alternative. I was going to ask the Government about that. On the other hand, the fact that any number of hospitals don't allow the procedure is also indicated, indication that there is a medical opinion against it.",
  "That's what I was wondering, because - -",
  "Suppose, this might help, suppose the physician testifies that I wanted to do a non-intact, an in utero D&E, that that's, that was my intent, that's what I wanted to do, that's what I always want to do. In this case I had an intact delivery and had no other choice. Are you saying that we could interpret the statute to say that that is not the prohibited criminal intent, he is immune from prosecution in that case?",
  "Well, give me one instance in which your proposed interpretation would work in the real world.",
  "Well, just on that last point, I mean, we are interested of course in different interpretations, but it just seems to me that your interpretation would have very little practical effect.",
  "It seems to me that your argument is that there is always a constitutional right to use what the physician thinks is the safest procedure.",
  "I inferred that from your comments.",
  "So then, you think there are instances in which the State can require that a procedure be used, even if it's not the safest procedure?",
  "So then, the - -",
  "The obverse of the proposition I put at first, it must be true that there are some instances in which the State can prohibit a procedure even if it is the safest procedure.",
  "But are you saying that the rule for paycheck decisions is different than the rule for other sorts of decisions?",
  "That seems to me to work the other way around, just like the case we've just heard argued in the last hour. It's a question of specificity here. If the, if the employee, he alleges that promotions were based on experience and the employee didn't have the experience because of past discrimination, why is that different than the paycheck rule? I take it indicates that you would not allow the, a cause of action unless the discrimination was within the statute of limitations period?",
  "Would that be true if there were a change in ownership of the company, so the discrimination originally occurred under owner A, then the company is purchased by owner B, completely unrelated, and the, the disparity is used for bonuses, etcetera?",
  "Well, under the, under the answer that you gave to the Chief Justice and the rule you propose, what of the case of differing ownership?",
  "Does he have to know that the present decision to continue the pay structure is discriminatory?",
  "Well, the question is whether or not there was a discriminatory act and if the employer, let's say it's an employer that has just purchased a business, thinks that it's a neutral criterion to base wages or bonuses or increase on a prior pay scale and he doesn't know about the prior discrimination, why isn't that a defense?",
  "But suppose he has no intent to discriminate as a present matter, but he also knows that his decision is necessarily based on a policy that was discriminatory some years ago. What result?",
  "He knows it, but his present decision is necessarily based on some prior decision that was discriminatory.",
  "How is that -- how is that consistent with the statement in Bazemore that the employer has a duty to eradicate past discrimination?",
  "But of course, there the legal standard was not clear. And the Dura case, I looked at, and perhaps you disagree based on what you -- what I have just heard, and I thought Dura was a lack of proximate cause. They just didn't show any relation between the injury they alleged to have suffered, and their own.",
  "And that's the way I read Dura.",
  "So in the negligently drove case, the plaintiff negligently drove over - - the defendant negligently drove over the plaintiff, if it's not specific as to time and place it must be dismissed? If it's specific as to time and place it's, it withstands the motion?",
  "What if it does say within the last 10 years.",
  "Do you have a case, do you have a case I can look to that tells me that?",
  "Now you're reading from the Swierkiewicz brief?",
  "No. His hypothetical is all you've done is to allege the final sentence without the preceding clause, the five or six lines before there's a comma. That's out. All there is is the allegation of the conspiracy. Is that enough in this case?",
  "No. The hypothetical is without the preceding clause. Is that enough - -",
  "Is that enough in this case for what Justice Alito asked, and I think we are interested in the answer that you make given this complaint in this case that we are faced with.",
  "Well, would it be, would it be inadvisable for us to say the motive test teaches us something important; it has a valuable place; it's just not the exclusive test for what's obvious.",
  "Or do we have to reject it all out of -- out of hand?",
  "Motivation in this special sense.",
  "But, but, but my question is does it not serve to show us at least one way in which there can be obviousness?",
  "It may not be the exclusive test. We're -- I'm asking what the test ought to be.",
  "No. No. No. It took from 10 years to go from -- I think 10 years from Asano to Engelgau, so it must have been not all that obvious.",
  "Do you, do you concede - - do you concede that claims 1 through 3 are valid?",
  "If I had asked your opinion as an expert would you - -",
  "Well, I mean it seems to me that the whole argument that you're making as to Ford is that anybody knows you could, you use an electronic -- you have an electronic throttle, it serves a purpose; the pedal serves a purpose; put the two together.",
  "Why doesn't -- don't 1, 2 and 3 do the same thing?",
  "If they're invalid then I have -- then I'm struggling to find what your test is.",
  "I don't know what your test is.",
  "Going back to the asphalt case, were you suggesting that if they had made a claim for a process patent, that it might have been valid?",
  "Do you agree that in that context it would serve a valid purpose, i.e., can we - - that is to say, can we keep the motivation test and then supplement it with other, with other means of, other ways of showing obviousness?",
  "In this case, would there have been anything for a jury under your test?",
  "What about claims 1, 2 and 3?",
  "It looks like Dystar was decided by the Federal Circuit after it decided this case, didn't it?",
  "I mean, you have to be defending what the Federal Circuit did in this case. And the fact that they say well now, what this means is really in some other case, that seems to me that's really irrelevant.",
  "And I think you should tell us when the case has been decided after, I think it has much less, much less weight.",
  "Yes, but your -- the Federal Circuit is saying that, the gist of it is if and only if the previous patents taught this. But you, you can look at these two devices, and you're a good mechanic, you've never seen a patent, you've never read these patents, you've never read these claims, you've never been to the Supreme Court, and you put them together.",
  "And the Federal Circuit said oh, it's not in the patent, it's not obvious.",
  "Well then, in this case let's assume that we all strike out on coming out with the magic formulation. One of the ways the law progresses is we go from case to case, and in this case you have two standards of operation. One is a pedal that basically operates by pressure. The other -- and by levers. Other is by electronics, and these are two different methods of making the carburetor release the fuel. So why not, so somebody combines them. Why is that such a big deal as, as claim 4 says it is. Certainly this inventor would not be the only one to think that the two could and should be combined.",
  "What about in this case where the wires were getting frayed until this disclosure?",
  "So suppose I read the record the other way. Suppose I read the record as saying this invention stopped the wires from being frayed and therefore it was an advance.",
  "Was there any argument in the trial court or in the briefs of the Court of Appeals as to how to calculate cost? You basically have two markets. You don't usually think of cost when you buy something. But was there any argument as to how to determine whether or not this was below cost in the Brooke Group sense?",
  "But that was the end of it at the trial court.",
  "It's not clear to me that we have to get into this but if we do, I'm not sure about your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question. If you have your own logs that you own already and if you have logs on a long-term contract, the only relevant logs are the logs that both people are competing for. That's the only relevant market that we are talking about insofar as the purchaser is concerned.",
  "And if Weyerhaeuser wanted to drive somebody out of the market, then they go after the logs which are open to both parties.",
  "Why is it so hard if you take Justice Stevens' premise that there's an agreement and we take that as a given, as a given premise?",
  "But at the outset, you made this, some of this perhaps reassuring statement that we need not decide about global warming in this case. But don't we have to do that in order to decide the standing argument, because there's no injury if there's not global warming? Or, can you show standing simply because there is a likelihood that the perceived would show that there's an injury?",
  "What's your authority for that? I have the same question as the Chief Justice. I was looking at your brief for the strongest case. Suppose there were a big landowner that owned lots of coastline. Would he have the same standing that you do or do you have some special standing as a State, and if so what is the case which would demonstrate that?",
  "No, no. I'm asking whether you have some special standing - -",
  "-- as a State and, if so, what's the authority for that?",
  "Well, I don't know. 1907 was Georgia versus Tennessee Copper, and that was pre-Massachusetts versus Mellon. That seems to me your best case. What about a small landowner? I asked the question about a big landowner. Suppose you have a small landowner and he owned a lot?",
  "Your problem, I think, you take the position, the proposition that the greater the harm the greater the risk, the smaller the probability has to be before it is reasonable to act, and necessary to act.",
  "In Norton versus Utah Wilderness Alliance, having to do with the regulation of off-road vehicles, we indicated that one measure was whether or not the agency has unreasonably delayed its action.",
  "Well, I guess we can ask the respondents. But is it your understanding that respondents take the position that the State has no control at all over whether or not the shares have been properly issued, whether or not certain accounting requirements applicable to all corporations have been complied with?",
  "They say that there's no area of State law that is applicable to the subsidiary corporation?",
  "I could understand that with reference to just the amount of consumer loans, as Justice Scalia was talking about. But just to see if the corporation has a -- had -- had a meeting that year, has duly elected its officers under State law, do the respondents take the position you have no authority to visit the corporation to determine that?",
  "Well, that seems to be a standard preemption case. It's not as broad as just visitorial powers generally. Maybe I'm wrong. Do some subsidiaries of the -- of a national bank do things other than banking, say title insurance or something like that? I don't see anything in the record where the OCC wants to displace the State as to that. This is just a standard preemption case. When the OCC has regulations that control, then the State has no authority to add to those regulations or to have, or to have contrary regulations. But if it's something that doesn't have to do with banking at all, then I suppose they would say -- I can ask them -- I suppose they say the State has authority to regulate.",
  "What's your best case for the proposition that an agency and not the Congress defines the extent of field preemption?",
  "Do you disagree in general with the Solicitor General's brief? Do you agree in general with the brief submitted by the Government or do you have differences with it in its approach?",
  "Well, I can - -",
  "Well, it, it is a point that I, I'd like both him and you to discuss at some point during your argument. If -- can you use race for site selection? When you have, you need to build a new school. There are three sites. One of them would be all one race. Site two would be all the other race. Site three would be a diversity of races. Can the school board with, with the intent to have diversity pick site number 3?",
  "It -- there's -- well, we can have all kinds of different hypotheticals, but there's residential housing segregation, and it wants, it wants, the board wants to have diversity.",
  "No. It is a new school. It's a new school.",
  "So it'd have to take the three sites, all of them in the hypothetical, all of them equal, and just flip a coin, because otherwise it would be using a - -",
  " No, no. The school board says we want, right up front, we want racial diversity in our new schools. Illicit under the Fourteenth Amendment in your case?",
  "Well, it may not be necessary for you but it might be necessary for us when we write the case. We're not writing just on a very fact-specific issue. Of course, the follow-up question, and the Solicitor General can address it too, is this: Assuming some race-conscious measures are permissible to have diversity, isn't it odd to say you can't use race as a means? I mean, that's the next question. That may, in fact, be why you give the -- seem to give the answer that you do. You just don't want to embrace that contradiction.",
  "That is true.",
  "Well, what would you do with strategic site selection in order to create racial diversity?",
  "I mean, that's expressed and principal purpose. You know the hypothetical.",
  "Are you suggesting there was no consideration of overall educational benefits in this plan?",
  "At page 7 of your brief you say: \"School districts have an unquestioned interest in reducing minority isolation.\" If I put a period in there, then I would get to my strategic site selection, and I still haven't got your answer on that. You don't put a period there. You say: \". .have an unquestioned interest in reducing minority isolation through race-neutral means.\" And this brings up this same question Justice Ginsburg had. Isn't it odd jurisprudence where we have an objective that we state in one set of terms but a means for achieving it in another set of terms, unless your answer is that individual classification by race is, is impermissible, but other, more broad measures based on, with a racial purpose are all right?",
  "And what is the answer to my strategic site selection hypothetical?",
  "Well then, let me change Justice - -",
  "Well, my slight modification of Justice Scalia's hypothetical -- and it proceeds on the same theory -- is suppose there's a huge demand for housing. A developer has a plan to build 500 units. Can the city say, we'll grant you the permit on the ground, on the condition that 30 percent of all the houses go to minorities? That means people will live together. Then we can have a school, a school that can be diverse.",
  "Well, your system is the one that gives a choice to the individuals.",
  "But in Grutter we said, to shorten it just a little bit, at page 329-330 of the U.S. Reports, 539, \"the law school's interest is not simply to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group because of race ... that would amount to outright racial balancing which is patently unconstitutional.\" And that seems to be what you have here.",
  "The problem is that unlike strategic siting, magnet schools, special resources, special programs in some schools, you're characterizing each student by reason of the color of his or her skin. That is quite a different means. And it seems to me that that should only be, if ever allowed, allowed as a last resort.",
  "Justice Alito and Justice Breyer and I myself am interested: Can you tell us what has happened since the plan's been enjoined?",
  "I mean, have you gone back to square one? And it's just, there's no diversity at all? Or is there substantially more diversity? Can you tell us about that? Because it's important. It may mean that you don't need to identify students by the color of their skin in assignment.",
  "But the emphasis on the fact that everybody gets into a school, it seems to me is misplaced, but the question is whether or not you can get into the school that you really prefer. And that in some cases depends solely on skin color. You know, it's like saying everybody can have a meal but only people with separate skin can get the dessert.",
  "I understand, and I'm just wondering whether in your view that independent value could ever be trumped by the obvious countervailing value of having some African Americans see some white teachers and vice versa?",
  "And they also have unintended consequences when this Court ignores them.",
  "Does this case present the story where the meaning of Brown versus Board of Education is you can never take race out of politics?",
  "I, I think that's probably true. I think it is also probably true that the people in your community and the people on your school board are acting in the utmost good faith. And that what they have done is going to help the education of many students. The question is whether or not we can say that an insincere school board, people that want to play the race card, who want to play the race trip, the - - the race chip, that want a system in which they can use race for political advantage, can do this based on the color of the individual child's skin. That's what's involved here.",
  "I'm conceding that. The Constitution assumes that this might not always be the case. Are we going to look at the sincerity of the school boards, school by school board, school board member by school board member?",
  "But it, but it presents the principle that this Court is confronted with. If we for the first time say that a system that has achieved unitary status. So that the courts no longer have the authority or the need to supervise them, can then turn around and use individual skin color as a basis for assignment, we've never said that. And that takes us on a very perilous course.",
  "In the university cases this Court ran as far away as it could from using racial quotas. It talked about the fact that there was an individualized assessment. At, at issue was a university student who could understand the reasons for being rejected on, on the grounds of race, race being one criteria. That isn't this case.",
  "Once again, once again, one of the rationales for the law school cases was a First Amendment rationale. And you, and I think properly so, say that this is, this is not your interest. I agree with you. But that means that that case is completely inapplicable to help you.",
  "Well, I think -- I think we were communicating. Swann was a case where there was de jure discrimination. Bakke was a university case. This is a different case.",
  "And it's, and it's a troubling case.",
  "If it were to become relevant, would this record show -- this is the school district -- and this would be in the regime of the Court-ordered desegregation plan, because you are just recently emerged from that -- that the school district has tried means other than race conscious, of race classification in order to obtain the diversity benefits you seek?",
  "And were those magnet schools? And could you tell me about that?",
  "Do any of those study the possibilities of the system in which you elect to go into a system where race counts?",
  "Are they written out anywhere we can see them? Or are there articles on this?",
  "Can you tell me, how is race used? Do the administrators have discretion in the weight they will give to it on a case by case basis?",
  "I'm not sure how to ask the question: Is it used fairly evenly across the board when it is the tiebreaker?",
  "To tip the tipping point, whatever.",
  "That means -- that leads to the question of why do they need it?",
  "So it's symbolic that race counts?",
  "Excuse me. I didn't understand it.",
  "Well, suppose a company has a plan to defraud the Government and it use a certain chemical mix to save money and that's what the real fraud is. And it puts it in place and it puts it in place in 1988. And the -- and it has just two containers full of this. And the relator knows about it. The relator then quits. Then for 10 years the company does the same thing, following the same patterns, same method, same improper formula. And he then rings -- he then brings this to the attention of the Government in the proper way and files a suit. He cannot recover for the later action which was the same pattern, practice?",
  "Would it be completely inconsistent with Taylor versus United States for us to say that when there is a novel or an unusual theory of potential liability such as proposed by the respondent, which would exonerate him from application of this statute, that he has the burden to show that that's what happened?",
  "Would Taylor allow us to do that sort of burden shifting?",
  "And so your general rule to accomplish your objective would be?",
  "Well, I'm not so sure.",
  "Well, I -- is there a distinction between the question Justice Breyer put to you, the hypothetical of a municipal electricity company, and this case? In this case you have private haulers, you have private waste dumps at the end, you just have a public, a publicly owned and mandated processing center in the middle. It would be as if in the electric case you have private electric companies that generate the power, private electric companies that distribute the power, but they all have to go through a Government-owned transformer at the key. It seems that's the case you have here.",
  "But you don't make that, that's not the argument you make.",
  "At least that's not the way you answered Justice Breyer.",
  "But, but then, but then Justice Breyer is going to say well, you - -",
  "-- that you, that you can bar it altogether but you can't regulate it just a little bit - -",
  "-- actually is greater than the sum of it.",
  "It's a quite different assumption.",
  "Well, what is your authority for the proposition that we use strict scrutiny?",
  "Can you give me one case of it being strict scrutiny?",
  "I mean, I just didn't realize that that phrase entered into our Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Correct me if I'm wrong.",
  "That is to say, if it discriminates?",
  "But certainly on burden cases we don't require that.",
  "Well, it might be a good revenue device for the government to say, yeah, let's have our own pasteurizing plant, we'll make it a criminal offense for anybody to use a facility other than ours and we'll charge triple the price.",
  "That's not a burden on interstate commerce?",
  "Suppose the user fee were ten times what it is?",
  "Why is that?",
  "Well, I suppose any private entity can choose its market.",
  "I suppose any private entity can choose its market. You're a market participant. You're saying, we're going to serve this class of consumers. That's your privilege. But what you do is you have a market participation which is sanctioned by the criminal law. You've built this trash utopia where everybody sends wonderful trash and you enforce use of that by the criminal law. So you're engaging as a market participant, but you're taking an extra advantage by using the criminal law to enforce, to enforce its use.",
  "Well, but it's basic Commerce Clause analysis that a State has no interest in what happens to the product out of State. Baldwin versus Seelig.",
  "You can't say we want - - we're enacting this law to affect what happens in other States. That's just contrary to the Commerce Clause.",
  "But I thought that was just the answer you gave to Justice Stevens on your point two.",
  "Who mandated this plan? The State of New York?",
  "But the State of New York can't mandate what happens to interstate commerce.",
  "If you say the Congress of the United States has authorized discrimination against interstate commerce, then of course it can do that. That has happened.",
  "But Pike doesn't apply to discrimination. Pike applies to burdens.",
  "It seems you are conflating the two.",
  "What would you do with Justice Alito's question? Dean Milk versus Madison: All milk must be processed whether been 20 miles of where it's - -",
  "-- produced.",
  "Held discriminatory against interstate commerce. Could -- under your view, could your city require all milk be pasteurized within your city at a government owned, city owned facility?",
  "No, but Justice Scalia says it always does because it benefits the locality.",
  "You have -- by criminal laws - -",
  "Are you suggesting that the test is whether under colorable jurisdiction -- a hypothetical case, suppose the statute, Federal statute is very clear that it applies in any case. Would your argument be the same?",
  "But if we accept that in the opinion, what was the phrase you used, colorable jurisdiction, or -- it's something I made up, I suppose -- is there some concept that we can refer to or some phrase that works to -- in order to incorporate your test that you seem to be suggesting?",
  "Mr. Waxman, may I just ask this question? I don't understand what the import of this order on page 51 is. I have it in front of me. What did that do? Is it anything different immediately after the order entered than - -",
  "Well, am I wrong? I thought that the Attorney General of Guam did file cert in some cases that are pending, or am I wrong on that?",
  "Mr. Waxman, can I ask you this, just about Guam, not about the other territories. Is there anything in the Organic Act that would prevent Guam from changing the assessed percentage from 35 percent to 100 or 150?",
  "So there's no, no limit in the Organic Act of any real meaning?",
  "And they're valuing it for tax purposes, so that sounds like tax valuation.",
  "No, just before you go there, if I were a bond investor, I would much prefer issuing bonds if it's the lower value, if it's the assessed value. I'm just more secure.",
  "Well, you do have a concrete appraisal, but it's just reduced to 35 percent.",
  "In that case, you should want us to exercise jurisdiction, decide it one way or the other.",
  "But you still have the option, and I'm just dying to ask the question not having anything to do with the case. Why did they do this? Why did they have -- was it just to make everybody feel good and they think they're ripping off the government because they're getting only a 35 percent value, even though everybody knows they'll just raise the rate if it changes?",
  "Well, I don't know if you got to the third point you were going to make. You were outlining three different points. But it seems to me that from the very start, what happens is that you and your brother for the respondent are talking past each other. You want to talk to us about the adequacy of the State court's finding. The respondent says what we - - all we want is a hearing in the district court, and those are two different issues. We want a hearing in the district court, i.e., so that we can show the findings are insubstantial or incorrect. Those, it seems to me, are two different issues, and I sense the briefs are talking past each other on this point. Did you see the same thing?",
  "In your view, what is the standard for when the district court may hold an evidentiary hearing? I know there's an element of discretion in it.",
  "That's the only time the district court can hold a hearing?",
  "Yes, but it seems that if he doesn't do that, then that's a bar. But if he has done that, when can he ask for a further hearing?",
  "Well, on the waiver point, let's assume that this case had not come in -- come here, and you had gone back to the district court pursuant to the order of the Ninth Circuit. Surely you would have taken the position, or you could have taken the position if the evidence developed that way, that he really knew or should have known about all this mitigating evidence and he waived. You certainly could continue to take that position in the district court.",
  "And the district court would say I now have a more full, factual record, and I make the finding that there was knowing waiver, or there wasn't.",
  "But doesn't that assume that the defendant know what mitigating evidence is? I mean, this defendant, I suppose wants to show, \"I thought mitigating evidence was just going to be what the, these two relatives were going to testify to. There was really much more, if my counsel had investigated.\" And that's not a knowing waiver.",
  "And the district court has substantial discretion in determining whether or not to grant that hearing on that basis.",
  "Part of that discretion is, and you've been careful to say this, that there's a likelihood of a different result?",
  "So it seems to me that that is the difficult part of your case based on this evidence.",
  "Well, we know what the fetal alcohol testimony is going to be.",
  "And we could make a determination or the court of appeals could make a determination or the district court could make a determination how likely that would to be affect the result.",
  "I have just one other question on a different matter. In Judge Bias's dissent, Judge Bay's dissent, he quotes a letter from the Petitioner, the Petitioner does not want to proceed with this appeal and wants the execution scheduled. Can you comment on that?",
  "Just on the second point. I wanted -- does the rule of the Federal district court in forum non conveniens where it dismisses a case for lack of a convenient form, does it have any ongoing consequences as the law of the case? I know our Chick Kam Choo precedent where we said Federal court determination forum non conveniens is not binding in a state court, but supposing in this case that the parties went to San Francisco with a -- and said we want to sue there. Would the San Francisco court, the United States District Court feel bound by the determination that this dispute is determined by Chinese law, and that the Chinese court is therefore the appropriate court?",
  "What about the ruling that this would be governed by Chinese law and that the Chinese court is the best forum to consider that? That too has no lat -- has no effect beyond the court in Philadelphia?",
  "In Martin, in the hypothetical where this case is dismissed for forum non conveniens and then they go to another Federal district court, could the second Federal district court say this has already been heard by the first district court; I'm not getting into it? Or, or does that district court have, have to go through the motion again?",
  "But you have the same problem if it's students, I take it? You'd have the same statistical question whether you, you use districts or students?",
  "I see your white light is on. I don't want to take -- would the other States make that same answer that you just made?",
  "Well, I wanted to ask about that. Suppose Washington says that as a matter of Washington law we are bound by our interpretation of purpose and we interpret the statute according to that purpose. You use the words \"plain language\" a few minutes ago.",
  "Are we free to disregard that and to say. Oh well, we're just going to follow the plain language?",
  "Like the says that was argued, the first case this morning?",
  "But that's a Federal, a Federal statute and this is a State statute. If the State court says, we're interested in purposes, we decided, and you must as a matter of State law interpret the statute according to the purpose as we found it, aren't we bound by that?",
  "What's your authority for that?",
  "Well, that's because the characterization had a Federal consequence.",
  "Do you agree with the court's conclusion that constitutionality is at issue here?",
  "Isn't it your position that this statute is constitutional either way you interpret it?",
  "But Washington -- at a minimum, I would assume that the Washington Supreme Court would not have constitutional avoidance as a crutch in order to reach that, to reach that conclusion, because there is no constitutional issue here under your view.",
  "Are the First Amendment rights of the union members, of the workers who are non-union members relevant?",
  "I mean, you -- you begin by talking about the First Amendment but you, you proceed as if there are no First Amendment rights of, of workers involved at all.",
  "Well, I take it States have considerable discretion in determining how to protect Federal constitutional rights.",
  "And absent some direction that we have to consider this as only being for a, for purposes of election transparency, it seems to me that Washington acted quite properly in saying we will use this mechanism in order to protect our workers' First Amendment constitutional rights.",
  "You want us to consider this case as if the First Amendment rights of non-union members were not involved?",
  "But that's been your whole argument so far.",
  "Could the State have a restriction requiring affirmative authorization for all union expenditures that fall within the Abood-Machinist line of cases?",
  "If this were across the board as to all First Amendment rights an objecting member has, then the statute would be void -- would be valid, rather?",
  "No, it's done in this statute.",
  "Well, my hypothetical is that there's a Washington statute or a Washington constitutional referendum provision, initiative provision, which says that as to all protected speech for non- union members who have moneys taken out, there must be affirmative authorization.",
  "Can you tell me -- this is just basic bankruptcy. I should know, but I looked it up and couldn't find it. A standard promissory note which provides for attorneys' fees, the holder of the note is the creditor, the maker of the note is the bankrupt -- the maker of the note goes bankrupt. The holder of the note gets his attorney and says: File a claim in bankruptcy. And the attorney sends him a bill. Is the attorneys' fees, the attorney fee for filing the bankruptcy claim, recoverable as part of the claim?",
  "It's the standard, it's the standard attorneys' fee provision, all attorneys' fees in connection with collection of this note and enforcement of the terms of this note.",
  "Is there something where I can look that up in Collier? Are there millions of cases? I mean, this seems to me fairly rudimentary.",
  "No, no. But in my case, it's a post-petition action.",
  "Just in the hypothetical, I would think that in many cases, there's going to be some payout for the promissory note, and the holder of the note tells his attorneys: Make sure I get that claim in bankruptcy. The attorney files a claim. And every attorney that files a claim for a promissory note which is entitled to a fee from the bankruptcy court for filing in the bankruptcy court.",
  "Are they - -",
  "Let me just ask you about the Fobian, and I know Justice Breyer has a question. Let's assume that you're correct in that the fees are allowable. Can the bankruptcy court make the determination of the reasonableness of the fees?",
  "In this case.",
  "So -- so if the bankruptcy judge isn't sure of what the amount is, he looks to State law to determine the amount?",
  "But the bankruptcy court does determine reasonableness.",
  "No, no. But -- but we are talking about attorneys' fees for services performed in the bankruptcy proceeding?",
  "The cost of filing the claim, the cost of talking to the bankruptcy judge, et cetera.",
  "Well, if you say it doesn't go far enough then I infer from that you say that it's valid as far as it goes?",
  "Justice Ginsburg has a question I'm very interested in. Do you defend the Fobian rule?",
  "That doesn't -- and then you have the negative inference or the exclusio unius argument, whatever, which I think is misplaced in this context.",
  "Well, Timbers cited, as the Chief Justice indicates, the interest section in 506. That's all it's about. I don't -- I think Timbers is misleading on this point.",
  "No, attorney for the debtor.",
  "Well, on that point you disagree with the Collier citation at page 9 of the reply brief then?",
  "Well, it says if the creditor incurs the attorneys' fees post petition in connection with protecting a pre-petition claim - -",
  "-- the fees will be pre-petition.",
  "So you disagree with that?",
  "I -- I am concerned about your point that there are all kinds of attorneys' fees contracts out there and if everybody can get fees for filing the claim post-petition act, we have a huge amount of claims to pay. Travelers would tell us, though, that a surety is different, that they somehow stand in the shoes of PG&E or something.",
  "If you prevail, why can't every attorney who represents a creditor who has a credit card or a promissory note providing for attorneys' fees file something in bankruptcy and get attorneys' fees for the filing of the claim?",
  "I have just two, two questions on, on willful and then -- because you may want to talk about the other issue in the case. First, you began by saying that here a district judge has come to the contrary conclusion; by definition, it can't be reckless. Do you have any authority, where we -- for that proposition, where we have said that?",
  "We find all the time that a right is not clearly established under AEDPA, and so forth -- and disregard what I just said. That's my first question. And the second is willfully, as Screws itself makes very clear, it is interpreted differently in the criminal context than it is in the civil context.",
  "Why did they use credit reports? Is it just a hedge against late premiums and the cost of late premiums, or does it bear on risk factors generally?",
  "Well, why can't we just read Nelson and then say in these cases whether or not it's correct?",
  "But you see, in Johnson the Court was confronted with the special issues and it makes the assumption based on the State's representation there, that the special issues had enough latitude for a jury to fully consider this. What has happened in these cases is that the prosecutors tell the jury, they keep reminding the jury you just must answer special issues one and two as given. And in the Cole case they say, even though you felt maybe he had had a rough time as a kid, you still must put that out of the mind, of your mind, and just go by the special issues. And that's the concern in these cases.",
  "But that's because the issues confined him to that.",
  "Were these decisions post-Johnson.",
  "And what's the Texas case that says that?",
  "Well, did we say that in the case of all childhood, in cases, in every case of childhood abuse and so forth?",
  "Or was it really applied just in the context of the Graham evidence?",
  "Right. But the answer to Justice Breyer it seems to me has to be that you can only consider it in the, in the context of deliberateness or future dangerousness.",
  "Can you tell me, if you know, how many cases in the Texas system, capital cases, are pending that were decided before the legislature amended the instruction?",
  "But I take it your answer was that all these were tried before Texas amended the statute. Was it 1991 when it amended the statute?",
  "And all the cases you mentioned were tried before 1991.",
  "Also on the same preliminary line of inquiry, are we in as good a position as the State court to conduct harmless error analysis, or can we or must we defer to the State court's harmless error analysis?",
  "So that if there is an instruction given to the jury and it violates the Constitution, then we, as a de novo matter, can determine the harmless error, harmless error inquiry?",
  "Well, is the level of harmless error determined as a matter of Federal or State law when there is a Federal law?",
  "Really. You mean that they could have something that it has to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and we'd be bound by that?",
  "No. But in this case the counsel for the defendant did one other thing, and it said to the judge, you don't have authority under State law to add to these supplemental instructions. And I was going to ask you, he was right about that, wasn't he?",
  "Really?",
  "Was it the nullification instruction?",
  "But in this case the judge said I'm going to give the nullification instruction, and the attorney said, and I think quite properly, he said that won't work.",
  "Is there no Federal interest in ensuring that there is a full and fair implementation of a Federal right? And if the State higher standard is erroneously applied, doesn't that prejudice the Federal right?",
  "It seems to me that gives very little weight to the goal, which I think is a congressional goal, of nationwide consistency in eliminating the disparities in the sentencing system which cause great disrespect to the justice system.",
  "Can I substitute \"substantial\" for \"gravitational\" without offending your position or affecting your position?",
  "Kind of a weak law of gravity like the Moon. It's only at one-seventh.",
  "Well, I guess the question is how strong should we say or can we say, or can Congress say it is?",
  "Then it seems to me that to accomplish the goal that you want to accomplish in this case, you almost remove the appellate courts from the process.",
  "Well, as one of the themes that you advance, you indicate that if your approach is followed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over time. I assume they would be adjusted to be more precise, but then we are right back where we started because you want to give the guidelines very little effect. It seems to me, in a way, you're arguing against yourself. If your view is accepted and the result is considerable disparity, I suppose all that Congress can do is have mandatory minimums.",
  "Do you think it is idle to talk about disparity before the Sentencing Reform Act was adopted? You remember those days.",
  "Well, I think you ran away from Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical just a little bit. Let's assume that Congress wants to keep this distinction and let's assume that there's no constitutional problem with the distinction. There might be, but let's assume. Can the judge simply say, I ignore that congressional -- congressional judgment is wrong. I'm not going to do that.",
  "Is the judge permitted - -",
  "Where -- I'm looking at that. It says shall consider. Am I missing something?",
  "Can you give me your page cite?",
  "Suppose the district court says I give these following -- I've considered these following specific factors. But in my view, the consistency and nationwide uniformity that the guidelines strive to achieve is of great importance; and for that reason, I'm following the guidelines?",
  "Is that an inappropriate judgment for the district court to make?",
  "It's not the end all. Suppose the district judge said I think this is of great importance. You don't think that the Booker opinion - - or do you think the Booker opinion rejected uniformity and consistency as an important factor?",
  "Mr. Cochran, you do contend, do you not, that if the guidelines had been mandatory, there would have been a violation of the Sixth Amendment.",
  "That's right, Your Honor, absolutely.",
  "The guidelines are what?",
  "Can you say it is an initial benchmark?",
  "So benchmarks are bad. Presumption is bad. Great weight, that's bad?",
  "Well, perhaps I misunderstood Justice Souter's question, but I have this concern, and I thought it was his concern as well. At the appellate level, is the presumption something that can only be overcome by a clear and convincing showing or is it just an initial benchmark? We're playing with standards and words here.",
  "And when we talk about presumptions at the appellate level, that's actually a little strange in any event. You usually talk about presumptions as assisting us in finding a fact.",
  "So we write that this is an additive thing?",
  "Suppose the amount were trivial and you just wanted to get a resolution of this question?",
  "Then there would be a case with a controversy problem, I should think.",
  "Is the master disk a component?",
  "What's your position?",
  "Just the disk but not the information on the disk is the component.",
  "But I still would like to know your position. The golden disk is or is not a component?",
  "But copies of the golden disk are or are not components?",
  "Physical manifestation?",
  "I suppose if you could, if you made 99 copies, those would be 99 components. Then if you used -- if you're going to make 100 machines. If you used for your disk the master disk for the last copy, then that would have been -- that would -- then the master disk would be a copy, a component of the last machine.",
  "You make them abroad.",
  "But if the disk, if the golden disk itself after they finish the copies, were used - -",
  "-- in a hardware, then that would be a component.",
  "So are you saying that neither the source code nor the compilation are a component?",
  "So that neither the source code nor the compilation are a component, save as, the compilation is put on a disk?",
  "That seems odd. I mean, Microsoft doesn't say please buy our disk because it's the prettiest disk in the business.",
  "It says buy our program because the program means something.",
  "Suppose you had a patent on a biological organism and it was contained in a little vial, and you shipped it abroad. Just by doing nothing at all, it grew, and it had -- it grew into 100 different parts.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, there can be a process patent.",
  "Can have you have a copyright on a program?",
  "Is that analogous to the source and the compilation, the source being the design, the compilation being the key?",
  "But suppose, suppose you had a machine that makes another machine, and if you ship that machine to Europe -- and there's a patent for the machine that makes it. If you ship it to Europe and it starts making another machine, the statute is not violated; and isn't that just what's happening here?",
  "Well, is it an answer to Justice Breyer, or maybe it isn't, that we have no conceptual problem saying there would be liability if this happened within the territorial limits of the United States?",
  "And so there shouldn't be a greater conceptual problem if you prevail, in applying it abroad.",
  "Are you saying that the infringement act that happened in the United States involved no components?",
  "The Government does cite the principle that when there's a specific statutory scheme that controls over a more general one. It doesn't cite a tax case for that, at least as I recall. Has that principle ever been applied in the tax code, do you know?",
  "Well, I suppose -- tell me if I'm wrong, or the Government can tell me if I'm wrong -- but there is this difference also that in a refund suit, you have to pay the money. The Government has the money before you can bring the refund suit. Am I right about that?",
  "Incidentally, I'm just curious, if the underlying assessment -- if you wished to have challenged the underlying assessment, it's for a million dollars, can you pay $100,000 and then bring the refund suit in order to test the validity of the tax, or do you have to pay the whole amount?",
  "Well, your argument is probably based on the statute. I just question one phrase you mentioned, which was that Williams was not driven by the equities. It seems to me it was wholly driven by the equities.",
  "Getting back to my earlier question, if there is a million-dollar tax liability, and there is a levy on the bank account for $100,000, do you have to pay the extra 900,000 before can you bring the refund suit?",
  "So that's, that's also a difference.",
  "Do you have a citation for that as would apply to the Internal Revenue code?",
  "I don't, I don't see how you can say there's frustration. Perhaps I'm missing something. It seems to me that for years the Revenue Code has had two basic schemes. One is you can contest the liability before you pay the money. The other is you pay the money and sue for refund. And one requires you go to the Tax Court and the other district court and so forth. So these are two different schemes and here you have to -- we are advised that even if there was a levy for $100,000 you, couldn't contest it unless you paid the extra 900. So those are two very different schemes. Am I wrong about that?",
  "Of course, because the Government doesn't have the money. But in the refund suit the Government has the money.",
  "Often does, but not necessarily, and doesn't have to have all the amount.",
  "And both statutes in Kreider I take it applied to the refund suit?",
  "So there were two statutes bearing on the same remedy.",
  "Is the rule that you propose that the policeman must balance the risk of harm to others versus the risk of harm to the fleeing person?",
  "Your brief says that the officer reasonably believes that doing so, i.e., terminating the chase, would avoid a greater risk of bodily injury or death.",
  "Greater than what? Greater than - -",
  "Without reference to the possible harm to the driver? I just want to know what you're testing.",
  "I didn't mean to put words in your mouth. It seems to me your test might be whether there is a greater risk in stopping him or not stopping him as to other people, without reference to the risk to himself.",
  "Well, it's your brief. I want you to - -",
  "I thought we had a test for deadly force in Garner and it's whether or not there is -- it's more likely than not, whether or not there is a serious risk that death will ensue. That's the test, Garner.",
  "Well, that's a different issue and you may prevail on other arguments in the case. But as to whether or not there's a likelihood or a reasonable likelihood of serious injury, it seems to me that's clearly a question for the jury. I mean, we might argue about it up here, but that's classic jury question, isn't it?",
  "I would think that would apply to all high-speed cases; would you not agree?",
  "But your position would be the same even if Scott knew that the only reason they were trying to stop him initially was the speeding violation?",
  "He used the turning signal. That's like the strangler who observes the no smoking sign.",
  "Well, as the Chief Justice indicated through a question earlier, isn't it reasonable for an officer to assume that it is -- he is trying to escape because there is something more serious than speeding at stake? I mean, that's the assumption I would draw.",
  "You mean just as many people take off in high speed chases for speeding as for serious crimes?",
  "Can you tell me as of the time he exited the parking lot, by that point, had he committed any felonies?",
  "90 miles an hour would not be a felony, not a reckless driving?",
  "Yes.",
  "At no point did he commit a felony?",
  "If he had intended to hit the police officer, was it - -",
  "The district - -",
  "Under, under -- under your rule, what you're concerned with is the bumping, the use of the force. Under your rule, if the police continue the chase without using the, without trying to ram him, and then there is an accident and innocent people are killed, or injured, I assume that under the tort laws of most states, the police could be liable.",
  "Well, aren't they the proximate cause if they continue the chase without trying to terminate it?",
  "No. No. Well, I meant terminate the chase by -- by -- by forcing him off the road.",
  "But isn't there -- but isn't that one way to assure that the police are not liable, both from a moral standpoint and a legal standpoint, for causing the injury of other people?",
  "Well, you mean it's irrelevant to our analysis to consider that he might injure other people?",
  "But your, your answer to Justice Stevens as I understand it was the police not have the duty to discontinue the chase? The obverse of that is that the police may prolong the chase, i.e., prolong the injury to the public. I'm surprised at your answer.",
  "If we say that the parents are the real party in interest and are entitled to sue in their own right, is that the end of the case, or do we reach the second -- a second question as to whether or not they can represent the children?",
  "Was their an argument at any point in this case that the claim was frivolous?",
  "I'm not following you. Where is this provision? 1401 what?",
  "Could the court appoint the parent guardian ad litem and just the parent proceed as guardian ad litem?",
  "The guardian ad litem cannot proceed pro se?",
  "I had the same question as Justice Ginsburg, and I think was also suggested by Justice Scalia's question. Suppose that Congress passed a statute that said we hereby appropriate a million dollars to the President to use to call religious conferences, and then it spelled out these conferences. Is there standing there?",
  "But --and I of course want the answer, but then, why is that consistent with what you told us at the beginning that there had to be a statute?",
  "-- just one, one more question on this, on this line. And I won't belabor the hypothetical. Again there's a Federal statute for this conference, and the moneys go for air tickets to various religious ministers and priests. Does that meet your outside the Government test for standing?",
  "It seems to me unduly intrusive for the courts to tell the President that it cannot talk to specific groups to see if they have certain talents that the Government may use to make sure that all of their energies are used properly by the Federal Government. It's almost like a speech rationale. And perhaps you would say that's just a judgment on the merits, but it seems to me that there's a standing concern here, too, that we would be supervising the White House and what it can say, what it can -- who it can talk to. And it seems to me that's quite intrusive from the standpoint of standing purposes. I'm not sure that this makes a standard that distinguishes the case from Flast or brings it within those -- within those cases.",
  "May I ask a quick question. I had the same list of alleged acts, and I think many of them are uncontested, that Justice Ginsburg mentioned. Just as a matter of policy, can you inform me, when the Solicitor General's Office takes this case do you look into whether any of these things happen and the Justice Department issues a warning, don't do this any more? If these things are as Justice Ginsburg explained you don't defend all of those actions?",
  "I know that. I know that.",
  "Because if this, if this continues, your argument -- and I understand your argument that there's no essential free-standing cause of action for damages -- basically means he has a right to go broke with attorneys' fees challenging each individual incursion, each individual wrong. Well, again that assumes that he wouldn't get any relief out of the IBLA. That assumes that if he had gone to the IBLA and said, you canceled my grazing permits for grounds that weren't valid, that the BLM would have proceeded to engage in the same conduct. In fact, the IBLA - -",
  "Piecemeal.",
  "Piecemeal.",
  "Does he have any action that is other than piecemeal?",
  "I take it the answer is no.",
  "As originally negotiated, with I think Nelson. Was the right-of-way cancellable at any time? Or how long would the right-of-way last?",
  "Can I ask you about the Bivens theory here before your time runs out? Doesn't Davis versus Passman help the Respondent here?",
  "Well that's because we assume it's focused just on his property and that the property was ultimately the thing that was in issue. But if you have all these other retaliatory actions, and wrongful actions taken by the Government tangential to this dispute, I take it Davis versus Passman, broadly read, says we can use Bivens if there is no other way to get a remedy against the Government.",
  "Suppose we think - - suppose we disagree with you on the latter point. We think he is really in a bind; there's not really anything he can do. Doesn't that invoke the Davis versus Passman rationale?",
  "To expand -- it would be an expansion of Bivens.",
  "The people who had done this - -",
  "I'm not sure, Professor Tribe, that the cases you cite at page 22, 23 of your brief really support your position. The question is whether there should be a freestanding cause of action for damages.",
  "And in the brief you say that the government says that this is limited First Amendment, and then you say, \"These remarkable claims are unsurprisingly false.\" I thought that was a rather severe charge against the government, that it's misrepresenting its cases.",
  "Then in page 22 and 23, you go ahead and you talk about Wisconsin versus Yoder, Lefkowitz versus Turley, Bordenkircher, which I think was vindictive prosecution or adding on charges. All of those are in the -- every one of these cases are in the context of a criminal proceeding. Griffin, a murder case. It's just alleging a constitutional - -",
  "-- alleging a constitutional claim. Well, which one?",
  "Well, no. That was, there was an existing case or controversy there. That wasn't a freestanding cause of action. None of these cases are freestanding. Davis versus Passman, different.",
  "Well, it seems to me that those cases do not support your position, and I don't think it's correct to say that this is unsurprising, that the government makes a false representation about cases.",
  "I think it was in the context of a freestanding right, but let's leave that aside.",
  "That's right. It does seem to me that you are asking us to extend Bivens, this is an extension. Would you accept that?",
  "It's statutory.",
  "But Professor Tribe, all these cases are cases in which there is -- Nollan, you have a cause of action to challenge the permit and this is just a, this is just a constitutional defense. That's different from a freestanding cause of action. And I share Justice Scalia's concern. It seems to me in thinking about this case there is -- there could be something very wrong here, going after a person because of what he's done. Suppose the Government wants somebody to be a witness in a trial and he won't do it, and they go around hurting his business, they go around invading his property and so forth. That to me is outrageous and you might have an argument that there should be a Bivens cause of action for that. And Justice Scalia's question -- I had the same question -- is why do we think it to the property? The essence here, the essence of what's going on, is that they're being vindictive against this person. Now again, the cases you're citing, include Hartman, which is a free speech case which is different, really don't support you. I think this is an extension of Bivens.",
  "Fair enough, but it's an extension of Bivens.",
  "Davis versus Passman is a different context. But in theory is it consistent with what the Respondent asks?",
  "Well, is this case limited to signs about drugs? What is the rule that you want us to adopt for deciding this case?",
  "Disruptive of what? Disruptive of the classroom order? There was no classroom here.",
  "Well, suppose you have - - suppose you have a mission to have a global school. Can they ban American flags on lapel pins?",
  "Yes, but the rule you proposed, I thought, in response to my question is that the school has wide discretion to define its educational mission and it can restrict speech that's inconsistent with that mission.",
  "And it seems to me that's much broader than Tinker. Now you said, well, there is an exception for political speech. Well, but then you're right with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, let's suppose that they have a particular view on a political issue, No Child Left Behind, or foreign intervention and so forth.",
  "And is that the rationale on which you wish us to decide this case, nothing more broad?",
  "I'm asking what your recommendation is to what our rule should be this case.",
  "Well, then you're not arguing for the broad educational mission, which is what you said at the first.",
  "This, this -- this parade had a theme to celebrate the Olympics, with -- the high school kids are carrying the torch, the band is in it. And suppose the banner said vote for, vote Republican, vote Democrat. And he wants to be on the TV with that. Could this, the principal make him take that sign out of the ground in that it's inconsistent with the whole theme of, of, of the parade? Something like our Kurle case?",
  "Is that different from the rationale you've put.",
  "Well, would you waive damages against this principal who has devoted her life to the school, and you're seeking damages for her for this sophomoric sign that was held up?",
  "Can the student be allowed to wear a button that says \"Rape Is Fun\"?",
  "Why?",
  "Why?",
  "But do you concede that there was some right of school control for what was going on across the street?",
  "If kids were throwing bottles and injuring passers by, the principal had no right or duty to go over there and stop it?",
  "Well, that's because the school has a right of control.",
  "Of course I disagree with the characterization on disruptive. It was completely disruptive of the message, of the theme that the school wanted to promote. Completely disruptive of the reason for letting the students out to begin with. Completely disruptive of the school's image that they wanted to portray in sponsoring the Olympics.",
  "Some of the students were carrying the torch and the band was playing in the parade.",
  "So under your view, if the principal sees something wrong in the crowd across the street, had to come up and say now, how many here are truants and how many here are -- I can't discipline you because you're a truant, you can go ahead and throw the bottle.",
  "I suppose he could have come here on direct.",
  "It says that if the Brecht standard applies, does the Petitioner or the State bear the burden? I guess that's the narrower question, who has the burden.",
  "Well, maybe, maybe you'd end up - -",
  "The third party perpetrator that Maples was going to talk about according to the prosecution's theory, was Hurtz or Hearst?",
  "And there -- there was a link between Hurtz, there was an acquaintanceship between Hurtz and the victim?",
  "Was that established in other testimony or would that all have come out just only through Maples?",
  "Right. Okay.",
  "How did Hurtz's name enter into the trial?",
  "Why did anybody mention him?",
  "Did he say he'd killed peoples otherwise, or at other times?",
  "Well, but then at that point in time, Maples, Maples' conviction -- Maples' testimony becomes, assuming there's a foundation, becomes more relevant.",
  "Mr. Haltom, before you go drifting, counsel, into the evidentiary questions in the case, I have one question. Two cases. A, Hurtz did not testify at all. B, he did. Is the foundation ruling any different in the two cases insofar as Maples' testimony or is it the same? I.e., is there a lesser showing for foundation if Hurtz did testify?",
  "Oh, you mean, oh, you mean more? You have to be more strict for foundation after Hurtz testified? I was suggesting the opposite.",
  "Well, just on your assumption, to make your hypothetical clear, you, you want us to assume that three or four times at least he violated a constitutional standard?",
  "I just want to know what arguendo assumption you are making.",
  "I mean, they'd be improper because they -- they were based on an emotional appeal that's improper?",
  "That passage was in the context of other statements in which I think it's fair to say that he analogized the role of the juror to the role of a soldier who has to have the courage and the duty to kill.",
  "Could you tell us -- as you know, AEDPA has the decisions of settled precedents of the Supreme Court and there's the Supreme Court standard, a very general standard that we can get from Darden and Donnelly, although we didn't reverse there. I take it that the counsel for the Respondent is going to say: Well, this is a Federal standard, but the Eighth Circuit is entitled to apply the specificity and the application that it's given to this, so the Eighth Circuit's entitled to rely on its cases in reversing. Do you agree with that?",
  "I assume that's what they're going to tell us.",
  "Why.",
  "Well, didn't he seek a COA?",
  "This is a pro se prisoner. He gets his -- all the claims are exhausted, it's dismissed. And he seeks a COA on that point.",
  "Why would it be applicable to State prosecutors if it is not a rule. I don't understand that. Is it applicable to a State prosecutor or not? If a state prosecutor asked you for your advice, is this opinion applicable. And you tell him yes or no.",
  "But they must follow because it's the law, right?",
  "Well, where did Chief Justice Stone get it from?",
  "Where did Chief Justice Stone get it from? Just because of our supervisory power? I mean, if it's just Federal supervisory power, then I think you could tell the counsel, he doesn't have to follow it, it's due process.",
  "Well, could a prosecutor say, one of the factors you must take into account when you begin to deliberate is the deterrent purpose of the death penalty? Deterrence is one of the reasons we have the death penalty.",
  "To teach us. Can he say that?",
  "So then now we have the principle that you can talk about deterrence. Now it is just the way in which he talked about deterrence?",
  "What do you think, go on and on -- suppose he'd mentioned deterrence six times?",
  "Right.",
  "You have this only in a footnote in your reply brief. It wasn't raised in the BIO.",
  "So if the prosecution had not opened the door, that would have been improper? You overrule -- the judge said counsel, you can't argue about sending a message for life?",
  "You -- you think the trial court could tell the defense counsel that the defense counsel cannot argue to the jury, ladies and gentlemen there is nothing more precious than life and that's what we're asking you to decide here and we want you to assert the values of this community that we value life? You can't say that?",
  "Is part of moral culpability that you take moral instruction from thieves murderers on the street, as opposed to those higher standards for which society seeks to aspire? Is that moral culpability?",
  "Is it moral culpability for you to take as an example for your behavior the criminal population?",
  "You're talking about moral culpability. Is it part of your moral culpability that you take your values, your instructions, your behavior from criminals, as opposed to people who uphold the law in society? Is that part of moral culpability?",
  "Well then, isn't it relevant what's happening on the streets, etcetera?",
  "If the Eighth Circuit had had Lawrence in front it, it would have ruled differently? Or should it have ruled differently, in respect to Lawrence?",
  "Under Lawrence the Eighth Circuit would have been wrong?",
  "Mr. Olson, does brand competition generally help retailers, or is this a question that can't be answered?",
  "Interbrand, interbrand competition? Do retailers like interbrand competition?",
  "Well, but we're talking about inter -- we're talking about retailers. It, it seems to me at the outset of the argument, you -- you acknowledged, and I think it is the general rule -- that if the retailers themselves have this resale price maintenance, it is invalid. Well, if the manufacturer does this just for the convenience of the retailers, and that's -- many of the examples in your brief, it is for the convenience and for the benefit of the retailers, then why shouldn't there be a per se rule? Why should we allow the manufacturer to do something we that wouldn't allow the retailers to do, if it's for the retailers?",
  "Well, I thought the per se rule was the cookie cutter approach.",
  "Does that presume a contract in which the retailer has a separate charge for the service?",
  "If not, I don't see how that would work under your rule.",
  "Yes, it was authorized by the district court in the sense the district court put it on a piece of paper. It wasn't authorized because the district court had no authority to extend that.",
  "Well it is an equitable rule conditioned upon compliance with time limits.",
  "Well, I mean, that -- that may, that may be true of this stage; but Justice Scalia's question points up the problem of what do we do if we write this case? How do we formulate this rule? And if we say that it's not jurisdictional, not binding, then going forward, it seems to me to allow the hypothetical that he puts to you.",
  "That's why we're wondering how to write the opinion.",
  "I looked at this. There's a time start. And I think it might be the time stamp when this document was entered on the ultimate appeal. But -- but something you said at the outset prompts this question, that -- Did you think that -- the time runs from $14 days after the date when the district court's order is entered.",
  "And was there a submission or an implication in your remarks that you thought that the order was not entered until three days later?",
  "Is there an entry -- is there a time entry on the dock -- on court's order?",
  "I know that it's a handwritten one. But that that -- that shows how long he has to appeal. is there a date when the order was put on the docket? Does that show on this sheet?",
  "And I asked this once before: Did the document you received show the dates that it was entered on the docket, so you knew when the 14 days was running from?",
  "But it says when it was signed by the judge. It doesn't say when it was entered on the docket, when it was entered by the clerk.",
  "At some point during your argument -- and I know you only have 20 minutes -- will you tell me whether or not in your view the pleading standard that the judge must follow is equivalent, is the same as the instruction that's given to the jury? Because if it isn't, then the Seventh Amendment argument may have some more force.",
  "Well, in writing -- I take it, so far as the jury, it's just whether it's more likely than not, preponderance of the evidence.",
  "So your submission is, maybe not in this case, but insofar as your theory of the case, that the trial judge can, and in fact must basically apply a standard of fact -- standard of proof that's higher than that what the jury would.",
  "A burden of over 50 percent?",
  "I just have to make it clear. Is the high likelihood, or strong inference, is greater than more likely than not?",
  "Can you tell me a little bit of how -- how this should work in your view? Assume the CEO makes misstatements as to the earnings report and the acceptance of one of its new products. Just assume that.",
  "Can we make a strong inference that a CEO knows what his own earnings reports are?",
  "Can we make a strong inference that a CEO knows the status of current earnings - -",
  "-- when he makes, when he makes a statement.",
  "And by the proof stage you mean both summary judgment and submission to jury?",
  "What would you think about the following - -",
  "Is the requisite standard, knowledge of falsity.",
  "Intent to make a false statement?",
  "Do we take judicial notice that a CEO knows these things and that's the strong inference.",
  "But you agree you have to have that? You have to have some specific allegation to show of his knowledge? We can't just infer that?",
  "So you would say that you could have a beyond reasonable doubt standard that must be met at the pleading level, but more likely than not at the jury level?",
  "We want to know what the rule is.",
  "And I hope we're going to recognize that Congress thought it was doing something. Your argument so far, Professor, doesn't indicate that Congress - -",
  "You indicated that the - - you know, the plaintiff had to do all this investigation. The whole point of this was that the defendants were being disadvantaged.",
  "Well, I think more likely than not, most people think of 49, 50 percent. Can you tell us whether strong inference is stronger than more likely than not?",
  "It sounds to me like - -",
  "I want, I want to be fair. I interpreted your argument -- and please tell me if this is incorrect -- as indicating that if I think strong inference is greater, more onerous than more likely than not, at the pleading stage, I then also have to say this is the instruction that must be given to the jury? In order to avoid the, the discontinuity between the pleading stage and what - -",
  "Then can you - -",
  "Can, can you tell me, if the Petitioner does not prevail here, the case goes back to the State court. Can the immunity argument be raised in the State court?",
  "In other words the State court couldn't say well you know, this district court was wrong; there's really immunity under the Federal statute. The State court can't hold that?",
  "Because then you'd have constant -- eternal shuttling back and forth, that's why.",
  "In other words, the -- the Federal determination bars the State court from redetermining that there's immunity? That the State court can't say, \"Federal court, you're wrong?\"",
  "If we think that Powerex, that there's a strong interest in having Powerex remain in Federal court if it's entitled To that under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, that would be suffer to get around 1447(d)?",
  "But I'm having, I'm having the same problem as Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer. Can you say in just a few sentences the difference between the case where there is sovereign immunity, China, the China hypothetical, and this case where it's organ immunity?",
  "You're telling us that one is more important than the other, but there's no textual basis in the statute for us to make that distinction.",
  "I'm asking why is denial of immunity for sovereign status different from denial of organ status giving you a right to a bench trial, etcetera?",
  "I thought it also addressed, unlike the more general regulation, just people who have companionship services. So if you have a maid or a cook or a footman, who doesn't provide companionship, then 109 is inapplicable.",
  "Do we take the case and - - I'll ask the same question to your colleagues from the other side -- on the assumption that if the nine -- the factors in the statutes are met, that EPA has no discretion to withhold the transfer?",
  "Are you -- are you saying that the consultation does beyond the nine factors that are listed in the statute?",
  "But isn't that beyond the nine factors?",
  "I -- I understand that. But when they sit down and they have the consultation, is it proper for the EPA to say now, we're consulting with you, but only with respect to the nine factors, as to permits that are issued by the states afterwards, but then that's something else.",
  "But what is your position as to the propriety of the EPA's saying what I've said in my hypothetical instance? If they -- they say we're going to consult with you but we want to make it clear we're only talking about the nine factors.",
  "Well, I think you are at issue with the government on that point.",
  "If the EPA can protect the plants when the permit is under its own jurisdiction, why can't it use that same basis for objecting when it's under the State's jurisdiction?",
  "Would you agree that if we grant your position and grant you relief, that it would be something of an extension over Witt and Darden, in that the jurors in Witt and Darden had fixed views, that they were as a matter of conscience opposed to the penalty?",
  "I understand that. But I do think that the views of this juror, Deal, were somewhat more equivocal than in the cases I've mentioned.",
  "It seems to me on that point that the State is somewhat surprised and whipsawed. And I understand that the Washington court reached the issue. It is not independent State ground. I take it the prosecutor had some peremptories left?",
  "How late in the process was -- was Deal considered? Was he one of the early jurors or one of the late jurors?",
  "This was about a 17 day voir dire?",
  "Well, that cuts a little bit against the peremptory. I mean, if it was early in the game the prosecutor might not have exercised the peremptory.",
  "Oh, I see. So the whole jury is -- I see.",
  "But the point stands that the court of appeals was just incorrect in, in, in not noting what's there too late. It's just not a fair summary of what the Washington Supreme Court did.",
  "Well, what is -- I know, Justice Breyer; just on this point. The defense actually volunteered \"no objection.\"",
  "If there is confusion, is that grounds for excluding him?",
  "It may well be objected, there were 12 instances - -",
  "-- in which the prosecutor wanted to excuse; in seven of those, there was an objection.",
  "So he certainly knew how to object. And you absolutely trap the trial judge here by not indicating to him that he should make some further finding. In fact, the -- the -- the lawyer doesn't just remain silent. He's standing and says I have no objection.",
  "And incidentally the court did not say are there any objections? The court did not say that.",
  "Well, but the court didn't say is there an objection? So you're incorrect.",
  "You think he could have imposed the death penalty in this case?",
  "What's the harm then in replacing him, from your standpoint?",
  "You're complaining about the excusal of a juror who by your own submission would impose the death penalty. So why am I here?",
  "I would like to hear the answer.",
  "There were actually 12, I think. Weren't there 12 objections by the prosecution? I was going to ask, we've already destroyed the rebuttal time of your colleagues, but it seems to me that this is a large number of challenges by the prosecutor. Can you comment on that? 12? I mean, the defense objected to seven, and five objections were sustained.",
  "Thank you.",
  "No. I think the prosecution challenged 12 times. There were seven objections. Five were sustained.",
  "Well, let me put it to you this way: There's no demeanor finding here. Suppose the judge had made a demeanor finding. That would be different, the case would be a different case, wouldn't it?",
  "And if the objection is what prevents the demeanor finding, then maybe we should be able to consider the fact there was no objection, even though Washington law doesn't require it before we consider the issue.",
  "Does the fact that this is structural error, that there's no harmless error analysis, mean that we should be very careful to give substance to the rule that there's deference to the trial judge? And in fact, in the Witt case, we said that the determination to excuse a juror is based on determinations of demeanor and credibility that are within the trial judge's province. We said that.",
  "What presumes that there is that judgment made by the district judge, whether or not it's mentioned? It was not mentioned in Witt.",
  "Should defer to Judge Kozinski's observation or to the Supreme Court in Witt?",
  "But in, but in many cases the case will become moot after a period of time and the Chief Justice and I have the same concern. The question is directed to do we just keep this litigation alive for the -- for the ancillary issue of attorney's fees?",
  "Well, we're asking about what rule you propose we adopt and the submission to you is that if we have a rule there can never be attorneys fees in this instance, that will then create pressure to continue the litigation when it's for all practical purposes of no real importance to the parties, other than to just establish attorney's fees. And that seems a waste of resources.",
  "Well, you are saying the Chief Justice is proposing a rule. I think he was asking you -- you want to just give us all or nothing. And we're suggesting that it just doesn't make systemic good sense to insist that every preliminary injunction be carried through to a final adjudication for attorney's fees. And we are asking is there some midway ground. And you, you've so far -- you can structure the argument the way you want, but you so far are -- in effect telling me absolutely not.",
  "We have when election season comes many, many requests for injunctions, and after the election is over the case just goes away. Nobody is interested.",
  "Under your position, all of these matters must be contested until final judgment before attorney's fees are available.",
  "In other words, to avoid fees on fees, we do something that's wrong?",
  "So in speech terms, there were alternative means to get the message out.",
  "I think the briefs are - - I think it's fair to characterize the Respondent's brief this way, or fair to concentrate on Pickering. It seems to me that Pickering is the key here, and I took away that impression from your brief. If we said that it's commercial speech, I think that's a little far off the mark. If we said it's an unconstitutional condition, I'm not sure that helps either side that much, either.",
  "In Umbehr we said, the Court said, that in the independent contractor cases the interests of either party, the government or the contractor, are not quite so intense as they are with a public employee. I thought that made sense when I read it. I'm not so sure it does any more.",
  "Well, I suppose we could construct a hypothetical where we could say there's a very strong interest in the contractor. So I'm not sure that that works as a general theorem.",
  "And how would you balance it?",
  "And how would you commence?",
  "Could the association bar Brentwood from contacting public school students altogether?",
  "About enrollment. About enrollment.",
  "Well, like if Brentwood, let's assume -- I think it's true -- is rather well-known in the State, and if they send you a solicitation form to enroll, everybody knows they've got a great athletic program, so we say you can't solicit any high school students.",
  "I haven't kept track of your time, but if we're going to rule for you we have to reach the due process problem. And at some point after you finish discussing what you wish to on free speech, I actually find that a somewhat more difficult issue.",
  "It seems to me that, turning to the state action for a moment, one of the justifications for finding state action that is there is no other real choice, that they have, other than to - - if they want to play athletics in Tennessee other than to join this association. And yet at the opening of your argument, you said oh, well it's voluntary. So It seems to me that your speech argument is inconsistent with one of the justifications for finding state action to begin with.",
  "But that's somewhat inconsistent with one of the most forceful arguments for finding state action to begin it, i.e., that you have to join the school if you really want to compete with most of the schools. You have to join the association.",
  "Did it serve the suspension or has that been stayed? Was it suspended from competition for two years? That was the penalty.",
  "Did it -- did that take effect?",
  "One year - -",
  "Weren't all these things that are being discussed before the factfinder, or was there some ex parte contact later which was the only evidence for what we're talking about now? I'm getting into the due process point.",
  "But I mean, all of these matters were discussed and there was an opportunity to reply to all of these matters that we've just been talking about, correct?",
  "It doesn't seem to me like there's a strong case for a flawed hearing for a due process violation.",
  "I thought it had some State claims as pendant claims.",
  "Is it material to your position to show that there was deterioration in his mental condition between the time of the sentence and the time you brought the petition? I.e., the -- during his incarceration, his condition worsened?",
  "Then if you get beyond the second or successive question, your next point was whether or not AEDPA applies?",
  "In the course of your argument, could you answer this: Suppose we find that the State did not comply with the mandate of Ford because it didn't give adequate procedures to the defendant, it did not give him an adequate opportunity to present his defense. Suppose we find that. I'm going to ask the same question of the State. Does that mean that the district court should then send it back to the State? Or is the district court at that point entitled and required to hold a new hearing on the substantive issue of Ford competency?",
  "Would it be within the discretion of the district court to send it back to the State? And say well, now you didn't give the correct procedures and that's -- an invalidity. So we're sending it back to you. Would the district court have discretion to do that?",
  "It may be much harder for you to get that standard on this Court's review of a collateral proceeding than this Court's review of a state proceeding, because of AEDPA.",
  "Because?",
  "Your position is that the affidavit submitted to the district court by the psychiatrists are sufficient to vindicate your substantive position that he cannot be executed under Ford?",
  "You gave him one week and there were no funds for his own psychiatrist.",
  "You do agree that Ford stands for the proposition that there must be a hearing that meets the essentials of fairness so that the defendant can contradict the hearings that -- the conclusions of the State-appointed psychiatrist?",
  "But I did understand counsel's argument to say that relief must be given, he cannot be executed, if he lacks the capacity to form a rational understanding of the nature and justification for the punishment. You, I take it, would agree that if we can just use the lay term, you cannot execute an insane person if he is grossly psychotic, and you can't execute a comatose person?",
  "So we're talking about what insane means, and that's a lay term. So suppose there's a gross psychosis which is a severe disorientation from reality and from rationality, and he cannot understand, and he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and the justification for his punishment.",
  "But that's different from having a rational capacity to understand the nature and justification for the punishment. I think it is. I would conclude it's a fair conclusion from the psychiatrist's affidavits and from their testimony, that he knows he committed a crime, he knows he's being punished, and he's going to be executed for that crime. But it stops there. The delusions prevent his understanding.",
  "I really do need your help on a procedural part of AEDPA. Let's assume -- I know that you don't agree with it -- let's assume that the State erred because it gave inadequate procedures to the defendant with reference to the adjudication of competency to be executed. Let's assume that. Would the district court have had discretion, if it made that finding, to send the case back to the State court to have new proceedings?",
  "I was asking the question. So don't agree with me.",
  "And it had discretion to do that?",
  "No, no. Assuming he made that finding.",
  "What do you do if there's incompetency of counsel in a routine, not a death case, incompetency of counsel, and the district court finds incompetency of counsel? It then goes ahead and he hears all of the issues that a competent counsel would have addressed, or it sends back to the State court?",
  "In your experience and in your present position, have you seen many condemned people with the symptoms as severe as this defendant?",
  "I don't suppose you have statistics of how many have been sentenced to death and have later been found incompetent?",
  "Is that the one that says interest abated with respect to erroneous refund check? Or am I reading wrong?",
  "Is it fair to say that Congress acted on the assumption that there was no right to the abatement with, and to the payment unless it enacted the statutes?",
  "If, if the history of this issue had been such that before the enactment of this section the courts of appeals were divided or the courts were divided as to whether or not there was jurisdiction in the Court of Claims and in the district court, would your position be different?",
  "So it's, so it's only (h) that gives any court any jurisdiction at all?",
  "Even though in our hypothetical world some courts of general jurisdiction thought that they did have jurisdiction?",
  "Well, isn't it an abuse - - isn't it an abuse of discretion for the Secretary to fail to do what the statute tells him he absolutely must?",
  "The poor do not have the incentive or even the ability to defer paying a tax, where the people that have large bank accounts may, and investments, may well profit by just paying the interest to the Government.",
  "They're exactly alike but for their ability to earn interest in different ways.",
  "So that means that in every settlement agreement you'd have to engage in this analysis to see whether or not it was fair.",
  "Well, that's the question. Do you concede that this arrest was lawful?",
  "Do you concede that the arrest was lawful? The officer was obligated to arrest this person, knowing what he did, was he not?",
  "Do you have any case in which we exclude the evidence seized incident to an arrest when the arrest is lawful?",
  "I didn't think you did, and that's my concern. I assumed that this officer was required to arrest the person, and we can have hypotheticals, he sees somebody wanted for multiple murders and so forth. But I'm just not aware of authority which says that when the arrest is lawful and the search is incident to that arrest, that the evidence is excluded. What's your best -- what's your closest case you can give me on that?",
  "Can I have one please?",
  "Thornton, I'm not familiar with immediately. I'll look it up.",
  "No, no. This was the search of a person incident to an arrest, and I really jumped a little bit ahead of the questions that Justice Alito was proposing. There may have been a moment in which the officer did not have the authority to act and he did, but it seems to me that once he has this knowledge, there is now an intervening cause and the arrest is proper, and the search as well.",
  "What authority do you have that the operation of the exclusionary rule depends on the offense for which he was arrested?",
  "Do you have any authority for the proposition you just offered?",
  "The search incident to an arrest leads to an exclusion in one case and not in another case, depending on the charge on which he was arrested?",
  "Well, do we have an -- an argument that something was seized from the driver that should not have been seized from his person?",
  "Well, but I mean, that's not before us.",
  "We're talking about evidence seized from the defendant.",
  "You're representing the State of California and you want to establish the proposition that any time there is a traffic stop in the State of California or I guess anywhere in the United States all the passengers are free to immediately leave, absent some further countermanding officer -- order by the officer. I think that's a quite surprising proposition. Now, we don't have empirical studies and so forth, but at some point the Court takes judicial notice and I think indications from the bench are we just don't think passengers, A, are or, B, should feel free to leave when there's a traffic stop. I just think you have no social or empirical documentation for that position.",
  "But on your earlier answer to Justice Ginsburg, there's no authority in this Court to say that whether you deem yourself stopped or not depends on whether think you're innocent. There's zero authority for that, right?",
  "Correct me if I'm wrong.",
  "Going back to Justice Stevens' question, the passenger knows the minute the red light goes on that the police can either tell them to get out or tell him to stay in. He knows at that very moment. That seems to me to substantially limit his freedom of action and indicates that - -",
  "Well, maybe our questions took your colleague representing the Petitioner beyond the question presented. The question presented is only whether the passenger felt seized. If we agree with the Petitioner, do we send the case back?",
  "Well, why, if we have serious doubts whether or not the evidence is suppressible? All we've been asked in the question is, is whether the passenger is detained.",
  "While the questions indicate that even if the passenger is detained, who cares, it's a lawful arrest.",
  "Well, it may be that we would say because of the exclusionary rule dynamic, we have very little interest in applying the exclusionary rule to this but I'm not so sure that we should bend the concept of seizure and say that the passenger hasn't been seized. Perhaps we should be very liberal insofar as applying the exclusionary rule and in this case it seems to me there is lawful arrest which is intervening cause anyway. But I don't know that we should distort the law of seizure.",
  "Yes, but in that case there was a blanket rule. The officer didn't have to have a specific reason. And that it seems to me indicates that that's because the person as a general rule knows that he or she is seized. If the officer had to give a specific reason requiring the person to stand outside as the dissent said, then you might have had a point. But I don't think that's what the Court held.",
  "Well, but there was only one, there was just the driver in the Brower case.",
  "There was no passenger as I recall.",
  "Well, but I mean in the case it's just not directly on point. That's what we are arguing about.",
  "So that's just another case that doesn't help us.",
  "Well if you're correct and this was a sponsor decision, not a fiduciary decision, let me ask you when you're wearing, when the company is wearing its sponsor hat and says we're going to terminate this plan, does it have a duty to consider the best interests and the security of the employees, number one, when it picks an insurance company? It can't pick some flaky insurance company if there is a much more solid insurance company, can it?",
  "But if have this duty to consider the interest of the employees in selecting the, the insurance company, in selecting the amount of the annuity, etcetera, if you have that duty it seems to me that that's a fiduciary duty.",
  "I agree with Justice Scalia, that that's one answer. On the other hand, you have -- there are two arguments here. And what we are exploring now is whether this is a fiduciary obligation or a sponsor obligation.",
  "So we will have to assume for that -- if you can't do it by merger, then the whole case goes away anyway. If merger is not permitted under the statute, then we don't need to worry whether it's a fiduciary response, correct?",
  "So what we're asking in the first part of this argument is whether or not it's a fiduciary response. And that's what Justice Souter and I are questioning. And it does seem to me, assume that there is a meeting of the board of directors, we think we are going to terminate this plan. At that point, choices are made as to how to terminate it. And it's difficult for me to see why the interests of the employees are not uppermost in -- in your duties, i.e. a fiduciary duty, when you decide how you're going to terminate it.",
  "Why can't you say it's a business decision as to which insurance company you're going to select. Maybe you do say that.",
  "Well, but that's the way you characterize it. I don't know why it's mere execution, when it's an annuity and it's not mere execution when it's a merger, once the determination decision has been made.",
  "But Justice Alito's question, and I have the same question. Let's assume, A -- I know this is not your position -- but the merger is a permissible option. And B -- and I know this is not your position -- that this is a fiduciary obligation. I assume then you would lose, because the extra assets must go, the reversion interest, must go to the employees if it's in their benefit.",
  "But then you say that if it's a fiduciary obligation, and the merger is a permitted option, that the administrator, A, can, or B, must still give the money back to you.",
  "The administrator, as a fiduciary, can consider the interest of the employer as well as the employees?",
  "Could an administrator make that decision in its fiduciary capacity?",
  "Could a plan document provide that upon termination the employer is entitled to a refund of any excess funding? And would that then be binding on an administrator in a fiduciary capacity?",
  "And I take it the administrator would then have the duty to obey that?",
  "Then why couldn't the PBGC say, you know, we are not quite sure how these insurance companies work. So we'll buy the annuity and then the five million is an extra guarantee to make sure the annuities are paid and that also goes to the insurance company?",
  "Well, if you prevail won't plan documents or shouldn't plan documents be amended to say that merger is not an option and any reversion goes to the employer?",
  "Well, how could the administrator, how could the administrator negotiate with the employer to give the $5 million back if it's with a fiduciary?",
  "Well, I suppose if it would have been amended. But what happens, what happens if the employer wants to continue in business, but simply turn the plan over to a multiemployer plan? Is that a fiduciary -- and you have an employer that wears two hats. The employer is also the administrator. Is that a fiduciary decision?",
  "So then it's the ongoing significance of the decision to the employer that determines whether there's a fiduciary obligation?",
  "I can't see why it's a fiduciary obligation in case A -- a sponsor obligation in case A and a fiduciary obligation in case B. That just depends on the sequence of timing.",
  "Well -- excuse me. Excuse me. I'm just not sure I understand your answer. If the employer finds the rock solid insurance company under -- pardon me, the administrator finds the rock solid insurance company under Justice Scalia's hypothetical under (i) he must consider all other options under (ii)?",
  "Well, on that point in some jurisdictions and perhaps you can tell me about New York, I had thought and correct me if I'm wrong, that tax liens have a superior status to other liens in that they are an, an interest or an estate in the property as opposed to an attachment. Is it not true? And I don't, and I'm not talking just about order of priority for creditors. I'm talking about the superiority insofar as being or not being an interest in property.",
  "Yes.",
  "Is there New York law to that effect?",
  "Because I had -- I had thought that it is an estate in land in at least some jurisdictions. And Justice Breyer was asking about the same thing. In other words, there are liens -- there are liens and liens. There are different kinds of liens.",
  "Why isn't it commercial activity for New York to say, we provide garbage services, electric services, et cetera.",
  "But they pay fees and New York taxes. Suppose New York doesn't have fees. Suppose they say, we'll just do this out of our property tax.",
  "Well, what about the argument that it was an interest in property. The brief was very clear that it is an interest in property, and that a tax lien is almost sui generis, in that it is an estate in the property.",
  "It survives bona fide - - it survives bona fide purchaser without notice?",
  "And under New York law does property, do property tax liens have some superior status? Are they distinct under New York law from other liens?",
  "Without reference to priority.",
  "I -- I had thought they had a greater priority and that they even survived purchase from bona fide sellers.",
  "Is this the Vienna Convention?",
  "European Convention.",
  "Now -- now I take it you under New York law and the law of most jurisdictions, the tax lien becomes a lien against the property before any judicial proceedings.",
  "Just because they are unpaid. And this is probably a question more for them than for you, but as you understand their position, if you put a lien on the property for unpaid taxes, are they entitled to demand its removal?",
  "You mean of course they can under their view?",
  "No. No. No.",
  "Can they demand that that lien be released - -",
  "No, no. -- because it violates the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act? Is it their position that you have no right at all even to notice a lien against the property?",
  "It would seem to me to follow from what they're saying.",
  "My hypothetical is can they demand that the lien be removed solely because of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.",
  "With reference to the offset of foreign aid, could that offset be made under the controlling statutes just based on your lien, or do you have to have a judgment first?",
  "Do you take the position that it's improper even to notice the property with the lien?",
  "I mean, let's assume that you owe the taxes.",
  "What is that citation? I was looking for that. Is that cited in your brief?",
  "Thank you.",
  "You mean we held that the statute was constitutional on its face?",
  "I'll look at Eichman, but it's not my recollection of the case, that the whole, the essence of the duty imposed by, under the statute was held.",
  "Well, but there's always an application or there's no case.",
  "Absent some declaratory judgment provision.",
  "And in we recite that the district court held the Act unconstitutional as applied to appellees and dismissed the charges.",
  "Isn't that a -- can you give me examples of cases where that Act applies?",
  "Can you give me instances in which employees of an the office of a Senator are covered by these obligations and cannot invoke the Speech or Debate Clause? What's the classic example where you can't invoke the Speech or Debate Clause?",
  "Yeah.",
  "Yes. Because it seems to me that your argument just completely eviscerates the intent of the Congress in passing this Act.",
  "Well, except the Act itself has a provision for office of Senators.",
  "And so it seems to me you're giving no effect to that. You say there is a hole in the process the minute the furniture mover is gone?",
  "What's the test for intruding? If it would chill his exercise of the function in future cases, or if it requires him to talk about legislative decisions, or what?",
  "What if it required him to say how he allocated his resources, that he allocate his resources 10 percent to foreign affairs issues, 50 percent to health care issues? Would that involve is - - is that a Speech or Debate Clause problem?",
  "I have one question. The Appellants here were the ones that appealed to the court of appeals? Did they appeal from the district court?",
  "But under 1291, the United States Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction where direct review may be had in the Supreme Court. So it seems to me that their position contradicts their own basis for jurisdiction here. Do you agree with that?",
  "Well, but my point is that the Appellants are telling us that this is appealable here directly, but if that's so they shouldn't have gone to court of appeals, they shouldn't have gone to the court of appeals; they're untimely when they come here.",
  "In Eichman, I was able to get out the district court and the last part of the district court, the last line of the district court, it says the law under which these three -- let me begin again -- the law under which these three defendants have been prosecuted is unconstitutional, which seems to me to contradict what Appellant's counsel told us about what happened in the district court.",
  "Right. I have one -- one question. Could the Senate direct you to pay this judgment?",
  "Direct your office to - - to do that.",
  "Because it -- suppose they thought there was liability and if you say yes, then I need to know why you and counsel who just addressed this are on different sides of the case, if you're both representing the Senate.",
  "Could it, if it chose?",
  "All right.",
  "How, how do you distinguish your Blue Cross example from the instance where drug companies are doing testing required by the FDA?",
  "Blue Cross is different because there they are acting as an intermediary of the Government?",
  "I know all that's involved here is the forum and removal; but if we were to rule for you that there' is Federal officer status here, would that effect any of the substantive determinations on the preemption question, etcetera?",
  "It's just a forum question?",
  "We all -- we all know - - maybe -- I think, I think it's accepted, that the public only tunes in to the political dialogue shortly before the election. That's the time in which you -- in which you reach the public. So the fact that the filibuster has been going on for a long time is -- I don't think answers the question as to how speech can be the most effective.",
  "Are, are there frequent issues -- instances in the political process, do you think, in which the public runs an ad against a, a candidate knowing the candidate is probably going to win anyway, he or she is from a safe district, or it's very difficult. But they want to run the ad anyway in order to affect his conduct or her conduct once they're reelected, so that they'll take a different position, a second look.",
  "It -- it seems to me logically that's possible. I just don't know if that, if that happens very often.",
  "Is that called democracy?",
  "We look at fighting words in a context.",
  "It's one thing to say something in a bikers bar and another thing in the - -",
  "Are there many cases where we look just at the words?",
  "You can't shout \"Fire\" in a crowded theater; it has to be a crowded theater.",
  "Well, if it's your position that the parties are not really injured or affected by this, and the parties' position is that they are, who should we believe? I mean, it's hard for you to tell the parties that they don't know what's in their best interest.",
  "Well, there is evidence that, in other States, those who preached racial hatred have tried to associate themselves with a particular party, much to the concern of that party, and I see nothing in your position that would prevent that.",
  "And is the remedy for the party, you said, to have more speech for the party, to say that this is not their candidate, etcetera?",
  "But this Court has said that parties could be strictly limited in the amount of moneys they spend to endorse a particular candidate.",
  "I don't think the law can have it both ways.",
  "I was going to ask the counsel for the Respondents, and you can answer as well, can you explain to me briefly the existing structure for the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, to say Mr. Smith is our nominee?",
  "Well then, it's not just a rhetorical flourish. It's true; when the State says that you take the position that you are entitled to say on the ballot who your nominee is, that has to be a correct statement of your position given this statute and given the issues presented to us here.",
  "Or is that just somewhat hyperbolic? It seems to me he is right based on your - - on the position you're now stating.",
  "Suppose there were an empirical study that Washington voters know about this system, and that 80 percent of the Washington voters know that the party has not endorsed any one of these - - all of these candidates. That it's just say a statement of preference, that that's all it means; the voters know this. Is your position the same?",
  "But -- but my submission, or my hypothetical and it's just a hypothetical, is that no one is misled by this.",
  "Accept the hypothetical as true. Then what's the injury?",
  "What would be the validity or the invalidity, in your view, of a scheme which said that the ballot has one candidate who says, Smith, Republican nominee, and the other candidates -- other candidates say, Republican preference?",
  "You -- you can't answer my question? You can't hypothesize any legitimate State interest for doing that?",
  "Well, when the Court writes this opinion, what's the fairest statement of the State's interest in this requirement? What do you think is the fairest statement of the State's interest?",
  "You think there's no legitimate interest? It's -- it's an unfair question, I suppose.",
  "Well, I'm going to ask the State the same question.",
  "Does the State have a legitimate interest in weakening the influence of political parties?",
  "If we found that that was the necessary effect of this ballot measure, then would it be invalid?",
  "Could the Congress have mandated the result and the rationale that the Fourth Circuit used here?",
  "And is \"reasonable\" defined as an appropriate interpretation of congressional intent, or does \"reasonable\" mean something else, like a just sentence? What -- how do we define \"reasonable\"?",
  "Whether or not the commission and then the district judge reasonably interpret the congressional intent, and if the commission reasonably interprets the congressional intent is the district court allowed to disregard that?",
  "Assuming the commission was reasonable, can they still disagree?",
  "So in your case you ask us to establish the proposition that in any case, a sentencing judge must always be free to disregard a reasonable interpretation of the Commission, a reasonable interpretation of a congressional statute?",
  "You would go further - - you would go further and -- and submit to us the proposition that I -- that I just stated?",
  "Reasonably.",
  "But -- and I take it your submission is that the district court must be able to make the determination that the commission's policy is to be disregarded in every case to come before the court?",
  "Does the Guidelines supersede the parsimony provision, because the parsimony provision is general and the Guidelines -- the ratio is specific?",
  "Suppose experience shows that the ratio is not consistent with the parsimony provision -- we find that over a course of time?",
  "If it had been the other way around and the district court had said what appellate court said and the appellate court had said what the district court said, what would you be arguing?",
  "Well, you can see the systemic concern. I mean, it's just not always going to be the case that the district judge is the one to give more leniency.",
  "Going back to the Chief Justice's hypothetical and the colloquy you had with him with the hypothetical, the two different judges in the statement district or the same circuit that treat age differently, if the Congress saw that would the Congress be able to say anything about that, do anything about that to stop the disparity?",
  "Consistently with the Sixth Amendment?",
  "Can you tell me what happens if there's a -- two bank robbers, the one's with the get-away car; the other one going into the bank teller, and the robber that goes into the bank gets $1,000 and comes out and gives 500 to the get-away guy. Is that a violation of the statute?",
  "And -- if your definition of proceeds is problematic, it is something like an abstract question you're asking us to answer. If this -- if we say well, we're not sure this is proceeds but if it is proceeds, it is defined as gross receipts. That's an artificial context in which to address the issue.",
  "Well, you see the problem we have is we're not sure that it is within the statute. So then you're asking us to say how to make the statute work when we don't think the statute's applicable at all.",
  "Did you argue at any point that these were not proceeds?",
  "Did you argue that in the court of appeals?",
  "Well, I think it is a stretch so far as the question presented. The question presented is very clear whether or not it is gross receipts or net profits. That's what we're asked to resolve.",
  "Brief in opposition - -",
  "What about the bank robber -- there's just one bank robbery. They spend $500 to each, to people for their airfare and car rental. They rob the bank. They only get $800. They lost $200. They then give the $800 to the attorney to please -- or to somebody to please launder the money. No profits?",
  "That would be a very silly result.",
  "No. They gave it to a third person to conceal it, $800.",
  "8,000, 8 million.",
  "Assume that it's proceeds. Assume that they have a money launderer. Under your definition there's still no violation?",
  "Just focus on, if you would, Mr. Olson, on the election for the delegates. Now, suppose it were shown -- a hypothetical case -- that it's extremely difficult to get on that ballot. You need, let's say, 2,000 signatures in 30 days. Would there be a constitutional issue raised by that situation?",
  "A hypothetical case.",
  "What about Kusper, the Kusper case?",
  "I think we have made it very clear that if you're going to use a primary system, you can't have such burdensome registration requirements that the primary system is not, to all intents and purposes, to all intents and purposes open to those who wish to participate.",
  "So you think that in Kusper, if -- if there was reasonable access to a general election, you can structure and stifle the primary any way - -",
  "I'm just looking at the principle here, and it may be that you'll say that there's no burden here, et cetera. But I just want to know: Isn't there a constitutional principle that we are entitled and we must look at the fairness of the primary system insofar as participation of the voters?",
  "Just to make it clear, is it your position that, with reference to this election for delegates, the State can make it as burdensome as it chooses on those who wish to put themselves forward on the ballot as a proposed delegate?",
  "But if there is a State-mandated primary, I thought it's basic law that the State may not place unduly restrictive barriers to participation in that primary. I think that's a given, it seems to me. Now, tell me if I'm wrong - -",
  "And then we can argue about whether the burden is too great here, which it may not be.",
  "Do you think a political party could say, you can't vote in our primary unless you've been a member of our party for 4 years?",
  "This would be a State-mandated party primary for - -",
  "-- election - -",
  "What about the burden on a single delegate wanting to be on the ballot? I think that requires 500 votes, and there was no specific finding that that was burden, was there? Or am incorrect?",
  "What are your -- what are you best cases for that proposition?",
  "But the State -- the trial court didn't find that that was a burden.",
  "You say the State, your mean the State statute?",
  "The transaction was not wholly without benefit to Scientific-Atlanta. They got some advertising. And it was not wholly without benefit to Charter. They were able to show that advertising works. Now, that puts aside the fact that they were using misleading accounting principles.",
  "But there are -- there are any number of kickbacks and mismanagement and petty frauds that go on in the business, and business people know that any publicly held company's shares are going to be affected by its profits, so I see no limitation to your -- to your proposal for liability.",
  "Well, I agree with Justice Scalia's earlier comment, I don't think that Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola really cared anything of -- one way or the other about the investors.",
  "For them the scheme made a certain amount of sense, they didn't really care.",
  "But that's far different from having a purpose. You said they have to have a purpose.",
  "Which goes back to my earlier question, that most people that engage in frauds on business know that if it's a publicly held corporation, it's going to hurt the price of the shares or affect the price of the shares.",
  "Well, I thought -- I agree with Justice Ginsburg. I thought the \"in-connection-with\" argument is actually in addition to or separate from an additional argument you made that there was no deceptive statement made here. I thought that's what you were arguing, and I have problems with that argument because the statute doesn't require a statement. It requires -- conduct suffice.",
  "Would you say that there was deception, standing alone?",
  "Well, but that's --",
  "-- that's not the allegation of the complaint. I -- I thought the allegation of the complaint was that they -- they knew that this was a fraud and they participated in the fraud.",
  "If we accept --",
  "If we accept your theory of the case and we then get another case in which an accountant or an attorney who prepares the statement for publication to the investors and then gives it to under 10b-5 as to the accountants and still rule -- and still keep our ruling in favor of your client here?",
  "And if so, what would --",
  "And if so, what would be the rationale?",
  "How about outside accountants and attorneys who deliberately and directly participate in negotiating -- or in drafting the false disclosure statements?",
  "Could they be liable and under your theory of the case, but your client not liable?",

  "But -- but what you're saying is that all Watson did was to receive the gun. But he agreed to accept the gun as payment.",
  "It seems to me that in that sense he used a gun. It wasn't his gun yet, but he agreed that if the gun would be brought to the scene of the transaction, that he would accept receipt of it.",
  "He says, you get a gun, you put it in your car, you come to my house, you bring that gun with you, and I will give you drugs. I think in a sense he's using the gun. It's through the, the actions of another that he is doing it to be sure.",
  "Perhaps. But it seems to me to unduly constrict the case to say that all he did was receive it. He did more than that. He agreed in advance.",
  "Suppose he received the gun, loaded it and said, well, now, let's renegotiate this transaction?",
  "But he doesn't brandish it. He just, he puts it in his pocket and he says: Let's renegotiate this. What result? Could the government charge him?",
  "I suppose you could say we used the gun in order to complete the drug transaction.",
  "Are you saying that the parties are viewed collectively so that in Justice Breyer's example the pitcher and the batter used a ball and a bat. Is that your position? And in this case the seller and the buyer used drugs and a gun.",
  "Well, does that fit with the words of the statute, any person who - -",
  "Even though it's a collective enterprise, you can still focus on one of the parties and prevail. Is that your position?",
  "Well, I'm still interested in the answer to the Chief Justice's hypothetical.",
  "Suppose the court acts beyond, clearly beyond, its jurisdiction?",
  "Could you answer the hypothetical, please.",
  "Suppose in this case the President did the opposite -- the same facts only the President said to Texas, do not comply with this judgment.",
  "So then the President's - -",
  "-- determination is not conclusive.",
  "My hypothetical is he's coming out the other way. He says don't follow this judgment. And you say he can't do that.",
  "And I -- I think that that's not -- not consistent with your earlier position.",
  "Can this court interpret the meaning of the Avena judgment if it's ambiguous? For instance, it said that a number of Mexico nationals have not received a hearing. It didn't say all of them. And I have a problem, incidentally, because I think Medellin did receive all the hearing that he's entitled to under the judgment anyway. Can we interpret the judgment in that respect if it's ambiguous, not clear?",
  "Can we interpret the judgment?",
  "And can the President displace our authority to do that?",
  "Suppose the President had reached the contrary conclusion, a hypothetical we put earlier. Supposed the President had told Texas, do not follow this judgment?",
  "I agree that we should give that determination great weight, but that's something quite different from saying that he can displace the authority of this Court on that issue of law.",
  "And in Nash he was being held under Federal custody. So Nash is just inapplicable here.",
  "Of course, Nash is just a wonderful speech by Marshall anyway; it's not an opinion.",
  "And what you are saying - - and this has been the law - -",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Then this is consistent with what you've been explaining to Justice Breyer in your answer, that for 200 years we have had some treaties that are very important, but they're not self-executing; their violation may put us in violation of international law; but it is for us to determine how we are going to comply with the international obligation; and there is no obligation on the part of the State to comply with that law because it's not self-executing.",
  "At some point I think in the course of your argument, we may get back to whether the Vienna Convention itself is or is not self-executing. I think the Solicitor General was correct in saying that that's a difficult word. I think it is self-executing in that the State has to comply with it. I'm not sure that it is self-executing in that the State has to accept whatever procedural framework the foreign national demands.",
  "And the United States apparently accepts the verdict of those - -",
  "You have three different things that you have to tell us about today: That the President's authority, the effect of the ICJ, and -- and the Avena judgment, and ultimately, the force of the Vienna Convention itself. And the only question I have that I need your help with is as to the last, and I hope that it doesn't interrupt the train of your argument. I think the ICJ -- pardon me, the Vienna Convention is self-executing, in that it requires the States to conform to the consular notification provision.",
  "Suppose you have a judge who has control over a defendant who's being held in custody pending trial, and the defendant says I want to see my -- my foreign counsel. The judge says no. Can you mandate that -- assuming State procedures allow him in, couldn't you mandate that judge to require him to allow the notification to take place?",
  "You see where I'm going?",
  "If I thought he did, would I still have to rule against you?",
  "Could I make a distinction between failing to let him see the counsel at all in my hypothetical and a demand that the procedural framework be altered? Isn't there a distinction between those two cases, do you think?",
  "How many parties to Avena -- there were 51 -- are being held in the State of Texas?",
  "But suppose, to narrow that hypothetical, that there's a rule that you can't be an employee of the clearinghouse or the exchange if you have a conviction for fraud, and they don't -- they're negligent and careless about enforcing that rule and that fraud causes the loss. Under either your theory or the government's theory, would there be liability, and is there a difference between those two theories?",
  "But in my hypothetical there is a transaction and there are actual damages - - I'm reading from -- from (b)(c). There's been a transaction and the liabilities for damages sustained by a person who engaged in the transaction or subject to the rules of the buyer.",
  "Well, but under that reading they should have used the word \"and\" rather than \"or.\"",
  "Or which is subject to.",
  "But the -- the buy and the sell contract will be worth nothing if it isn't cleared.",
  "I know. But you want - - you want us to say that the clearing is no part of the transaction, but the clearing is necessary to make a transaction go forward. Otherwise the contract is just a nullity.",
  "Well, on that subject and you -- your client obviously has an institutional interest in the case, assuming you don't prevail, is the government's theory much broader and more undesirable in your view than that offered in Klein brief? I didn't have an opportunity to ask Mr. Days if he accepted the government's position.",
  "Are there instances where multiple parties who are injured sue under state law, or is this generally deemed preemptive, or it just doesn't happen, or - -",
  "Well, but even -- even there I assume the law waits for a certain passage of time, and I would assume that there can be no felony committed during that interim period or the person's sentence has to be served or something? It's ongoing, it's prospective. And so restoration has a real component, in that -- that is not present in the statute that we're faced with here.",
  "Well, it is of -- maybe no difference if the operation of law is 24 hours later.",
  "But I assume that's not the case. I assume that there's in every case, as Justice Scalia's question indicates, a certain passage of time that takes place.",
  "Well, but I'm suggesting -- and I haven't done the research -- that that's atypical.",
  "I think it's atypical to give a felon one day in jail.",
  "Do you know, since you seem to have looked at it: In North Carolina, for the person whose had his civil rights taken away, is -- is there any mechanism to get them back earlier by -- by applying for clemency or a pardon or - -",
  "That would be about the only way?",
  "And in the automatic category, I take it, it's usually after the sentence has been served?",
  "Suppose the distributor attaches the movie review. It's in amazon.com, and then it has the movie review.",
  "And is that your answer to the -- all of the hypotheticals that are put forth in the Coalition for Free Speech, the Catholic Bishops, the advertisement in amazon.com or Netflix, then?",
  "Let's -- pardon me.",
  "Let's assume for the moment that there are minors, so that the content aspect of it is film.",
  "That there are real minors in some of these things.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "If one had a hand held video at a school or something like that?",
  "There are two things that you -- that all of us have to work with here. One is the scienter component here. Is that overly broad, vague, and so forth? The other is the content. And my concern is the same as that indicated by Justice Stevens at the outset. There are some terrible practices in the child-trafficking area where children are held in brothels for the most debased of acts. There are abuses in prisons, abuses in schools. If there are videotapes showing those things, it seems to me that the statute is -- that they're clearly covered by the statute, and maybe even a killing of a little girl in public might be sadistic. Assume that that's covered by the statute. Is there anything in the \"presents\" and the \"promotes\" language in the scienter component of the statute that gives some protection to these materials? Is it just as-applied? Is that what we have to do?",
  "So we want the public to see this to show them how bad it is, and that is permitted under the statute, because it is not \"presenting\"?",
  "I agree with you that we have different motives.",
  "But I'm not sure that the statute covers that.",
  "Well, I suppose if we were going to do that it would be simpler and maybe prudent for us to reexamine our overbreadth rule. Your client here falls within none of these examples. He was convicted of having what everyone recognizes as not only child pornography but involving a very small child. And he knew what it was. And he -- and he conveyed that belief. Given the fact that it would appear that child pornography is a growing problem, a serious problem on the Internet, maybe we should examine the overbreadth rule and just say that your client cannot make this challenge.",
  "Can we reject the overbreadth challenge here and still leave an overbreadth doctrine for some other cases? I'm not sure how we could do that.",
  "Well, I propose if the State of Minnesota really cared about this, it could have its own confrontation rule. Does it have a confrontation rule?",
  "That means the State isn't necessarily tied in knots. It has the option to do substantively what it chooses.",
  "Well, page 2 of your reply brief, the yellow brief, you take issue with the State, and you say the State is wrong if there is a decision either way on the confrontation clause and it's questionable under Federal law, we can review it. I can concede that's right, but that doesn't get you home. That's the problem.",
  "That is the problem. You're now creating a regime in which State courts are reaching questions that we said ought not to be reached for final convictions.",
  "And that was the basis on which we decided Crawford.",
  "It's a general policy rule, but it may well, as in the Crawford case, as a good example, have affected this Court's initial determination to strike off in a new direction. We did so knowing that there's a possibility that we wouldn't upset final convictions.",
  "-- to that effect.",
  "Well, even -- even outside of the habeas context, we -- we decided a case, Hudson v. Walker, one or two terms ago. It was a no-knock case. We said that, even if there is a no-knock violation, the exclusionary rule does not apply. This would be too costly an extension of the exclusionary rule and would bring the -- would make the Fourth Amendment a disruptive force. Under your view, I take it, the State, even in -- in its trial proceedings subject to direct review, could disagree with that and take a Federal concept, no-knock, and then apply the exclusionary rule, thereby forcing us to make the -- to draw the very lines that we said we ought not to draw in Hudson.",
  "But -- but you agree with me, then, that under your position, the State could apply an exclusionary rule.",
  "You want us to write an opinion which begins with the sentence, \"This Court has no interest in the extent to which its constitutional decisions upset final judgments\"?",
  "Is part of that because of what's involved in expectations? That's the Smith case, where we said the determination of whether a constitutional decision is retroactive Is every bit as much a question of Federal law as the decision of the substantive right itself. We said that in Smith.",
  "And here the expectation -- in Smith it was the expectation of people in the private sector. Here the expectation is one of finality of judgments.",
  "-- expectations as being questions of remedy?",
  "It seems to me that your -- your answer to Justice Souter's question earlier should be that there is uniformity. Some States are fast, some are slow, but in the end there is a final judgment which is a settled expectation, and the substance of the law honors settled expectations, which is finality.",
  "And the concern is not so much a concern not so much for the defendant here but for the States, isn't it? We don't want -- we think there is -- there is an important value implicit in habeas, and one of those values is that there be a limit to the degree to which we are going to upset the settled expectations of the States. Isn't that right?",
  "Well, I must say I have serious problems with your position in that regard. If you were not to prevail in this case and -- or, pardon me, if the Petitioner were to prevail in this case, and there were a ruling on what Crawford means, or doesn't mean, we could review it. I think the Petitioner is absolutely right on that point.",
  "Isn't what you are saying is that the concern in Teague was not only with State court processes, but with settled expectations of those who are involved in the criminal system, particularly victims who are entitled at some point to rely on a conviction being final?",
  "We don't usually think of just of settled expectations as being questions of remedy. We consider those as being questions of substance.",
  "I was going to ask this question. Is it -- would it be permitted for a State to say that, with respect to utilities and certain industries, including railroads, we use valuation Method A, with respect to commercial rental real estate property we use valuation Method B? Is that permitted?",
  "So is a large part of the argument you would make that other utilities are comparable or not comparable to a railroad?",
  "Suppose an accounting journal or some prestigious group of accountants and tax appraisers came up with a new theory for evaluating railroad property and it was conceded by all to be highly accurate. Could they use just that for the railroad and different methodologies for all other utilities all over the country?",
  "So that if had the Platonic, the ideal valuation method, the State could use it only if it ended up with the right ratio?",
  "But in the end it has to have the right ratio.",
  "Well, Congress uses the word \"true market value\" and under this hypothetical I come very close to true market value, and you say it doesn't work.",
  "I thought your -- I thought your submission was that even if is true market value for the railroad, the ratio still has to be in line if the methodology is different.",
  "Why would your position be any stronger if it used fair market value?",
  "Or any weaker?",
  "What do you mean, we have false \"fair market value\"? I never heard of such a thing.",
  "Suppose a State said that it was unlawful for anyone other than a State resident to purchase the bond?",
  "Would it be constitutional to say that the holder of the bond must always be a Kentucky resident or, if you sold the bond, it has to be to another Kentucky resident?",
  "So if New York has a very strong financial community, it can really benefit its citizens by keeping the market in New York bonds for itself, if it chooses?",
  "And your case for that is what, United Haulers?",
  "I can ask your brother who represents Petitioner -- maybe I'd better should -- I'd get a better answer from him so far as his position. As you understand his position, as you understand the State's position, would it be permissible for State A to go to State B and say: We -- if you make your bonds nontaxable to our residents, we'll make your bonds nontaxable to your residents.",
  "Do you find that consistent with the vision of the framers for our national market under the Commerce Clause?",
  "I assume there would be a preference to Massachusetts milk for Massachusetts buyers, to Michigan automobiles for Michigan buyers, and the State did not subsidize.",
  "-- authorities - -",
  "I think that's true. There's a national securities market. Everybody knows that.",
  "And I don't think either side can avoid that fact. He's suggesting that it cuts more in his favor than it does for yours because you are creating artificial barriers to that market. So that when a person who knows about Kentucky bonds and who knows what the good ones are moves out of state, he all of a sudden loses the advantage to purchase those bonds anymore, or at least he does -- he takes a penalty for doing that. Let me -- let me ask you this, the question I asked your co-counsel. A and D get together and agree on reciprocal advantages for their -- for their respective residents. Is that constitutional?",
  "Suppose it's not. And - -",
  "And isn't that exactly what's happening here? Isn't that exactly what's happening here? You have, in effect, a pact among States to favor their own residents.",
  "I suppose any favored legislation favoring local industry helps the State, and the State residents like it. That's the whole point. That's why the Commerce Clause exists as a check.",
  "All politics is local. All States want to protect their residents and make it look like they're doing something for their residents. And that's exactly the purpose of Commerce Clause prohibition against explicit discrimination, which is what this is. There's no doubt that this is explicit discrimination.",
  "What are -- what are examples -- what are examples of Federal statutes that have allowed explicit discrimination?",
  "In the insurance industry?",
  "Was the rule or the presumption that you just quoted in effect when Congress last revised the statute?",
  "But you can -- was Congress aware of that general rule when it last revised the statute?",
  "I don't, either, and that's why, when you say, well, it's a general rule, well, your argument tends to lose force because of the fact that Congress acts against the background of what this Court has stated.",
  "Well, that -- that assumes that the government has waived in every case. If it hasn't waived, I have to do it anyway.",
  "If they, if they raise the defense - -",
  "-- then you're going to have to determine it anyway, subject to clearly erroneous findings of fact, as to when the person entered the property and so forth.",
  "Aren't statutes of limitations generally more equivocal than that?",
  "May I go back to the answer you gave Justice Stevens when he asked you to assume that there was no precedent, we're reading this as an original matter. I thought your answer to him, correct me if I'm wrong, was that, well, in any event \"shall be barred\" means that it can't be waived anyway. But statute -- I looked up other statutes of limitations, and other statutes of limitations: \"Shall not be entertained,\" \"may not be commenced,\" \"may not be brought.\"",
  "My response was all statute of limitations say that and all statute of limitations can be waived.",
  "But I thought conciliation was an important policy of the EEOC.",
  "But you want us to write an opinion saying, we're not concerned with conciliation? We just - -",
  "Is that in the record?",
  "Under the - -",
  "Well, in some -- one of the functions of a judicial -- what about an agreement, arbitration agreement, that the district court can find facts de novo?",
  "Well, suppose it's a complex matter of monitoring emissions, looking at water quality, and the arbitrator has to sit by the river for a month, the district judge had to go down and sit by the river for a month.",
  "But you have to give us a standard. You said, you mentioned, oh, functions of the district court. I don't know the standard you're proposing that will allow us to draw the line and to put cases on one side of the line or the other. You said, well, you can't interfere with the functions of the court. I don't quite understand that.",
  "But -- but the question is whether or not that streamlined process is the only process. It seems to me that if the purpose of the Arbitration Act is to promote confidence in the arbitration process, that if parties agree to have the double assurance that the arbitrator hasn't made some strange ruling of law, that that's quite consistent with the whole purposes of arbitration.",
  "But you're -- you're asking us to interpret the statute; and let us assume that it's a plausible interpretation and interpret the statute as the Petitioner would. You know, under Section 8, the parties can use the authority of the court to libel a ship. The court is extending its authority to -- to use very intrusive means, and to say that the parties can't ensure, if they choose, to have review for correct errors of law -- to correct errors of law when the ship has been seized, it seems to me to promote the whole purposes of the act.",
  "Well, we're arguing about that textually. I'm saying that there's nothing inconsistent with the Petitioner's position and the basic policies of the act. You talk about finality, streamline, and so forth; but if the parties have more confidence in the arbitration process by ensuring this added level of review, it seems to me quite consistent with the purposes of the act.",
  "Would you -- would you agree that what we hold in this case applies to suits in admiralty, where you don't go to State court under Section 8?",
  "Well, at this point you don't have a State court fallback for your argument.",
  "And I -- I can't say why it isn't -- I just repeat my earlier point -- quite consistent with encouraging confidence in admiralty arbitration to allow district courts to review rulings on a matter of law if the parties so choose.",
  "And I would add - -",
  "I would add that in admiralty you don't have the back-up of State law.",
  "Could the parties have an arbitration agreement in which they said, if there are contested issues of law, either party may seek declaratory judgment?",
  "In a Federal court, under the Declaratory Judgment Act.",
  "My hypothetical is it's in the arbitration agreement. If the arbitrator gets stuck on a difficult question of law, either party can seek declaratory relief, and the arbitration proceedings are held in abeyance pending that declaration.",
  "No. There's the advisory -- we've been through this. This is a real controversy, not an advisory opinion.",
  "I think the reason you hesitated to answer yes might be inconsistent with your position.",
  "There are lots of other things for the arbitrator to do. He's got some specific issues of law that are contested.",
  "I'm not sure why you have to give the answer you just gave to Justice Alito, if what you told Justice Scalia is correct, that the \"if\" clause includes the condition that the court reviewed for issues -- for errors of law.",
  "Well -- but you're arguing to Justice Scalia that Section 9 works because you could interpret the \"if\" clause that way.",
  "Now you're telling Justice Scalia, oh, well, it's a different action. We have got the action here anyway.",
  "I think those three points are certainly what would help me. Could I ask just two preliminary questions? They don't necessarily have to do with this case, just to get something straight. I take it that you couldn't have claimed this deduction under 162 without getting into an argument that it should be capitalized and that's why 212 is in the Code?",
  "My other question is background only. Perhaps I should ask the government. Are 162 expenses subject to the 2 percent ceiling?",
  "Well, it seems to me that that just simply couldn't have been Congress's purpose in passing this statute because now you have a recipe for avoidance. In most States -- California has a rule that the trustee has to make prudent business investments. I assume a great number of businessmen outside the trust context think that they have their principal objective of making prudent business investments. But under your theory all expenses for that objective would fall within this exclusion. I just don't think that's what the Congress could possibly have intended.",
  "Well, is that true just in your case?",
  "Universally, there is never a danger of tax avoidance? You want us to write the decision on the assumption that tax avoidance is never a problem in the creation of a trust?",
  "If we can rush to the fallback position, is it acceptable to have a test that says would the expense have been incurred if the nontrust business wanted to achieve an objective that the trust wanted to achieve here, fixing the roof?",
  "And I think the structure of the statute requires us to -- to do that.",
  "It almost sounds like ordinary and necessary under 162?",
  "212. I understand that.",
  "What do you have to support that? I resist accepting that broad proposition, and I don't know where to look or who to ask in order to determine its -- its truth or falsity.",
  "Well, are you asking us to reject the concept of concurrent jurisdiction in all circumstances?",
  "And in your view to what extent does this involve subaqueous lands toward -- and I'll just put \"toward\" -- the New Jersey side?",
  "I'm not sure I understand your position on where New Jersey's jurisdiction begins and ends with reference to subaqueous lands.",
  "But that's -- Article I -- that's an exception. And you don't have the benefit of that exception when you're talking about Article VII.",
  "The exception is not that specific as to the -- as to the extent of the jurisdiction.",
  "It seems to me you're running away from the hypothetical. I have the question that Justice Souter has, basically to what extent does concurrent jurisdiction apply, what are the limits that we will apply in later cases to implement this concept of concurrent jurisdiction? In the laws of some States you can't overburden an easement. If you give a power company an easement, it can't put huge 300-foot structures on the easement without taking -- is that the kind of analysis that we have to apply in order to make your concurrent jurisdiction and the Master's concurrent jurisdiction theory work?",
  "But that assumes that there is going to be a wharf. You want us to say that the police power means that there cannot be a wharf if New Jersey says no.",
  "And that seems to me inconsistent. If Delaware says no.",
  "That seems to me inconsistent with saying that New Jersey has a right to wharf out.",
  "I don't know where -- what -- where do you draw the line, what is your distinction?",
  "Under your view a riparian right exists only to say whether there should be a wharf. The -- the State with jurisdiction over the riparian right has no interest in what's going to happen on that wharf, or what the wharf is going to look like?",
  "What case -- and I could ask Mr. Farr the same question -- do I consult in order to give content to the term riparian rights? Where can I see what the substance of riparian rights is, in the -- in the decisions of this Court or in other leading decisions.",
  "Could the State of New Jersey allow the wharf to be built for some unspecified purpose, just let it stick out there until it decides what it wants to do with it?",
  "I'm asking a hypothetical, could it do that? It would seem to me that would be a very stupid riparian use, but could it do that?",
  "You are saying that the --",
  "You are saying that the concept of \"riparian rights\" displaces the police power, to a large extent.",
  "Ms. Brinkmann, I'm interested in two things. Number one, I want to make sure you completed the quantification point that you made, and you pointed us to someplace in the record, because the Petitioner said, oh, it just costs a penny a package or something like that. And then the second point, I think probably not related, is the question of knowledge. I take it you're not contesting if there's actual knowledge that it's a minor that there can be a prosecution. I'm not sure how that works if the company -- because of the imputed knowledge. Suppose an officer of the company or some shipping clerk knows it. Wouldn't the company be liable if the company were subject to -- those are two different questions.",
  "Just on the knowledge point, I'm still not sure. I don't want to ask you if you concede that knowing delivery would make you liable. That's what the First Circuit said. I suppose that's not before us, so I have to take that as a premise, as a given.",
  "It's a little bit hard to write the opinion your way with that, with that concession. That's my problem. Or with that premise.",
  "Well, but the way -- I'm telling you I assume the way it works is that the UPS truck goes out to the tobacco warehouse and picks up 4,000 boxes, all registered tobacco. He certainly knows it's tobacco at that point.",
  "Why is it that knowledge requirements have a different preemption analysis? That's what I'm finding that difficult to understand.",
  "Then that's clear preemption in Justice Breyer's example. If California says you must ship certain products in refrigerated containers, that is definitely preempted under your analysis.",
  "It seems to me rather odd that major carriers can determine the scope of pre-emption. Suppose there are smaller carriers that say we don't want to do this. Take the New York settlement example. If the New York settlement example, in effect, opens up a new kind of service, all other carriers have to follow that? That's a -- there's no authority in our cases for that kind of pre-emption analysis, is there?",
  "If you were to read the district court's minute order -- and this is that short minute order -- as saying that evidence of pattern and practice simply is not admissible, that would be error, would it not? Error to -- if the -- if that had been his ruling, that would have been error. In my Court, you don't introduce pattern and practice. That can't be - -",
  "Is there anything in the other parts of the record colloquy, comments by the district judge, that you think Respondents have called to our attention to indicate that he had this sweeping view?",
  "Excuse me. Did I hear mishear you? You said it's a 7,000-person?",
  "It doesn't mention the offer of proof.",
  "Was there an attempt by the plaintiff during the discovery phase of the case to show other evidence of pattern and practice, statistical evidence; or was it just these five people? Was that all that the plaintiff presented?",
  "The inference they are trying to prove is there was somebody upstairs that told everybody what to do.",
  "Does the record show in this 70,000-person company how many supervisors there were? Do we know that?",
  "The next step up would be --",
  "I see your -- does 404 bear on the case, Rule 404 of the Rules of Evidence?",
  "Even if those supervisors RIF'd two thousands employees, and only three made this complaint?",
  "No matter how many employees were RIF'd, only three supervisors - - hypothetical case, three supervisors. No many how many employees were RIF'd, the three is sufficient so that these witnesses could testify?",
  "So take it in this case, and in all cases, the plaintiff has the burden of laying the foundation for this evidence; is that not correct?",
  "And you say the foundation is satisfied if they were the same supervisors in the same division, I thought.",
  "You want us to write that in a case as a rule?",
  "Without reference to how many employees were involved?",
  "You said there was going to be an agreement that this would be a trial or a day, a day and a half.",
  "Was that before or after the premise this testimony would not be admitted.",
  "You told it can be done in a day and a half. Because these five were excluded.",
  "I don't think that has any bearing on the ruling that the trial judge made that's under review in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and that we're looking at here.",
  "Has this Court said that 403 determinations must always be made on the record?",
  "Well, I thought that's precisely what you are saying, that that there is no balancing shown, that he didn't do the balance.",
  "You said there were two points about 403.",
  "Do you think the deference in Uttecht, which was the death qualified juror - -",
  "-- should be any greater than in a Batson case where we have the sensitive issue of racial discrimination?",
  "Well, Uttecht - -",
  "Uttecht was a death qualified juror - -",
  "-- and this is a Batson case.",
  "Because of our concerns in the Batson area, do you think we're entitled to have a different standard of deference for the trial court? I think your - -",
  "We haven't discussed this - -",
  "Well, before that decision is reached, let me ask you this -- under State law, either generally or specifically under the law of the State that you are trying to invoke here, does the jury -- does the finder of fact weigh the potential risks of injury and illness against the probable benefits to the health of the patient? Is that one of the things the jury does? In other words, suppose this was a very important device, but it had a one percent risk. Does the jury consider that when it determines whether that's been negligently sold?",
  "Alright, now isn't that exactly what the FDA measured in the PMA process? The FDA is specifically charged with weighing the risks against the probable benefits.",
  "So the jury is doing the same thing that the FDA did.",
  "Well, but that was under the expedited 510(k). That's different than PMA, because in PMA there's a specific weight.",
  "Was Medtronic free to alter this label without the FDA's consent?",
  "What's the citation for that?",
  "Is the manufacturer free to continue to sell the device after newly discovered risks - -",
  "-- pending the FDA's acting on the same information?",
  "It takes time for the FDA to act. Let's assume that we know it's going to take six months for the FDA to do this. The manufacturer knows that there's a real problem. He can continue to sell in the face of the knowledge of the real problem?",
  "I was asking you about the manufacturer's duty pending the FDA's action.",
  "If the manufacturer finds just from its own laboratory experiments and not because of any data it's received from doctors and patients that there's a better way to do this, does it have the obligation to notify the FDA?",
  "Suppose a label is approved in a very specific form under PMA, and then a year later, it turns out, unforeseen by anyone, that doctors are just -- many good doctors are just reading it the wrong way and it's dangerous. Can the manufacturer continue to sell new devices with the same label pending the annual report?",
  "Just take - -",
  "Just take my hypothetical.",
  "And you could -- and the manufacturer continued to sell the device knowing that the label is being misconstrued by very good doctors pending FDA action?",
  "Yes, it's very serious.",
  "Does the failure to give that notice subject the manufacturer to liability if the manufacturer continues to sell the device?",
  "What do I read in order to verify your statement that the -- that manufacturers can cure the label without FDA approval? Where do I find that?",
  "Yes.",
  "Suppose there had not been a six-year wait, would it be appropriate then for us to -- if you prevail -- remand the case to the habeas court and instruct the habeas court to defer until the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has finished the DTA review proceedings?",
  "Why should I assume that the district court in Washington would be any faster than the court of appeals?",
  "Why can't that take place in the CSRT review proceedings that are pending?",
  "You're not heartened by the prospect that the detainees could apply to the Cuban courts, which would then hand process to the Commanding General at Guantanamo?",
  "I didn't understand that point when you were having your colloquy with Justice Breyer, either. I thought you were going to answer to Justice Breyer, that the court of appeals does have the right to determine whether to the extent the Constitution and the laws of the United States are applicable, whether such standards and procedures, such as CSRT, are -- - to make the determination -- are consistent with the Constitution --",
  "-- that's provided in the MCA.",
  "But the statute --",
  "But the statute talks about standards. Why can't that question that Justice Breyer raised be reached by the Court of Appeals under the CSRT review hearings when it determines the constitutional adequacy of the standards, or am I missing something?",
  "Just one more question on that point: Would the Court of Appeals in -- under the MCA have the authority to question the constitutionality of the definition of noncombatant -- of unlawful combatant?",
  "How can we fit your position when we have no jurisdiction here?",
  "Our opinion says have a nice day, everybody.",
  "What does that tell you about the adequacy of the substitute?",
  "If you say that tolling is automatic, which I assume is your position, would it be possible under the statutes to say that tolling is not automatic but can be permitted in the discretion of the hearing officer?",
  "Or are we then just inventing something that's not in the statute at all?",
  "No. All it needs to do is to say, we'll grant you an extension while we look at this.",
  "If your client or some other client, assuming the government wins in this case, leaves within the 60-day period and the petition for rehearing is forwarded, can he take all these affidavits and apply for an adjustment of status, or is that much longer?",
  "Even with voluntary departure?",
  "May I ask one question? And I'm not sure the progression in which Justice Breyer was going to begin. I take it that the motion to reopen has -- shows new evidence, new factors, new circumstances; and that would be unavailable on the appeal, because the record hasn't been supplemented. Or am I wrong about that?",
  "While you have an appeal -- while you have an appeal from what was in the record.",
  "If you don't have the motion to reopen then the -- then the new material is not subject to the appeal, or am I wrong?",
  "In one of your -- in one of your arguments earlier you said the whole idea of voluntary departure is to expedite the proceedings and so forth. I assume that voluntary departure is never elected as an option before the Board rules.",
  "In other words, it -- or am I wrong?",
  "Yes, but the removal -- at the outset, you don't elect voluntary departure at the outset of the hearing?",
  "No, no, no. I mean in a contested case.",
  "Well, if it were properly administered, would you have a case here? Let's assume 100 percent of cases are properly administered.",
  "No, my question - -",
  "Let's assume hypothetically, and we know this isn't true, that 100 percent of the time it's properly administered. Then do you have an argument to present to the Court?",
  "You were interrupted, and you gave Justice Ginsburg -- you said you have two problems for monitoring. She asked you who would do this and what measures would they use.",
  "And you were never able to get to the second.",
  "Well, as to the cuff, I thought the record was rather clear that it is just not used at these low blood pressure levels.",
  "So you're standard is that there has -- well, don't let me misphrase it for you, but there have to be other obvious available alternatives.",
  "So your safeguard one is the only -- you have against Justice Scalia, endless litigation, or does your threshold two do the same thing.",
  "Did you mean to say unconsciousness.",
  "Well, I see what you're doing. You're constructing your argument so that we have structural protections. I can understand that argument, but Justice Souter's question points out just as a practical matter this is not nearly as important as a failure to object to illegally seized evidence, a post -- a post-arrest delay, open courtroom, all of which are subject to waiver.",
  "Well, I was interested in your comment on trying cases, but to say that you have to sit down and explain to the -- to the defendant the difference between the magistrate and an Article III and why you like this particular magistrate -- it's the attorney that does all the questioning, after all -- it seems to me is -- is a burden. It's not justified by the position that you're -- you're submitting to us.",
  "That gets back to your structural argument, which makes a certain amount of sense just insofar as knowing where the line is. On the other hand, I'm just not sure of the practical significance of the client's participation when it's really the attorney who is making the decision whether or not this magistrate will allow him to strut his stuff in front of the jury for a little longer than the district judge would. I just don't see how the client can really have much informed input into that at all.",
  "Suppose -- I know you don't like to contemplate this, but that we accept the Petitioner's position that there has to be, that the client has to waive. Would we be better off just adopting the rule that there has to be express waiver, or would you then recommend that we ask the further question whether or not there was an implied consent?",
  "Well, he was there, he probably knew and the record shows that he knew what was going on.",
  "I, frankly, don't think we should go down that route.",
  "How does that work? You have some jurors, and you have juror's excused for cause, and there is an argument about that, then that juror has to sit down and wait for two days and then they go back and they review that before the district judge. I just don't know mechanically how that can work.",
  "Excuse me, if the Article III judge says, oh, this should not have been excused for cause, then you go back and bump the juror.",
  "Do you think the magistrate judge would overstep -- assuming you win and that is that rule is that the attorney can make the waiver, would the magistrate judge overstep by saying I know you've consented to this, but I want you to talk to your client about it; I want you to explain what the rules are? Would that be overstepping?",
  "I also wanted to know whether there is in the record the corporation's balance sheet? It was frankly hard for me to believe that this was not in excess of basis. You don't usually capitalize corporations for $10 million. But I don't have any basis other than just an assumption to make that observation. Is the corporate balance sheet with the capital structure in the record?",
  "Was it introduced by the Government or by the defendant?",
  "I'm not, I'm not sure if what the Government is maintaining here is so prejudicial to its position in other cases, which was the earlier discussion we were having. Here there is simply nothing on the corporate records to show that this was a distribution with respect to stock. I don't care whether this is earnings and profits or in excess of basis. But there's just no indication of the distribution with respect to stock, and you have two shareholders. Under Hawaiian law, can you make a disproportionate distribution to shareholders so one person gets capital back and the other doesn't and there's no redemption of shares?",
  "That was, that was the qualification that the Second Circuit made in its D'Agostino case. It said if there's a violation of corporate law then our rule doesn't apply.",
  "Well, but that's the whole point. The fact that he doesn't show this as a distribution indicates that he couldn't do this under Federal law, so it must be something -- under State law, so it must be something other than a distribution.",
  "Well, under the Government's intent test, I suppose if you have a calendar year and the distribution is made in June, that the Government could say: What we want to show -- we want you to show that there was an intent to make a distribution with respect to stock at that time. Whether or not it was a dividend, whether or not it was a return of capital, we won't know until the end of the year. I suppose they could try to argue that.",
  "You mean to say the Government can't argue that this -- the Defendant has to show that it was a distribution with respect to stock and that that was his intent. Whether or not it was a dividend, whether or not it was a return of capital, we wait.",
  "Under your response to Justice Stevens, once you show that it was from a likely source of income that he received it, it's unreported, then it's the defendant's burden to go ahead and show this was a 301 distribution, that I had a basis that absorbed it, that there were no earnings and profits. That's all for the defendant.",
  "Let me get something clear. They wish to introduce evidence. They wish to introduce evidence. And you say, oh, well, the proffer is no good because there is no basis, so there was no evidence. I don't understand that.",
  "Oh, I see.",
  "And you say there was no other evidence in the record that the expert could use for that testimony?",
  "Well, at 97, are you saying that the expert would have brought with him financial records to show earnings and profits and basis? Because I interpret the Government as saying there was nothing for him to testify to because there was no other -- the basic value was not in the record.",
  "This has been very helpful, but it does seem to me to raise a question about the fairness of your opening statement. You began by saying something to the effect that this does not discriminate on the basis of age. It does. Age is the explicit factor that the statute uses in order to answer Justice Breyer's question. And the Act does not prohibit the use of age in all circumstances to which it applies, but it does -- the Act goes on to prohibit the use of age in some of the circumstances. And one of those circumstances is the hypothetical of the 55-plus-year-old person used in Justice Breyer's statement and example. So, it is not correct, it seems to me, for you to say that this does not discriminate on the basis of age. Now, maybe there is some good reasons for doing that, you can get into that, but it seems to me it does make an explicit determination based on age as to some people.",
  "Suppose I can't make that assumption or adopt that premise. Is there another basis on which to reach the result? I think this does explicitly discriminate based on age as to some people, and you're telling me you don't want me to do that. But Suppose I don't agree with you. Is there some other way to reach the result?",
  "I just think it's hard to confine your rationale if you say that any association could sue. If it says, you know, there are people that if they knew what we were doing, if they knew this problem they would really want us to sue on their behalf, I don't know if I'm going to confine your rationale.",
  "But clearly you answer all of those questions that you've just posed, that you've just responded with, \"no\". So then your answer to Justice Alito should be no.",
  "Although that leads to the next question, is whether or not there are ways in which the -- the central purpose of this law can be preserved but it could be less stringent. But I'd like you to respond to both of those things.",
  "That wasn't -- that wasn't the problem I had with your answer to that question. You posed a number of questions to Justice Alito, or a number of responses, but to each one of those your own answer in the brief was no, and therefore your question -- the answer to Justice Alito's question should be no, there is no system that you know of that can impose a photo ID.",
  "Your answer is no.",
  "And even so is, there anything that prohibits the State from confirming the validity of the registration at the polling place?",
  "If we thought that the birth certificate requirement for indigent people was - - was burdensome, are there any States that have alternates to birth certificates? Do neighbors come in and testify that this is the person? And I was going to ask the Petitioners' counsel if there's some areas where this statute -- where the central purpose and the central function of this statute can be preserved but there can be some reasonable alternatives for people who have difficulty?",
  "If we did that, I assume challenges could be made in advance of the election.",
  "You want us to invalidate a statute on the ground that it's a minor inconvenience to a small percentage of voters?",
  "If we rule for Respondent in this case, would we have to reexamine the holding in California v. Greenwood?",
  "I should know this, but do we defer to State law in determining the lawfulness of the time before arraignment in the context of confessions, the McNabb-Mallory rule?",
  "Which is Federal.",
  "Well, was there any indication in that case that if the State had a shorter period, they would - -",
  "Don't you think we have to, if not overrule, at least back away from the holding in California versus Greenwood?",
  "I think it is much easier to administer, to have a uniform Federal standard, rather than whether or not an officer can arrest in one county for something and not in another county whether he has to have a badge or not. Those are the kind of trivialities we talked about in Whren.",
  "And both arrests are illegal, but you're saying that there's a difference. So your bright-line rule now seems to evaporate.",
  "I mean I'm assuming that your answer to my question about the badge or the wrong county and so forth would not result in suppression. Correct me if I have misinterpreted your argument.",
  "What's right?",
  "But then if you -- do you accept the proposition then, in some of these minor cases, the arrest might be valid, then you're whole argument about the Framers and the trespass and so forth is wrong.",
  "The Court simply said we're going to use our Federal supervisory power and incorporate the State law of arrest. If we don't have another body of law, we're going to do it. It didn't say it was required to by the Constitution. That's not the way I read Di Re.",
  "Then you have three cases, not five.",
  "I couldn't find the order that the court -- in the record it says that the order would be -- the court granted a preliminary injunction, the superior court, and then it said, according to an order to be entered by the clerk. How long was the arbitration stayed for? There was an enjoined -- there was an injunction. What was the term of the injunction? Just until further order of the court?",
  "Did the Respondent at any point indicate that after the Labor Commission, Labor Commissioner, made a determination that they would not go to superior court for de novo review?",
  "I must say that the Volt case is written in rather sweeping language that's not particularly helpful to you. On its facts, I think it's different because there were other parties, independent parties in the litigation. Don't you think that's the best way to distinguish Volt in your case?",
  "Does the Labor Commissioner have authority to commence proceedings on his own motion or her own motion?",
  "Well, I'm sorry that I asked already.",
  "If you go to the superior court for de novo review, can you ask the superior court for an order enforcing its decision?",
  "Well, you get de novo review. So do you ask the court for an order -- a declaratory order, declaring that the person is a talent agent or is not a talent agent?",
  "So do you think it would be within the authority of the superior court to say this is a judgment binding on the parties and the arbitration will not proceed, or must proceed consistently with my order?",
  "Yes. Well, but if the Respondent prevails, don't you think that the superior court has that authority?",
  "If Respondent prevails in this case, don't you think that the superior court can then say that its declaration is final and the arbitration shall not proceed?",
  "Did you take that position below, was the question.",
  "The arbitrator already agreed to do that. You didn't need the injunction for that purpose.",
  "Well -- but if your position is that we have to preserve the integrity of the State system, the Labor expert and so forth and the State builds in to that procedure, de novo review Superior Court, it seems to me rather difficult for you to now just say oh, well, the Superior Court doesn't make any difference.",
  "I just want to understand your position. In this case, does the California provision for de novo review in the Superior Court apply to stay the arbitration while that aspect of the proceeding is completed?",
  "My question was: You go to the labor commissioner. You also have a de novo right to go to the superior court.",
  "Suppose the labor commissioner said something absolutely silly. Wouldn't you think you would have the right to go to the Superior Court?",
  "And it would make no sense to do that and -- and not to also stay the arbitration.",
  "No. Now, we have this case. We have an arbitration clause.",
  "The arbitrator is waiting. You go to the labor commissioner, you go to the superior court to say enjoin the arbitration while I go to the labor commissioner.",
  "The labor commissioner does something silly. Can you not then go to superior court and get de novo review of that wrong decision of the labor commissioner before the arbitration starts?",
  "Have you taken that position consistently in this litigation?",
  "You have taken no position on it either way?",
  "Are you telling us that under no circumstance, if you prevail in this case, would you go to the superior court for de novo review and -- and, as part of that, stay the arbitration?",
  "All right. Let's assume the arbitration clause is valid.",
  "Even though in this case you have assumed that that arbitration has to be stayed for the labor commissioner. So the case does not have to be stayed, and you would not ask for it to be stayed, in the superior court?",
  "In this case, the Court of Appeals, the majority said the fact that the losing party will have a right to de novo hearing, involving additional time and money, does not excuse the Defendant from the legal requirement to exhaust his remedy. And I think you're preserving the option to go to the Superior Court, at least the contestability of the arbitration clause.",
  "So that, it seems to me, makes incorrect your statement in your brief that, oh, this is just for eight months, so that there's very little additional time involved because of the de novo hearing.",
  "Don't you think that your statement at page 34 of the brief has to be qualified in that respect?",
  "But you also have the right to challenge what -- the accuracy of the Labor Department's finding. That's what both -- all the judges on the California court agreed with that. So I'm asking, doesn't that make -- require qualification of your statement at page 34 that these procedures are expeditious and informal and do not entail additional expense or delay? All of - -",
  "That does require some qualification there.",
  "All right. Does it also require some qualification in you brief where, at page 12, you say Preston clearly and repeatedly sought to procure employment for Ferrer in the television industry? Our rules say that you cannot raise matters for the first time in this Court. And you have no evidence on that point.",
  "I know you didn't, and that's why I'm questioning why you put it in your brief. Doesn't that require some qualification?",
  "Therefore, don't make factual averments here for the first time.",
  "Do you think, in the briefs to this Court, you can make factual statements that are not in the record?",
  "I think they do say that it is disputed. They do dispute that he clearly and repeatedly sought to procure employment for Ferrer. That's the whole issue in the case.",
  "But they said it is - - they dispute that it is to procure employment.",
  "That seems to me completely inconsistent with your argument that additional time was minimal. And if you have repeated statements in your brief that require qualifications, if in your former argument in Marshal, the Court is concerned with the accuracy of one of your citations, shouldn't we view with some skepticism what you tell us?",
  "But that's always the case. It's always the case that the arbitration is quiet on this. It is -- the Respondent's position is that it is absolutely quiet, but it is also absolutely clear that it is State law.",
  "I'm not sure that Volt would have been different. Volt is -- Volt is written very broadly, it seems to me, in favor of the Respondent's position.",
  "I suppose if we write the case your way, we have to talk about what happens if this Labor Commissioner had enforcement powers, that they had the sua sponte right to invoke, and that they did?",
  "Would you have the same answer if you had a State statute which defined felony drunk driving, as many do, as felony drunk driving which causes serious death or serious physical injury to another?",
  "You would still say that that statute does not qualify?",
  "No, there isn't in the usual felony drunk driving statute, there is - -",
  "Well, the driver intentionally drives the car knowing that there's a risk.",
  "But that -- that is because everybody knows there are -- there are two conditions: One in which he just is reckless and he doesn't care, in which case he has the intent; the other one, he's so drunk he can't form the intent. Both of them are covered, and the latter is simply because we don't want an excuse to exonerate the more culpable of the two.",
  "That's true in almost every State, for the reasons that I've indicated, because many people have the intent, and those that don't shouldn't be exonerated because they're more drunk.",
  "Well, it seems to me that your argument gives us greater reason to treat the last clause as independent just so that we can be sure that it doesn't include only property crimes, because, as the Chief Justice just pointed out, \"physical injury\" is really the term that does the work in the second clause. So it seems to me that you're almost giving us a reason to make that clause more independent, more forceful, more significant.",
  "Filling out a false income tax return. I mean, I thought of one.",
  "Well, there is a whole category of those. So - -",
  "Can you tell me what test, what conclusion, you want me to come to in your argument? Drunk driving is within the last clause because - -",
  "Well, I suppose you say most legislatures think this is dangerous. That's enough?",
  "I'm not trying to be captious, but I -- it's difficult to find out what the standard is.",
  "Well, I'm not so sure. It seems to me that the burglary, arson, extortion, explosives involves at least the stereotype of the armed career criminal that you see in movies and hear about in organized crimes testimony and so forth. I don't -- I don't think it's completely far of the mark.",
  "Obviously -- obviously incomplete.",
  "It would, in the case of drunk driving - though, it seems this would be a better case for the Petitioner if we were operating under this statute.",
  "It's narrower in that sense as applied to this case.",
  "May I ask you this question? If the government were not to prevail in the first case, Rodriguez, should we remand in this case, because -- because then he -- the fourth felony would have been improperly found if we rule against the government in Rodriguez?",
  "Are there any statutes which talk about offender as opposed to \"offense\" in this area, do you know?",
  "It seems to me your argument might be slightly better if the statutory term was \"authorized,\" not \"prescribed.\" I don't say \"prescribed\" could never be used in the sense you mean, but when you have alternates we usually would use the word -- alternate possibilities -- usually you'd use the word \"authorize\" rather than \"prescribe.\" \"Prescribe\" indicates one rule.",
  "I guess what you're saying is that if it's a victimless crime, that the second offense is no more injurious to the State than the first was. I'm not sure that's the case. The fact that the State sees multiple offenders, repeat offenders, in its community means that they have to spend extra resources to prevent -- to incarcerate them because they have a network of distributors, et cetera. They are more experienced, so they are more dangerous to the State.",
  "Well, I'm not sure the offense is the same. I think the injury to the State is compounded by the repetition.",
  "It affects the tone of the community, the number of law enforcement officers we have to have, the cost of reincarceration, rehabilitation, etcetera.",
  "But that's what I'm addressing. It could be more serious when it's the second time.",
  "The offense in and of itself.",
  "No.",
  "I have the same - -",
  "I think this is part of the substance. I thought that as part of one of your answers you said that Ohio is free to allocate part of this capital gains tax to Illinois? Did I hear you say that, because I don't understand that?",
  "I see.",
  "Are you saying this is a passive investment?",
  "I don't like to intrude on the white light, but if I could just ask one question. If the unitary-tax argument has been preserved and is met and if there's a finding that they are unitary, does Illinois have the right to tax the sale, or to -- to a portion of it?",
  "No, no. Assume -- assume it is unitary. Can Illinois then, in your view, have a part of -- tax part of the gain on the sale?",
  "Well, if you did not proceed on the unitary business there, let's take that off the table. It seems to me that Lexis's presence in Illinois is quite irrelevant.",
  "It seems to me that, under your theory, you could tax the sale, even if Lexis were not in Illinois at all, just because Mead is.",
  "And if I can just add on to that same question: If you're going to have the unitary-tax theory, that's -- that's very helpful. But if we take the unitary-tax theory off the table, it seems to me that you are confusing the law by having some midway test. I don't know what your theory is, that -- in relation to this part of Justice Breyer's question.",
  "But Mead didn't receive - - pardon me -- Lexis didn't receive the money for the sale, Mead did.",
  "Unless, again, if Mead's presence or nonpresence is simply irrelevant to what happened here, absent a unitary theory.",
  "Do you think that if there had been a separate corporation and that Lexis was a subsidiary corporation and the subsidiary was -- it was sold, that, again, absent a finding of unitary, Illinois then could have had a tax?",
  "All right. So, then, the asset stock doesn't make any difference?",
  "That gets back to Justice Stevens's initial hypothetical. If you live in New York and you have an investment in a company that does a lot of business in Illinois and you in New York, a resident individual, sell that stock, under your theory Illinois could tax it.",
  "But it seems to me that those factors are wholly irrelevant to the fact of sale. It's just whimsical. It has nothing to do with the sale. The reason we use apportionment in other cases is, just as in Justice Breyer's railroad example, there is no other way to tell, and so forth. But here the presence of Lexis in Illinois is wholly accidental with reference to what went on in the sale.",
  "And that is different - -",
  "But the proration, it seems to me -- that should have nothing to do with the extent of Lexis in Illinois - -",
  "-- nor does it have to do with the extent of Mead in Illinois.",
  "I see your white light is on. I have just one question. Are there cases where some downstream restrictions on use might be necessary to prevent the patent from becoming worthless, i.e., in the biological area for replication of seeds in agriculture and so forth?",
  "I thought Univis was one of your principal cases.",
  "Just so I understand your answer to Justice Alito's question, the Commission has retroactive authority to alter the permission to engage in these contracts only if there is fraud - -",
  "-- or something similar?",
  "Retroactive?",
  "Retroactively?",
  "But Justice Alito's question, I think as I understood it, or at least a question in my mind that followed upon it, was whether or not -- what's the basis for any retroactive revocation of that or - -",
  "Is volatile the same as dysfunctional?",
  "If -- if your theory prevails and you go back to the Commission, does the Morgan Stanley contract, where the lower rate seller was, does that get reevaluated, too? You reevaluate all the contracts back down the line?",
  "Let me say that, consistent with your theory, that everybody -- that this whole unwinding process backs up all the way down to the original seller?",
  "I think you could argue that it should be just the obverse.",
  "Do you mean Patterson would come out the same under 1981 as amended by the 1991 act.",
  "I think Congress would have been quite amazed at that rule.",
  "And Congress changed that and the case we have is also post-formation.",
  "Under your view, would harassment be prohibited by 1981 as amended?",
  "But the term \"harassment\" is not included in 1981(b).",
  "You practice in this - -",
  "-- in this area - -",
  "Perhaps you can maybe just tell me based on your experience: After 1981 was amended, did 1981(b) supersede Title VII in run-of-the-mill termination and harassment cases?",
  "No, no, not retaliation. I mean harassment, discharge, et cetera.",
  "Yes.",
  "Why not? There's a longer statute of limitation. There's no cap on damages.",
  "Well, then I have to refine the hypothetical. I don't want to take too much, but in Federal court - -",
  "-- because it does seem to me that Congress told us: We don't care if there's an overlap between 1981 and Title VII, we don't care if there's a longer statute of limitations, we don't care if there's no cap an damages; we want 1981 to work. And that's -- 1981 does apply in a large number of employment discrimination cases.",
  "And if that's true, then why do we worry about retaliation? If Congress is not concerned about it, why should we be?",
  "Well, you say it's clear, but neither you or the government seems to tell me any words in this statute. Your argument is that we should create a cause of action in order to make this effective. I understand that argument. I think the Court's cases stand against it, and if you want to - - but it seems to me that you're admitting that nothing in the words of the statute as amended help you. And the government -- which as well is an impairment, which I think is quite wrong because that's not what section (c} intended for. But that's almost an admission on the government's part that it can't find any words in section (b) either.",
  "But that was there before -- but that was there as of the time of Patterson.",
  "So then Congress did nothing by the amendment to help your case.",
  "Patterson was not a retaliation case.",
  "Patterson was a discharge and harassment case.",
  "And the words do seem to cover that.",
  "But nothing that you argued so far shows that the words of the statute as amended, that is to say new subsection (b), help your case.",
  "I do not read subsection (c) as giving substantive rights. I mean, you can argue about that. I think you have to talk about (b), and I think you have a valid point when they say that they're extending the protection for the life of the contract. But I still want to know what particular words in section (b) you rely on? \"Benefit\"? \"Privilege\"?",
  "Because it's ironic to say all those cases were wrong when Congress agreed with them and disagreed with Patterson.",
  "But that was true in Sullivan because a property owner who wants to sell is in a particularly advantageous position to enforce the rights of the buyer. It's part of his own contract. And to extend it to the situation we have here is quite an extension of Sullivan in my view.",
  "What I'm -- what I'm taking away from the argument is that if I were to write this opinion in your favor, I would have to say that it's necessary to imply a cause of action prohibiting retaliation in order to make these other words effective. And that seems to me a very limited argument and a very difficult argument for you to prevail upon, given the authorities and the approach of the Court that we've discussed.",
  "I understand that, and - - and there certainly is a cause of action as to all the terms in the contract, but you want to add -- for me to add a new term. You can't use the existing terms to say that there is a cause of action other -- that helps your client, other than that there is a general approach that there is protection post-contract formation. I would have to agree with that; and I don't think you can get out of it impairment.",
  "Now you're making enforcement, as with Patterson.",
  "Now you're just talking about make or enforce and that brings us right back to where we started.",
  "Are you asking us to infer, to find implied in the words a cause of action against retaliation?",
  "What words - -",
  "What words in the statute? And not \"impairment\" because I don't agree with the government on that.",
  "A third reason is that the word isn't in the statute.",
  "Well, that's a benefit, privilege, and term of the contract - -",
  "-- to me fairly obvious to me to include harassment. That was the situation in Patterson. That's what Congress sought to address. Retaliation is something quite different.",
  "Well, then why were you - -",
  "-- talking about impairment in your brief?",
  "Well, of course, and you in your brief bracketed that and just made that equivalent to retaliation. I don't think it is because he was arguing that he didn't -- he was himself injured because he couldn't sell his own property. He has an interest in his own property. And that just isn't true in the standard retaliation case of the type we're discussing.",
  "But a seller is -- or a would-be seller is always a built-in advocate for a buyer if some third person interferes with the contract.",
  "If we take it that you concede -- I don't want to say that you concede. If we take it the government has a strong case under the smuggling statute, wouldn't it have an equally strong case under (i) of the statute that we're considering here, which doesn't require concealing or disguising the nature, just to avoid a transportation reporting requirement. That's the same as the smuggling statute.",
  "I know the government didn't indict under (ii).",
  "You mean as the proceeds of an illegal transaction?",
  "Was there a reporting requirement for -- for this shipment. If he had gone to the border, would he -- well, then, a lot of what you're arguing about isn't very important because they could just indict under (ii).",
  "To avoid a transaction-reporting requirement, and you wouldn't have to go through all this \"nature\" thing.",
  "You indicated that there is such a requirement.",
  "Oh, I see.",
  "Then what you're saying, I suppose, is that the movement of funds, if they're illegal proceeds, outside of the country is a per se concealment?",
  "Give me an example of when you take money outside of the country that's illegal money - -",
  "-- that's not a concealment?",
  "Well then, let me back up. Then let me add this. It seems to me that you're saying, as you have to say, that any movement of illegal funds outside the country which is concealed is per se concealing a relevant attribute?",
  "But if you do.",
  "I think you have to go that far to make the case you're making.",
  "But you're always concealing the control. You're always concealing the ownership. You're always concealing the location if it's in your shoe or in the bottom of the car.",
  "Well, your answer to Justice Scalia's hypothetical is still not clear to me. It -- it seems to me your answer should be yes, because he's concealing the ownership as of the time he goes across the border, which brings me to my earlier question, if once it's concealed, the statute is always -- is always valid. Then you indicated that oh, well, what happens at the destination is very important. Then we had Justice Scalia's hypothetical. I'm not sure where you came out on that.",
  "So Concealment, concealment during the transportation is always a concealment of an attribute under the statute. That has to be your position.",
  "Well, then your only defense is to go across the border and before you go across you put all the money in your arms so the people can see it? That's the way you do it?",
  "Other than that?",
  "But you, in response to one of my hypotheticals, said that it would be relevant in some cases to show that it was designed to create the appearance of legitimate wealth. So you put that back in - -",
  "So you put that back into play.",
  "Suppose the evidence is clear that he knew he was taking it across the border and it was to pay the drug dealer? Would that suffice?",
  "Well, but -- no, no. He conceals it, in order to pay the drug dealer.",
  "Yes.",
  "It's concealing who owns and controls.",
  "You're arguing an unconstitutional condition, in effect.",
  "Leaving aside Buckman, what's your strongest case in support of your position? Besides that it is a new problem.",
  "This -- this tracks somewhat Justice Stevens' question. Do we know in this case, would this have taken two or three days of testimony? Was there discovery? Was it a thousand documents? Or three documents?",
  "The converse of that is that the discovery is exhaustive and quite burdensome. I mean, you're trying to say, well, don't worry; there's thousands of documents here; they won't be submitting anything else. But, on the other hand, that cuts against you when we're talking about the intrusiveness on the Federal scheme because you have to have Federal regulators go back through all of this stuff again.",
  "Your premise still is, is that the drug should not have been marketed, or is that your premise?",
  "I know your purpose is different, but the premise on which you operate is that the drug should not have been sold.",
  "You can back up as long as you want as long as you come forward and answer.",
  "Aren't you going to tell this jury that the drug should not have been on the market?",
  "I thought under the Michigan scheme you don't have to show that. You just show approval, and that's the end of the case in Michigan.",
  "And in your view could a State prohibit introduction of evidence by the defendant that the drug was approved by the FDA?",
  "And all they say in the statute: We just think -- they just think this is irrelevant.",
  "But I don't think that's consistent with your position. There's no doubt about that.",
  "There was special consideration because of military considerations.",
  "Did the Navy have the right to audit the subcontractor's books?",
  "Suppose they audit the subcontractor's books and they don't discover a fraud and leave. Would there be liability then under your view?",
  "The books show that X dollars were spent for certain parts and that was far too much. That was an inflated figure. It fools the government. The government then paid the subcontractor -- pays the contractor; the contractor pays the subcontractor.",
  "Well, you say (a), but we're talking about (a)(2) - -",
  "-- in connection with (c).",
  "But you were quoting from (a)(1).",
  "I know that, but doesn't (a)(2) stand by itself, especially as -- as (c) is written, (c) and (2), (c) and (a)(2) make perfect grammatical sense without any presentation to the government.",
  "But you said given to the government. It's \"paid or approved by the government.\"",
  "Mr. Olson, it seems to me you're fighting a hypothetical. Let's say they built a lousy school, sub-spec. The roof is falling in; the plumbing leaks. It's a fraud, but they've given the money, the feds have given the money to the States and the States have let this slip by. Justice Scalia's point was the Federal Government has been injured.",
  "But the Tanner case didn't confront the statute which has the definition of claims that Justice Breyer is putting to you.",
  "This statute that we're looking at, in effect, defines what a fraud against the government is.",
  "I don't know that that accords with the definition of \"claim\" in (c).",
  "It says the government will reimburse.",
  "But I meant provide. It has provided it already.",
  "So in your own school hypothetical, there's liability.",
  "You mean the captain - -",
  "-- is not a managerial officer for any purpose? Suppose he decides that he's going to leave despite an adverse weather report? Is he not a managerial agent at least for that?",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm asking about the concept of the managerial officer in general. And I think that we can explore in this argument, whether or not The Amiable Nancy held very squarely about punitive damages, whether we ought to do so in the first instance.",
  "And it seems to me a large part of that inquiry turns on what a managerial officer is and what -- was Hazelwood not a managerial officer for any purpose at all?",
  "But I don't think the conductor is on a par with a captain. The captain has this huge vessel. He can decide when it leaves. He decides the course. And I think that \"managerial officer\" might be a divisible concept. Obviously, he doesn't bind Exxon for filing its tax returns or to decide whether there's a deduction. But you are saying he binds Exxon for no purpose at all, ever.",
  "Of course, we are talking about punitive damages but at the concept of a \"managerial officer.\" And I haven't heard why he isn't a managerial officer at least as to some things.",
  "You're talking about tradition. It has never been the tradition for criminal statutes to have open-ended penalties. So that -- that explains why the CWA has specific limits.",
  "Well, perhaps that's a segue to point No. 3. I don't wish to - -",
  "-- to cut you off. On point - -",
  "On point No. 3 - -",
  "My only question is this: Assume that there will be punitive damages applicable to Exxon under maritime law in in case. We have read in the briefs about the limits that should be imposed on these punitive damages. And those are from our due-process cases. If we are deciding this case as a matter of our authority to determine Federal maritime law, are there factors that we should include in a punitive-damages framework that do not -- that do not appear in our due-process cases? And, if so, what are those factors?",
  "And I take it, under that, you would point to the double -- the provision for a fine double the amount of the damages? That would be a factor?",
  "I mean, if we're looking for guidelines - -",
  "-- double general damages is a factor that we could -- that we could follow in the maritime framework?",
  "What would be the formulation of the rule if the Court thinks that any added amount would not deter, and how do we know that? How do you formulate this rule?",
  "Do any of those cases say the managerial agent is liable if he violated express instructions from an employer?",
  "Because that's what the last part of your instruction 33 says. And it does seem to me that this captain may be managerial for some purposes and not others. I think that's the way it's going to have to come out. Maybe not. But certainly he was not entitled to set aside the policy of Exxon that you cannot navigate a vessel while intoxicated.",
  "But they have not conceded the accuracy or correctness of instruction 33. And that's because he was not entitled to set aside the policy on intoxication.",
  "No. Your instruction says if he was a managerial agent, his acts are attributable to the corporation. That's it.",
  "So the corporation's responsibility or complicity or culpability is simply not relevant under your theory of the case, even though that's what you talk about in your brief.",
  "So in your theory of the case, instruction 33, if the superior had told Hazelwood don't pilot the ship today, Exxon would still be liable? That's your theory of the case under instruction 33?",
  "Or the last part of the instruction 36, I think.",
  "Well, but that -- that goes to measures, not to liability.",
  "That was the first phase. And that's the instruction, it seems to me, that you have to explain.",
  "Correct me if I'm wrong. You've read the case -- our case in Cooper, which says that the appellate court has to examine de novo to determine the adequacy or the excessiveness of the award to deter.",
  "Well, then, a fortiori, it gives us the right and the duty to do so as -- sitting as a common-law-type court.",
  "But the -- the United States Code, the general criminal code, 18 U.S.C. 3571, has exactly that number. It's -- for -- it's double the pecuniary loss for a criminal act. And it seems to me, if when we're looking for guidance, as Justice Souter quite properly indicated we must, and Justice Scalia has indicated with reference to the Water Act, that this is -- gives us a very valuable instruction.",
  "But isn't the measure what is necessary to deter? Isn't that what we've asked first and foremost, not exclusively perhaps?",
  "I just didn't hear you. You said that this dispute should be settled by - -",
  "Well, it gets way ahead of the analysis and probably way ahead of your argument. At some point I'd like you to address whether or not one of the equities the Court can consider is the likelihood of an earlier decision. Let's assume we project out another 10 years. Does that make a difference? That may come toward the end of your argument rather than now, but I'd like it addressed at some point.",
  "Could you address that? That is the issue. Sovereign immunity, is this a question of where a party is just entitled to plead inconsistent theories? Was this a special appearance? Why is it that the Philippines can come into court and say, \"we have sovereign immunity, and therefore the suit must be dismissed\"? Would you just address that basic point?",
  "But suppose a case -- and you have to do a lot of supposing. Suppose that the Philippine Government was simply not amenable to the process of the court, not because of foreign immunity, but just because it was outside the geographic area where process ran. It just can't be made a party. Exactly the same analysis as here?",
  "I understand, but in my hypothetical case it's just as if somebody is at the North Pole and you can't serve them.",
  "Well, the difference in the redo is that in the second case that's just been hypothesized, the Philippine government is represented. We are making these assumptions, and the Philippines government says: You can make these assumptions, but they may very well be wrong; we want to be represented before you make those assumptions.",
  "Any party that's beyond the process of the court has a right to come in. The question is what happens if they are not there.",
  "In making that balancing, what weight did they give to the sovereign immunity of the Philippines?",
  "But what we're looking for here, at least one of the things we might look for in this case, is a specific rule to give to the States so the State knows when counsel has to be appointed. In this case suppose the magistrate, the man behind the little window, said: We're going to give you a ticket; keep in touch with us; don't change your address until you notify us; you're free on your own recognizance. Would counsel have been required there?",
  "How is that different from a traffic ticket?",
  "So it's the warrant that makes the difference?",
  "-- that a magistrate is required whenever bail is set -- pardon me, that an attorney is required whenever bail is set?",
  "The rule is -- I want to know, what do we tell Texas it has to do in all these cases? What do we tell jurisdictions that have to deal with traffic tickets? Does it make a difference that you're held in custody or not held in custody? I don't understand the rule you want us to adopt.",
  "Well, what about my traffic ticket?",
  "I've never had one so I don't know what they say.",
  "Other members of the Court can advise me about that.",
  "I know -- when we were talking about traffic tickets, you said, well, that was a warrantless arrest. This was a warrantless arrest.",
  "And then --",
  "Then how could they hold them in jail?",
  "He was held after he saw the magistrate. Suppose he had been held for three months and you couldn't make bail, we don't need counsel?",
  "I am asking what the constitutional rule is.",
  "We have here a proceeding before a magistrate; this results in custody. And my question is, suppose this were weeks, would counsel be required to be appointed?",
  "If we said that when a defendant is ordered held in custody, that there is then a right of counsel, would we be contradicting any of our precedents as opposed, say, to extending them?",
  "Well -- no. But my assumption was assuming that the defendant is remanded to custody. I added that.",
  "Can you give me -- can you give me some idea, or some empirical assessment, or tell me where I could go to find out, as we sit here, how many people are being held in custody after a probable-cause determination and do not have counsel appointed for them and do not have the right to have counsel appointed to them until some other critical phase takes place?",
  "So then there was just a misapplication of the statute here when this man was held for three days, and then he requested counsel?",
  "Well, I'm talking about the first phase before there was an indictment, just the probable-cause phase. You say even then there is -- under this Texas statute there is a right to have counsel in one day?",
  "It seems to me that our precedents do say, Gerstein versus Pugh, that the probable-cause hearing is not an adversary proceeding where counsel is required; and if we are going to give you relief, we have to go beyond what Gerstein says.",
  "One of the concerns, Mr. Dellinger, of the framers, was not to establish a practice of amending the Constitution and its important provisions, and it seems to me that there is an interpretation of the Second Amendment differing from that of the district court and in Miller and not advanced particularly in the red brief, but that conforms the two clauses and in effect delinks them. The first clause I submit can be read consistently with the purpose I've indicated of simply reaffirming the existence and the importance of the militia clause. Those were very important clauses. As you've indicated, they're in Article I and Article II. And so in effect the amendment says we reaffirm the right to have a militia, we've established it, but in addition, there is a right to bear arms. Can you comment on that?",
  "And this makes, it does - - I think you're write right in the brief to say that the preface shouldn't be extraneous. This means it's not extraneous. The Constitution reaffirms the rights, reaffirm several principles: The right of the people to peaceably assemble, the right to be secure in their homes, the Tenth Amendment reaffirms the rights, and this is simply a reaffirmation of the militia clause.",
  "Well the subject is \"arms\" in both clauses, as I've suggested is the common subject, and they're closely related.",
  "Well, do you think the clause, the second clause, the operative clause, is related to something other than the militia?",
  "All right. Well, then - -",
  "It had nothing to do with the concern of the remote settler to defend himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes and outlaws, wolves and bears and grizzlies and things like that?",
  "But the Second -- the Second Amendment doesn't repeal that. You don't take the position that Congress no longer has the power to organize, arm, and discipline the militia, do you?",
  "So it was supplementing it. And my question is, the question before us, is how and to what extent did it supplement it. And in my view it supplemented it by saying there's a general right to bear arms quite without reference to the militia either way.",
  "Well, there's no question that the English struggled with how to work this. You couldn't conceal a gun and you also couldn't carry it, but yet you had a right to have it. Let me ask you this: Do you think the Second Amendment is more restrictive or more expansive of the right than the English Bill of Rights in 1689?",
  "I think that would be more restrictive.",
  "The purposes of what?",
  "You said there is no showing that rifles and handguns. I think you meant rifles and other guns.",
  "Is necessary for the purpose of what? What is the purpose?",
  "If I could just have one follow-on on Justice Ginsburg real quick. Do those States -- Justice Ginsburg asked -- - that distinguish among weapons, State constitutional provisions do not do so?",
  "Because I did interrupt Justice Breyer.",
  "So in your view this amendment has nothing to do with the right of people living in the wilderness to protect themselves, despite maybe an attempt by the Federal Government, which is what the Second Amendment applies to, to take away their weapons?",
  "I agree that Miller is consistent with what you've just said, but it seems to me Miller, which kind of ends abruptly as an opinion writing anyway, is just insufficient to subscribe -- to describe the interests that must have been foremost in the framers' minds when they were concerned about guns being taken away from the people who needed them for their defense.",
  "You think Madison was guided by the experience and the expressions of the right in English law, including the Bill of Rights of 1689?",
  "Or would you say like protecting yourself against intruders in the home?",
  "Could it also be simply to reaffirm that the provisions in the main text of the Constitution remain intact?",
  "But you were about to tell us before the course of the questioning began about the other purposes that the amendment served. I'm -- I want to know whether or not, in your view, the operative clause of the amendment protects, or was designed to protect in an earlier time, the settler in the wilderness and his right to have a gun against some conceivable Federal enactment which would prohibit him from having any guns?",
  "That are not appropriate to - -",
  "It seems to me that Miller, as we're discussing it now, and the whole idea that the militia clause has a major effect in interpreting the operative clause is both overinclusive and underinclusive. I would have to agree with Justice Ginsburg that a machine gun is probably more related to the militia now than a pistol is. But that -- that seems to me to be allowing the militia clause to make no sense out of the operative clause in present-day circumstances.",
  "My point is: Why is that of any real relevance to the situation that faces the homeowner today?",
  "Well, you're being faithful to Miller. I suggest that Miller may be deficient.",
  "But Just to be clear - - and I don't want to misstate your position, but my understanding, I at least inferred that you would consider it reasonable to ban shipment of machine guns and sawed-off shotguns in interstate commerce?",
  "I -- at least to me the question is, what would be the constitutional basis for insisting on Justice Scalia's suggestion that you need a number of guns? You have argued, it seems to me, that the District or a government could prohibit just what he said, unless you needed one to take to the militia.",
  "I'm asking about the constitutional standard you apply to a hypothetical statute which would prohibit the guns Justice Scalia described. What is your position as to the validity of such a hypothetical law?",
  "You began -- and it's not just because of my notepad but because I'm interested - - you told Justice Ginsburg there are two reasons - -",
  "-- why the government's cap is wrong. And I'm not even sure you finished the first one. What are the two reasons?",
  "Assume that our decision will in part drive the market either way, what we do will effect the way paralegals are used, the way billing is done. If that is true, is there some utility in simply following the EAJA so we give a consistent signal to the market and then if Congress wants to change it, it can? I mean - -",
  "Rather than follow EAJA, I mean follow 1988, follow Jenkins. Follow Jenkins.",
  "Are there some disutilities from an economic standpoint in having two structures: Jenkins for one kind of cases, EAJA in the other cases as the government wants?",
  "Are there some disadvantages to the system?",
  "It seems to me the question is a valid one, that you're running away from the question.",
  "And I'll let you answer. It suggests this further inquiry. Suppose that a solo practitioner knows that a paralegal in another firm is very good at this and he asks the other lawyer, may I use your paralegal, and he just sends that lawyer the bill. What -- how would that be billed under your view?",
  "They both -- they both apply, they both apply to outside experts.",
  "But again, you're not answering the hypothetical. Let's assume two cases: Case A, you hire an outside paralegal at $85 an hour. He is outside, he is independent. He is just like the expert engineer in the Chief Justice question, $85 an hour. Case two, it's your own paralegal. The prevailing rate for which you charge general clients is $85 an hour. Why should there be a difference?",
  "But under your -- they can't even charge $85 an hour.",
  "Let me just be clear. The statute with reference to State contractors, which is the $50,000 statute, and the statute with reference to private employers, which is the $10,000 statute, in all of those cases, the law is applicable only if the money is paid before all the work is done?",
  "But on that point you're in disagreement with the Ninth Circuit, and - -",
  "So the principal rationale for the Ninth Circuit's opinion is incorrect in your view?",
  "Is it time-honored since Granderson? Is that the first time we did it?",
  "As to sentences? As to sentences?",
  "-- better example. It doesn't quite work because it does not supersede the term \"debtor\" that was used earlier. In the government's submission at least in this case, \"felony drug offense\" supersedes the earlier provision in section 13.",
  "So it seems to me they're not comparable in that sense.",
  "Can you tell me what happened in South Carolina? Could he on those facts and under the charges have been sentenced to more than a year? It was just that the judge gave him less than a year?",
  "But he, himself, was eligible for the - -",
  "Could you tell us just a little bit about the rule of lenity? You want us to apply sort of a watered down discount rule of lenity in sentencing cases? And do you have authority for that?",
  "After we said in Granderson the rule of lenity applies without qualifying or modifying it at all.",
  "Well, but there has to be a real ambiguity. I mean, if there is a plausible defendant-friendly interpretation, that doesn't trigger the rule of lenity, does it or doesn't it?",
  "That was in a context where the question was whether or not the conduct was criminal at all not since.",
  "If you apply clear statement rule to the sentencing code, I don't think we are going to be able to get beyond the second sentence.",
  "Do you know, what happened before the Tucker Act with inverse condemnation claims? The government violates the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment Takings Clause applied to the Fifth by inverse condemnation, and there is no Tucker Act. Was there a constitutional cause of action for damages?",
  "Were there any other cases where they said, well, it's not in the stream of commerce yet, and there was an intermediate broker, or anything like that? Are there any complexities like that?",
  "But in none of these cases did they have those sorts of problems?",
  "Here there was a payment. Here there was a payment.",
  "It's different than if you try to enjoin the collection at the outset.",
  "So that argument doesn't work.",
  "Well, but if we -- if we accept your view in this case, they can go in a district court and enjoin them. It's not a tax. The Tax Injunction Act doesn't apply.",
  "And -- which is just what Justice Ginsburg's questions point out. And earlier I had indicated that in this case they did pay the tax.",
  "So it seems to me there is a distinction. It may be that you would prevail in your argument.",
  "If they tried -- if they tried -- do you think they could enjoin the collection of a tax refund?",
  "But, I mean, in your argument you say it is absolutely -- that it doesn't apply. Just get an injunction.",
  "Well, then we'll invent the hypothetical company that is going to go broke and all that stuff.",
  "But you can't have it both ways. You're saying it isn't a tax for your purposes, and then in my hypothetical case you say you have to go through the tax law.",
  "And the same with your answer, what I thought was your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question.",
  "Is the interest the same in amount in either case?",
  "If the respondent prevails in this case and you have a case similar to this one that begins in the trial court, how do you think it would work, that the plaintiffs in the trial court action have to get preclearance either way? They have to get preclearance in the event that they prevail? And then the other side has to get preclearance in the event that it doesn't. I mean, is that the way it would work in your view?",
  "If I'm in State trial court, how can I make a ruling if -- assuming the respondents win in this case, if I know there has to be preclearance?",
  "I suppose States get - - State courts get preclearance all the time with district changes, don't they? Or how does it work? They just hold the judgment in abeyance until there is preclearance, and couldn't -- and if so, couldn't do you that here?",
  "But you said in answer to Justice Souter that this is your case. There is no law that's precleared.",
  "Even in the hypothetical Justice Souter proposes, I don't know the rules in Alabama, but I can see a Federal court saying: Well, this is premature; it hasn't been precleared; why should I pass on the validity of something that might not be precleared?",
  "How does that apply to a State statute which is fully enacted and then there's going to be a challenge?",
  "Well, I take it it's your position -- and I noticed this in the question put to you by Justice Breyer -- tell me if this is wrong, but that it's not just the fact that the court makes a decision, because the court may have discretion to choose plan one, plan two, plan three, but it is if the court makes a decision to show that the prior practice was invalid, was void under State law.",
  "That's the distinction, I take it.",
  "Not the fact that it's just the court, but the kind of decision the court makes.",
  "But suppose they didn't have that footnote. Suppose they said: We hold it void ab initio. Then, what's your answer to Justice Scalia's question?",
  "I'm not sure that in those cases you had what you had here, which was a declaration, let's assume, of invalidity ab initio. Let me give you this hypothetical. A county council goes to the board of commissioners or the board of supervisors of the local county or legislative branch and says: The legislature has just adjourned; it passed a lot of laws, and one of the laws it passed is that that you now have to set the qualifications locally for certain officials, so we have to act on this right away. They pass the legislation. Three weeks go by. The county council says: You know, I made a mistake; that law was never passed; it was never signed by the governor. What rule? What result?",
  "Well, suppose it had been precleared?",
  "That's not just an implication. That's your whole theory.",
  "But habeas corpus is concerned with the safety of the prisoner to the extent that it's controlled by our authorities. And if you're in the United States, could an officer release a prisoner knowing that a lynch mob was outside? I should think not.",
  "Of course, this is just a hypothetical question.",
  "Of course.",
  "But I really wanted to get your answer to Justice Stevens's first question straight. You think citizenship is not relevant?",
  "But I thought you were not basing your case on the citizenship?",
  "I might have - -",
  "Well, why didn't you answer Justice Breyer -- and we've interrupted you a couple of times. You have the box. He's going to be released. They want him. I don't see then why you didn't answer Justice Breyer's question differently.",
  "Well, what we're doing - -",
  "What we're doing is we're testing the authority and the propriety of the district judge to proceed.",
  "And that's why we are asking if, at the end of the day, the order is a release, is there a problem? And I should think you'd yes.",
  "It seems to me that you're begging -- you're begging a question -- you're inserting a premise that we have to decide, whether the release is unlawful. We're asking, that's part of the equation. I'm the district judge. Can I say, I've looked at all this, I want this prisoner released tomorrow morning; and if the Iraqis pick him up, fine with me? Can I say that?",
  "But it seems to me your statement is wildly overbroad: That there is a due-process restriction on release by the United States Government to another sovereign?",
  "If we have an undercover agent in Japan who finds a drug dealer, he gives him to the Japanese police.",
  "I don't understand that. That's a sweeping statement. That just can't be right.",
  "But you've just said that it's unlawful. You said that an American law enforcement officer working in another country who takes custody of a wanted criminal cannot turn him over to the government of that country. That's just got to be wrong.",
  "I guess what's troubling me, Mr. Attorney General, is that it -- it does seem to me fair enough to make that charge in this case; but then we -- but then we have the tremendous number of cases where the prosecutor is going to be in the position in a plea-bargain context, say, to threaten to charge this offense with a heavy mandatory minimum. My understanding is that district judges do not and cannot be involved in plea bargain negotiations; they can look at a plea before it is entered. What can you tell us about the safeguards that might exist in the system generally against -­ against overcharging, against charging for something where the result is close to absurd, as in some of these hypotheticals about the income tax return and the gasoline and so forth?",
  "And I suppose if you thought there was a problem, you could promulgate them out of your department.",
  "I take it that one of the reasons you make your argument is so that if you prevail and you go back to trial, you would argue that this is not in relation to? Is that correct?",
  "If you prevail in this case and we say \"in relation to\" is part of the statute --",
  "-- and then you go back to the trial court, I assume you will argue to the jury that the government can't show that it's in relation to.",
  "That's right.",
  "But it seems to me that in a prosecution, in this prosecution, it might be somewhat difficult to establish in relation to.",
  "And that would be -- even assuming the jury was properly instructed, et cetera, et cetera.",
  "All right, but doesn't that show the necessity for the very interpretation the attorney general has argued for here? It is just too difficult to establish and very dangerous?",
  "You think on this evidence, on this record, that a jury, if it were instructed to -- that it had to find \"in relation to\" could return a conviction of guilty including the \"in relation to\"?",
  "If this case had been instructed according to your theory of the statute and on this record and on this evidence, could a jury find your client guilty?",
  "That's exactly why the attorney general says he needs it.",
  "As you understand the Respondent's position -- and perhaps the question is better addressed to the Respondent. But as you understand their position, would they accept Justice Scalia's formulation of what the rule ought to be or the formulation that his question proposed?",
  "Do you think -- there is always a concern in these cases whether or not we're going to be creating more inefficiencies for the judicial system; that is to say, the trial judge was incorrect in ruling that the trial was becoming a farce. I suppose you've weighed that cost against the benefits of the rule. And what are the benefits of the rule, that the trial is quicker, that the appeal is clearer?",
  "But I assume if there is error it would be structural error - -",
  "There would be no room for harmless error analysis.",
  "But in either case, there's a farce.",
  "A very rational highly competent person might want to make the trial a farce. Why should that case be any different than where the person does so because he's incompetent?",
  "The State's interests are the same. If the highly competent person deliberately wants to make a shambles out of the proceeding, the State's interests are the same. Now, there are certain options available. They can exclude him from the courtroom or something, but - -",
  "Could we have a rule that even if you are highly competent, if you make the trial into a farce, you forfeit your Faretta right?",
  "And these were communications made to the judge before the trial started?",
  "Well, you've presumed in your answer to Justice Breyer -- I don't know if you fully answered all of the questions he raised -- that this defendant would immediately obey the objection. That doesn't happen.",
  "They don't communicate. It's two ships passing in the night or in the case of some defendants about five ships passing in the night.",
  "So -- so you're presuming something that that's -- that's just inconsistent with the reality. And you answered Justice Alito's question to say well, it's a legal matter; if it's a medical matter I don't comment. But it's a practical matter; it's a commonsense matter. We know what goes on, and what goes on is very costly to the State and to the fairness of the trial.",
  "Well, you've got a record in open court here.",
  "Well, Allen was a disruptive conduct case, where he was yelling and he was put out of the court. That's quite different from a defendant who pretends to comply with the order of the court and then repeatedly takes everything off track time after time. That was not Allen and I don't think you can cite Allen for the problem that most of these cases present.",
  "Well, there's a difference between disrespectful and disruptive. And the Allen case was disruptive. I mean, he was shouting, he was yelling. Everything had to stop. That just doesn't apply to the case we have here. It's inapplicable.",
  "Did the trial judge in this case cite the findings and the observations he made during the competency hearing in open court as -- for the support of the ruling?",
  "What about the competency hearing that was held in open court with the defendant?",
  "Of course, one way to control these defendants is to say: Mr. Defendant, if you persist in this irrelevant line of inquiry, the court is going to consider whether or not you are competent under the Indiana standard to conduct your self-defense. That would get his attention.",
  "Well, now you're falling back on the very psychiatric evaluation in the first part of the trial that you disparage in the second.",
  "I still don't know your \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. Do you say he should have been found incompetent or that he should have been competent based on your present assessment of the record?",
  "Was he competent to stand trial, in your view as you now understand this record?",
  "There are all kinds of nuts who could get 90 percent on the bar exam.",
  "I take it standard competency principles laid down by this Court require that the defendant be present and that he testify if requested. And the trial judge must question that defendant when competency comes up in the presence of the court.",
  "Are there also instances -- and, again, I'm interested in Justice Breyer's question and Justice Stevens's question, the practical reasons that might have prompted the statute to be drawn in the way that you say it's been drawn. Are there also instances where a transaction goes through and is later unwound, is later set aside? So that the tax has to be refunded?",
  "I guess your point is that, as a whole, the virtue of the stamp tax is that it is virtually automatic on recording, and you don't have to send out notices, and so forth.",
  "The whole point of the stamp tax.",
  "I had one question as to operation of the tax in Florida. Suppose a transaction -- there's no bankruptcy. A transaction is completed. Stamps are paid. There is then a suit to rescind the transaction on the ground of fraud or mistake. Do you get your money back from the stamp tax?",
  "I can understand -- just taking a quick look at 365(g), why it serves a different purpose and a different function. But the Respondent's point was, you have to interpret \"under\" differently under your view, under 365, than under the statute at issue. Do you agree with that?",
  "Suppose in a tortious interference case, the two tort -- there are two tort feasors, and they communicate with each other by mail. Is that a violation of the mail fraud statute?",
  "In my -- in my hypothetical, there was no -- there was no reliance on anything said. It was just used to facilitate the scheme. And I assume the plaintiff could recover.",
  "But without the mail fraud violation -- let's assume -- the tort would have been unsuccessful. It would not have been complete.",
  "Yes. Yes. Let's assume that. And it was directed at this class of persons and it was relied upon by the county. It seems to me that that's certainly sufficient under the -- it's a mail fraud violation.",
  "I mean, refer to the mail -- the civil RICO refers to whether it's a mail fraud violation. You want to assume this additional reliance requirement.",
  "Is -- is it your view that assume -- assuming there is a State law cause of action for tortuous interference, that if that tortious interference was effected through the use of the mails by the co-tort features, that that automatically invokes the RICO statute?",
  "That -- that there are predicate acts, yes.",
  "Is it the law generally in the States that an unsuccessful bidder can sue the successful bidder if the successful bidder misstated qualification?",
  "Can you incorporate under tribal law.",
  "Do you think it's inherent in Montana exception number 1, that an Indian tribal court in the course of adjudicating commercial dealings has the capacity to elaborate common law?",
  "Tribal common law?",
  "And you think that's necessary for regulating consensual relationships?",
  "Well, and I suppose - -",
  "Well, suppose it were the first occasion? I mean, what's the rule? That doesn't help me.",
  "In other words, if you go -- if you make a mistake 14 times, you're bound to 15? That's kind of an estoppel.",
  "In your view, does jurisdiction follow all regulatory authority? If it's within regulatory authority, then is it your position that there is necessarily jurisdiction to enforce in a tribal court - -",
  "-- in civil cases?",
  "In your position, is regulatory jurisdiction concomitant with civil judicial jurisdiction in the tribal court?",
  "What general principle underscores the validity of your point that it's -- is it a republican form of government law, Due Process Clause? What is the general principle you rely on to say we have to look to the structure of these courts? If the structure is insufficient, then it violates what prohibition in the Constitution?",
  "Due process for whom? The tribal courts aren't governed -- aren't creatures that are subject to the Due Process Clause.",
  "What is -- what is the constitutional prohibition that is a restriction on assigning cases to a court that does not follow the Due Process Clause if it's an Indian court? It's not the same as if we assign this to the American Arbitration Association. What's the difference?",
  "May I ask you this question about the rule: It says before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure. Can a pre-sentence report say possible grounds for departure are as follows, and then list them? Or does this, in your view, mean that \"identified for departure\" means as recommended by the pre-sentencing report?",
  "Well, could the pre-sentencing report just list a series of -- a whole series of factors saying these are possible grounds for departure? Would that comply with the rule?",
  "Would future dangerousness -- future dangerousness be something that could be put in the report and that would cover these - -",
  "That's the latest thing we're talking about very much.",
  "That is an abuse of discretion standardized?",
  "Unworkable or is there just as many impracticalities as the rule.",
  "And it would also, I take it, be circumventing what could happen in the district court. You have to move very -- seven days in the district court for mathematical error, and that's it.",
  "Other than for assistance - -",
  "Perhaps that's after a new trial.",
  "What happens if it's - - what happens if the sentence is five years, reversed on appeal, error in evidence, same -- same offense, same indictment? Then you have to comply with the vindictiveness rules before he can give a higher sentence?",
  "What do you think is the rule if there's a new trial and the judge says, you know, what about this, I heard the evidence again; I think I'm going to increase the sentence?",
  "But what's sua sponte - -",
  "It's a resentence. There's a new judgment, a new conviction. What happens then?",
  "Well, actually rule 35 was changed because it used to be based on the mandate. But now rule 35 says you can reopen within seven days after the verdict or finding of guilty. So that would indicate under the rules that the mandate is irrelevant.",
  "Within the scope of the appeal, which brings us right back to this case.",
  "I don't know about your initial premise. I -- I take it the policy here is that the defendant who appeals ought to know what's at stake in the appeal. He shouldn't be surprised.",
  "If he cross-appeals, fine; if he doesn't cross-appeal, he knows what the stakes are.",
  "But now you're saying that if the sentence is -- is vacated, they can start all over? That the district court can't start all over if it's still in the district court. Why should the court of appeals have any more authority than the district court does?",
  "Well, if this were to be a more frequent occurrence, i.e., plain errors, then we were to rule for you and court of appeals generally would do this, then a defendant might think twice about appealing in a complex case.",
  "Because there's nothing that could happen -- once the district court rules and the seven days for error goes by, there's nothing that anybody can do to raise it.",
  "What about treason? What about treason? Even the countries of Europe which have joined the European Convention on Human Rights, I believe they make an exception to the prohibition of the death penalty for treason. You can slaughter your fellow citizens, but if you offend the State you can be put to death. Is treason an exception from the -- our ban on the death penalty except for murder?",
  "Mr. Fisher, your white light is on, and you do want to protect your rebuttal right, but you began by indicating that this statute could be narrowed. It could be narrowed by a requirement of recidivist behavior. Are there any other narrowing categories?",
  "What would they be?",
  "Both -- both sides have something of a dilemma with Coker, because if you say that it does not control this case, then the consensus or the lack of consensus -- or the consensus is more reliable. If you say it does control this case, then the consensus is not so reliable; and both sides have that duality that they have to confront.",
  "But there was some indication that in most cases the prosecutors, in part to see if they can get a plea bargain, begin by saying they're going to charge with the death penalty. And I'd like you to comment on prosecutorial discretion. Again, it cuts to weight. In one sense, it's -- it's a check, so that only the most egregious cases are covered. On the other hand, there's a temptation to overreach, and it's an argument that Petitioners make for saying that the death penalty should not apply.",
  "If you were asked to draft this statute that we have here and you have just the definition of the first statute with the -- what we call aggravated kind of -- and you have the age limit, would any other limiting categories occur to you as being inconsistent with sound statutory drafting and sound policy?",
  "And that's prior conviction - -",
  "-- not prior offenses?",
  "Is that in front of us here?",
  "This is not a speech case where you have standing to object to the statute that can -- would be unconstitutional as applied to others - -",
  "Or is -- contradicts.",
  "If this case had been one in which were notice, before the suit was filed -- or at the outset of the suit, and some encouragement to go ahead with the suit, would that have fit your, I guess, second category of adequate representation, adequate opportunity to have your -- a case heard?",
  "Yes.",
  "From a fair - -",
  "And that is because?",
  "But why doesn't that fit at least the semantic version of the category you gave us?",
  "Your list of factors is cumulative? They are not independent categories? Your category number 2 then is not a stand-alone category for barring -- for barring the second plaintiff?",
  "But -- but that's not what -- that's not what your second category was. I understand privity, but you didn't -- you weren't just trying to restate the concept of privity in your second category, were you?",
  "Yes.",
  "Right. Otherwise you would have just said privity.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I guess you begin with the proposition that the government must always have a reason for what it does?",
  "So you have a national for-clause employment system. You can only be hired for cause -- fired for cause.",
  "But you're getting back to the point the government must always have a reason for what it does. Can you cite me a case that says that?",
  "Must always have a reason for the actions it takes.",
  "Yes, those are all tax cases, or in Olech, 30 feet as opposed to 15 feet, where there was a clear difference that was not -- but there was also an allegation of an invidious motive.",
  "It's just hard for me to get that sweeping provision out of Olech.",
  "Do you think Olech was wrongly decided?",
  "I don't find anything in Olech that says that every action that does not have a reason is constitutionally infirm.",
  "Do you think Olech was correctly decided?",
  "And public employment is different just because it's going to be a big problem? What --",
  "Well, but we're presuming that there is an objective reason for promoting or retaining -- the person has a college degree and so forth -- but that that person is rejected anyway because of dislike.",
  "That's the hypothetical. Why is that hypothetical case different than Olech?",
  "But then we say that there is a subset of unusual cases where we will allow the cause of action?",
  "I'm having trouble hearing both the question and the answer.",
  "But we are concerned about the case -- let's just assume, just take it as a hypothetical case -- where there is an arbitrary and vindictive reason for hiring the employee and it has nothing to do with race, sex, or other recognized suspect or improper categories. And I thought your answer to me was, well, I might make an exception to that.",
  "It seems to me that you want us to write an opinion that says there are some instances where the government can act arbitrarily and unreasonably.",
  "And that's because of existence of other avenues of redress.",
  "I understood that the argument --",
  "But what authority do you have for us to parse different governmental actions and say some are subject to the Equal Protection Clause and some are not?",
  "Other than the convenience of the government -- it might be more efficient for the government -- you want us to say that the government can act arbitrarily with respect to employees?",
  "But a public employee applies for a 30-foot easement that he is entitled to, and doesn't receive it; and the mayor says and by the way I don't like you, so you're fired: A, you don't get the easement, B, you're fired. Why -- why do we treat the cases differently? Other than the floodgate argument etcetera?",
  "But that just states your conclusion. I want to know why this is.",
  "So we should cite there is no constitutional right to be a policeman? We can revise that?",
  "I'd like to ask about the provisions of the statute which allow the candidate who doesn't have the personal funds -- what was the name of the challenger in this case? Not Davis -- Reynolds?",
  "Reynolds -- - to receive, is it, unlimited contributions from his own party?",
  "Yes.",
  "Suppose you had a statute which either explicitly said or has the effect, as this does, that the less wealthy challenger, the challenger in Reynolds' position, has more access and more support from his party than the challenger does from his party? What is your best case that indicates that that is unconstitutional, and what is your argument that that is unconstitutional?",
  "That concerns me in this. What is your best argument that differential treatment of the candidates vis-a-vis support from their respective parties is unconstitutional?",
  "The statute makes that distinction.",
  "And it seems to me that that distinction is somewhat questionable, and I'm asking you for your best statement of the theory as to why it's unconstitutional and your best case to show that it's unconstitutional.",
  "But you make that argument to the statute generally. Is there any more specific argument that you can make in the context of the less well-funded candidate having more support from the party than the well-funded candidate had?",
  "It seems to me that that's a particular vice of the statute, and I want to know if there is a formulation that's more precise than the general attack that you made -- that you make.",
  "But the party for the less well-funded candidate has the option to have much closer ties, much greater involvement, than the party for the other candidate; and that seems to me highly problematic. And I want to know the best case that you have for that proposition and the best statement of law that can you give me for why that is unconstitutional.",
  "And he cannot have the support from his party that the opponent can have from the opponent's party.",
  "Not the same level of support.",
  "And is party support sometimes important in an election?",
  "Does anything in Colorado indicate that there can be a differential between the party support given to one candidate and the party support given to the other?",
  "It's not just money. It's not just money. It's the quality and kind of speech. You're saying, the government is saying, the statute says, that the underfunded candidate has less access to coordinated expenditures with the party than -- than the other party -- than the other candidate. And the cases have acknowledge, the statute acknowledges, that coordinated expenditures have a particularly potent force, and you are saying candidates are treated differently in the access to this kind of speech. And I know of no precedent of this Court that says one party is entitled to assistance from a certain segment and another party is not, based on the -- the content of the speech. And that's exactly what this is.",
  "But it's in the statute and it's part of the challenge. I agree that it's been given a relatively minor position, but it's of great concern to me because it puts this Court, it puts this statute, in the position of preferring one kind of speech over another. And we simply do not do that.",
  "Are you saying that argument is not properly before us when we are judging the validity of the statute that's been challenged?",
  "But the provisions --",
  "The provisions of the law which prefers one candidate over the other with respect to coordinated expenditures has an impact on campaign strategy.",
  "Mr. Solicitor General, you're defending this statute on its face, I take it.",
  "And it seems to me that this is a facial invalidity of substantial proportions.",
  "Do you want us to write an opinion which says that independently wealthy candidates generally have different sorts of views than other people?",
  "But we are not -- well, but we are talking about the door -- the door opening here at trial. Did he give notice that he was going to testify in California? Do they have some rule that if you're going to testify, you have to give notice?",
  "That tends to diminish somewhat, but not entirely, your, I think, quite proper response that this came in on direct not -- not cross.",
  "Well, of course -- of course, that's true. That is the reason for the confrontation -- confrontation rule. But it does seem to me that this is responsive to his defense; and you say, well, it's his state of mind, and her testimony was general. I think it does go to his state of mind.",
  "But we are talking here about the definition or the contours of the equitable rule, the forfeiture rule, for confrontation. And I think perhaps what Justice Ginsburg was suggesting, and certainly what I was suggesting, is that when we are looking at whether or not there is a forfeiture, we are talking about equitable considerations. Now, it's true in this case we are presented with an instance that I've never seen, which is that the murder itself makes the declarant unavailable for purposes of the equitable exception. And it is true that that goes much further than the common law did.",
  "Well, but I think what Justice Breyer is saying --",
  "But I think what Justice Breyer's line of questioning points out is that there were other provisions of the evidence rule followed in England which would not allow the testimony to come in, in the first place. In this case, we wouldn't even have the issue before us if the testimony were not admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. It is admissible. Then we have to ask if it conforms with the Confrontation Clause, which is the issue we have. But because of the restrictions he points to, there was never the occasion for the common law to explore the boundaries of the forfeiture exception in the confrontation context.",
  "Let's -- let's assume that the only case on the books pre-1789 was Morley, in which the defendant did specifically intend to keep the witness away from the trial. But let's assume, contrary to fact, that the Morley case gave a -- a very sweeping, expansive definition of the equitable forfeiture rule and said the defendant cannot profit by his own wrong. Could we take that general language pre-1789 and say that it supports the rule today, assuming we could find that in the Morley case or other aspects of the common law? Or would we be just confined, as you understand Crawford, to the specific holding of Morton that there has to be a specific intent?",
  "Please -- please make the supposition.",
  "All right. Well, suppose we read the English authorities that it does not foreclose the expansion of the equitable forfeiture rule.",
  "I -- I find that difficult to understand because the dying declaration rule came up in many instances when the confrontation rule was not involved at all.",
  "Really? I thought they came in, in civil cases all the time.",
  "Well, but I -- I agree -- I'll check the, -- check --",
  "But the forfeiture rule is designed to suspend the operation of the confrontation rule. That doesn't mean that it comes in. You still need another hearsay exception which will allow it in.",
  "If it was -- if it was testimony. There are a lot of declarations that are not testimonial, and the rule is very important for those.",
  "There are also declarations that are testimonial, in which case we look to the confrontation concept.",
  "But to the extent that Crawford is confined simply to testimonial statements, any number of statements --",
  "-- that will come in under the California evidence rule are simply not controlled by the Confrontation Clause anyway. It's just -- it's a standard hearsay problem.",
  "Does the record show or did the trial indicate anything that he told the police on the prior occasion? They went into different rooms and they each gave statements?",
  "Well, I think it's an astonishingly broad exception you're asking for. On the other hand, testimonial statements are all that's involved, and so that's a narrow class, and maybe that balances out. I'm not sure. But may I just ask and you can comment on it if you -- may I ask: The defendant gave notice that he would testify?",
  "California law requires that?",
  "Or it does not require it?",
  "All right.",
  "Suppose the unavailability is caused by the defendant's negligence. Defendant negligently runs over the victim.",
  "I mean over the declarant.",
  "Suppose it's negligence.",
  "Is there a hypothetical universe where a scheme that discriminates on the basis of age is reasonable, but there is another alternative that doesn't discriminate on the basis of age? Is the first alternative still reasonable, or does the existence of a nondiscriminating alternative make it unreasonable?",
  "If that's true, then is it necessary either on the burden of production or burden of persuasion aspect of the case to consider other alternatives?",
  "Why is it necessary in light of the answer you gave me at the outset?",
  "Whether you even get to --",
  "The burden of production, of course.",
  "And what about the burden of persuasion?",
  "Why is it that if the employer has the burden of production, and I assume that is satisfied by his saying, here's the plan that we used, here are the factors we used, here is the reason we used them. What is so difficult for the -- what is the difficulty in saying that the employee then has to show that that is unreasonable?",
  "You think the statute doesn't make sense, so we don't --",
  "Well, I'm well aware of the statutory format here. But what I want to ask is why is it beyond the employee's means and capacity to show that this is unreasonable? It seems to me that that's the gravamen of this case.",
  "Well, if I find the text of the statute neutral or at least not clear, then it is proper for me to ask as a matter of efficiency where the burden should be placed, is it not?",
  "I'm not sure that if the statute contains three different conditions, three different commands, that it follows that the procedural implementations for all of these has to be the same. Do you have any authority for that proposition?",
  "If you want to say that Congress was well aware of burden of persuasion, burden of production problems with affirmative action, then they wouldn't have drafted it this way, that's one thing. I'm not sure that that's true.",
  "Yes, and just adding on to the Chief Justice, it seems the employer is the one that would prove the negative. He has to say there were no -- here is a whole universe of other frameworks, and none of these work.",
  "But you there agree that there is a distinction between \"business necessity\" and \"business reasonableness\"?",
  "Does it have to be just the specific decisions? Suppose that the company does not have clear rules of, what do you call them, firewalls between the profit side and the claims processing side. Would that be enough to cause a greater, more searching standard of review, say de novo?",
  "So then you're saying, A, the fact that there is a potential conflict is not enough; B, the fact that there are no procedures in the company to ensure that the conflict doesn't affect the judgment, that is not enough either.",
  "I'm positing. Does the fiduciary at least have the, the burden of production to show that it has established clear lines of demarcation, firewalls, whatever you call them, within the company? Does it have at least that obligation going forward?",
  "Well then, I don't know what effect you're giving to the fact, as the earlier questions have indicated, that there is a structural conflict.",
  "You want us to write an opinion to say that it's irrelevant that a company does not have procedures to insulate the profit section from the claims processing section? I'll use those terms.",
  "Suppose that the insurance company shows or may be required to show, at least by the burden of production, that it has established firewalls, very careful procedures, written regulations that claims administrators are not to consult with the people that set policy and prices. Does that suffice to permit, simply, abuse of discretion review?",
  "So that there is nothing the fiduciary can do in order to avoid intrusive - - highly -- a high degree of scrutiny in review of every close case?",
  "So that all insurance company claims adjustors have less deferential review than independent claims administrators?",
  "You want us to institute an industrywide rule differentiating insurance companies from other - -",
  "Suppose an insurance company -- I'll just repeat my earlier question -- has done the best that it can do to have a firewall, independence and so forth. Does that bear on whether or not the less deferential standard of review is invoked?",
  "So it makes no difference what -- it makes no difference what the policies of the companies are insofar as the standard of review?",
  "This - -",
  "This bears upon the question Justice Breyer asked, which we never could get completely answered. Can you tell me what the Sixth Circuit did wrong here?",
  "But suppose that a new drug is found for the treatment of a condition, glaucoma -- hypothetical -- and the evidence is stunningly clear that smoking with this new drug causes a severe allergic reaction. Does the cigarette manufacturer have any duty to disclose this on the label or in promotions?",
  "No, I -- they've just found this out last week. Do they have any -- there can be no -- I take it under your position there can be no suit based on misleading or false promotion or labeling, and there can be no suit even for the sale of an unsafe item?",
  "Would you have -- would have you been satisfied if your complaint said this complaint does not seek any damages based on the link between smoking and health?",
  "Would you accept that amendment to your complaint, that the plaintiff does not seek any damages based on some link between smoking and health?",
  "So what are your damages?",
  "Mr. Frederick, if I take away from your oral argument that it is your position that this suit is not based on a link between smoking and health, I'm going to have difficulty in accepting your position in this entire case. Do you have a secondary position that it is based on a link between smoking and health but it is subject to a general duty, that is, that supersedes or is quite in addition to labeling?",
  "Your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question was that the state attorney general could not impose a regulation that said you must say that low tar cigarettes have as much nicotine as regular cigarettes. If the attorney general couldn't do that, why could the plaintiff do it in his lawsuit?",
  "No. The hypothetical was the attorney general requires this as a regulation under his authority.",
  "Well, if we don't call it \"insurance,\" can we all it \"pooling\"?",
  "I did want to understand your position. Suppose there is a statewide contract for public employees and one union brings a suit to interpret a provision of that collective bargaining agreement having to do with overtime or holidays or something. And then it notifies the other union, we're going to have to drop this litigation because we can't afford it. Even though it ultimately may affect you down the line, you're not a party. I don't see the harm in allowing the other union to subsidize or contribute -- use whatever verb you want -- that litigation -- that litigation.",
  "What -- what -- what harm are we trying to prevent here?",
  "The First Amendment can be -- can be a sword or a shield. This union wants to use it as a sword in order to promote, in order to protect its rights under the collective bargaining agreement. I don't see the harm.",
  "That's not quite the hypothetical. Let's say there are two bargaining agreements but they're identical, and that this litigation that's underway will have persuasive force for the union that's thinking about entering, and then the union decides that it is going to enter to help the union involved in the suit, and the members of the, of the contributing union object and you say they have a First Amendment right. That's your point?",
  "I don't see why the objects of collective bargaining the, objects of union -- of the union, are not being fulfilled.",
  "Could you tell us two hypotheticals. One is the librarian, two is the public celebration. Would nonunion, would participating unions be allowed to contribute to either of those activities?",
  "Against nonmembers? Against members, there has to be a pro-ration, they has to be a pro-ration. A with the librarian, B with the celebration.",
  "Well, one of the difficulties it seems to me is the Petitioner's position with the sort of all or nothing approach. But you seemed to be taking the mirror position of that. Your argument is all or nothing on your side. I don't get much help from either side as to what the standard should be. I know germane is obviously a malleable word, but we are looking to see if there is some test that we can use that's not all or nothing.",
  "I haven't heard from either side yet what that would be.",
  "All right. So you define \"look through\" as -- under our hypothetical here as looking through to all people who might potentially be parties under this arbitration agreement.",
  "I will think about that. I'm -- I'm -- I wasn't -- it wasn't clear to me that that was so.",
  "But that's not quite so, because the -- the action could proceed with just A and C, and then it -- it could come to a complete judgment as to them. In the look through for the -- the claims that are involved, the action couldn't possibly proceed without taking account of the pre-emption claim that the Federal -- the Federal claim. You couldn't -- you could decide the case completely in No. 1, the diversity case, but not in No. 2. So there -- so there is a difference. It's true, you don't decide it completely as to all parties.",
  "Speaking of gymnastics, can I ask you if you had foreseen this problem, could you have brought a declaratory judgment action to establish that your Federal claim - -",
  "-- controls this dispute and could you have then said that you wanted this arbitrated?",
  "Why didn't you do that? Why are we here?",
  "I mean, could you still do that after this case?",
  "Is the Petitioner's -- I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to ask the Petitioner -- is the Petitioner's argument for a limited look through compromised in any way by the Beneficial Bank case which allows removal if there is a Federal defense?",
  "That's of course in the context of a defense, as opposed to a counterclaim.",
  "What about a Federal defense?",
  "Let's just assume the hypothetical -- the hypothetical: The computer malfunctions.",
  "I'm sure a computer might be compared to God, but let's - -",
  "But we want an answer - -",
  "We want an answer to the question.",
  "Let's assume no one did anything wrong.",
  "-- because this bears on the fact of why are we doing this at all.",
  "Is there a 1983 violation here?",
  "I suppose if the concern were that the police would become sloppy, then a 1983 suit would be more likely?",
  "And there are three reasons. One is to reduce the incidence of arrests, so they don't have the hazard of felony arrests. Number two is?",
  "And if there were pervasive deficiencies, I assume that's exactly what we would inquire about under 1983?",
  "And would you add 1983 as number four to your list?",
  "Do we use the word or the phrase \"good faith\" in writing the opinion if we write it your way?",
  "In Hudson versus Michigan, didn't the Court engage in a very broad balancing of the social costs and the potential for increase in violations in saying that there was no necessity for the suppression rule in the no-knock case?",
  "And the definition of negligence is that he was not objectively reasonable?",
  "But in that -- but in that hypothetical I think it might be easy to say that the policeman on the beat was not objectively reasonable in relying.",
  "But that's certainly not the case here.",
  "Suppose it were an agency like INS or Customs in which they have many people that are not sworn officers or some that are, does it make a difference who answered the phone?",
  "In Rand we said this is exactly the inquiry we are not going to make.",
  "Rand was where we had a traffic stop made by a narcotics officer. And the question was, well, he was going outside his jurisdiction. We said we are not going to get into the way police departments are organized. We are just not going to do it.",
  "That's Rand.",
  "Do you have any views on the other case?",
  "Or location.",
  "And this is important, but you had three -- three points. One was the fact of the arrest; and, two, it must be contemporaneous. And the third?",
  "But the bright line swallows up the rationale in this hypothetical where already he's handcuffed; he is in the car. Is there a justification apart from Chimel for our keeping this bright-line rule?",
  "Are there other -- are there other reasons that it's hazardous or dangerous or at least risky to leave an unattended car where other people can go in and maybe find weapons and contraband if the police aren't guarding it? I mean, are there other reasons other than Chimel for this bright-line rule?",
  "What is the basis for your wanting us to adopt what we might call a bright-line rule for automobile exception? What are the reasons other than officer safety which we think may not be a very persuasive reason.",
  "Well, you keep coming back to danger. And let's -- let's assume that some of us think that when he has been handcuffed and in the back of a car and he is about ready to leave the scene, there is no more danger. I want to know if there are any other reasons other than preserving evidence for searching the car. It seems to me there are good reasons for searching that car. It's -- it's movable. That's the old vehicle exception. It can have contraband in it. It can be stolen. It can be taken for joy rides. But you don't seem to make any of those arguments. You just want to keep coming back to officer safety and on that point I think your case is very weak.",
  "Fine, if you want to go back to that, fine. I have problems with the argument but if that's your argument I'll take it from there.",
  "Diminished expectations of privacy are not a reason to search.",
  "The only reason to search that I can find from you so far is officer safety.",
  "But the absence of dominion or control works the other way. That makes it all the more dangerous. That could be -- there could be guns that other people could get out, evidence other people could get out; and, rather than go through a case-by-case analysis of whether this was true in every case, we just have a bright-line rule as Justice Scalia said at the outset.",
  "It seems to me that the absence of the dominion and control is -- is just a conclusory statement to explain what happens in the case the person is arrested, but it -- it doesn't seem to me to provide a rationale.",
  "It actually works the other way, because it means there is more reason to search. It's not in our dominion and control. We are leaving it on the street. We want to know what's in there.",
  "That is what they are asking about in this case.",
  "But again as a preliminary matter, am I on the same page with Justice Ginsburg? Or would it be a different question? I'm curious to know why the beneficiary designation and change provisions at page 48, number 29c, beneficiaries, couldn't have been invoked here. Is that the same question Justice Ginsburg was asking?",
  "Because the plan does contain a procedure for designating some other beneficiary, including the spouse. I just don't understand why anybody doesn't talk about that.",
  "Well, of course, that was the point of my earlier point. I focused on -- on this whole paragraph.",
  "That just indicates that this would have been a different case if the provision of the plan that said there shall be no assignment, which is quoted in the Fifth Circuit thing, was the only provision in the plan; but when you look through this in retrospect, there are means for participants and beneficiaries to make a change, and they weren't followed here.",
  "And I understand that you say in effect they were. I understand that argument but it's not as if the plan didn't contain an adequate vehicle if the -- the parties had followed strictly the terms of the plan.",
  "What do you want me to read here?",
  "Well, are the provisions of page 49 of the appendix consistent with the statute?",
  "Did the Court of Appeals give short shrift or overlook that point?",
  "Would you like to argue the question that is here?",
  "I was going to say in part it seems to me that in isolation it seems harmless, almost trivial, but the whole point is that the employer doesn't think it is trivial. The employer uses it, by hypothesis, as a basis to retaliate.",
  "It seems to me that the participation clause is the line of least resistance. I understand we have to say what a hearing is and so forth. Are you asking us to resolve on the opposition clause because that will give more guidance to the system or - -",
  "I think that's a very strong argument for the participation clause.",
  "You don't have to answer that. We'll be glad to see you again.",
  "Is the only question - - -the participation is not in doubt. The only question is whether it's an investigation under this subtitle.",
  "I take it that you're are here because you find the decision of the Ninth Circuit, and I take it of the district court, prejudicial for the government on an ongoing basis; and what are the principal reasons for that?",
  "And what particular errors? The standard for review -- pardon me. The standard for the grant or denial of injunction? What are the principal areas you want to present to us?",
  "Let me ask you - -",
  "Would the irreparable injury have to -- and this just repeats Justice Stevens's question. It is the same concern I have. Let's assume an EIS is required; let's assume it hasn't been prepared; let's assume the government project is going to proceed. You still have to show irreparable harm before you can get the injunction?",
  "Do you have authority for that in the -- are the circuits unanimous on that point?",
  "Then, let's -- let's assume standing. Let's assume standing. Let's -- let's assume people have standing.",
  "Are there any authorities in the circuits which would indicate that irreparable injury is not required when there's standing, when an EIS is required, when an EIS has not been prepared, and when the government is ready to proceed? There is always irreparable injury before you can get an injunction? That's what all the circuits say?",
  "By the time this case got back to the court -- the district court a second time, the President had made a determination that this was in the paramount interest of the United States. The Defense and Commerce Department jointly had made a determination that this is necessary for the national defense. And it seems to me, even if those determinations don't resolve the EIS statement, they certainly must be given great weight by the district court in determining whether to continue the injunction. If you could comment on that, incorporate it also in what you were going to say about Mr. Garre's argument with reference to the standard.",
  "Could any one of those have brought suit?",
  "But I mean -- but the letter alone, I don't know what the criteria were for the addresses.",
  "Oh, okay. Okay.",
  "But under your definition of coalition district, race is the key factor.",
  "And you are telling us if we have a rule that makes race the key factor then race doesn't matter.",
  "I thought you were proposing a brave new world of coalition districts.",
  "Based on race.",
  "What's the authority that says you must consider race in drawing the districts, assuming that you don't have an existing majority - - minority-majority district? What's the -- what authority do you cite for the fact that you must consider race in drawing districts? What do I read to find that?",
  "No, that's -- that's a majority -- majority district.",
  "Okay. So then what other case do you have?",
  "Well, then your statement that you must always consider race in drawing districts is not -- is not supported, or at least it's a new proposition that you are arguing for us here.",
  "That's something new. I thought we took the case -- at least I have been thinking about the case -- on the assumption that there is a valid State law that is being superseded. Now, if you are questioning the validity of the State law, that's something -- that hasn't been raised here, has it?",
  "I'm talking about, you're indicating to us that the county line standard that the State court invoked as a matter of State law is itself questionable because it was based on a prohibited racial animus. And I -- I indicated that that's very new to me. I thought we were taking the case on the proposition that the county line rule is a neutral, valid State law principle. Now, it may or may not be superseded by the -- by the requirement of section 2. That's what we are arguing about. But this is the first time I have heard that we have to somehow question the underlying State rule under the Fourteenth Amendment. I thought we took the case on the assumption that the State rule is valid.",
  "I'm talking about the county line rule.",
  "Intentional by those who draw the district?",
  "I won -- I'd hoped that you could have a brief time to discuss your third rationale because it's going to require determination of how people would vote.",
  "That's what I wanted to know, and it gets back to the merits and not Saucier. We are going through two different things here. Assume this is an undercover officer, not an -- not a -- not an informant. Now, the undercover officer sees a crime being committed, and he is ready to make the arrest. Can he automatically ask for police assistance and -- and other policemen? Are the police then entitled to come into the home in your view, or do there have to be some exigent circumstances?",
  "Just -- just to be clear, if -- if I may, I know your red light is on: Your position is if an undercover officer is in the premises and sees a crime being committed, he automatically can invite police in to assist him in making an arrest without exigent circumstances?",
  "What's -- what do I read? What authority do you cite me for that proposition?",
  "Well, you would agree he could make the -- the arrest by himself. Assuming he was a police officer - -",
  "-- he could make the arrest by himself.",
  "But -- and -- but you are saying he can't ask for assistance to make that arrest effective in all cases. There has to be some exigent circumstance.",
  "Well, it seems to me that in the case that Justice Alito put, that there are exigent circumstances.",
  "Well, that -- that's a different point and I have some question about that. It seems to me the police are never quite sure exactly what's going to happen.",
  "It seems to me that this is an area where the police do need guidance, and I need guidance. I find this -- I find this very difficult. It seems to me that we could have learned a lot if the -- if the courts of appeals had addressed this question.",
  "Which is what they do in Saucier.",
  "Which is what they would do under Saucier.",
  "So the police say, you know, we made a mistake. We should have had a warrant, but we have our man in there now, we have got to do something. The police cannot send assistance?",
  "No. You say they have created the exigent circumstances.",
  "So -- so my first statement was correct. It's illegal for the police to send their assistance, the other officers in?",
  "And you say as a practical matter we have to say that under the Constitution we can endanger -- we must endanger the officer?",
  "No, no. The hypothetical is that they have to send people in to assist him. But the hypothetical also is they should have anticipated this, and therefore, in your words, they created exigent circumstances.",
  "It seems to me that dilemma and that paradox casts considerable doubt on your proposition that if the police create the exigent circumstances, they cannot rely on it. I seriously question that proposition.",
  "No, no. I want to talk about the general rule.",
  "You want us to write an opinion saying that any time police create the exigent circumstances, they can't rely on them if they had had the time to get a warrant. And I find that a dangerous rule.",
  "The rule does bear on culpability, and culpability sounds like part of the definition of an offense or a more serious offense.",
  "I don't understand why this happenstance is required to do it under the statute. I didn't quite understand that.",
  "You said it's only happenstance. He has to do it under the statute if he makes the finding.",
  "Are you saying it would have to be a bifurcated proceeding?",
  "Is there historic evidence that bifurcated proceedings were required before Apprendi?",
  "But statutory interpretation questions aren't for the jury.",
  "I agree with Justice Stevens. I thought that was the whole problem, the \"or\" and the \"and\" is the problem for you.",
  "First, is there some constitutional minimum? Let's assume direct review. Is there some constitutional minimum requirement for scienter with reference to an accomplice?",
  "What is it?",
  "Is that the same -- is that the same as purpose?",
  "Well, but you don't take the position, do you, or do you, that Washington law conforms to the Model Penal Code? I thought the Model Penal Code was much more defendant-friendly than you're stating.",
  "So you're -- would - - would you say that the trial court in Washington states law correctly if it says that being accomplice you have to have a purpose to facilitate the commission of the crime?",
  "But you agree there is a difference in \"knowing\" and \"purpose\"?",
  "It's toward the bottom of page 123. And I have the same, I have the same, just tieing onto Justice Souter's question, on the same subject. It seems to me that that hypothetical is not necessarily correct.",
  "The gloss that the Washington Supreme Court ended up with was exactly the same as the instruction that was, that the judge gave in this case -- to be as a -- the trial judge, whatever the state of the law was, got it right.",
  "Was there an objection?",
  "The objection was based on the defense proffer of an instruction which was, namely, close to the model penal code that says you have to have the same -- is anterior principle, and that's not necessarily the law in every state. So the defense bears some responsibility for not -- for -- number one, it didn't have a coherent theory either.",
  "No objection from defense counsel.",
  "And your answer to Justice Breyer incorporated the -- the principle that the defense counsel had been arguing for from the outset of this case, that you must have the same scienter as the principal, and that's not necessarily the law.",
  "It can go on in some States but not -- it doesn't have to be the law as I understand it.",
  "Just at the outset, I'll just make one comment. You argue that it's impossible for Wyeth to comply with the State law and at the same time the Federal label. As a textual matter, as a logical matter, I just -- I don't understand that. I think I could design a label that's completely consistent and that meets the requirements that the Respondents wish to urge. Now, if you want to say that any alteration of the label violates Federal law, that's something else. But as a textual matter, as a logical matter, as a semantic matter, I don't agree with it.",
  "The FDA was never concerned with risks versus benefit?",
  "I don't understand what we're talking about here. The new information was not brought up by either side - -",
  "-- showing increased frequency or increased severity?",
  "Right? And supposedly, it was burden of the drug company to show - -",
  "You agree with -- you agree with Mr. Waxman that the FDA specifically addressed the risks and benefits of IV push as opposed to the risks of arterial exposures?",
  "You're talking about changing but you can supplement without changing the label.",
  "If we conclude that new information is the criterion for deciding this case, if we reject the argument that misbranding at the outset allows State law to supplement the duty, but that if there's new information, then the label has to be changed -- if it that's the line we draw, can this verdict be sustained?",
  "And the Vermont court's opinion?",
  "Well, to put the burden on the manufacturer seems to me inconsistent with what 10 States have said, that there is a rebuttable presumption and inconsistent also with the instructions the jury received in this case, that you can consider the FDA label. So, I think, to me, what you say there is not borne out by what happened in this case or by those other States' - -",
  "What sort of -- excuse me. What sort of tribes were not under Federal jurisdiction?",
  "Pardon me. What -- what -- yes, what members of tribes were not under Federal jurisdiction?",
  "Were there, then -- were there persons of Indian descent who were not under Federal jurisdiction?",
  "What -- what kind of persons would those be, persons without a tribal affiliation?",
  "They wouldn't qualify for two reasons -- A, they weren't recognized; and B, they weren't, in 1934, under Federal jurisdiction? Or either?",
  "Because I suppose that what the Government wants us to do is put in two commas: The Indian as used in section -- a person of Indian descent, comma, who are members of any recognized Indian tribes, comma, now under Federal jurisdiction. That still might not help if they weren't under Federal jurisdiction in 1934.",
  "Even if they were recognized later?",
  "You don't agree that \"recognized later\" complies with this statute in your case.",
  "That, seems to me, not to help you, because if they are the same, then that would apply to both. Justice Breyer was suggesting, as I had earlier, that maybe you can make a distinction between those were under Federal jurisdiction then and recognized tribes now.",
  "The Chief Justice's question, and I was going to put the same question to Mr. Olson, is whether or not there is -- is some canon of construction, some principle of Federalism which makes us be very cautious before we take land out of the jurisdiction of the State. It sounds to me plausible. Is there any authority for the proposition I just stated? Have we said that in cases or - -",
  "Or have we said the opposite, that there is no - -",
  "But is there any overriding principles about which we must be most cautious before we interpret the statute as depriving the State of the ownership and jurisdiction of this land? Is there anything in the cases either way on that point?",
  "If you -- if you think of the case as a principal-agent case so that the principal can direct the agent as to what to do, the agent being the county, then it seems to me that the unions might still have an argument that this is an unconstitutional condition. I've been looking for ways to examine this case. The public forum doesn't really work for me. Subsidy doesn't really work for me. It seems to me to be an unconstitutional-condition case. At least that's the argument. That doesn't mean you necessarily can't prevail. But suppose the State told the city: You can't have a parade that you sponsor for this particular cause. That would raise an unconstitutional-conditions argument; wouldn't it?",
  "Why isn't it? And I say that because I think that follows on Justice Stevens's line of questioning. I didn't mean to interrupt him, but it seems to me that is consistent with what he is asking.",
  "You stand up and say that this isn't viewpoint -- that this is -- that this is viewpoint-based. Isn't it where the union -- and aren't they right about that?",
  "The general proposition that underlies your argument that the local entities are creatures of State law and they cannot receive Federal powers from the Federal Government when the States object, is that -- is that an acceptable proposition?",
  "Right.",
  "There is -- there is a case out of the Ninth Circuit, and it was affirmed by this Court on a procedural point, but not on a -- not on the merits -- out of the neighboring State of Washington, where the State says a locality cannot build a dam more than 25 feet high. The locality then gets a license from the Federal Power Commission, and the State said, well, you still don't have this authority. And the Ninth Circuit said you do. The Federal power then supersedes. Would you agree that that case is valid?",
  "Because there the local entity has powers greater than what the State wants to give it, even over the State's objection.",
  "Really, if the State can -- can opt not to do something, it can't tell its subdivisions, we don't want you to do it, either? And the subdivision can then go to the -- directly to the Federal Government and say, please let us do this, even if the State would be free to reject it on its own?",
  "It seems to me that that is the argument you should be making here.",
  "Now - -",
  "Let me just establish something at the outset. You had conceded below, and I thought I saw this in your brief as well, that as to the State of Idaho, its determination not to allow the deductibility is permissible.",
  "All right. So, we begin with the proposition that a State may do this if it chooses; i.e., this -- refused on its own to have the payroll deduction.",
  "And if -- and if a State had a system in which all payroll deductions were -- by local entities -- were routinely controlled by the State, the State did all the pay roles for the local entities, then it -- in that case the nondeductibility would also be permitted, I take it.",
  "Suppose the State at the State level says this is a contentious area, we want to stay out of it. We are going to be neutral. We are simply not allowing payroll deduction for right to work clauses, for union clauses. We don't want this. If the State can say that, and your concession indicates to me that it can, then why can't it tell its subdivisions you have to be efficient, we don't want arguments from one city to the next city about payroll deduction that's going to consume the time of the city council's, the time of the citizens, we want to take this off the table for you just the way we've taken it off the table for us?",
  "Well, of course, that's the interest. This is a very strong Federal interest in allowing the States to organize their governmental systems the way they choose. Our gun control registration case, where we said the Federal Government cannot tell the counties that it has certain duties for gun control.",
  "I -- I -- I'm not sure that's right. I'm not sure the State isn't saying we want to determine how our government is structured in this respect.",
  "I'll read Russo again, but I didn't think Pocatello, Idaho, was part of the state of major.",
  "Could you help me with this? Would you object if we analyzed this as a constitutional condition case? I don't know that you would prevail or not. But it -- the forum analysis doesn't seem to me to quite fit.",
  "Why is that? MR. COLLINS -- the problem with constitutional condition -- if it were a condition on the local governments, then it's not really - -",
  "You agree that the Chevron case is not a substantial evidence case?",
  "Can't we assume -- let's assume that there is.",
  "Assume that there are - - are two sources for the uranium, A and B, and it goes to the enricher. A gives it; B gives it. A ends up with B's uranium. Justice Stevens is saying at some point there is a transfer of title.",
  "No. We are asking you to accept that hypothetical, so we can - -",
  "Are you saying the utility doesn't have title to what was formerly B's uranium?",
  "The enrichment is done. It's back in the United States. The utility says: This is my uranium. I have title. Do you dispute that?",
  "How does he get the title from -- to the uranium that was formerly B's uranium?",
  "At what point did that title transfer?",
  "Well, is the agency's position that its policy has changed or that it has not changed?",
  "Well, the court recognized, but it seems to me the FCC -- and this is what Justice Scalia's questions go in part to -- in the remand order at first it said its policy hadn't changed.",
  "Are you talking about community standards for broadcasting?",
  "I'm not sure that works. I haven't looked at the statistics on one-parent families, working parents, and so forth. Those factors both have to be considered.",
  "And you don't think you need to go beyond (A) to resolve the case?",
  "And he can't go to Federal court until that is resolved?",
  "If you do prevail, it is rather dramatic, because your client was stunningly negligent. He does nothing for four and-a-half years, then strolls over to the State court.",
  "Is the State statute that allows the early conviction to be set aside and the appeal reinstated -- do we have that statute?",
  "I thought I had it. Do we have it in - -",
  "Well, you're saying that (2) has a negative implication.",
  "You are saying that (2) had a negative implication. In other words, the time shall not be counted while it's pending and that it should be counted if it's not pending and you are not diligent.",
  "Do we begin with the assumption that this is a Chevron deference case? And I think Aguirre, INS v. Aguirre, would tell us that it is. It was a different statute. Do we begin with that assumption?",
  "Well, do I begin with Chevron?",
  "Do you take the position that the Government is wrong in saying that it's bound by Fedorenko and that's the reason perhaps for us to send it back?",
  "And do we begin with the decision in Rodriguez-Majano, the BIA decision - -",
  "-- which cited Fedorenko?",
  "But why does the Attorney General have expertise in -- in that area? I can understand why he has expertise when he knows that, from experience, that certain defenses are harder to prove than others, that certain evidence is harder to obtain than other evidence. But does the Attorney General really have expertise in determining degrees of duress, degrees of culpability? Is that within the Chevron framework?",
  "I don't know why you -- I don't know why you concede that.",
  "Well, but your position is that it is unbounded. If the legislature passes a statute requiring specific intent, scienter, concepts of personal responsibility, we don't say this is unbounded.",
  "I'm saying in the general criminal law. We don't say, oh, this is unbounded. This is what courts are for. This is what adjudication is for, is to establish and define what duress means, what scienter means, what degree of intent is culpable, what isn't. It's not unbounded.",
  "Was -- was there an element in Imbler of the fact that you have to make tactical and strategic decisions at -- at the moment that are difficult, that call for judgment that has to be exercised on the spur of the moment? This is somewhat different. This is -- this is a long-term commitment or a long-term policy that the Respondents are arguing for. It seems to me somewhat different than the dynamics that inform the Imbler decision.",
  "Well, I -- I suppose that is why the Petitioners seemed to change their theory. They -- they -- they were -- they were concerned about prosecutorial immunity, so they take it to the higher level of policy. When -- when they do that, I suppose they might have the stronger argument if they could show deliberate indifference. Are there cases that help them on the \"deliberate indifference\"? What's -- what's the best case for them on deliberate indifference?",
  "That is why the case is hard, and I -- I almost have to see what the violation would be before I could determine the qualified immunity aspect of the case.",
  "That's what we are deciding in sort of in a vacuum. It's a little difficult.",
  "The Monell case -- does the Monell case rest on the assumption that there can be instances where a policy makes the policy of those who adopted the policy liable?",
  "In the broad ethical scheme of things, apart from liability under this statute, it seems to me that a newly elected district attorney would take seriously the obligation to make sure that everybody was following Brady.",
  "Well, that's the next point. If I were a prosecutor, I would say: This is my constitutional duty to say it, in the broad sense of - - of my ethical obligations of my duties to the public.",
  "Well, I think it's more than that. He can't be indifferent to sloppy practices in the office - -",
  "-- consistent with his or her obligations to perform their duties.",
  "But suppose it were shown -- this is hypothetical. Suppose it were shown that 90 percent of all escapes under the escape statute were breakouts involving weapons; 10 percent were failure to report. Would that affect how we decide the case?",
  "Yes.",
  "Do we look to the crime to see generally whether or not it involves violence and serious risk of harm?",
  "So that, in my hypothetical, it would be a more difficult case than the case we have here or would it be the same?",
  "No. My hypothetical is, under the statute, if you look at the whole universe of prosecutions under the escape statute, 90 percent of them are for breakouts involving weapons.",
  "But that's what we looked to in Begay.",
  "Well, it might not, if it just said \"escape,\" and then you'd have this same problem.",
  "You can say the same thing about failure to respond to a traffic ticket.",
  "Can you -- can you tell me: The U.S. attorney has this case. The man failed to report for custody some -- a few years earlier, and you have this offense. Does the district attorney or - - pardon me -- the United States attorney have some discretion here that he may not prosecute at all? What -- what goes into the - -",
  "What goes through the mind of -- of a prosecutor? He says, because this fellow failed to report earlier for this offense, I'm going to give him 15 extra years in jail.",
  "What -- what does a -- are there many instances where you think in a case like this a U.S. attorney would just elect not to file that charge?",
  "Or do you think they automatically file it every time; and if not, how do they define it?",
  "Do they ever look at the -- do they ever look at the attorney? This attorney has been giving us a hard time, and we ought to show him that we really mean business? Do they look at the nature of the -- the identity of the counsel of the defendant? Do they ever look at that?",
  "But the potential risk is based on an empirical assessment. What's -- how can we make an empirical assessment without statistics?",
  "But isn't that's based on our experience because we have these cases; we've been lawyers; we know what they usually involve. We have some sort of a - -",
  "-- an instinct or a basis for making a judgment.",
  "If statistics can inform that, why ignore the statistics?",
  "Well, of course, that's the point. Begay talked about purposeful violent conduct, not just purposeful conduct.",
  "Well, suppose - -",
  "Suppose the tests were by John Smith, assistant lab technician, and you call John Smith, and you say, \"Is this your signature?\" \"Yes.\" \"Do you remember doing this test?\" And he says, \"I do thousands of tests. I don't remember. I'll tell you the way I always do them.\" I mean, is that what you want?",
  "Well, that's what you're usually going to get, isn't it?",
  "Well, you know what you're going to get by looking, number one, at the States which allow this, where this happens all the time. You know what you're going to get in the States where the defendant -- where the defense can subpoena the witness. Now, if there are new tests, complex DNA tests and so forth, I suppose there is a lot to ask about. Standard blood alcohol, not much to ask about.",
  "You can raise all those questions from the fact of the -- from the document. Tell the jury, \"This doesn't show what tests were performed.\" It's there on the document.",
  "In your answer, you said, well, there would be this stack of affidavits and that's all the State would have to do. I think, Mr. Fisher, that was not quite responsive because the question here is whether or not there is an exception for business records. Nobody is talking about affidavits, witnesses, and so forth. We are talking about business records done in the ordinary course. It's true that it -- that the core principle is whether that confrontation is required, but the question is whether or not business records should be treated as something that are not testimony because they are done based on other protocols with other procedures where there is substantial insulation from the facts of the particular case because it's a routine scientific exercise. So I think your answer, I would agree, is responsive based on your theory of the case, but as a matter of practice and as a matter of the issue that's before the Court, I don't think it addresses it.",
  "Well, but the railroad case was an accident report. This is a scientific analysis.",
  "But if you had what we can call an independent lab, that certainly-- you certainly can distinguish that from a police report. It's a line-drawing question, I'll admit, but I think it's easily distinguished.",
  "I wonder -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- if you -- if you didn't state your case strongly enough with reference to California. I thought California followed the rule that you advocate here.",
  "I'm not sure it's one more witness. Labs are backed up with DNA. You know, the Federal budget for the courts, for the Federal courts, is $6 billion. Well, $1 billion of that is spent under the Criminal Justice Act for experts and translators and counsels. This -- this is a very, very substantial burden if we tell every State in the country that every -- in every drug case you are -- the State must produce the expert.",
  "It seems to me -- and tell me if this is not the way you want to argue. It seems to me to make your case you have to say of course this is hearsay; and the question is whether it's testimonial.",
  "And it's not testimonial because these are laboratory protocols, subject to ongoing, objective, repeated standards; that's different from testimony that it was a blue car, which is specific to the case. That's the kind of framework of the argument you have to make.",
  "And that as a result of that it is not testimonial because \"testimonial\" is a legal term that's subject to interpretation. I -- I guess that's the argument you're making and that you have to make.",
  "As I see it.",
  "Of course the problem was in -- I think it was Hammond was the companion case to David.",
  "The -- the 911 call was done for other -- really other purposes. It wasn't testimonial because it wasn't really directed to trial. This does seem more directed to trial, so then you have to tell us why even if it is, there are some independent guarantees of -- of reliability that means that we should say it's not testimonial as a legal matter.",
  "Well, do you have to have a machine? I mean, what about -- what about ballistics? \"This bullet came from that gun.\" Does that involve sufficient discretion, sufficient judgment that the expert has to be there, while the blood -- blood or drug testing doesn't? It seems to me that's where you have to draw the line.",
  "And to say that that wasn't raised in the case, this is precisely the question we are going to have to decide if you're going to prevail. I don't think it helps to say it wasn't raised in the case.",
  "We are raising it.",
  "I do wish you would comment on the argument that the State of California - - a huge state with many, many drug prosecutions -- seems to get along all right under the rule that the Petitioner proposes.",
  "If the State of California and other populous States have for, I take it, some number of years been able to function quite effectively under the rule that the Petitioner proposes, it seems to me that's something that you have to address.",
  "Why would it be undue for California and not for -- are you accepting the fact that in California it's a workable rule and it's caused no problems?",
  "That's a non- answer. We are asking what's the rule?",
  "Can you submit it on the affidavit, as the Chief Justice said under your theory of the case?",
  "You'd try to have some different hypothesis?",
  "But you have to have some boundaries, you have to have some framework, you have to have some explanation. You started talking about a machine. There is no machine in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, so it seems to me you have two different rationales floating around here and -- and neither are tethered to a specific rule.",
  "Well - -",
  "It seems to me you have to do that because there is all sorts of machines that have to be interpreted. There -- a chromatic spectrum analysis; the person has to say what he saw there, what she saw there.",
  "So just because the machine is involved it seems to me we cannot make a sensible rule based on that.",
  "Could you comment on the California experience, please?",
  "What's your distinction with the recordkeeper?",
  "What's your distinction from your own theory of the recordkeeper? Does the recordkeeper all have to -- do they all have to testify to testify that this is indeed the record?",
  "The graph, spectrograph or -- or -- or the -- the chart is introduced. Chain of custody is either stipulated or established. Can a person who did not make the test testify as to what that line -- what that graph means, and would that be sufficient to convict?",
  "No, but chain of custody is -- is quite different from the quantitative analysis and the professional opinion. My question is only chain of custody has been established, that's gone to the laboratory, the paper is produced, an outside witness testifies to what the paper means. I thought you said that that suffices.",
  "What -- what -- what's been the underlying rationale for the rule of lenity, which is a rule I think we should apply with great caution? But if we think -- what's the reason for the rule of lenity?",
  "Fair notice. It -- it - - it seems to me that if I were counsel practicing criminal law in the private sector, and I negotiated a plea for simple assault, but there was a spouse that was involved, and then I walked down the courthouse step with my clients, said we got a good deal, and incidentally, all guns in your house must immediately be surrendered to other people, you must take them all out, you may never hunt, you may never possess a gun. And under your view, if I don't say that I'm guilty of, it seems to me, serious malpractice. I just don't see that there is notice to the legal profession.",
  "Well, but the rule - -",
  "No. Where the context is, we are asking why the rule of lenity and the rule of lenity is to ensure notice. And it seems to me this is a classic case where there has to be notice. You could come back and say that even if the statute had been written as to apply specifically to domestic crimes, a lot of attorneys wouldn't have had notice on it when it was an omnibus budget bill added at the last minute.",
  "The -- the -- the statute uses the word element in the term singular. It seems to me that although this statute is a mess anyway - -",
  "-- that that -- that that doesn't particularly help you. Elements usually refer to each component of the actus reus -- you entered a dwelling with a weapon. You would say \"elements\" for that, wouldn't you? And it seems to me under your interpretation the statute should say \"elements.\"",
  "Well, I mean when we are gasping for straws I'm not sure anything is insignificant.",
  "In that instance is there room for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing?",
  "Can you envisage circumstances in which an ineffective counsel assistance, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim was presented in the State court and then there is a second ineffective assistance in counsel's claims or a further supplemental ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on new evidence that the district court might hear? Does that ever happen?",
  "So you think there could be instances, we might imagine, in which there could be two ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the second of which could be heard in the district court with evidentiary -- with an evidentiary hearing?",
  "Well - -",
  "And I don't want to interrupt your answer to the Chief Justice because I think it's critical, critical to your argument. As a procedural matter, I thought that the Establishment Clause issue was raised in the initial complaint. Are you taking the position it's now waived or something?",
  "It was under the State?",
  "If you prevail, the action should be dismissed, as far as you're concerned?",
  "All right.",
  "Then getting back to the Chief Justice's point, it does seem to me that if you say it's Government speech that in later cases, including the case of the existing monument, you're going to say it's Government speech and you have an Establishment Clause problem. I don't know if -- I'm not saying it would necessarily be resolved one way or the other, but it certainly raises - -",
  "-- an Establishment Clause problem.",
  "Do you have to - -",
  "Did the NEA -- Finley v. NEA, the Court didn't treat that as Government speech.",
  "Or am I -- is that the - -",
  "But, Justice Stevens's question is important, maybe not for your case but for other cases. We are deciding this for other cases to arise, and why isn't he correct that if you don't like the message then that raises a content-based claim?",
  "I understand that.",
  "But it doesn't seem to me that you have to make the Government speech argument for you to make the argument that you just made.",
  "And the same question Justice Stevens had, just to tack onto his question here, your answer was: Oh, well, the Government owns it. Suppose the Government says: We will accept ownership only if we agree with the message. That just puts his question. I think the ownership argument is - - is not an answer to the Justice's question.",
  "Well, under the Equal Protection Clause would -- if you wrote an Equal Protection Clause opinion, you would end up saying it's content-based. That's the First Amendment.",
  "I -- I don't think that can you avoid the hard part by saying, oh, other amendments of the Constitution might apply. The heart of the question is whether the Government may discriminate based on content, and that's a First Amendment question.",
  "Does the law always require us to adopt an all-or-nothing position? Aren't there some extreme cases indicated by the hypothetical where the First Amendment does enter in? Do we have to decide this case that it's all or nothing?",
  "Those are time, place, and manner regulations, with which we are all familiar. But my concern is that this -- this case is an example of the tyrannies -- of the tyranny of labels. Because it's a public forum, as Justice Scalia indicated, for parades, for protests, which are limited temporally, it -- it -- it just seems wooden and rigid to say to all of a sudden say, well, it's a public forum for something that will last 30 years for which there is only limited space. It just doesn't make common sense.",
  "You're saying the last generation had much more freedom than the present one?",
  "Well, your -- you can stick with it as long as you want; that's what the - - the Tenth Circuit did, but suppose that we were to say that we were unconvinced by the comparison between speeches and parades on the one hand and monuments on the other, so we did not apply the public forum analogy. Would that be the end of your case?",
  "Yes. What -- what - -",
  "I don't -- I don't wish to delay your reading, but -- but as -- as part of the decision we have to make, don't we have to have in the background the consideration of the -- that the -- the potentiality that the union might do just what it did here, and that would help, it seems to me, inform our decision on the question that you are presenting. Now, whether or not it's properly raised here, I do agree with you it comes rather late. But isn't it a factor that we must necessarily consider?",
  "Well, that -- that means that if there is z totally frivolous claim and the employer -- pardon me, the union says we are not going to arbitrate, the -- the employee still has the right to then proceed? The employer hasn't gotten very much.",
  "If you would -- if you would answer the question. The employer hasn't gotten very - -",
  "-- very much for the bargain.",
  "In the hard cases.",
  "But it hasn't got the ability to have the union help them weed out frivolous claims.",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure that employers nationwide would -- would - - would accept -- would accept that view.",
  "And again, maybe that's - - that's a reason for us not to reach it in this case.",
  "Suppose the employer did have the practice that the Chief Justice suggested, it tells each employee you have to sign an arbitration form, could the union in its collective bargaining negotiations say that you will withdraw this forum and that you shall not impose this obligation?",
  "I'm asking in your view if it came up to it, how would that be decided - -",
  "Because I'm concerned it's the same thing as the Chief Justice mentioned, I just don't think the employer is going to get very much under this interpretation. And that may, ultimately, hurt the employee.",
  "Is 1911 a stand-alone provision that would justify relief for you, or do we have to also refer to the general cost statute?",
  "Well, but let's assume that we think Congress can control this, this issue, this question. Now, I'm asking if 911 isn't a stand-alone section so that you can interpret it without reference to 1920.",
  "If I think this case is controlled by 1911, do I have to refer to 1920?",
  "Why can't you rest your case just on 1911?",
  "Are you saying that 1911 doesn't cover expert witness fees because it's not included within the term \"other necessary disbursements\"?",
  "Were they within 1911?",
  "Other necessary disbursements.",
  "Incidental to the case. You don't that think that covers expert witness fees?",
  "Well, but Justice Alito is saying we have discretion, we look for guidance, we have guidance from Congress. They have adhered to the $40 a day limit in very important cases; why don't we just say, Justice Alito is suggesting, that this is -- that this is a good guidepost for us and we will follow it?",
  "We are saying it's our discretion and our discretion is guided by what Congress has suggested so there is uniformity in the system and so forth.",
  "How do Special Master fees work? The Special Master always has fees and the parties I think usually divide them. How does that - - how is their authority to order them - -",
  "Well, I'm not sure that answer is -- is at all adequate. Number one, what is there, as Justice Breyer pointed out, that's so different about this case? Let's say one landowner secretly and intentionally is stealing another landowner's water, and -- and he has no legal right to do that. And the only way the injured landowner can recover is to hire a very, very expensive expert, a hydrologist. And by the time he goes to court, he is really going to lose the benefit of the damages. Congress has said too bad. That's the way it is. Why isn't it that way with States, especially, as Justice Breyer said, when States can really afford the -- afford it better than the landowner. What's the difference?",
  "Of course, I think you gave the answer earlier. Rule 53 allows for the -- an order to say that one or both parties shall pay the special master fee. So if we are going to follow other analogies, we don't have much problem here with expert witness fees -- pardon me -- with special master fees. It's under Rule 53. Of course, you say we don't have to follow that as a model, but it is a model if we -- if we were to look to congressional and -- and to other rules.",
  "Do you think it includes printing fees?",
  "You don't -- you don't think that - -",
  "-- what number here? You don't think that 1911 would allow the clerk to charge for printing fees?",
  "Well, the reason I ask is because printing, in 1920, printing and witness fees are in -- in the same sentence.",
  "So if you allowed printing, then I think it would allow witnesses under 1911. Citing Crawford Fitting, this Court made clear that no statute will be construed to authorize taxing witness fees and costs, unless it refers explicitly to witness fees.",
  "Except 1911 may do two things. Number one it may authorize the Supreme Court to fix the fees to be charged by the clerk. And then in the second paragraph it for taxing of those fees, the cost of serving process and other necessary disbursements; so it does two things.",
  "Would you agree that this Court invented the cause of action?",
  "I think maybe what Justice Ginsburg was beginning to get at is my question here. I assume that BTA is the most rigorous of the standards set forth in the statute. You can argue with that assumption, but grant me the assumption for the moment. If BTA is more rigorous than the other standards, what is it in the regulations that reflects the agency's concurrence with that? What is there in the agency regulations that indicates that there is a more rigorous examination under BTA than the other standards?",
  "Why didn't it use BPT or -- or one -- one of the other standards?",
  "If they are different, then one is either less rigorous or more rigorous.",
  "Do you agree that this is a Chevron case?",
  "Could the -- could the agency mandate a closed-cycle system, recirculating system - -",
  "-- for a whole plant? Could they -- under your view, could the agency, given its Chevron latitude, mandate closed circulation?",
  "Just under the statute.",
  "But it -- it seems to me -- of course, there are limits on what the agency can do, but if it couldn't mandate the closed circulation system -- I think I've got the term right -- if it could not do that, then this is not -- you're backing away from Chevron.",
  "It does provide for a waiver of sovereign immunity and says that the State will respond in damages. It might be -- I'm not sure - - that many prisoners would prefer this. They have got a solvent -- I hope they're solvent -- defendant.",
  "Well, we can just mark that place in the record. It -- it does seem to me that there is some real benefits to the prisoners under - - under the New York scheme. It's -- many counsel may think it's preferable than to sue under 1983.",
  "Suppose the -- the New York legislature said, you have a choice, you can bring a 1983 suit or you can bring this sort of suit against the State, and the State will respond to damages, but you can't do both. Can they do that?",
  "No, no, I said in the alternative.",
  "All right. Now, suppose they do it -- they say -- we are just talking about the State courts: you can't bring both types in State courts. You can still have your Federal cause of action in the Federal court, and we will also give our cause of action where the State's law is violated, but not both in the New York courts.",
  "You are being generous when you said that we would recall -- at least that I would recall the case. Is it Idaho, did you say, or Johnson?",
  "It was Johnson. I thought you said Idaho.",
  "Suppose that the State of New York said that in suits against corrections - - against the corrections department, against the State, there should be no damages awarded to a prisoner in excess of $3,000; and then the - -",
  "-- and then 1980 -- and then the prisoner tries to bring a 1983 suit in State court.",
  "Would the case -- would the analysis be just the same?",
  "In my hypothetical, do you think it undermines the Federal claims?",
  "But why can't it be argued here that Congress has an important mechanism in holding prison officials -- prison correctional officers - - personally liable, so that they are themselves aware that they have a constitutional obligation that is enforceable against them, and New York has taken this away? Now you may -- we may argue that if the State responds in damages, the prisoner is better off; but Congress has not made that judgment. Congress has made the judgment that the correctional officer himself or herself should be responsible.",
  "No, it has made that judgment. That's the whole purpose of 1983.",
  "No, the correctional officer, under the scheme we are talking about, is not responsible in damages.",
  "But -- does your case turn on whether or not there is an indemnification agreement?",
  "I shouldn't think so. That hasn't been your argument so far.",
  "One of the concerns I have in this case is the scope of employment is often litigated, and it would seem to me that the State of New York might routinely say, oh, this is not within the scope of employment.",
  "Which -- which means that this is a very difficult distinction and is a further burden on the 1983 ride.",
  "I think that's a rather routine defense. But why are they -- why are they left in the supreme court?",
  "When was this statute first enacted?",
  "1983 does not -- correct me if I am wrong -- does not allow punitive damages against a State, does it?",
  "Not -- if I got that right, not in Monell.",
  "Even in Monell -- even in Monell there is no punitive damages against the State, which is another reason you -- you were discriminating against the employee here -- against the prisoner. Because the prisoner could get punitive damages against the correctional officer but not against the State in either court.",
  "In neither court can you get -- and correct me if I am wrong -- punitive damages against the State, which never - -",
  "He can under Monell.",
  "In that same act they might rescind the -- the laws allowing the State to respond in damages, in which case you won't obtain very much.",
  "Well, but I -- it sounds to me like that you are confirming my concerns.",
  "Oh. Oh, you're -- you are saying that if our law had been clear at the time, that she still wouldn't have given the instruction?",
  "So your -- your contention is, is that this trial court and the counsel in the case had all the guidance necessary to give the correct instruction - -",
  "-- before -- before we even announced the rule?",
  "But we do that all the time in cause and prejudice cases. We do it all the time - -",
  "-- because of the importance of the constitutional right.",
  "But it serves very little interest. Nothing the trial judge would have done, nothing the plaintiff's counsel has done below, nothing that the intermediate clause would have done, would have -- would have been different if they had submitted what they call the \"correct in all respects\" rule. If they had filed the \"correct in all respects\" rule and submitted that rule -- if she had said, judge, I want to type a little piece of paper, everything would have been the same.",
  "I excluded the Oregon Supreme Court from my list of -- of participants who would have done something differently.",
  "And as between the two courts, the court of appeals, the Veterans Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, do we owe either of them, maybe not deference in the Chevron sense, but some deference because of their expertise in dealing with these claims, and if that is so then do we owe more deference to the court of appeals or the Veterans Court?",
  "I mean it's an issue of law, so I take it it's de novo.",
  "But in the exercise of that review, don't we have to give some weight to the determination of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims that sees these claims all the time? I actually thought that that's where you were going to start out because you cited 7261, which says that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Claims shall, what, give due effect to -- take due account of the rule of prejudicial error. And I think you could get from that that they have a certain amount of latitude in determining what the best rule is. But you're not going to -- you don't tell us that?",
  "In your case did your client attend the initial hearing?",
  "Well, what's the first time that your client knew that this claim was going to be processed at a particular time or the first time your client knew it had been denied? I just was never clear on the fact of what happened. If the notice was lost in the mail, so how did she know there was a hearing at all, or did she?",
  "I'm just trying to -- it seems to me at the first hearing, if she in fact is there, they say, well, now you have to give us some notice. And then at that point -- or some documentation, and at that point, at the initial hearing, everybody knows who has to produce what.",
  "Is there usually an initial hearing?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, the -- the statute says, and this is consistent with Justice Breyer's line of questioning, that the Veterans Court, the Court of Appeals, the Veterans Court of Appeals, shall give due account to the notice -- to the rule of prejudicial error. That seems to me to indicate that it has some discretion in how to decide the harmless error rules that it will apply, and that it knows more about it, in Justice Breyer's term, than either we or the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Why can't I get that out of this statute?",
  "Well, it just tells that the Secretary requests the claimant provide any evidence in the claimant's possession that pertains to the claim.",
  "That's fairly straightforward.",
  "But what about the notice, the original notice? They don't have a lawyer at that point? That was Justice Souter's question. I didn't - -",
  "If I could just ask some -- everything you said is applicable to a predatory price claim as well as a price squeeze?",
  "Well, you don't certify questions; you certify orders. And in the certification of this order, I take it, your position was in support of what the district court did and in support of what the court of appeals did, correct?",
  "You made -- you made - - you made an argument, or did you not, that is consistent with what the court of appeals did hold in this case?",
  "Was the court of appeals' decision consistent with the argument that you made to the court of appeals?",
  "Is the first -- is the first time that you indicated that you were in agreement with the Gould dissent in your -- the brief that you filed here in this Court?",
  "But it - -",
  "-- it seems to me that, in that instance, you seriously prejudiced the Petitioners here, and that that should be weighed heavily against you when you ask to -- for permission to amend your complaint in the district court.",
  "I mean, there have - - there have been costs and time - -",
  "Nor did you give notice to the Petitioners' attorney that that was your position so you could have asked for a stipulation on the point.",
  "Has the Brooke Group complaint been allowed in the district court or was it --",
  "Yes, it was?",
  "Well, would you say that absent the regulatory regime, there would be a duty to deal here?",
  "No. No. My question was: Was there a duty to deal under the antitrust laws? Because it seems to me the only reason that there is a duty to deal is because of the regulation. So, you use the regulation in order to establish the duty, but then you don't want to go to the regulators to regulate the price. And it seems to me that that's inconsistent.",
  "It's still seems to me that you, therefore, must rely on the regulation to establish the initial predicate of a duty to deal. And You rely on the regulation that far, but you don't want to go to the regulators to -- to argue about the price. You want us to look at regulation first and antitrust law second. Why can't we just look at this case as purely antitrust; and then, as Justice Breyer said, if it's a regulatory problem, go to the regulators.",
  "Where am I going to find footnote 6?",
  "And when -- when did the court indicate in -- in Tennessee that you had access to the file?",
  "Oh, I thought that was 2000 -- when was that?",
  "And the Brady claim has been pending in the Federal courts but just not decided since about 2001?",
  "Can you tell me what - - can you tell me what is this -- let's suppose that - - that you have -- had an initial Brady claim that there was one part of the file that you were entitled to see that said that there is some evidence that he's a drug addict -- user. And you take that Brady claim up. Later you find out -- you have access to a new file and you find cumulative information plus the information that he was dazed or something, which may not be very -- what's our test to determine whether the Brady claim has been exhausted?",
  "Or have we talked about that?",
  "Do you think that the material described by Justice Breyer would have been excluded by the trial court as irrelevant if it had been introduced, or cumulative as - -",
  "Do you think the prosecutor had an ethical duty to turn over this material?",
  "Well, initially Brady leaves the judgment for, furthering Justice Souter's point, to the attorney for the defense. You're saying that the prosecutor can preempt the role of the attorney for the defense in deciding what to offer to the court as material? And if -- and if -- and if -- even if the evidence is in a gray area, that's for the defense attorney to decide under -- under our Brady jurisprudence, as I understand it. Correct me if that's wrong.",
  "It's outside the record and not really relevant to the case. Has he been on death row since 1984 or so? And if so, is that solitary confinement? Is he not allowed -- if you know?",
  "I didn't hear your first -- in your opening. Did you say that Mimms established that it's likely that he's armed and dangerous? I missed that.",
  "I'm sure it wasn't, but I missed what you said on that point.",
  "Thank you.",
  "So in your view, or I suppose the government's view -- well, I'll let the government argue for itself. In your view, if the officer is just looking for the man in the gray overcoat and he stops someone on the street and says, have you seen a man with a gray overcoat, and the person says, well, I saw something like that, can he just suddenly spin him around and pat, and pat that person?",
  "I guess what you're saying is that if there is a stop of the passenger and an interrogation of the passenger, the passenger can't say, incidentally, this is consensual, and thereby avoid a pat down?",
  "And it seems to me there is some indication that that's what happened here if you credit the police officer's testimony.",
  "In other words, you can have consent within the context of a stop that has not yet ceased.",
  "The white light is on. I don't want to -- but your opening argument that you presented indicated that a seizure is not necessary. You -- you wanted a further rule.",
  "If the officer believes that a person is armed and might be dangerous, then they can pat down. That's -- that's the rule that you proposed, I thought.",
  "No, I disagree with that. The holding there was that the passenger was stopped, the passenger was seized, so this was a pat down in the context of an ongoing seizure.",
  "Well, even if that's true, why don't we accept Mimms with the gloss of Brendlin?",
  "But that - -",
  "Well, we didn't think it was a factual question in -- in Brendlin. In Brendlin we said even when the wrongdoing -- this is at page 7 - - even if the wrongdoing is only bad driving, the passenger will expect to be the subject of some scrutiny. And his attempt to leave the scene would be so obviously likely to prompt an objection from the officer that no passenger would feel free to leave in the first place. And that's why we held there was a seizure. You're basically arguing with the premise of Brendlin.",
  "Brendlin says no passenger would like -- would feel free to leave during the course of the investigation. And -- and I would have to agree with that as a -- as a common-sense matter. It would be amazing to me that this fellow said: I'm not going to talk to you anymore; I'm leaving; and -- and the -- and the police officer would allow it, particularly when the police officer, we know, searched the person.",
  "You -- you don't concede in this case, or do you, that Trevizo had a reasonable suspicion that Johnson was armed and dangerous? That has not been found for purposes of - -",
  "So even if you did not prevail, we would have to remand on that point?",
  "I have two questions -- I have two questions that might be related. You began by saying that you had two points for us.",
  "You said the first was that the court erred in saying that there was a -- a violation had been alleged.",
  "And I wanted to reach the second, and I was wondering if the second would address this sub-question that I have. If we were to say that Twombly is to be confined to the antitrust and commercial context, would -- would that destroy your case?",
  "I do have the same lingering doubts as Justice -- or concerns or questions as Justice Breyer. It's hard for me to believe we had to wait for Twombly in order to have this, and it seems to me Rule 11 is not applicable here because it simply works after the fact.",
  "Was this statute effective 180 days after its -- after signature?",
  "But -- but doesn't the risk or the potential of a fixed-fund pension plan where employees who are not parties to this action receive less? Isn't there at least that possibility?",
  "And shouldn't that possibility be weighed in the decision of this Court? I think that's the line of questioning here.",
  "And there's no realistic possibility that some pensions are based on a fixed fund which has been established already?",
  "But I take it that this decision you want us to write applies across the board to all plaintiffs.",
  "Well, when you say there's relatively little amounts of money, can you tell us what amount -- what the maximum amount would be involved? Are you --",
  "Would it be less than",
  "Would it be -- for the whole suit?",
  "Would that be a million -- a million dollars?",
  "But that -- that's a small amount of money, a million -- millions of dollars?",
  "I was going to ask that question. In other words, there are cases or at least it is contemplated that there will be cases under the rules, where the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal does determine that there should or should not be an offset.",
  "Yes.",
  "But going back to the main issue, the only reason that this is at issue before the Iran tribunal is because it might be a setoff in the event of judgment in favor of Iran?",
  "But how is that affected -- how is that affected depending on whether or not the judgment is executed or not. Would the Iran tribunal have the authority to order Cubic not to satisfy the judgment, but to just hold the funds?",
  "I don't know that it's the subject of the award. And it's really not at issue; it's just recognizing that there has been some prior transaction.",
  "But Iran might say in the tribunal, in responding to the setoff argument, this claim that we brought against you, the United States, implicates a breach of obligations that you have that are un -- somewhat unrelated to what was at issue in the -- in the -- in the Cubic judgment. And then the United States would say, no, that's not true. So they would have to examine the Cubic judgment. So that means it's at issue before the court.",
  "There might be in the setoff proceedings. There might -- there might be an argument that there are two obligations, and there is a setoff or that there is a setoff.",
  "Well, I think we might get - -",
  "-- substantial -- a substantial degree of argument on that point.",
  "Well, but he couldn't find it inappropriate, could he? If you're again talking about the plain language of the statute, I don't see there's much room for the district judge to say: Well, now, I'm not going to say that you have to participate in further state post-conviction proceedings, the unexhausted claim. It seems to me under your reading of the statute the appointed counsel, say in an unexhausted claim instance, would have to under the statute represent the defendant in further State collateral post-conviction proceedings.",
  "So you would interpret \"all available post-conviction process\" as meaning federal?",
  "I just want to make clear what your position is. Federal determination on habeas corpus, that there are unexhausted claims, ordered to return to the State court: Is the appointed counsel required under the statute to represent the defendant in the State court in further post-conviction proceedings?",
  "Do you have to take that position? But that is your - -",
  "But that is your position?",
  "The government's principal concern in this case is the possibility to potential, assuming the Petitioner prevails, of appointment of counsel in State post conviction collateral proceedings, i.e., when there are unexhausted claims. Apparently the Sixth Circuit in bank addressed this, and in your brief you indicated there is a number of additional claims. Is that the principle thrust of your concern rather than clemency?",
  "You think there is no way to interpret that the statute so that it could include state clemency proceedings but only federal post conviction review proceedings in judicial -- before judicial tribunals?",
  "If the discharge comes from a single pipe, is it always one or the other, or can it ever be both fill and - -",
  "What happens if the agencies disagree as to whether it's fill? If 404 says it's fill, EPA says it isn't, can the EPA then veto it on that ground?",
  "But there are still going to be cases, I would assume very close cases, even under the present standard, where there could be disagreement.",
  "So do we decide -- we decide this case on the assumption that this is fill? Do you agree that this is fill?",
  "Well, then the question that we've put earlier is whether or not a single pipe contained both, and you say that it can contain both.",
  "It's one -- visibly, it's one stream, but you say it consists of two things.",
  "Is it both slurry -- is it both fill and non-fill?",
  "You say this is 404; it's not 402 - -",
  "It is 306?",
  "But it is fill.",
  "But I thought -- I thought your brother would say: But that does not respond to 306 effluent.",
  "At some point during the oral argument, and perhaps at the beginning because it is the beginning inquiry: When there is an evidentiary hearing, how does the standard for the court of appeals differ than when there has been no evidentiary hearing?",
  "Well, let me put it - -",
  "Let me put it this way: We're the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, let's assume. What effect do we give to what the district court did, and how would that -- how would the case be different than if we were simply reviewing the same situation and it came from the State court? What's the difference?",
  "We just pretend the hearing didn't happen?",
  "Do we look to the Federal court evidentiary hearing as part of the analysis to determine whether what the State court did was reasonable? And you -- and you have -- you have thought about this, and obviously the problem is, since the California appellate courts didn't see the hearing, this is an artificial exercise, and you know the problem.",
  "Did at any point -- did the State at any point challenge the correctness, the propriety, of holding the Federal evidentiary hearing?",
  "And if so, is that before us?",
  "But -- so then -- so then we do look at the facts. I don't want to take up your or the Court's time on this any more, but I remain puzzled, I have to tell you, about what to do with this hearing. I went through it at great length. It's very careful factfinding, really.",
  "But I -- I just don't know how to fit that with the standard when I look at the - - the reasonableness of the -- of the State court decision.",
  "Well, if -- if the Profitt -- the Fifth Circuit -- Profitt, the Fifth Circuit case, applies in the Ninth, Ninth Circuit, and I would think it would, just as the magistrate judge thought that it would, then that would be -- present a very close case and it would probably require reversal of the State court, wouldn't you think, if the Profitt rule applied? What is it, the \"all or\" -- not \"all or nothing\" - -",
  "\"Nothing to lose.\"",
  "Why is it, then -- if we say that and if Profitt is inconsistent with that, do we then remand or do we say on this record clearly it was reasonable? Obviously you want us to do the latter, I take it?",
  "Don't we have to go - - don't we have to say that this was reasonable?",
  "Of course.",
  "He didn't use the word \"functional equivalent\" in the portions I read. Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong about that.",
  "And he told the trial judge, \"I've got an uphill\" - -",
  "-- almost perpendicular. And he had -- each and every one of those experts in their affidavits, in their reports, had said that he didn't have deliberation or premeditation. They were getting ready for that. And he felt that this would be devastating cross-examination material because the jury had already found the opposite -- they had already disbelieved the expert on this point. Now, it's true, it's true, that knowledge of wrongfulness is probably slightly more extensive than premeditation. But based on the defense that he was going to present -- he didn't know what he was doing at this time -- he had a very, very difficult obstacle to overcome.",
  "So you are saying the judge had no discretion whatsoever?",
  "But couldn't he also give life. He could also give the maximum, which was life, couldn't he, or am I wrong?",
  "Well, it's hard for me to believe that he didn't. He -- he has tried a hundred cases. He had moot or mock -- mock trials where he was asking the experts these questions with the co-counsel. And you want us to say that he didn't understand the law? And there is no -- there is no finding to that effect. There's no finding to that effect: That he did not understand the law by the magistrate.",
  "By the magistrate, there was no finding to that effect.",
  "But they didn't -- they didn't strike the experts' testimony. The experts testified at some length, the -- the psychiatrist.",
  "So that was relevant to premeditation and deliberation, and the jury did consider what the mental health expert said.",
  "Please correct me if I'm wrong, but as a general rule psychiatrists don't - - don't testify as to the ultimate standard. They testify as to the condition and -- and the symptoms of -- of the defendant, and then the jury makes that conclusion.",
  "Has he served his time so far in a regular institution?",
  "I just want to make sure I understood your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question. Assume a lawyer is appointed. The defendant says, \"Yes, I want my lawyer.\" He's in the jail cell. The policeman walks by, he says, \"I have a lawyer, but I want to talk to you now.\" Can the police talk to him?",
  "All right. Well, then it seems to me that the Miranda protections give you all - - or, the Miranda rules give you all the protection you need.",
  "Well, I'm wondering if there is some further rule, could the prosecutor talk to the defendant if the defendant was in the cell and the prosecutor walked by, saying, \"I know you have an attorney, but I would like to talk to you\"? Could the prosecutor do that consistently with the Sixth Amendment?",
  "Really? The lawyer - -",
  "The lawyer can talk to a client for another lawyer?",
  "Well, again, if that's - - if that's the principle that you're operating on and that you'd concede, then I think the Miranda warnings would suffice to give all the protection you need.",
  "But wouldn't that be a Miranda problem?",
  "Miranda.",
  "You think, given Moran, that there was no Miranda violation here?",
  "Well, of course, they know -- it's a death case -- that counsel is going to be appoint -- or it's a murder case -- that counsel is going to be appointed. Everybody knows that except this defendant. He doesn't know; of course he doesn't know.",
  "One of my concerns is that Jackson is a formality, but you're arguing for a formality on top of a formality. I don't know what functional purpose is served by your position that he has to request the lawyer at the arraignment, especially when he's not versed in the law, he's in this stressful situation, and you require a formalistic request on the part of the defendant? It just makes no sense to me.",
  "No, you're requiring some kind of ritualistic phrase to indicate that he -- that he accepts the appointment.",
  "That he requests the appointment.",
  "But this is still an artificial framework, because we know that in this case he has to have a lawyer under Gideon unless he waives it after being fully advised. You couldn't rely just on - - on the failure to make a request not to proceed with a trial lawyer. Of course he's going to have a lawyer unless after he very, very careful colloquy from the district judge or the trial judge, declines. So it seems to me that this -- this whole framework here is quite artificial. Now, I do think there's a Miranda problem here, if we accept his -- the defendant's testimony that the police told him, \"oh no, you don't have a lawyer.\" I know there's a factual issue on that. And I -- I think the counsel for the Petitioner may not be quite correct in Moran v Burbine. I didn't have time to talk with him about that. There there was no misleading; they just didn't tell him that he had a lawyer. Here, assuming his version of the facts is correct, they told him, \"oh, no, you don't have a lawyer,\" they affirmatively misled him, and it seems to me that's a Miranda problem, if it's true, and that Miranda is completely sufficient to protect his rights.",
  "But the Chief Justice's question, I'm interested in it as well, are there instances in which a State-appointed counsel can delay and have that not attributed to the State? Is it always attributed to the State - -",
  "Just because he's State - -",
  "There is a delay, but it's not attributable to the State.",
  "But you -- you imported -- I'm looking at your quotation from Turkette, at page 5 of your brief. It doesn't seem to me conclusive of your point. In order to answer Justice Scalia, you had to interpolate, to add various words. You had to say - - you said an ongoing organization with directions or something to that effect. That is not what Turkette says. Turkette says \"as proven by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, that is continuing.\" That's all it says.",
  "Basically, you described this -- this gang. One -- one person is a guard. The other person brings the hook to pull the -- the box off. Another person scouts it out. Another person's got the scanner. It seems to me to fit precisely what you have just described.",
  "Isn't it pretty clear that if the -- the person who is supposed to be the lookout doesn't perform his job, he is not going to be included in that next heist?",
  "But -- but you -- you would instruct the jury that if these three thefts that are covered by RICO occurred over a period of a year, and they involved lookouts and scanners and so forth, you may infer from these acts an enterprise as defined by the statute?",
  "You would allow that instruction?",
  "Where -- where in your briefs or in the materials do we find the definition of what the enterprise is, other than in the statute, other than the terms of the statute itself?",
  "I mean, in other -- what do I refer to in order to supplement the instruction that I just noted -- that I just suggested?",
  "That's at the bottom of 111 where it said you can look to see what it does and make the inference rather than have -- I forget -- an abstract analysis?",
  "So you want to us make the inference that the impermissible or criminal activity was permitted by the absence of this specific clause. You say there is no implied condition, no implied covenant?",
  "Well, the questions so far indicate that one of the promises was an implied promise that you will keep the terms of the agreement by lawful behavior. So that just -- what you say just begs the question. Now, I recognize the government has conceded a breach, and we will probably move on from that point. But, as Justice Scalia indicates, it puts the case in a very artificial posture, it seems to me.",
  "Under the law of contracts I assume -- I haven't looked it up yet -- that you can't rescind for a nonmaterial breach. A trivial breach doesn't always allow recision. And isn't it trivial if the district court said: You know, I don't care if the Attorney General of the United States and the Solicitor General himself both came into the court on their hands and knees begging me to do this. I wouldn't do this. I wouldn't give you an increase.",
  "So it seems to me an immaterial breach, other than as to one level -- and correct me if I am wrong. I take it as to level one - - or as to the third level, they need the recommendation before they have the authority to reduce. Am I right about that?",
  "There are some instances in which the -- the prosecution must make the recommendation before the district judge has the authority to depart downward, am I correct?",
  "That's right. So -- so this -- this district judge, I take it, did not have the authority to go down by -- by a third without the recommendation?",
  "Even as to the third level, the district judge said, you know, I will assume that they have made the argument. I will assume they have made the argument. I wouldn't hear the -- I -- I wouldn't grant -- I wouldn't follow the recommendation. I am not going to depart downward even assuming the government -- it seems to me that there is -- the government's breach is immaterial.",
  "My reading of Santobello is the same as yours on that point, and it's difficult for me to understand.",
  "Well, but I take it -- you never really answered Justice Alito's question. I take it that the defendant and his counsel can knowingly recognize that an error is being committed, say nothing, listen to the sentence, and then object later. That's your position, yes or no?",
  "Just to explore the issue of breach for a moment, suppose hypothetically, same facts here, but it is all vented and discussed and aired and objected to in the district court.",
  "The defense attorney says, well, now, if you look at paragraph 8 and so forth, and the government says, well, Your Honor, well, he committed another crime. And then the judge says -- and we are not going to move for the recommendation. And the judge says: I will assume that you made the recommendation, and I will just tell you right now I wouldn't take the recommendation anyway. I'm not going -- I wouldn't give a lowered sentence even if you made the objection. What result?",
  "Is it? Because in Santobello there was no reason given for the prosecutor to violate the plea agreement. Here there's a good reason. Can you distinguish Santobello on that basis?",
  "Well, it would be consistent with the second purpose that you gave to say that there's a six-hour safe harbor, whatever term you want to call it, and beyond six hours the Court is free to reexamine its supervisory rule in light of what Congress has provided in (a) and (b) of the statute.",
  "It is a little bit odd to say that Congress has built a statute around a supervisory rule, but taken away the authority of this Court to reexamine the supervisory rule.",
  "Well, you were trying to get to page 7 of your yellow brief?",
  "Well, is it your position that the McNabb-Mallory rule serves purposes other than to ensure the voluntariness of the statement?",
  "And that's what you're trying to reach here?",
  "But if that's true, then why is it that we would suppress the confession if it's completely voluntary? I mean, what's the link between some other end that's being served by McNabb-Mallory - -",
  "-- something other than voluntariness and suppressing the confession?",
  "But why do we want to avoid delay in presentment? What reason do we give? And I assume there are reasons that -- to contact family and so forth -- other than voluntariness.",
  "What do those rights have to do with a confession that is conceded, for our analytic purposes, to be voluntary?",
  "But all you are doing is trying to have an enforcement mechanism for this by the wholly unrelated remedy of suppressing the confession if it's voluntary. If it's not voluntary, of course, it's related.",
  "So you are saying a confession can be coercive and still voluntary?",
  "Did the government -- I thought the government said that an empirical database would be the Ninth Circuit, which has the more generous rule.",
  "My understanding is that stays are granted in a very high percentage of those cases. I would be curious to know, A, the percentage of the cases in which it's granted; and B, the percentage of those cases that are ultimately decided in favor of the government?",
  "Well, is it true that there are more petitions filed in the courts with the more generous standards?",
  "Just to refresh my recollection, what -- what is the major difference between the standards that -- or the findings that the judge must make, (a) to grant a preliminary injunction and (b) to grant a stay?",
  "My -- my concern is that I sense in this statute a congressional concern that stays are too frequently granted. And one thing we could do, if we were to accept your view of the statute, is to say: And you must be very careful. Well, the courts don't listen to that very much. And short of granting the -- accepting the government's position, I don't know what you could do if there were a -- a submission and understanding that stays were being granted routinely and too frequently.",
  "Are there other cases in which clear and convincing -- the clear and convincing standard applies to appellate courts? It seems to me clear and convincing is more appropriate for a factual determination at the trial court level.",
  "Yes, but you still have a differential on the Friday to Monday night hypothetical. You wouldn't apply, or would you, the same standard that you would apply on Monday for the next -- on Monday for the next year and a half?",
  "Because you have the same problem under your standard as the government does under its.",
  "You think that if you do not prevail, and we say clear and convincing evidence is the standard, that courts are not entitled to consider equity?",
  "About your position, is it your contention that if we grant -- if we determine clear and convincing is the standard, that equities are not relevant to that calculus?",
  "Are there cases in the courts of appeals where Indian tribes litigate with the Secretary and claim an abuse of discretion for the way in which the Secretary performs the duties with respect to Indian lands?",
  "I -- I recognize that, but I want to know, is there a body of law in the Federal Circuit that generally recognizes that the -- that the Secretary has a fiduciary obligation that's enforceable as a matter of administrative law?",
  "I meant all of the circuits.",
  "Well, what I was asking was whether there was some doctrine that the -- that the trustee -- that the Secretary acts in a capacity, a fiduciary capacity as a trustee. If that doctrine were out there, then that might be the basis for saying that it's a sufficient foundation for a money damages. I was just asking, is that doctrine there?",
  "Well, give me an -- an instance in the statute that is in opposition brief of the orange brief at page 5. Give me an example of why the last clause \"and such disposition shall create no liability on the part of the United States,\" what contingency was that directed to if not the one that is before us?",
  "Well, that - -",
  "But it says \"the development or utilization of natural resources.\"",
  "Well, why isn't it a public purpose to develop Indian minerals? That benefits the Indians and whole country.",
  "No, it says \"public.\"",
  "Well, even if -- if I may have just one minute, Justice Souter. If you get revenue from the natural resources, why isn't that a public, religious, educational purpose? They get revenue from leasing.",
  "I just -- I just think you give too cramped a reading to section 5.",
  "Just as an example, to follow up on Justice Breyer's question -- and then can you answer his question -- many States have -- have rules that you have to be a resident of the county to serve on that jury. And suppose a juror thinks that he or she is a resident and gets the county line wrong or doesn't know what the residency requirement. Under your rule -- what is your term, an \"unlawful adjudicator.\" And then we have a -- we have a -- a Federal constitutional standard that requires structural error for any State -- for any violation of any State -- State rule. That is Justice Breyer's question.",
  "You are -- you are avoiding the question by saying, oh, don't worry, there are not going to be many violations of this sort, and then you pick out age. But Justice Breyer began -- the preface to his question was -- was that there are -- are manifold requirements varying from State to State.",
  "What you are giving us is a sweeping proposition, A, for the constitutional principles that you are setting forth; B, for the supervision and intrusion it would cause Federal courts on the State system.",
  "Well, our footnote in a later case authored by Justice Scalia indicates considerable doubt as to the viability and to the correctness of that formulation in Swain.",
  "Salazar, I think, is the - -",
  "No. No. I thought you were citing Swain -- and I think you are going to have to establish -- that peremptory -- to win your case, that there is a constitutional basis, a constitutional right to exercise a peremptory challenge, at least - - then you can you have a subset of that -- when the State gives it to you. But I think Swain no longer stands for that proposition.",
  "But -- but how -- how could it do that if there were not some underlying Federal constitutional right? I say \"how could it do that.\" It obvious that they did it; but what -- what would be the principle basis for that analysis? What would be the analytic framework that would lead it to look to the Federal decisions? This is a State issue.",
  "But we are asking you what the analytic justification for that course of reasoning is if that is indeed its course of reasoning.",
  "Well, but you have to give us a sustainable analytic framework if -- if we are going to reverse their decision.",
  "What -- what case would you cite for that proposition? And you can't say Michigan versus Long.",
  "Isn't this Johnson versus Standard Oil and that sort of thing?",
  "For the reasons that have been discussed, it may be that we won't get to the merits of the Petitioner's argument, but assuming we do, the Petitioner talks about the -- I don't have -- the \"unlawfully constituted jury.\" Is -- is -- what is the extinction distinction between the hypothetical case of the juror who isn't a resident of the county and the State says you have to be a resident of the county - - what is the distinction between that and, say, a non-Article III judge sitting on a court of appeals panel? Why is one structural and the other not?",
  "And this would -- this would be a little different than the juror who might be biased or might not be biased, because this goes to a hard qualification. It's just a hypothetical in the case, but it's a -- it's a linchpin to the Petitioner's argument.",
  "Well -- but the hypothetical is it doesn't -- the juror doesn't satisfy the requirement because he or she is from the wrong county.",
  "What was that case?",
  "Oh, Illinois - -",
  "I will use that as an examination question but let's hope it doesn't come up.",
  "But don't some of those courts, rather than focusing on the qualifications of the particular juror, look to the -- how close the case was?",
  "There are any number of alternatives that we can adopt in ruling for your position. If we were to rule for your position, what do you think is the most straightforward rationale?",
  "Well, suppose that it's Shell's truck -- that isn't this case, but suppose it's Shell's truck, and every time they make a delivery the driver catches the waste in a can, four or five gallons, and dumps it in the creek. Is Shell liable there under the statute?",
  "I mean, hasn't it arranged for the disposal of the - -",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that I agree with your answer. Can you give me an example under this statute where Shell might be an arranger -- give me some hypothetical in which Shell would be an arranger?",
  "Why isn't that the case in my hypothetical -- it's just a hypothetical -- where the driver catches the five gallons that spills out of the hose every week and dumps it in the creek?",
  "That's really the same as the question you answered Justice Souter, and that's an arranger under (3).",
  "Isn't it waste when it spills? You deliver -- you're supposed to deliver 100 gallons, 5 gallons spills; isn't that waste?",
  "They know that - - hypothetical. They know that in the course of delivery you're always going to spill about five gallons. That's waste.",
  "All I'm talking about is just a hypothetical definition of waste.",
  "But we were talking about waste, and I just wanted to get your agreement -- maybe you won't agree -- that when the product is delivered and 5 percent of it spills, that is waste, and we can talk about the other parts of it later.",
  "And I suppose the district court, if it wanted additional evidence, could have said, I want additional evidence on this point.",
  "Well, is Shell liable because it -- it knew of the transportation arrangements?",
  "Whether you have -- you might have knowledge that one chemical broker is more careless than another in the way the product was ultimately sold, I don't see why your theory doesn't make the seller liable as an arranger if it knows or ought to know that at some point in the distribution process there is likely to be spillage which will enter the waters of the United States. I think that's what your argument implies. I just don't see that in the statute.",
  "Ms. Sullivan, just on the apportionment point, do you agree that it is your burden to show that this is a divisible harm, and can you tell me how you showed that?",
  "I'm really concerned about the time and the white light, but I'm -- I'm not sure you answered the Chief Justice's hypothetical about $2 million, which is an initial clean-up that has to be expended no matter how large the -- the spill was. How did you discharge your burden of proof to show that that is not the case here or that that is divisible?",
  "But would the state of Hawaii, under Hawaii law, be entitled to take the position, if it so chose, that as the new owner of the lands, it has a special duty as a trustee that some other owner might not?",
  "But then -- then it's just a question of whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court - - assuming that it made the decision that I hypothetically stated -- whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court, as opposed to Hawaiian legislature, could make the determination of whether or not there is some special trust obligation imposed on the State of Hawaii by reason of its own duties.",
  "Well, I'm not sure it would be prudent when the great bulk of the opinion is based on the Apology Resolution. And I -- I certainly do think you have a powerful argument if the Apology Resolution presents us with a Federal question. But the more far-reaching question -- I just inferred - - suggests -- might not even be very specifically within the question presented, and even if it's fairly embraced, you used the word \"prudent.\" It seems prudent for us to confine our decision to the effect of the Apology Resolution and whether or not the Hawaiian Supreme Court got that part of that right.",
  "Would you agree that there would be a Federal question if the Hawaiian Supreme Court said the Apology Resolution dictates our results?",
  "Your whole case rests on a cloud on the title in favor of your clients. But you - - you ignore the cloud on the title that has been entered against the State.",
  "Would it be enough to go to the jury on the hypothetical Justice Alito gives you?",
  "You agree that you could go to the jury whenever there is an identity card that does reflect the identity of a real person but there is no other knowledge that the government's case is introduced that shows -- that there is no other evidence that the government has introduced showing knowledge?",
  "Suppose he has five different cards with five different real people, would that be enough to go?",
  "No, no. No. The fact that he testified, that doesn't have anything to do with whether or not the case goes to the jury. Does the government make its case sufficient to resist the motion -- the directed motion for acquittal if it just puts in the fact that you have five identity cards and there are five different people and they are all real people?",
  "No, no. You have to have the further inference that he knows that.",
  "That was going to be my next question. The next question is suppose it was the Petitioner's own name but somebody else's number.",
  "Even if he had five different cards, all with his name, but all with the identification numbers of other real people?",
  "Does he have to know that? Suppose he uses John Smith. Does it suffice that -- do we have to show that he knows there is a John Smith in the phone book, someplace in the United States?",
  "But I want an answer to the question.",
  "And it can't be submitted to the jury on the basis that anybody knows that there is a John Smith?",
  "Can -- can it go to the jury without any other evidence other than the fact that -- his possession of the card?",
  "Can you give me an example?",
  "But if you say this goes to the jury, it doesn't leave very much to your knowledge argument.",
  "I mean, I suppose that defense counsel can get up, say the government hasn't shown that he knew this, and then the government says that of course he knows it -- I don't think you have accomplished very much.",
  "It's not a clear -- what -- what if the accused knowingly uses a card - - identity belonging to a dead person? Is that a real person?",
  "What is your view?",
  "But do you read Vaughan v. Atkinson as necessarily implying punitive damages would be inappropriate? I can't quite find the negative that you want me to find, I think, in Atkinson. True, they didn't talk about punitive damages. They said damages are appropriate, and attorneys' fees in this case, which is what the district court gave, we are going to affirm it. But there's nothing there that said punitive damages are inappropriate.",
  "But that -- but that was a common law wrongful death action, correct, Miles?",
  "It was not admiralty maintenance and cure.",
  "As I read your reply brief -- and please correct me if it's a misimpression -- you didn't dispute the fact that punitive damages were available historically for the shipowner's wrongful refusal to provide maintenance and cure, or am I wrong about that?",
  "And what about English admiralty, under the English precedents?",
  "Of course, in Miles - - again, we're coming back -- was wrongful death, not maintenance and cure.",
  "But I just -- and you can go ahead and answer that question without my interrupting. But my assumption from reading the amicus briefs in this case is that punitive damages were awarded in some maintenance and cure cases (a) as simply part of the overall award -- they weren't separated out, but it was part of the measure -- and (b) that some American courts, American judges, including noted admiralty judges, awarded in some cases punitive damages in maintenance and cure before the modern cases Moragne and so forth -- and Miles -- that you're talking about. Is that incorrect?",
  "I'm talking pre-Miles. I'm talking pre-Miles.",
  "Well, surely there will be some incidents in which the employer in good faith thinks there's no illness, that there's no basis for",
  "For you to tell me oh, this will just never happen, I mean, that's not the way the world works.",
  "Well, of course there are going to be disputes, and the question is whether or not, just from the standpoint of filling professional responsibility, in almost any maintenance and cure action where the counsel for the plaintiff thinks that -- for the seaman thinks that the employer has been remiss, he doesn't add the punitive damages complaint if we agree with your position, which changes completely the settlement and the bargaining aspect. But you can address -- you can address that.",
  "If I thought that the lack of counsel in maintenance and cure cases was a pivotal point or a relevant point for our decision, other than the representations of counsel, where would I look to verify that?",
  "The -- the -- that there is a problem in seamen finding attorneys who will take maintenance and cure cases.",
  "Is that a separate cause of action? Or is it just part of the maintenance and cure act?",
  "Can you give me some idea of how many cases there are in, say, the last 10 years in which in State postconviction proceedings the convicted prisoner has asked for DNA evidence?",
  "Three? 300?",
  "Do you think there's a constitutional right to establish innocence in some cases where there is new and -- evidence that could not previously have been discovered, that has a high likelihood of exonerating?",
  "I'm asking for your position.",
  "But can we get an answer to Justice Alito's question -- a hypothetical, the one he put -- could you put that condition on a statute or a rule consistently with the constitutional of the United States?",
  "Well -- well, let's assume that counsel and the defendant -- after full discussion and being fully advised, say this is too dangerous; we don't want the DNA test; we'll shoot the dice; we're not going to have the DNA test. He loses. Can you then get the DNA test? Or, as Justice Alito's question pointed out, could you have a condition that when you've made this conscious choice, you lost your right for later DNA testing? That's what he asked. I still don't have the answer.",
  "Well, you seem to be sympathetic to that position. But as Justice Alito's question again points out, what you are doing is setting up a game in which it would be really unwise to have the DNA test. Take your chances.",
  "You have a -- you have a built-in -- you have a -- a built-in second chance.",
  "And that's just -- that's just not sound trial strategy, counsel, and you know that.",
  "On that -- on that point, I just want to make clear: In the present posture of this case, I take it that if the Federal Innocence Protection Act applied, he would not qualify?",
  "He - -",
  "Well, but -- but as the case now stands he does not qualify.",
  "As the case now stands, he does not qualify.",
  "You're -- you're, in effect, asking us -- and you would say the -- the Solicitor General appears here -- you're -- you're, in effect, asking us to say that the Federal Witness Protection Act on these facts is unconstitutional.",
  "May I -- may I just ask one point.",
  "I take it he is not now in custody for this offense?",
  "Not for this offense?",
  "He's being held on other changes.",
  "But he's not now in custody for this offense.",
  "Would you resist that request?",
  "You cannot confirm that you would acquiesce and recommend that he get the DNA sample under those conditions?",
  "Would there be instances when you, as the Attorney General of Alaska, would waive procedural defaults, in order to determine if there was guilt or innocence in a case where DNA conclusively proved it, simply pause of your interest in not confining innocent people?",
  "All you're can say in answer to my question is, to your particular approach to your duties here, is that that's conceivable?",
  "Well, of course, one of - -",
  "One of the things you're going to say is that, with all due respect, Justice Breyer, this conflates the merits with the jurisdictional problem, which is exactly the mistake that the court of appeals made. Is that your theory of the case?",
  "Well, what do you do with third party beneficiary assignment assumption?",
  "Well, in a way that was where one of the parties, without the other party's consent, say assignee, a third party beneficiary. Here in a way it's a fortiori because the party who is objecting, his or its own actions caused the agreement to come into play. That's their theory.",
  "Well, then, my -- my question in this case is this: In your petition for certiorari you said that, well, by the time you came here you would have a standard for us that we can work with. You know, all of us know, that a ruling in your favor means that law and motion practice will -- could -- could change drastically in States all across the country. Disqualification for bias will now become a - - a part of the pretrial process, and I'm asking you what your standard is. Your standard is an unacceptable risk of impropriety or perception of bias, but I -- I need some more specific standards within which to fit this case. You give a general standard, and then we hear about the amount of the contribution. We hear about the fact that it was a contested election, et cetera.",
  "But your -- your standard of -- of impropriety doesn't, it seems to me, give sufficient -- or \"unacceptable risk of bias\" doesn't give sufficient guidance to the courts to implement this rule unless it's just -- it's just going to be one case. Now, I know the law evolves on a case-by-case system. I understand that, but it doesn't seem to me that the standard you offer us is specific enough.",
  "I want you to articulate some substandards that have -- that are general in nature, that apply to this case, substandards that are more specific than the probability of bias.",
  "I want you to be able to elaborate your full theory of the case, but just so you know, it -- it does seem to me that the appearance standard has -- has much to recommend it. In part it means that you don't have to inquire into the actual bias; it's -- it's more objective. Now, of course it has to be controlled, it has to be precise. But I just thought that you know that I -- I do have that inclination.",
  "And we're asking -- we're asking what substance we can give to the constitutional protection.",
  "I -- I think you're quite right in the way you describe Tumey, but I wonder why is that the reason -- why is appearance never constitutional? Why should that be? Can you talk about that?",
  "But our whole system is designed to ensure confidence in our judgments.",
  "And it seems -- it seems to me litigants have an entitlement to that under the Due Process Clause.",
  "And then debt of gratitude -- we keep asking but your time is running out, have you said what you need to say on debt of gratitude?",
  "Well, suppose you had the girlfriend phone and say: My boyfriend needs drugs; meet him at the corner of 3rd and Main. What crime does the girlfriend commit? It seems to me that it's pretty clear that she's under 843(b) facilitating.",
  "It seems to me that she may then have committed a felony, and yet it seems to me that her culpability is certainly no -- no greater, if you're talking about your -- the polity of your statute, than the man who uses the drugs.",
  "Maybe Justice Ginsburg would like some further illustration, but I thought that that was one illustration in answer to her question.",
  "Well, but that was the same word. That was \"transporting\" in both instances. Here you have \"purchase,\" one, \"facilitating\" with a telephone, two. That's different.",
  "Well, I'll think about it, but I think Gebardi does involve one statute, one act, transportation. This involves two. The underlying felony is the purchase or possession, and the second statute is use of the telephone. So I don't -- I'll think about it, but I don't think Gebardi works.",
  "If the government were to prevail here, I assume that it would then as a result have a much larger, more expansive discretion in charging and plea bargaining and -- and et cetera. Other than the rule of lenity, is there anything in our cases that indicates that we should be cautious about giving the government that authority so that that's an aid in our interpretation or is that just all within the rule of lenity?",
  "Other than - -",
  "No background principles either way on granting the prosecutors vast discretion in charging - -",
  "-- as it applies to statutory interpretation?",
  "The call -- does the call have to be completed -- I mean, if he gets an answer saying \"Your call is important to us, but we're serving someone else\"?",
  "Carry -- carrying a weapon. A lot of statutes punish more severely for carrying weapons.",
  "But it -- can you tell me, how does it work? The district -- the United States Attorney in one State, one district, has a case like this where there are four different phone calls; and he doesn't like the looks of the defendant, or for some reason he can charge him, and in the neighboring jurisdiction the United States Attorney does not. Are there guidelines? Does the Department of Justice control this in each case? Is there some manual where we could see what the rules are for charging? Is it all at the discretion of the United States Attorney?",
  "You have to use or carry the firearm before -- before section 2 even applies.",
  "That's different.",
  "But in a sense that's Justice Scalia's point, that the jury has in effect told us nothing, and in effect that argument hurts your case in one sense. Hung counts are meaningless.",
  "Well, on that first theory, and your theory that a retrial on hung counts is always permitted, I -- I take it there are no court of appeals opinions or decisions that agree with you on that point, or am I incorrect?",
  "A different question: Suppose you prevail. The hung counts are retried. And the jury hangs again and the jury hangs a second time. Is there any point at which the district court can intervene in the exercise of its own authority and discretion just to dismiss the charges?",
  "Then the government can try year after year to get a conviction and were the defendant down? Nothing the Court can do so long as there's a hung jury?",
  "Is that the rule in all of the States? Don't some States give authority to the judges to say, enough is enough?",
  "But I -- I guess what - - what Justice Breyer is asking is -- I have the same question. If we concede -- and at the end of the day you might not concede this, but if we take this as a beginning point, that a short, 30-second, 1-minute campaign ad can be regulated, you want me to write an opinion and say, well, if it's 90 minutes, then that's different. I -- it seems to me that you can make the argument that 90 -- that 90 minutes is much more powerful in support or in opposition to a candidate. That's I -- that's the thrust of the questioning.",
  "Well, suppose it were an advocacy organization that had a book. Your position is that under the Constitution, the advertising for this book or the sale for the book itself could be prohibited within the 60 -- 90-day period -- the 60 -- the 30-day period?",
  "And I suppose it could even, is it the Kindle where you can read a book? I take it that's from a satellite. So the existing statute would probably prohibit that under your view?",
  "Just to make it clear, it's the government's position that under the statute, if this kindle device where you can read a book which is campaign advocacy, within the 60-30 day period, if it comes from a satellite, it's under -- it can be prohibited under the Constitution and perhaps under this statute?",
  "In -- in this case, Mr. Stewart, I take it -- correct me if I'm wrong -- that you think the distinction the Petitioner draws between the 90-minute film and the -- and the short 30-second or 1-minute ad is a baseless distinction?",
  "So if -- if we think that the application of this to a 90-minute film is unconstitutional, then the whole statute should fall under your view - -",
  "-- because there's no distinction between the two?",
  "But I'm -- I'm saying if we -- if we think that this is -- that this film is protected, and you say there's no difference between the film and the ad, then the whole statute must be declared --",
  "But you want us to say they're both the same? You want -- you argue that they're both the same.",
  "But just from the standpoint of literature, that's very odd. Suppose you have a film which is quite moving with scenery and music and magnificent acting, and the subtle message that may be far more effective in advocating, and everyone knows that. Everyone knows that.",
  "Well, part -- part of independence is the assurance that the court has the ability to do justice in the case before it, and I think the purpose of coram nobis or coram vobis is to protect the integrity of the court, and that's all this court is asking. So that's quite consistent with what you've just said.",
  "Well, but -- but you're shifting ground a little bit. The tenor of the questions from Justice Alito and Justice Ginsburg really is to the effect: Does coram nobis require an independent source of -- of jurisdiction? And I should think not.",
  "The whole idea of coram nobis is to protect the integrity of the jurisdiction the court already has.",
  "I -- I acknowledge that. But there is a source of jurisdiction here. Coram nobis is to ensure the accurate exercise of jurisdiction that the court has earlier asserted.",
  "You might say that there is a lurking constitutional question and that we ought to interpret the statute to avoid a constitutional concern.",
  "When you say it's lurking, you're -- you're invoking the doctrine of constitutional avoidance?",
  "Okay.",
  "In the civilian courts or the military courts?",
  "Well, let's assume it raised because Justice Breyer asked the question - -",
  "-- and I would be interested in the answer.",
  "In coram nobis cases in the civil system, do courts appoint special masters when they're an appellate court and they have to find out if coram nobis was - -",
  "Or do they use district courts as special masters?",
  "In this case, the court had to invent a procedural device: There's going to be a new court-martial, which is a little odd because it's a new court-martial sitting in judgment on somebody who isn't even in the military any more.",
  "But all of that is extra-statutory in your -- this instance?",
  "Can you answer my question?",
  "But why does the bankruptcy court have jurisdiction to enjoin third party actions against some creditor of the estate?",
  "But if those actions won't affect the estate at all, I just don't understand sort of the basic theory, and I don't really understand the theory of the plaintiffs' cases, either. I don't understand -- I can't figure out what anybody expects to collect from Travelers for what they did. The fact that they defended cases certainly was proper for them as an insurance company. This is mysterious case to me.",
  "But none of whom would be affected if these suits go forward, as I understand it. I'm missing something very important, I think.",
  "Why isn't it harmless error?",
  "Well, but it seems to me you - -",
  "Well, as to the 1986 order it seemed to me that the counsel for the Petitioner might have answered the question posed by the Chief Justice with the traffic accident hypothetical: That is an interesting question of subject matter jurisdiction, and maybe there is subject matter jurisdiction, maybe there isn't, but that issue as to the 1986 order is final. Now, that brings us to the -- the later order, 2004, 2006. And then the question is whether or not that's just a reiteration of the earlier order or a further expansion of jurisdiction that could be reached. Why couldn't the counsel for Petitioner have given that answer?",
  "But, putting aside questions of notice, if these parties had been represented in the appeal of the 1986 order, maybe the subject matter jurisdiction ruling was correct; maybe it was incorrect; but it's done.",
  "So then it's just a question of personal jurisdiction and notice. It is not a question of subject matter jurisdiction, because subject matter jurisdiction can be concluded in an earlier order and there can be no collateral attack if you've been a party.",
  "Settlement clauses often release future claims; standard stuff in a release clause.",
  "But that is subject matter jurisdiction and that is foreclosed. Now, if you are talking about personal jurisdiction that may be something else.",
  "But you're talking about subject matter jurisdiction and that has been foreclosed by the earlier Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion. And the court of appeals' opinion that we are reviewing now seems to conflate that issue.",
  "Well, but -- I just want -- you said that the Court has never imposed a burden of proof-shifting requirement absent a directive from Congress? Are you - -",
  "Or maybe -- maybe I misheard.",
  "All right.",
  "But your -- your position, you rest heavily on the argument, I think, but there is no textual support in the ADEA for a heightened evidence requirement in order to shift the burden of proof. But isn't it true there is no textural support for shifting the burden of proof at all? I mean, I don't see how you can -- can convince us of the first proposition without confronting the second.",
  "Well, of course, affirmative defenses, usually the burden of persuasion is on the party asserting the affirmative defense.",
  "Well, in -- in response further to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I think Justice Souter's, too, is there -- are there any tactical difficulties or strategic difficulties that counsel face if they don't quite know which way the burden is going to shift before trial: The -- the number of witnesses you have waiting in the hallway or -- this -- this would be after summary judgment.",
  "The Solicitor General says, well, this is going to affect Title VII. It's going to affect all kinds of other acts. This is a watershed.",
  "You -- pardon me?",
  "Because it's statutory.",
  "Let's -- let's assume we have authority to incorporate the Title VII jurisprudence into the ADEA area as a matter of choice. Are there reasons why there should be distinctions between the two regimes?",
  "Are there reasons of administration or fairness other than -- I recognize that one is statutory and the others would -- would be our case law.",
  "It's not often that we have disagreements as to the basic facts. The red brief says that the tax in question constitutes 11 percent of the tax base, and you talk about that in the reply brief. Can you spend just a little bit of time at the outset telling us your views of this tax? And although it's the Respondent's statement and not yours, do you think 11 percent of the tax base means 11 percent of what's collected under this tax or under all taxes imposed by City of Valdez?",
  "In which case, that seems really quite irrelevant.",
  "As you understand it, with reference to the tax base referred to in the red brief at page 14 where it says it's 11 percent of the tax base, is that tax base all city-imposed?",
  "Well, it says \"vessels of all kinds are liable to taxation as property in the same manner as other personal property.\"",
  "But your answer it seems to me does put the issue squarely before us in the terms that the Petitioner has presented, that is to say, sure, suppose you tax the vessel and you tax trailers and small vessels and a lot of other things, but as to all of the latter category, you have -- you have an exemption. So the -- the only people that effectively pay the tax are the tankers.",
  "And I thought that that was the way the case was presented.",
  "Now, the question is what is imposed here? My understanding from the yellow book -- do you agree the yellow brief is accurate in its factual descriptions, perhaps not in its conclusions that it draws?",
  "See, we have a problem with the facts here. But my understanding of the case, and please correct me if I am wrong, is that sure, Valdez has tax authority and tax statutes which would cover a considerable amount of personal property on an ad valorem basis. But because of exemptions, only the tankers pay this tax.",
  "Was my statement correct?",
  "How do you define revenue base?",
  "But the answer to Justice Stevens's question is we can take this case as presenting to us the fact that the ships pay more than other property?",
  "And you say that doesn't make any difference.",
  "But there's nothing better settled -- well, perhaps that's broad. It is very well settled that the President is the one to determine who is the lawful and legitimate government that he would deal with.",
  "That's all that was happening here. And it's not just a question of one against the other. It's a question of what government has survived.",
  "And that is under -- and under the law something that has always been committed to the very large discretion of the President.",
  "Could you tell me what your submission is with respect to the error you see in the findings and the order made after the eight-day hearing? First, are you saying that after No Child Left Behind that the duty of the State with respect to educating the students who have a different language was less onerous?",
  "All right. And are you saying that because of that methodology any remedy based on funding is no longer appropriate?",
  "If we could -- is it valid as to Nogales, if we focus just on Nogales?",
  "Are you saying -- are you saying that the order the district court gave with respect just to Nogales - -",
  "-- is inappropriate because it used a funding remedy or a funding measure of compliance when it should have used blank, and then fill in the blank?",
  "Well, it seems to me very odd that -- assume you have a constitutional provision which says funding must be equal in each district. Then you find one district that's way behind, and that is, we will assume, is -- has been deficient in -- in providing language education. You are saying that if the court orders more money spent for that district, it must automatically order money -- additional money for every other district in the State?",
  "But -- yes, but that seems to me the necessary conclusion of your argument in the answer you gave Justice Scalia.",
  "But, again, what you're - - you're saying that any time a district court in a single district orders more money to remedy a constitutional problem, that because of that clause it has to apply to every other district. That just can't be.",
  "And if -- and if it is, then that is a very good reason for the district court to cede its jurisdiction to the State authorities.",
  "Did the district court on the 8-day hearing on remand make a finding that its incremental funding determinations that it had made earlier were an accurate way to measure compliance and to insist on compliance under the new immersion program?",
  "It seems to me, Mr. Starr, based on this last argument, that it actually is in your favor if the order of the court as to one district automatically requires additional expenditure for every other district, that is simply one more measure that the Court should use in finding an alternate remedy.",
  "Was she subject to a civil suit by the plaintiff in this case?",
  "Yes.",
  "Do you know whether or not in the Ninth Circuit in border search cases a body cavity search can be conducted without a warrant? I thought a warrant was required under the Ninth Circuit rule. I could ask the government.",
  "You -- you criticized the Ninth Circuit in your brief for having a sliding scale standard, which is a bad thing in your view. But it seems to me that your standard comes close to that. You call yours a differential level standard or something like that?",
  "I'm not quite sure where we are in your answer to the question of the Chief Justice's question. He asked you a hypothetical case. And you said that's a nonstarter because in this case. And the hypothetical is that there is a very dangerous drug, meth, that's going to be distributed and consumed that afternoon. Does that make a difference in the permissibility of the search and the reasonableness of the search and the scope of the search?",
  "So you don't mind our judging this case as if they were searching for meth?",
  "That's the way -- we should -- we should judge this case as though they were searching -- the fact that it was -- is it ibuprofen, have I got that? The fact that it was ibuprofen is irrelevant; we can consider this case as if it were meth?",
  "I don't think I understand that based on your answer. I'm -- I'm asking you -- you said that the nature of the drug makes no difference, It's a nonstarter.",
  "Insofar as the rule that we -- that's because in this case you don't think there's a reasonable suspicion to begin with. But that doesn't answer the hypothetical. We're trying to announce a rule. And your rule, your submission, as I understand you and as I understood the government, is that the nature of the substance they're searching for is irrelevant.",
  "So that goes back to my earlier proposition that you don't mind our deciding the case as if this were a search for meth that was going to be consumed at noon?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Well, let me ask you this about spine shuddering.",
  "Let's go back to Justice Souter's question. We assume that there's meth, something very dangerous, going to be smoked at noon, there's very strong suspicion of this student. The assistant principal says I'm going to give you a choice: we're going to engage in an intrusive search, same sex people, like what went on here; or we're going to call the local police department, we'll have probable cause to book you and they will search you at the jail house. Which do you choose? Would the school administrators be violating their duty if they did that?",
  "They give the student the choice. They say we'll do it here with a nurse right here, where you know everybody, and there's nothing wrong' or we'll call the police, and they'll do it down at the police station.",
  "Which -- which would be the less traumatic of the two choices for the student?",
  "You think it's less traumatic, or it might be less traumatic to have uniformed police officers take the person to the police station and conduct the search there?",
  "You want us to decide the case on the fact that that's probably less traumatic for the student?",
  "In the hypothetical wasn't there a probable cause?",
  "Well, let me ask you this -- this question, and I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but it is based on what Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg have both been asking. Hypothetical case: The city says, our test is not very good. We need a new test. The expert says, don't pay us to have a new one. There are two great ones out there. One is in City A. The other is in City B. Use either one of those. They are great. They check. They find out that City A has a disparate impact in the statistical sense, not in the legal sense; that it disadvantages minorities, at least if you look at the passage rates. The other test doesn't. Are they permitted to take the test that doesn't have that differential?",
  "My -- my question is - - and you can answer, I guess, both under Title VII and - - and under the Fourteenth Amendment. The city says, the only reason -- the only reason for our selecting the test from City B -- and both tests are very good tests -- is because minorities are better represented on the passing rate. Is that permissible?",
  "And do you find -- and do you find any constitutional deficiency in the city's choice in that hypothetical case? Is there any Fourteenth Amendment problem?",
  "No. No. It was - -",
  "It was designed to show, and maybe it's theoretical, but I want to know the answer so that I can understand this case. It's designed to ask you the question whether or not race consciousness is ever permissible.",
  "Well, counsel, you know, I've given law school examinations, looked at them, and bar examinations for years. There's never been one, when I don't look at it after the fact and say, you know, this could be better, this -- this was not quite right. So shouldn't there be some standard that there has to be a significant, a strong showing after the test has been taken that it's deficient? Before it can be set aside?",
  "But it looked at the - -",
  "Counsel, it looked at the results, and it classified the successful and unsuccessful applicants by race.",
  "And then -- and you want us to say this isn't race? I have -- I have trouble with this argument.",
  "But that's inconsistent with your answer to the Chief Justice who was exploring whether or not what we have here is a -- is a racial criteria, pure and simple, and you say, well, it's general. And then we point out that each applicant didn't have his name, but they had his or her race.",
  "Well -- well, but you are loading the -- the equation. The Chief Justice's question I don't think has been -- been fully answered. You are -- you are saying that you can eliminate constitutional concerns because the statute is enacted, which just repeats those same constitutional concerns. It's -- it's like having two tracks on the audio that don't quite fit.",
  "I'd like to talk just briefly - -",
  "I would like to talk just briefly about this point that the -- some of our hypotheticals where the test hadn't been given yet. Here the test has been given. And I had some concerns along the line of Justice Ginsburg's question. She said, well, it's not a vested interest. On the other hand, 2000e-(l)(2) says that test results can't be altered. There's a statutory interpretation question of whether that means they can't be used altogether. Two points about the statute. Number one, doesn't that diminish at least the force of the argument that this is a vested interest? It means the tests are -- have a -- have a certain presumption in -- in their favor. Secondly, on -- and maybe this is a question for the -- for the Petitioners rather than you. If we -- let's assume that we relied on that statute and said that there's a Title VII violation here because the statute was violated. I know you have an interpretational argument there. Would that give the Petitioners all the relief they need here, or is there still additional relief under their 1983 cause of action?",
  "It can't alter the results. But let's not get into the statutory interpretation - -",
  "Under the time-honored - -",
  "Under the time-honored approach, if the jury verdict necessarily -- or not necessarily, but did in fact refer to the amount involved and it was over $10,000, would that be part of the time-honored approach and then the statute would be fulfilled?",
  "Well, in that connection, at some point in the argument -- and you may be a little early because you're talking about the statute -- I'd like to know either anecdotally from your experience or -- or because it's written somewhere, how often do juries give special verdicts? It actually applies in the second case we're to hear as well. And has that changed in the light of -- of Apprendi? In -- in my experience, we just didn't know many of the features of the crime from -- from the jury verdict, and I just would like to know if that's changed in this day and age.",
  "But you may reach that after you've talked about the statute.",
  "But I can see that if there are multiple defendants in the case, some of the defendants might say that this is unnecessary, it's inflammatory.",
  "But all that just underscores the fact that - -",
  "And -- and why would you be reluctant to do that? Would you just spell that out a little bit?",
  "I suppose your answer, it's your first argument, it's the -- it's the offense.",
  "And if for Blockburger purposes or for double jeopardy purposes, you couldn't retry him for those other -- for that additional loss, then that's -- I assume your argument is that that's included within the offense for which he was convicted.",
  "Your position is that in ancillary, subsequent proceedings anything you prove that's within the offense convicted -- say, as measured by double jeopardy purposes, as protection against multiple prosecutions, that you can make that showing?",
  "That's my point.",
  "I take it that that's your whole argument.",
  "I frankly couldn't understand the government's concession on that point. I thought the -- the offense on illegal entry was to enter illegally after you've been deported. It's a -- there's a defense if the original deportation was flawed?",
  "I don't understand that.",
  "I see. I see.",
  "I don't want to take you too far outside the record, and you can come back to it, but I -- I just have this question. Suppose that in a jury case the jury -- pre-Atkins, the jury says, we find that the defendant has a 65 IQ, but that in light of the heinous nature of the offense, this is not a mitigating factor, and that he should be sentenced to death. In a subsequent Atkins proceeding, can the jury finding with reference to the IQ be conclusive?",
  "Or must that be reopened?",
  "It can -- can be reopened?",
  "But could the -- could the defendant argue the -- that -- the accused argue that at least as to the finding of the 65 IQ, that that is a given.",
  "And that that issue, i.e., the level of IQ, cannot be relitigated, the number?",
  "Let -- let me just ask, does the State have any position now as to his IQ?",
  "Will the State -- would you say the State has an independent obligation to -- to ensure itself that he has an adequate IQ?",
  "What about before? The whole point is that under the words of the statute as you interpret it, there is a condition predicate that has to be satisfied. So, to say that -- to answer by saying, well, that assumes they won't obey the hearing officer, what about before the hearing even takes place?",
  "Well, but it's not that hypothetical when -- there are two prongs. Number one, the school has to agree first with the diagnosis, which in this case they didn't even do that. They had a good faith disagreement. Second, they have to have an adequate IEP. So there are two conditions.",
  "The -- the problem that the government and the parents have is they have to give some work to (ii). Under -- under their view (ii) doesn't seem to do much work. And the problem with your position is that it seems in a way formalistic and in some cases to encourage intransigence. If we adopted a presumption that the school district's diagnosis was correct and a presumption that it's -- if -- if there was a diagnosis of disability, that its individual education program was adequate, that would, it seems to me, not be all you wanted, but would ameliorate the position of the school district. Would we have authority, do you think, to adopt such a presumption?",
  "Well, this -- this would be a clear and convincing evidence presumption that the -- that the IEP is -- that the school district designs is right, that its diagnosis is right. That's not all you -- that's not all you would be asking for.",
  "But would we have authority to do that if we were to reject your interpretation of the statute?",
  "Suppose we thought it were sensible to add to that burden the further rule that the school district is presumed to have made the correct diagnosis and, if there is a plan in that kind of case, that the plan was adequate, and that the parent would have to show by clear and convincing evidence that this is not so, rather than just inventing it and pulling it out of the sky. Is -- is there some authority in the statute that would give us warrant to do that? Or is there some -- any cases that would give us warrant to -- to establish a presumption of that kind in order to recognize the long-standing expertise of the States in this matter and in order to allow section (ii) to do some work?",
  "If the - -",
  "If the parents are entitled and the child is entitled to the special education and the school doesn't give it, and there are two schools -- private schools in the community, A and B. A charges, what is it, $5,200 a month tuition; the other is considerably less. And they both have adequate programs for the child. Is the hearing examiner entitled to reimburse only for the lower amount, or is the parent entitled to send the child to the -- to the more expensive school?",
  "But if OCC thought there might be such a problem, couldn't it act in advance to avoid the risk that Justice Breyer's question explains?",
  "Does any of this bring us back to the colloquy you began -- began with -- between Justice Breyer and Ms. Underwood with reference to many States?",
  "You -- you began on that, and I never did hear - -",
  "Well, to the extent we have some latitude in construing the Act, certainly it would be a relevant factor if we concluded that it's just unworkable or impractical to have an uncovered jurisdiction within a county which is a covered jurisdiction. They would have competing election days, competing election formulae. And it would seem to me that that just makes compliance with the Act much more difficult.",
  "If we find that you're not covered by the bailout provision, that only the county is, do you really then have standing to proceed to question the workability of the bailout procedures? I -- I suppose that would be a threshold argument for you to question the validity of the Act.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer - - Justice Breyer did refer you to some other more current statistics, submissions, Title V suits, and so forth. You might want to address those. And in that context, was there any control data to compare preclearance rates or preclearance events in colored -- in covered jurisdictions as opposed to uncovered jurisdictions?",
  "And that -- that's part of the showing, it seems to me, that the Congress has to make, that these States that are now covered and that were covered are markedly different from the noncovered jurisdictions. Was there anything in the record before the Congress or the district court to address that point?",
  "Well, is the burden that the Act puts on the State irrelevant consideration?",
  "How many people in the Department of Justice -- what's the Department of Justice budget for preclearance processes each year, do you know?",
  "Thirty attorneys. Do you quarrel with the assessment -- the testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that it costs the States and the municipalities a billion dollars over 10 years to comply?",
  "But you think that is - - that is relevant?",
  "But yet -- yet the Congress has made a finding that the sovereignty of Georgia is less than the sovereign dignity of Ohio. The sovereignty of Alabama, is less than the sovereign dignity of Michigan. And the governments in one are to be trusted less than the governments than the other. And does the United States take that position today?",
  "Well, then my point stands. You say that there is a basis for treating States quite differently as to the -- this fundamental right that we all agree on with respect to voting. And what's happened in part is that because of section 5 preclearance, say, a minority opportunity district is protected in covered jurisdictions and not in noncovered jurisdictions.",
  "This is -- this is a great disparity in treatment, and the government of the United States is saying that our States must be treated differently. And you have a very substantial burden if you're going to make that case.",
  "No one -- no one questions the validity, the urgency, the essentiality of the Voting Rights Act. The question is whether or not it should be continued with this differentiation between the States. And that is for Congress to show.",
  "Well, the overall historical record, Katzenbach said there had been unremitting and ingenious defiance, and that was certainly true as of the time of the Voting Rights Act. Democracy was a shambles in those -- that's not true anymore, and to say that the States are willing to yield their sovereign authority and their sovereign responsibilities to govern themselves doesn't work. We've said in Clinton s New York that Congress can't surrender its powers to the President, and the same is true with reference to the States. Wouldn't you agree?",
  "In covered States as opposed to noncovered States, if I can add that to the Chief Justice's question, please.",
  "Just one thing on bailout. It's like Eurystheus keeps telling Hercules, \"Oh, you did a good job, but now you've got another -- got another thing to do.\" That's the bailout provision. Anybody who has tried to fill out a government form realizes they make a mistake, so that the DOJ rejects it, that counts as a rejection. You have to have a - - what, a clean record for how many -- how many years - - before you can preclear? I mean, this is simply impracticable. And it seems to me a cornerstone of the Act and of your argument for upholding the Act, and if we find that it doesn't work, that it's just -- it's just an illusion, that gives me serious pause.",
  "I think that's absolutely right. Section 2 cases are very expensive. They are very long. They are very inefficient. I think this section 5 preclearance device has -- has shown -- has been shown to be very very successful. The question is whether or not it can be justified when other States are not covered today.",
  "Well, the brief filed by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the first 15 pages I think makes a good demonstration of discrete discriminatory acts; and the brief filed by Nathaniel, Professor Percelly, makes an important point about crossovers in different -- my concern is it's just not clear to me that Congress addressed this for the rest of the country. That's my concern.",
  "I -- I agree -- I agree that Buckley made the distinction between contributions and expenditures, and it seems to me that the government's argument necessarily wants to water down that distinction. But in response or just in furtherance of Justice Breyer's point, you have two cases, one in which an officeholder goes to a corporation and says: Will you please give me money? They say: We can't do that. The other is in which a corporation takes out an ad for the -- for the candidate, which relieves that candidate of the responsibility of -- of substantial television coverage. Isn't that about the same?",
  "And I -- and I think Buckley says no.",
  "But, as a practical matter, is that always true?",
  "Well, with reference to any incongruities that might flow from our adopting your position, are you aware of any case in this Court which says that we must refrain from addressing an unconstitutional aspect of the statute because the statute is flawed in some other respects as well?",
  "But that judgment was validated by Buckley's contribution-expenditure line. And you're correct if you look at contributions, but this is an expenditure case. And I think that it doesn't clarify the situation to say that for 100 years -- to suggest that for 100 years we would have allowed expenditure limitations, which in order to work at all have to have a speaker-based distinction, exemption from media, content-based distinction, time-based distinction. We've never allowed that.",
  "But if you -- if you insist on the as-applied challenge, isn't that inconsistent with the whole line of cases that began in Thornhill v. Alabama and Coates v. Cincinnati? What about the Thornhill doctrine? It is not cited in the briefs, but that doctrine is that even a litigant without standing to object to a particular form of conduct can raise that if the statute covers it in order that the statute does not have an ongoing chill against speech. And there is no place where an ongoing chill is more dangerous than in the elections context.",
  "So you are asking us to have an ongoing chill where we have as-applied challenges which are based on, as I indicated before, speaker, content, time, and this is the kind of chilling effect that the Thornhill doctrine stands directly against.",
  "Let me ask you this. Suppose that we were to rule that nonprofit corporations could not be covered by the statute. Would that - - would the statute then have substantial overbreadth?",
  "But suppose we were to say that. Would the statute then not be substantially overbroad?",
  "But I am asking you to assume that we draw the nonprofit/profit distinction. Then the statute, it seems to me, clearly has to fall because, number one, we couldn't sever it based on the language.",
  "But under your position, if corporations A, B, and C, are called to Washington every Monday morning by a high-ranking administrative official or a high-ranking member of the Congress with a committee chairmanship and told to tow the line and to tell their directors and shareholders what the policy ought to be, some other corporation can't object to that during the election cycle. The government silences a corporate objector, and those corporations may have the most knowledge of this on the subject. Corporations have lots of knowledge about environment, transportation issues, and you are silencing them during the election.",
  "When other corporations, via -- because of the very fact you just point out, have already been used and are being used by the government to express its views; and you say another corporation can't object to that.",
  "In the course of this argument, have you covered point two?",
  "And I would like to know what it is, so that I -- my notes are complete.",
  "And to undercut Buckley in so doing?",
  "But he was talking about contributions in that context. That's quite clear.",
  "You say it's been on - - it's been on the books forever. But, No. 1, the phenomenon of -- of television ads where we get information about scientific discovery and -- and environment and transportation issues from corporations who after all have patents because they know something, that -- that is different. And the -- the history you applied apply to contributions, not to those kinds of expenditures.",
  "Is the rationale for the break in custody that there is a likelihood of non-coercion? Is that the reason that you offer for the rule?",
  "All right. But this person was in custody in the sense he was in prison and the brief said, oh, he was released to the general population. But the possibilities for coercion or pressure are very substantial in the prison. The warden comes in and says: Oh, your cell doesn't have a window. I mine, there's countless way in which a prisoner in the general prison population would consider that he is - - that there has been no break in custody. I think that's a very difficult rule that you are proposing.",
  "You join counsel for the State in just not wanting to argue for a time rule, which seems to me the only thing that would work.",
  "That's become apparent, and I'm indicating that I think the time rule might have some benefits.",
  "But you don't give us any -- any suggestions. As -- you know, the State opens the bidding with seven days.",
  "But the Speedy Trial Act, with many exceptions, requires that you go to trial within 70 days. Would that be a benchmark?",
  "How about pick pocketing, would pick pocketing be a violent crime if it involves a touching necessarily?",
  "I guess a very good pick pocket could get -- could get just the wallet and not touch the person, I'm not sure.",
  "It's really a question for Petitioner's counsel, and I didn't have time to ask as your white light goes on. I take it your position is that if you do not prevail on your argument, that this is under Roman -- small Roman 1, that if -- you have to remand for small Roman 2?",
  "Is there an argument that you anticipate objecting to that remand? Or is this absolutely clear-cut that we must remand?",
  "I -- I don't want to waste too much of your time on the remand, but I can't really fault the government for waiving a right to raise a claim under Clause 2, which is your second reason for not -- not remanding, and it -- it does seem, to, me that the Eleventh Circuit -- one permissible reading was that they were just looking at 1, so that we would have to remand.",
  "I understand that.",
  "Yes. Except in this area, I am a little reluctant when it hasn't been argued before as to make a definitive holding, but I will look at the Eleventh Circuit opinion again.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Could you tell me how it works in district courts? This district court set September 13 originally for the -- for the motion. Do the district courts generally have a custom schedule for every case where they set times or do they have local rules on the subject?",
  "Yes.",
  "And that's -- that's part of -- that there in the local rule of court?",
  "But I'm -- I'm not sure that that isn't -- that that argument doesn't cut both ways.",
  "I'm not sure if that -- if you have a district where you have five days, a very short period and almost nobody can comply with it, then maybe that's an argument for the government's rule.",
  "Well, I think an assumption in your mathematical analysis is that there will be a difference in the time that it takes to dispose of the motion. If the time to dispose of the motion is the same, then you are wrong, I think. I will work it out.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, what is your systemic concern with the -- with the government's rule? The judge has to grant the continuance under either - - under either of your rules, and you say he has to make a finding that it's good. But are you concerned the continuance would be because the attorney wants to play golf or take a vacation with his kids, and that that's not the cause?",
  "Is that's what's driving your concern?",
  "But wouldn't judges in many cases do that anyway just in the course of deciding whether to grant a continuance?",
  "Give -- give me the consequences of ruling for the government that you see that are adverse in your view.",
  "But that's my point.",
  "I assume the district judge will ask. Or is - -",
  "Or do you doubt that?",
  "Just for my -- just for my information, what's a motion to -- to waive? I mean, why does he need permission to waive?",
  "I see.",
  "Okay. And what case - - what case do you have for that proposition?",
  "Can you give me an example of a case where we said a statute which might otherwise be overbroad is not overbroad because prosecutors have been restrained? Can you give me one case where we've said that?",
  "But that was a case where we knew what the content was. The content was not subject to an -- to an overbreadth challenge. The content was not.",
  "Well, but that -- that went to intent. It seems to me that -- let me tell you what I think your framework is and if it is wrong, tell me that it is wrong. This statute without the exceptions clause would be wildly overbroad. So you say it's not overly broad because of the exception or the savings clause. I will call it the exceptions. But it seems to me that the exceptions must be then tested as to whether or not they are vague.",
  "And you have you to show that they are not vague.",
  "I have one more -- one more question along the lines of Justice Alito. Forget this statute. Under a properly drawn statute, suppose that bull-fighting or pitbull-fighting is unlawful in every State. Could a theater have a live broadcast of a pitbull fight in Japan and charge ten dollars? And let's add the hypothetical fact that a lot of the revenue goes back to Japan and promotes more bull-fighting. Could a properly drawn statute prohibit that? And then perhaps Justice Scalia, Alito, has a follow-up question on his own hypothetical. Could a properly drawn statute prohibit that, that speech?",
  "We are asking whether or not that specific instance could be prohibited under a properly drawn statute, just like Justice Alito's hypothetical was under a properly drawn statute you could prohibit the conduct, the speech broadcast in that conduct.",
  "So your answer to my hypothetical is yes it could be prohibited under a properly drawn statute?",
  "Suppose an argument - - excuse me. Suppose an argument had been made to the Court in Ferber, that, you know, it's really good for people to see molestation of children because then they will be outraged and they will enforce the statute more. I just can't see the Court accepting that argument for a single -- for a minute.",
  "But that's the argument you are making.",
  "Well, it seems to me that we ought -- if there is a significant chance that Congress can affect an illegal market, an illegal activity by a statutory regulation we ought to defer to Congress on that ground. I think you still have speech arguments.",
  "On this economic causation, I think we have to defer to Congress largely.",
  "What was your answer to Justice Alito's hypothetical about human sacrifice?",
  "Would -- if the statute of limitations had run, could you still come back?",
  "I mean, not -- not necessarily in this case, but in -- but in a typical case.",
  "I said in a typical case.",
  "Or is it just - -",
  "Maybe this is the same question. Are you representing the interest of the Library of Congress?",
  "Well, but that -- that's because -- that's because you assume the act is going to be valid. You could have come here and said: This is such an important case Congress is taking action, and therefore, you should hear our standing argument to avoid the necessity of the Legislative Branch having to come in. You could have said that.",
  "If we were in -- if we were in the contract, civil contract situation, and there’s a mistake, the usual rule -- Restatement of Contracts -- is that the -- the question is whether or not it's reasonable to have the party who made the mistake bear the risk. Suppose we just had an instruction, Rule 11 -- I recognize this is a State case -- but we had a Rule 11 instruction, which said the only thing the court is going to inquire about and the only thing that was of relevance to your plea are criminal consequences. You take the risk of any misadvice, any misunderstanding, with respect to collateral conduct. That's your risk, and it's part of the guilty plea. If we said that, would that foreclose this kind of argument in your case?",
  "Well, then there’s no way the government or the court can protect itself against the -- these consequences, and there are any number of them. Suppose he doesn't advise that there’s going to be civil liability in tort once he pleads guilty, because then that's a fact that's concluded and it's just a question of damages. And as Justice Scalia indicated, there are many, many instances. I just see no way for the courts to protect themselves against -- against this. And -- and if the client, or the accused, is told that he accepts these risks, he can say, well, you know, there may be some risks I don't know about, I'll go to trial. He just accepts the risks.",
  "Well, do you think it would be wrong for a district court to say, now, I want to be very careful, and I'm going to add -- let's take Rule 11 as the standard. It's a Federal case. I'm going to add to Rule 11. I'm going to say, in addition to the Rule 11 questions that you've all answered, I want to make sure: Have you been advised about immigration? Have you been advised about other collateral consequences? Do you think that would be error for the –- or inappropriate for a district judge to do?",
  "The -- the judge would not be exceeding his -- his commission, his authority, to determine just whether this is knowing and voluntary in the sense of knowing -- knowing the criminal consequences of -- I mean, in the criminal system itself?",
  "But it seems to me a careful district judge would have to do this if you prevail.",
  "Well, then you are saying that the more the defense counsel strays from his only professional responsibility, the more at risk the government is. That seems odd.",
  "Well, why shouldn't we just adopt an amendment to Rule 11 in which the judge says, any collateral consequences with respect to your plea are not the concern of this court and will not be grounds for setting aside this -- this plea?",
  "Well, everyone at the counsel table I assume agrees that the plea has to be voluntary. But “voluntary” has various meanings: Number one, it is not coerced or forced. Would -- isn't your argument that “voluntary” does not include being fully informed?",
  "Well then, about important collateral consequences. Is there -- are there any cases that address this point one way or the other? That is to say, the extent to which “voluntary” includes the component of being informed about major consequences, significant consequences of the plea? Can I go anywhere to -- to read a discussion of this?",
  "Well, if -- if the strategy that Mr. Cordray and Justice Breyer and, to some extent, Justice Scalia have outlined is a correct strategy, would you go on to say that the implementation of that strategy was substandard? It's rambling, you have to -- in order to get Mr. Cordray's very succinct explanation, you have to go through a couple of pages and drift it out, as Justice Sotomayor said, his argument was fine, and Justice Breyer -- but that is not the argument we have.",
  "What -- what is the case that you have -- the best case that you have, maybe a case in the courts of appeals or the state supreme courts, where it is said that the implementation of the strategy was just inept -- totally inept. I mean, is that what your argument is here?",
  "Again, that depends on, oh, tone of voice, the ambiance of the courtroom. This -- this is very hard for us -- you know, he was trying to be folksy with the jury, obviously. These are things that are very difficult for us to assess.",
  "I see your light's on, but can we take this case on the assumption that nothing that you obtain in the way of relief will affect Duke Power under the comprehensive relicensing agreement?",
  "Don't we have to take the case on the assumption that their rights under that agreement might be affected?",
  "But are you saying you are not seeking a result that’s inconsistent in any way with that agreement?",
  "It is not clear to me what the district judge should do in making the lodestar calculation when he considers quality of performance. I guess you are saying -- I think maybe you have already said -- that he can consider quality of performance, but only within the confines of what is a reasonable rate.",
  "Because the brief for the Respondent said: Well, you know, you are really counting this at the front end, and if you can do that, why not put it in at the back end? And I'm just having problems with that still. Suppose the judge at the outset said: This quality of performance is so good that, so far as the lodestar is concerned, I think a reasonable fee is above the usual hourly rate.",
  "But -- so that in computing the lodestar rate, he cannot consider quality of performance?",
  "Well, then it seems to me you're saying that he does not look to actual quality of performance. He just looks to market rates without reference to that. I -- I --",
  "That's why I'm having -- I'm -- I mean, you know, the -- the question presented is -- is just quality of performance and results obtained; that's all we're talking about.",
  "And I don't see why that can't be considered as part of the lodestar, and if it can be, then I don't see what the argument is about.",
  "For extraordinary circumstances, what about a very, very popular cause and he wins and they are beating his door down? Can we reduce it for that?",
  "Were -- were expert witness fees reimbursable in this case, under -- under the statute? I noticed they were cut down, but I didn't know if he cut out all of them or just part of them.",
  "All right.",
  "Is Harris a fiduciary in the same sense as a corporate officer and a corporate director? Or does his fiduciary duty differ? Is it higher or lower, same with a guardian, same with a trustee? I mean, the word \"fiduciary\" -- does fiduciary imply different standards, depending on what kind of fiduciary you are?",
  "Well, would the test for compensation in this case be the same as any director or any officer of a corporation?",
  "I just want to know, is the fiduciary duties the same? Is the fiduciary standard the same, without getting into how its applied? Is the fiduciary standard the same for Jones, for a guardian, for a trustee, for a corporate officer or a corporate director, always the same?",
  "You said that Congress used \"fiduciary\" in a special sense. Then -- then, I have to conclude that your earlier answer is confusing for me, because I thought you were going to tell us that this investment adviser has the same fiduciary standard that officers and directors of corporations have. Then you say that Congress used it in this special sense. So that doesn't quite square.",
  "Do you think Congress used the term \"fiduciary\" in a very special sense here? I will just tell you the problem I'm having with the case. If I look at a standard that the fees must be reasonable and I compare that with what a fiduciary would do, I thought a fiduciary has the highest possible duty. But apparently the submission is the fiduciary has a lower duty, a lesser duty than to charge a reasonable fee. I just find that quite a puzzling use of the word \"fiduciary.\" Now, if Congress uses it as a term of art or in some special sense, fine.",
  "But it seems to me an odd use of the term \"fiduciary.\" I don't know why Congress didn't use some other word.",
  "How is the -- how is the standard you've just described different from a standard of reasonableness?",
  "Well, I would be very surprised if \"reasonableness\" always meant one -- one figure. It could mean a range.",
  "I -- I have a number of problems with the Third Circuit's opinion, but the question presented, it seems to me, is not really the dispositive point of the opinion. I don't think the question you presented is really that squarely before us.",
  "And I don't see a split, either. I mean, of course, there is going to be some discretion. The question is -- the Third Circuit, as I read the opinion, was concerned that it wasn't firmly established at the time of the waiver. I have real problems with whether the waiver should even be -- whether the time of the waiver is controlling, but that is not the question you asked us to resolve.",
  "Well, I don't know why you submit -- why you seem to concede that that applies here. I can understand why we want to look at the time of the waiver if it's an attorney arguing about jury instructions and so forth, but the man escapes when the door is open or when the window is open, and he doesn't give consideration to these things; and if he does, I think that's quite irrelevant. It seems to me that the waiver point is - - is something that shouldn't be conceded. I think that if ten years elapse between the time of the escape and the time the State formulates its rules, that he is bound by those rules when he gets there. But you don't argue that. That's not what you presented to us.",
  "But it seems to me that that's not what the Third -- Third Circuit was saying. It was saying that adequacy of the rule is determined by the law in effect at the time of the waiver, and it wasn't well-established. Now, I have real problems with that as an opening premise, but that's not what you asked us to resolve in your petition.",
  "Insofar as the ongoing rule is concerned, let's assume that as of the time of Doctor, which was a Third Circuit case, 1996, the Pennsylvania rule was then clear, Pennsylvania for the first time having made its rule clear. Would it be improper to apply it to this defendant, because he escaped before Doctor made it clear? I -- I just don't understand why the general rules of -- of -- of waiver apply in this case. It -- it doesn't affect rational conduct. It doesn't trap an attorney. Why can't we take the rule as it was when we heard his case after he had been returned as a fugitive?",
  "Do I -- Do I take it that -- that Justice -- Justice Breyer's question, repeated by Justice Scalia -- just take that fact, that's the only question before us. If it was discretionary and it's now mandatory, just focus on that only.",
  "Then your client isn't hurt? If you take - -",
  "But all -- all those books on our wall are the first time it's ever come up. I mean, that's how the law -- that's how the law is made. So -- the whole point of the adequate independent State ground, it seems to me, is part we don't want to affect rational conduct retroactively -- not applicable here. Two, we don't want to have the State court use this as a subterfuge or a device to avoid a Federal right. I don't think that's applicable here. You might want to argue about that. So it seems to me that the fact that it's a completely new rule in the case of an escape may mean it is still an adequate ground.",
  "But those weren't escape cases. Were they all escape cases?",
  "Well, that's the point. Why isn't escape sui generis, and how can we ever say that?",
  "Were you still answering the Chief Justice's -- I had -- had one more.",
  "I didn't mean to interrupt. You said there was no post-conviction review. I -- I thought they in this case went on to ask -- to exercise a limited review. They didn't reach the Mills v. Maryland point, but they did give a limited review to determine the sufficiency of the evidence, whether the death penalty was a product of passion or prejudice, whether the evidence fails to support the finding of the aggravating circumstance, whether the sentence was extensive or proportional. They did give post - -",
  "-- -conviction review on all those points.",
  "Well, they don't always liquidate the asset, if they -- if they elect -- if everybody agrees that they get the asset itself, they don't have to sell it.",
  "What -- what -- what you are doing there, you -- you argue that ambiguities are construed against the person that made the form. I think that's a little harsh when the trustee is a repeat player and knows -- and knows the rules.",
  "On the other hand, I think what you have going for you is that the trustee is going to always be at risk that the asset is worth more than what's listed and is going to have to take steps to value it in every -- every case. In this case, it's -- it's clear that she –- she knew that the Honda was worth more. She was only claiming $2,900, $2,950 on a Honda.",
  "And -- and if you take that together with -- and -- and the kitchen equipment comes next, and she -- and the value is the same in each column. So that indicates that she was claiming the full value.",
  "Is it also true –- tell me about this: One of my concerns is that the trustees simply don't have time in every case to have a creditors’ meeting and go through every asset. If they did, then Justice Breyer's suggestion, where they'd sit down and talk about all this stuff, would be -- would be fine. Am I right or wrong in making that empirical assumption? I mean, I just don't know.",
  "He has to. Otherwise, he is at risk that it might be worth $400,000 or whatever.",
  "But she could have said “in full.” You can't say she couldn’t have done nothing more. She’d put “in full.”",
  "Or “100 percent of value.”",
  "Now, you’ve said that there’s nothing else she could do, and I said, of course, there’s something else she could do. In Taylor, the case you cite, they put “unknown.”",
  "I mean, I understand your position, but you can't say there’s nothing else she could have done. That's -- that's the issue in the case.",
  "But how do you know that from the form? Number one, I think both sides have -- have an argument as to what the form means. I don't think it's at all clear-cut. As I say, I'm looking for some kind of a rule to tilt the case one way or the other. All right? I don't put a lot of credence in the fact that she -- the ambiguities are construed against her. I am concerned that in every case, under your rule, the trustee is at risk unless he makes an objection, and I think that's just going to make bankruptcy proceedings much more protracted and much more complex.",
  "Well, but therein -- the problem was triggered when they put in the word \"unknown.\"",
  "You mean in every single case where an asset is sold, there has to be a valuation beforehand?",
  "If -- if he claims the whole property is exempt?",
  "My question was –- I thought I understood your remark to say anytime there’s a sale, there has to be a valuation or an appraisal before the sale.",
  "But that -- but the very fact that it’s -- that there's going to be a sale may indicate that your premise is not true most of the time.",
  "Well, once again, Taylor had the word “unknown,” and this doesn't. And that's the problem.",
  "You mean if the trustee thinks there's a problem?",
  "Am I correct -- and maybe this is more proper for the government than for you, or for all the parties. I take it no one questions the propriety, the lawfulness, of the FERC determination to convene the settlement process? There's no argument that this was an improper, an unlawful process?",
  "Can I --",
  "Were the -- are the Respondents correct and was the court of appeals correct in calling this a presumption?",
  "In -- in calling the rate that was agreed upon a presumption of a reasonable rate?",
  "So you don't quarrel with that word --",
  "-- or would you quarrel with that characterization?",
  "But the rationale is the commonsense notion that it's a presumptively reasonable rate, and if that's true, how is that altered by the identity of the party that attacks it?",
  "Well, why is -- why is it not presumptively a commonsense notion when some different party attacks it? It -- it's still a determination that this rate, as a commonsense matter, is presumptively reasonable.",
  "Yes. That's different than Mobile-Sierra, although Mobile-Sierra did invoke market forces of another kind -- of another kind.",
  "Does anything in your argument turn on the fact that the Respondents were parties to the settlement process?",
  "Well, suppose -- suppose you had a case in which an individual that lives in New York goes to a person with a supply of cigarettes outside the State and says: I want to buy a lot of cigarettes and I don't want to pay taxes; can you help me? And they agree on an arrangement to ship, to ship the cigarettes. Is there proximate cause? Is it there if the city sues for injury in that hypothetical case? Would you say there's no proximate cause?",
  "And you think the city - - and you think the city cannot show proximate cause in a suit for its injury against the seller of the cigarettes? You think there's no proximate cause in that hypothetical case?",
  "Even though those are the only two people that have made the arrangement, and that was the whole purpose and intent of the arrangement? And you still say there's no proximate cause?",
  "Well, what do you do with -- what do you do with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical? I mean, she can pursue her own question, but I'm interested in the answer. Her question is, suppose the statute were amended so that the information had to be given to the city as well as to the State; would the case then be different, hypothetical case?",
  "Could you satisfy Justice Breyer's concern -- and maybe the answer is not -- by saying that if there were a corporation that went around to California taxpayers and said, we have a way to avoid taxes, that then there would be a RICO violation, and that would be closer to your case?",
  "Well -- well, you're certainly consistent and persistent on that point.",
  "But it -- it would seem to me -- it would seem to me that I gave you a way to differentiate this case. And isn't that consistent with RICO because we have a very specific enterprise here?",
  "So do you say then that proximate cause is in part established because of the specific intent? Is that - -",
  "Well, I'm glad -- I'm glad you said that, because the Associated Contractors said specific intent is not - -",
  "But in -- in the world and in the lexicon of proximate cause, why is there proximate cause because this was the business model? How do I explain that in terms of proximate cause? There's not specific intent.",
  "I know. But there is no other -- take a case which was put to you as the seller who has many reasons for selling from out of State. They have a good catalog business, it's a well-established name, and so it's not just to avoid taxes. How is that different from what happened here?",
  "Okay, and in terms of proximate -- the universe of the law that we call proximate cause, how do you explain that? It's not specific intent.",
  "Your -- your case here is a polite way of telling us we wasted our time in Buckley v. Fitzsimmons.",
  "I mean, we were just spinning our wheels in that case?",
  "Take two cases. One is Justice Ginsburg's case, a police officer fabricates the evidence, dupes the prosecuting attorney, or -- or doesn't fully disclose. Case two, a prosecutor does the same thing and gives it to a fellow prosecutor. Same -- should the analysis be precisely the same?",
  "So the -- so the law is the more deeply you're involved in the wrong, the more likely you are to be immune? That's a strange proposition.",
  "What if a prosecutor knows that it's fabricated evidence? The police officer fabricates the evidence and says: Mr. Prosecutor, it's a very bad man; I fabricated the evidence. The prosecutor introduces it. What result there? See, your footnote 6 presumes that the prosecutor doesn't know.",
  "Suppose he knows?",
  "Against the policeman?",
  "Again, the more aggravated the tort, the greater the immunity.",
  "You're basically saying that you cannot aid and abet someone who is immune, and that's just not the law.",
  "Well, you can't have it both ways and say this is a policy we should take into account and then when Justice Sotomayor asks you a question, say: Oh, well, that's for the legislature. I mean, you're -- it seems to me you're trying to have it both ways.",
  "What's -- what's -- what's your best authority for the proposition that there's liability in the case the Chief Justice put? What's your best case?",
  "You will have to refresh my memory. Wasn't that a Fourth Amendment violation ultimately?",
  "So that -- so that's not - -",
  "Well, could you answer Justice Breyer's question, which I -- I think raises a -- a critical point in terms of Justice Alito's examples of talking to the witness. Why isn't that at some point -- I think in Buckley, the \"judicial phase.\" Why is this the judicial phase?",
  "No, but probable cause doesn't work because you have -- you have probable cause once you fabricate the evidence.",
  "That's circular.",
  "Suppose the prosecutor isn't sure there's probable cause and he calls -- calls in the accountant, the CFO, and really doesn't begin to believe his story, so he starts probing and finally he gets the CFO to change his story with the plea -- plea bargain. Would that be part of the judicial process? Or is that still clearly investigatory?",
  "Well, he's trying to find out. That's what - -",
  "You don't have the cite for 542 F.3d, that part of the opinion? It's in 542 F.3d, 1281, but I don't have the particular page. Okay.",
  "But let's just talk about the -- the finding of -- by the district court that there was no strategic reason and the -- and the disagreement with that in the Federal circuit, and let's talk about it just under (d)(1) -- just under (d)(1).",
  "Would you say that the test is whether or not the -- that finding was clearly erroneous?",
  "Is that -- is that another way?",
  "Why -- why is \"unreasonable application\" different from \"clearly erroneous\"?",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm talking about (d)(1).",
  "I-- I beg your -- (d)( 2), unreasonable determination of facts.",
  "Yes.",
  "So you -- you think there can be findings that are clearly erroneous, but not an unreasonable determination of facts?",
  "I'm talking about (d)(2).",
  "Because the problem, as Justice Ginsburg indicated, is that the courts of appeals are looking for guidance as -- as to when we can go into -- into these findings and set them aside.",
  "And it really is very difficult for me to wear a \"clearly erroneous\" hat or an \"unreasonable determination of fact.\" I -- I just can't sense any difference there.",
  "That -- that brings us to the point of beginning. And could you give me, in summary form, your best interpretation of both (d) and (e), (d)(1), (d)(2), (e)(1), in light of the deference that the Federal courts should pay to State determinations? It seems to me that, if you use -- if you reserve (e)(1) for cases in which there's a hearing in the District Court, then it's somewhat counterintuitive because the strongest standard applies to the accused. He has the greatest burden, when the State hearing was the least effective. On the other hand, if they overlap, there - - then (d)(2) is often superfluous, so I have a choice of something that is counterintuitive or superfluous, and I don't know which one to take.",
  "And -- and -- but maybe there is -- is some more general theory that you can give me.",
  "Res judicata doesn't work.",
  "Although I think Congress might have had something like that in mind.",
  "Well, I don't think they've been handling it. I think there's a tremendous confusion, and I -- I find it very difficult to write an opinion to give them guidance as to when they can set aside hearings, to what extent they have to review the entire record. To me, I think many courts of appeals and district of -- and district courts think that it's just like a clearly erroneous standard. It's very hard to - - to use these standards to give you any concrete guidance in this specific case.",
  "I’m interested in -- in two different things and you can address them during the course of your argument. One is the assumption of the argument seems to be that there are in place parole -- throughout all the States -- parole systems which are effective, which are operating, and that they have the capacity to make accurate judgments about rehabilitation. What can I read -- what -- what studies do you have to -- that -- that comment on that? Secondly, unrelated, at some point I think you ought to talk about the procedural bar, which is something you go over very, very, very -- let's see -- that's Sullivan.",
  "Pardon me. That's Sullivan, yes.",
  "What -- what would you do if there were a crime spree and there were different jurisdictions? One jurisdiction imposes for 35 years, the next jurisdiction for another 35 years, to be served consecutively.",
  "So the second jurisdiction has the obligation, but not the first? Is that the way it works?",
  "I didn't -- I didn't hear the second.",
  "If we look just at deterrence, my initial instinct is that the difference in life and life without -- life with parole and life without parole is just not a factor in deterrence. I -- I don't know how I'd confirm that one way or the other, but let's -- let's assume that there is some basis for that intuition. Then, insofar as the deterrence prong is concerned, since it's not a deterrent, and if you assume that there is rehabilitation, what is the State's interest in keeping the accused, the –- the defendant in custody for the rest of his life if he has been rehabilitated and is no longer a real danger? What's the State's interest?",
  "And you could say retribution, but then you have judges on a case-by-case basis deciding when there should be retribution.",
  "But it seems to me the deterrence interest is quite minimal if you assume rehabilitation or strong evidence of rehabilitation.",
  "Can you tell us just a little bit about the Florida correctional systems, the policies with respect to rehabilitation programs? If they don't have parole, then you might say, well, they don't need rehabilitation programs or that they might need them more. Had the rehabilitation programs been increased or decreased since the phasing out of parole? Or is it about the same? Or are they -- are they non-existent?",
  "Why does a juvenile have a constitutional right to hope, but an adult does not?",
  "Well, suppose arguendo we assume that the judge is right, that Roper did not establish a rule that applies in this case. Then what position are you in with reference to the procedural bar? Do you have any other arguments that overcome the procedural bar?",
  "And you say the -- under Florida law, the question is not whether the right was, to use the phrase, \"clearly established\"?",
  "But the right is whether or not -- it had -- what was your phrase? \"A significant bearing\"?",
  "That wouldn't apply to the Eighth Amendment?",
  "We’re talking about the first sentence of (B), I take it?",
  "What age was he at that point?",
  "But you know that the insurance industry -- the insurance business, as we know it, really began in England in 1680, when they discovered differential calculus, and they had expectancy and actuarial tables, actuarial for life, expectancy for shipping, and this really created a whole new industry. In your view, I think, clearly those would be patentable, the -- the explanation of how to compile an actuarial table and -- and apply it to risk. That certainly would be patentable under your view, and it's -- it's difficult for me to think that Congress would want to -- would have wanted to give only one person the capacity to issue insurance.",
  "And so in the insurance case, it takes a person to go over to the Bureau of Statistics and compile statistics on -- on life -- on life expectancy.",
  "In the Diehr case, the Court said that in the end, the abstract idea must be in a process that, oh, implements a proposal that the patent laws were designed to protect, which brings you almost back to the beginning. You don't --",
  "You don't know much from that language. But that was something that you could touch, that you could see, that looked like a machine; the substance was different before the process and after the process. And -- and none of that's applicable here. It's --",
  "But it would be different, it seems to me, than what you are -- let's assume you can't patent an alphabet. I assume that’s true. And you can take an alphabet to make beautiful words, and -- and so forth. You -- you want to say that these -- these electronic signals can be used in a way just like the alphabet can be used. And many of the scientific briefs say that their process is different, that they are taking electronic signals and turning them into some other sort of signal. But that's not what you are doing.",
  "Was the State Street case a machine-or-transformation test?",
  "You talk about the State Street case in your brief, and it's complicated because of the Federal statute that followed it. If you had just the facts of State Street before us, and forgetting the Federal statute was enacted after it, how would you decide this case?",
  "That's what I thought. And is it -- is it machine or transformation, in your view?",
  "Well, that was one of the reasons I asked you about it, I suppose. Just looking at the whole case, do you think the State Street holding -- the State Street invention was patentable?",
  "How would you come out in the State Street case today, if all of the arguments were made under your test?",
  "That's -- that's a problem I have.",
  "You thought we -- you thought we’d mess it up.",
  "Not all diversity suits have major law firms in them and a lot of resources to spend in -- in discovery to determine more complex tests.",
  "The -- the -- subchapter 2 does talk about a special rule on reopening for battered spouses, children, and parents. Is that a statute where the discretion is committed to the Attorney General?",
  "So -- so it -- so absent the regulation, you would interpret the statute as saying there is no discretion?",
  "No, that wasn't my question. Let's say there’s no regulation. And the statute says, number one, there shall -- so subchapter 2 of the statute says, number one, there shall be motions to reopen. And then there is a special rule for battered spouses. Now, you would interpret that statute, absent any regulation, as saying this is not within the discretion of the Attorney General?",
  "Well, how does an Attorney General decide without -- without using discretion? He must grant, in any case? Whether a battered spouse waits for 15 years, he must grant? Just under the statute, now.",
  "This is hypothetical.",
  "Well, then there must be a discretionary component implicit.",
  "I just want to return for a moment to the battered spouse provision. The battered spouse provision specifically says that in the Attorney General's discretion, he may waive the time limit for the 1 year for the battered spouse. Now, that surely is discretion specified -- and I think the word \"specified\" is important here -- specified in subchapter 2. So there should be no judicial review as to that. You would have to agree with that, wouldn't you?",
  "All right. So then the thing that Congress cares about most is something the court can't review. That is counterintuitive.",
  "What about my question with reference to motions to -- to reopen? That is specified under subchapter 2. That's right there in subchapter 2: There shall be a motion to reopen. Now, if you had no regulation upon it, wouldn't you say that would be within the discretion of the Attorney General?",
  "No. No, that's not my question. Hypothetical, not a real case. Just a hypothetical.",
  "Just so we can talk about the statute. The statute says there -- subchapter 2, the one we are most interested in, specifies -- and that's one of the words -- that there shall be a motion to reopen. Now, don't you think that's within the discretion of the Attorney General, absent any regulations?",
  "All right. So absent a regulation, there would be jurisdiction stripping under that provision, right?",
  "Why?",
  "All right. But you would give me, or would you, the concession that -- or agreement that the Attorney General's discretion to waive the time limit for battered spouses is committed to him? And that's non-judiciary reviewable, wouldn't you think?",
  "Again, that seems odd, that the thing Congress cares about so much that it makes a specific provision can't be subject to judicial review.",
  "Can you give me an idea of how many motions to reopen are brought to the courts for review each year?",
  "So we are talking about 2 or 3,000 petitions to the court each year?",
  "Well -- but that would be a question of law which is accepted.",
  "Have any of those courts said that they don't have a workload problem?",
  "But we are talking about what’s “specified” under subchapter 2. I think that's an important word, in addition to \"under.\" And motions to reopen are specified, and it doesn't say “discretion.” It just says there shall be a motion to reopen. Do you get any mileage from that, or you seem to rest your argument instead on the regulations? And I think that's almost a weaker argument.",
  "So you -- you consider -- you -- you think it's plausible to have a regime where motions to reopen are not discretionary at all, absent regulation? That would seem very odd to me.",
  "Do you think absent the special provisions of the -- of the immigration act that we are considering, if it were just under the APA, that a motion to reopen would be committed by law to agency discretion under 702? Because it seems to me that, you know, there are sources we could look to, to see whether or not it's rationally exercised.",
  "Well, I actually think it helps you because -- there is -- there is something to review, the agency does have discretion. But this statute strips it, because it provides for motions to reopen, specifically. But, of course, you --",
  "-- you don't take that --",
  "Now, what -- on what page? Look at page 6 --",
  "Can you tell me just as a practical matter, suppose -- suppose the county says, you know, we found out that we were defrauded by this contractor, and it sues the contractor. But its suit doesn't cover really all of the damages, only half of it. Can a qui tam action then be commenced for the portion that the county isn't seeking? I mean, how does that work?",
  "Which there would be if there's a complaint filed by the county - -",
  "-- against the contractor.",
  "Depends on the identity of the claim?",
  "And -- and suppose in their race to the courthouse, the qui tam plaintiff files on Monday and the county files on Tuesday?",
  "I'd like to go back to Justice Ginsburg's very first question. I want you to assume that in category 1 it means State or Federal. Maybe you disagree, maybe you don't. I want you to assume that. If we assume that, does it make any sense to confine category 2 to Federal only?",
  "And what's the practical -- your answer was, well, that's because -- I want to know the practical rationale for that, the practical reasons why that should make sense.",
  "Well, but if we had that --",
  "If we had that kind of analysis, where the -- where the company has to reserve all of its defenses, then we would never get to the statute of limitations problem. I think we have to assume that the -- that their theory of the case is correct. We have to -- to assume it for statute of limitations purposes. Of course, you deny it.",
  "Well, I -- I think you don't get -- get very far. And -- and it seems to me, as Justice Stevens's and Justice Ginsburg's questions indicate, that the companies can't have it both ways. They can't endorse the Twombly case and then say just an inquiry notice of a general -- of a general nature suffices. You have to have specific evidence of scienter. And there’s nothing here to indicate that the plaintiffs had that.",
  "Even on -- on -- but you have you to say, on their theory of the case.",
  "Well, but if not, then the whole storm warning theory that you have conceded doesn't work.",
  "Well, it does seem to me that even if we adopt your theory of the case, there is some problem with the allegation that there was fraud, because Vioxx did not -- because Merck did not disclose that the hypothesis was only hypothetical, and the FDA August letter made that clear. So it seems to me you may have a problem as to that aspect of the case.",
  "But, again, I'm not sure we would parse that out up here.",
  "Oh, well, you mean we have to look to see how the analysts react?",
  "If it were confined to unlawful activity and narrowly drawn, do you concede that such a statute would be constitutional?",
  "You say \"perhaps.\" Yes or no? Can Congress by an appropriately, an appropriately drawn narrow statute, prohibit attorneys from advising, A, criminal conduct in reference to a bankruptcy; or, B, civil conduct -- conduct that is improper under the civil code because it's a fraud on creditors?",
  "Well, again in the hypothetical context, could Congress enforce by a statute what it requires in the attestation clause?",
  "You think the attestation clause cannot be the basis for sanctioning an attorney.",
  "I mean, how can that be if it's too vague.",
  "The attestation clause is designed to ensure that the attorney has performed in an ethical and proper way, I take it.",
  "Isn't that one of its purposes?",
  "I won't take up too much more of your argument, but it just seems to me odd that you can enforce an attestation clause, but not a statute that does the same thing. I don't understand the principle for that. You say it's a gateway and it's designed to facilitate the bankruptcy process. Well, the government could say the same thing about its statute.",
  "Well, Congress often forgets about the First Amendment, but lawyers don't.",
  "Well, if we assume a proper limited construction -- I know you disagree with that, but if we assume that we can limit the statute properly so that it applies just to unethical conduct, then you can't give that advice to anybody, and the fact that assisted persons is a subclass of that is irrelevant.",
  "Yes, but that doesn't go to your other point that there's a problem in determining the class of persons. If it's unethical, you can't give it to anybody. And the fact that the class of persons is difficult to understand is irrelevant.",
  "I have heard of referring to legislative history when the statute is ambiguous. I haven't heard of referring to legislative history to make the statute ambiguous.",
  "Well, A, I suppose you don't have to advertise; or B, if you do, you can say in your bread hypo: Under the Federal law we have bread, but our bread is -- I don't know -- gluten-free or whatever. You can use - -",
  "You can always add -- add in order to make it non-misleading.",
  "Well, what -- what if the creditor is sitting in the courtroom and has actually made arguments and appeared in some other aspects of the case? Then they come to the student loan and the -- and it's ordered discharged without any hearing, with the creditor sitting there. The case goes to judgment, there’s a final decree of discharge. Can the debtor -- pardon me. Can the creditor come in 10 years later and say, oh, this is void?",
  "Well, what about -- what about my question?",
  "No, no. No, no, no. My hypothetical is there is -- it has commenced. It’s a big hearing. There's lots of issues. The student loan creditor is there, actually participates in some of the hearings on other issues. Then, while they -- while they are still there, still represented, the judge says: Now, I'm going to discharge the student debt; I'm not going to have any hearing. The creditor does nothing. Can the creditor come in 10 years later and say this is a void judgment?",
  "Well, my case is just a little different in that the creditor is there in the courtroom represented.",
  "What about my --",
  "What about my question?",
  "I think --",
  "I think that's an astounding -- an astounding conclusion, that there -- that you simply are writing out the doctrine of -- of waiver altogether.",
  "But the idea that they have to have a charade hearing is -- is equally off-putting.",
  "I didn't hear. Proper --",
  "I was going to ask whether or not in -- on the facts of this case, the client could have waited until the final judgment, not appeal, but then come in under Rule 60?",
  "So then the client is not required to -- the creditor is not required to appeal?",
  "All right. So I don't think they could have -- and of course, you don't think it's void. It could come in under 60(b) if it's void, but you don't think it's void.",
  "All right. So you have to show mistake or surprise, and you doubt that there was a mistake or surprise here.",
  "Let me just ask this and maybe I have bankruptcy law wrong. My -- my understanding is that if creditors are not listed, they are not discharged, correct? I think that's right in most cases. If you don't list the creditor, the creditor is not discharged.",
  "I'm -- if you're having problems with this --",
  "I’m just wondering, doesn't it happen all the time that creditors are not listed and then they come in later and say the debt is not discharged? I mean, doesn't that happen all the time?",
  "And is -- is the rationale that that -- that that discharge would be void as to them, or that they are just not covered? Suppose the bankruptcy judge makes a mistake and lists a creditor by name as being discharged, but that creditor never received notice. Is it void?",
  "Well, is this -- is this case all that different, then?",
  "He got notice of something that was void.",
  "I mean, that -- that -- that assumes that he got notice of something that was legally improper.",
  "Well, I'm not sure there was proper notice. There was not a notice that there would be a contested hearing. Or that there would be an adversary hearing.",
  "I'm -- I’m not sure that there was a proper notice.",
  "Well, of course that's the problem in the case. Sometimes we decide cases that don't make a lot of difference and that once we decide the rule everybody will know what the rule is. But in this case, the Petitioners say that if we adopt the rule that the Ninth Circuit adopted, it's going to be extremely burdensome and costly on -- on municipalities, on -- on those who give student loans, et cetera. And that -- and that you are just creating a tremendous burden on an already overburdened system.",
  "On the practicality point, you talk about electronic notice. I suppose that that -- that the creditors for student loans could have the automatic electronic thing where they say, we insist on a hardship hearing. But that doesn't solve the problem, because they’d then have to go back and see whether or not there was a hardship hearing in the case. So that -- that means they have -- they have -- they have to -- they have to inquire into every case whether or not the proper hearing has been made.",
  "Oh, you mean they can't ask for a hearing unless there is a reasonable ground to believe that there is no undue hardship -- can’t even ask?",
  "Well, what does the notice of -- the time for a notice of appeal run from?",
  "What does the time for the notice of appeal run from -- the discharge order?",
  "Now -- now, just in the -- in the general run of the bankruptcy, how do you calculate when you have to file your appeal -- from the time of the discharge order?",
  "Let me ask you this question on Florida valuation. Assume you prevail, there's a cause of action for a taking. You have a beachfront area, beachfront home, in which there's a hurricane and there's a loss of the beach and a sudden drop, so that it's now a 60-foot -- a 60-foot drop. The State comes in and says the only way we can fix this is to extend the beach and make it a larger beach on what was formerly our submerged land. And it does that that. Under -- and it -- and it has the same rule. Under your view, is the State required to pay you for the loss of your right of contact to the beach, your littoral right, because there's let's say another 100 foot of new beach? Are they entitled to offset that against the enhanced value to your property by reason of the fact that they've saved it from further erosion and have given you a beach where there was none before?",
  "So the enhancement from the post-project benefit is a credit to the State in the takings action?",
  "But it would be subject to the easement that the State acknowledges you have, which is the easement of access?",
  "Well, but the -- the --",
  "No, no. As I understand the supreme court's opinions, you have several special and exclusive -- or exclusive -- or exclusive, common law littoral rights: right to have access, right to reasonable use of the water, right to accretion and reliction, right to the unobstructed view. They can't sell that.",
  "No, no.",
  "The -- the hypothetical is the State says that the property owner, the upland owner, has these rights. The Chief Justice asked you, could this property be sold? I think the answer would be yes, but it would be subject to the continuance of that easement in the dominant estate. That has to be the answer under the supreme court's opinion. Now, you may not agree with that.",
  "All right. That gets to the question, if we agree with you that there is such a thing as a judicial takings, what is the standard by which we decide when the Federal courts can and must intervene to disagree with the -- with the State law and to characterize it as a taking when the State has said that it is not? Would we just find all sorts of adjectives -- it’s sudden, unexpected, unfounded -- we just have a string of adjectives, sort of like an adequate independent State ground rule or something?",
  "Okay, I'm familiar with that opinion. Now, in this case, number one, it seems to me that in order to do that, we have to become real experts in Florida law. Number two, once we do that it seems to me that this opinion really addresses something that's -- that's new, and it's -- it’s grounded in common law doctrines. It's a close case. It might have gone either way. Let's assume that. Does there have to be some finding that the State decision is clearly unreasonable? I mean, if it's a close case, does the State win under your test?",
  "Well, it seems to me that, reading the opinion, I -- I can get there. There was some talk about the Belvedere case as helping you. I thought it did not at all. That was a very odd case where the easement is wholly separated from the dominant. It's the reverse. They take the main property and leave the easement, rather than vice versa. So I just thought that was irrelevant.",
  "The State can do an accretion --",
  "-- but not an avulsion?",
  "But the problem with the argument that I'm having is that in the last colloquy with Justice Breyer, we heard how reasonable this act was. That's one thing. But you have taken the position that it's your property and you can do with it what you want anyway. Now, maybe in this case it won't make a difference, because it's so reasonable, it’s -- there's not a taking. But what about -- what do you call those -- the spring fling, the spring break --",
  "-- hypothetical, or a permanent oceanography museum?",
  "So you --",
  "And you think there's a taking as a matter of Georgia -- pardon me, of Florida law if enjoyment of the view and access is substantially impaired? I mean, is that the test?",
  "Do you think that either all of the time or some of the time a public beach would -- that intervenes between the upland and the water would be a substantial impairment of the upland owner's rights?",
  "That -- that's exactly my point. You say that the State owns the beach, and it's okay because there's a protection against unreasonable use. And I'm asking whether or not a State beach with, what do you call them, port-a-johns and hot dog stands and so forth, isn't a substantial impairment of the upland owner's use? And you say, well, the State owns it --",
  "But that takes away from your earlier argument that we don't need to worry because there can be no interference with substantial enjoyment. And it seems to me that Justice Alito's question has still not been answered in your argument.",
  "I want you to talk to me about what the constitutional law ought to be in this case as a general matter. We'll figure out facial and -- and as-applied later. I still see that your argument leaves open this question in my mind raised by the concerns that Justice Alito has expressed.",
  "But when they do, they're going to be met by you when you're in the trial court and you say the State owns the property.",
  "What authority is there in Florida law or in general law to say that the act of an -- an artificial person is an accretion or avulsion, instead of just an act of nature? What -- what case do I read or authority do I read?",
  "But -- but did they call it an avulsion?",
  "That -- that -- so that doesn't answer my question.",
  "Has the -- has the Florida Supreme Court ever explicitly interpreted -- what is it? Article I, section 8, of the Florida Constitution more expansively than -- and explicitly so -- and explicitly so, than Miranda?",
  "But your case has to be that, if we adopt the Petitioner's petition, it's perfectly fine for every jurisdiction in the country to use this warning, right?",
  "And every jurisdiction in the country can use it, so we can -- we can talk about whether or not it’s adequate.",
  "Excuse me. You think lack of uniformity is a good idea?",
  "Could you tell us where that is? I think you mean page 479, but I'm not sure.",
  "What page are you on now?",
  "We could write that down. It could be the next case.",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that's the case. The remand in Long was only to address another issue. The Long Court took its determination as being binding on the issue that was before the Court in Long --",
  "-- in that case.",
  "And in each time, it said that it was by extension from Miranda. It always linked it, and that was the question that was presented in the State court --",
  "-- that it certified.",
  "That's the whole reason we have jurisdiction, so that Miranda will not be confused, and so that it won't be a hazard on the landscape when people say \"Miranda\" and they mean something else.",
  "And it's not at all clear that the Washington -- that the Florida Supreme Court could in this case go back to the Constitution. That's -- you can't get that out of Long.",
  "It's -- maybe in some other case. Not necessarily in this one, because Long leads to -- to the contrary.",
  "But you have no case in which the Florida Supreme Court has explicitly said that we have a warning that is more strict, more rigorous than what Miranda requires? You have no case?",
  "Well, except the words that it quoted from the lower court opinion -- that is, we are talking about the -- the Fifth Amendment, and by extension, Article I, section 9.",
  "So that seems to me to indicate that it’s incorporating, not going further.",
  "I think the opposite. I think the repeated linkage shows that they think they are the same.",
  "What happens --",
  "What happens to the information that the board obtains? Can the board go public with that --",
  "-- or is it all confidential?",
  "The -- the burden of time of compliance?",
  "The burden is because it's difficult and expensive to comply?",
  "No -- but I'm -- I’m talking about the harm to your client and to the -- those similarly situated.",
  "There’s the cost of compliance. What other harms or dangers or risks are inherent in the power of the board unmonitored, unchecked by the SEC, to investigate?",
  "But -- but the question is -- I assume it’s the follow-up question that Justice Ginsburg is interested in -- under your view of the case, why is that lawful?",
  "But that's -- that's the history and tradition of this board, which isn't very long. But the history and tradition of boards like this is that their investigative powers are independent. Now, you say that there could be a rule, but that just isn't the way it works. And if you refer us to history and tradition for other purposes, we ought to look at the operational principles, operational assumptions of this board.",
  "I want to ask -- I want to ask one thing: You want us to imply or find -- or you want us to infer from the statute that there's a power in the President to remove SEC commissioners for cause? You want us to find that that is implied in the statute?",
  "All right. What is -- what is the authority for us to find that there is an implication in the statute to remove just for cause? There’s -- wouldn't that be unique in our precedents?",
  "I mean, if there is a removal power implied, why isn't it removal for all purposes? How -- why can it be limited to just for cause? What authority do we have to do that?",
  "But we are talking -- we are talking about independent or quasi-independent agencies, and I understood Solicitor General Kagan to say that it's quite all right with an independent agency for the President to phone them on an ongoing basis and say, do this, and do that. Do you agree that that's what a President ought to do with an independent agency?",
  "Call them on a routine basis, to supervise what they are doing?",
  "Well, they -- they -- this board has authority to -- to tax those people it regulates, to issue subpoenas, and so forth.",
  "But this isn't subject to the operations of the President, if he has to go through an independent agency. Are you encouraging the President, on an ongoing, daily basis, to instruct an independent agency what he wants done?",
  "No, no, Humphrey's -- Humphrey's Executor was not a specific issue. It was just the general qualifications.",
  "I -- I understand that.",
  "One of your arguments -- an important argument in your brief is the -- the Federal balance, apart from vagueness for a moment --",
  "-- which was the lurking problem here. You say it should be State law, because then the Federal courts would at least tell States that they can't enforce their own law strictly enough. But if it's Federal law, then the Federal government tells the States: Well, regardless of your standards, we have our standards. I don't see much to choose from in this --",
  "-- in those -- those two alternatives.",
  "You say if there’s a State law prohibition --",
  "-- then this statute applies. But then -- then the Federal government is telling the States: Well, we don't like the way you enforce your laws; we're going to do it.",
  "So it seems to me there's not much to choose between -- between the two arguments.",
  "Are -- are you saying that unless we adopt the limiting instruction that you propose, the statute is then vague?",
  "Just while we are on the Oeschler thing, and then you'll probably want to go on to the other thing. Assume this trial were held again. The government said: All the same evidence -- same evidence. Would that evidence suffice for an instruction to the jury? Could the case go to the jury under the Oeschler theory?",
  "Kickback or bribe.",
  "Under the test that you propose, is the test the same? Does the statute read the same way, and is the test the same for private and public officials?",
  "Well, then we -- then if we accept your view, we have to have one subset of definitions for private officials and another for public officials. It's hard to do that under the statute.",
  "Well, under the judge's bribery case that we just -- that you discussed earlier, couldn't you take the position that that money the judge took as a bribe really should have been paid to the government?",
  "But that would fit your test, though.",
  "Well, it's a little - - it's a little odd that you -- you would say that an argument that shows a way the statute can be saved cannot be -- cannot be presented.",
  "I mean, he's saying the statute could be saved, if at all, if you adopt this - - this construction. And if you do, his -- his conviction must be set aside.",
  "Well, on the other hand, if we just can't find a -- a grounding in the statute for it, then that's because the statute's there.",
  "So if the employee would be fired if defalcation had come to light, that's material?",
  "All right, that's the ball game.",
  "Then that's the ball game. Hypo: you go to the ball game, the government - -",
  "The employer finds out about it, he fires -- so it's material because you would be fired for it.",
  "I'm asking about just materiality. Just materiality would be satisfied. You said that if the employer would fire, that is material. And then we had the ball game hypothetical. Then you said oh, well, and then some other thing. But we are talking just about materiality so you should stick with that question.",
  "He drives to the ball game in the government -- in the company car.",
  "But it said honest services include fiduciary duties under corporate.",
  "And -- and why is it that you say an arbitrator cannot do that, but a judge can?",
  "But are they situated and do they have the same authority as a court would in determining that issue, given the fact that it was remitted to them to decide?",
  "And you would -- would you describe -- would you describe the authority of a court any differently than you've just described the authority of an arbitrator?",
  "Suppose one person doesn't observe all the procedures. One person prepares the sample, another person puts it on the paper, another person reads the machine, another person calibrates the machine.",
  "No, no, no. The evidence is presented, and the test comes out so -- positive, so that the gun fires or that it's a drug or that it's a DNA sample. Can the conclusion be presented by one witness from the lab, when that witness did not observe all of the procedures?",
  "I knew this case presented us a problem.",
  "Did it misspend that money? Are you saying the money was misspent?",
  "What is there in the record that shows that the claims of the States are identical to the claim the Commission is asserting, which was the -- which was the instance in the Arizona-California case?",
  "It seems to me that it's the obligation of the Commission to show that there is an absolute parallel between the claims. And I just don't see where I can infer from the record or conclude that that is the case. And if -- and if that is not so, then the Commission is not like the Indian tribes in the Arizona case.",
  "Well, I am conscious of your white light, but it does seem to me --",
  "-- that the Commission is -- is asking for the money for itself.",
  "But here the Commission is seeking sums for itself. What assurance do we have that the Commission, if it received the money, would give it back to the States exactly in the ratio the States demand it?",
  "I -- I think it's their obligation to show the complete parallel between -- between the claims, and that that has not been done.",
  "Take a hypothetical case where North Carolina did have a real advantage and they used the money to create a facility, would that bear on the unjust enrichment claim or even the sanctions claim?",
  "I just want -- you said the only State that contributed money to the Commission was North Carolina? I just want to make sure I heard that right.",
  "That’s it?",
  "Right.",
  "Suppose -- suppose we think that the same State -- or the same-claim rule applies, and that if the Commission is asserting the same claim as the State, that then it can sue. Suppose that's the rule. Are these the same claims?",
  "Well, is part of the statutory scheme that you can be committed to Federal custody for, say, a year and then the State takes it over?",
  "Why would a State want to incur that extra expense if --",
  "-- if the Federal Government is going to do it for them?",
  "Could the Federal Government order a commitment of anyone who's been in Federal custody over the last 10 years?",
  "No, no, no. That makes your -- my hypo too easy for you.",
  "So that must be because there is a lack of Federal power.",
  "But the brief -- excuse me.",
  "Well, when I was thinking about your hypothetical, I thought, well, that's a pretty easy commerce power argument. I -- I notice that in -- in the government's position, you don't argue the Commerce Clause very much, and I -- we’ve got Morrison v. Brzonkala looking at you and Printz and so forth. But it -- suppose Congress said there is a class of committable, dangerous sex offenders that are crossing State lines and using interstate facilities, and made those findings. Would that be sufficient to establish a Federal commitment law?",
  "I didn't hear. You think they have a power to --",
  "Because the government --",
  "Well, suppose, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, he caught the communicable disease in the prison as a result of poor prison conditions.",
  "No, no. The hypothetical is that his sentence ends, and they want to commit him to a Federal health facility.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, there is -- there is in the sense that the relation between the prisoner and his or her State is disrupted for, say, 15 years, and then this person is just a derelict.",
  "Well, suppose you -- suppose you have a --",
  "But what if -- what if you’d have a country in which ne exeat orders are routinely imposed in every custody case? Then it's almost like your statutory case here. What does that have to do with custody?",
  "It seems -- excuse me,",
  "-- but I'll just finish my own question.",
  "It seems to me that what you are saying is that, in some countries, there -- there is a presumption that there is always custody in the party -- in both parties.",
  "As long as you brought that up, I was just going to ask: Should -- if you prevail in this case, should there be a remand to see if that section applies?",
  "Well, you’re saying -- I know the white light's on -- but you are saying that every case that involves the Chilean government, the convention here is applicable, requiring return?",
  "Do you -- do you agree that every case originating in Chile must come out this way, so that there is a return required?",
  "But that seems to me remote from the concept of custody that the convention has in mind.",
  "Well, you could say that the limitation on the custodial right is the right of the husband to visit once a month or 3 -- 3 weeks a month. I -- I think that's slightly an artificial approach.",
  "But that -- that cuts both ways so far as you are concerned, because it includes -- might mean that custody includes the right to insist on living in a specific country.",
  "But, textually, that’s certainly plausible.",
  "I had one question for the other counsel and didn't have an opportunity to ask it. If the Respondent were return to Chile, would she face criminal charges or contempt charges?",
  "Well, but the ne exeat order --",
  "And I was --",
  "I was going to say the ne exeat order, under your view, is the one order that can't be enforced anyplace.",
  "But that -- but that's a defense to a removal order.",
  "Well, what about attorneys' fees?",
  "Changes in the -- in the rule apply? They make a change to make it -- give the passer more protection, but there's -- this really hurts certain teams, which mostly run, and so -- rule of reason?",
  "Well, how -- you know the litigation system. How do we know?",
  "Well, my -- my hypothetical: Two or three teams which aren't particularly popular in the league are hurt by the rule change. And --",
  "And notice, there’s -- that the owners sit around the room, they are liable for a conspiracy. I mean, this is serious stuff. Triple damages. I don't -- and my question, really, was the same as Justice Ginsburg’s. Can you give us a zone where we are sure a rule of reason inquiry will be -- would be inappropriate? We can take care of it on summary judgment. Because if you don't have some sort of section 1 carve-out for joint action, then -- then everything is under the rule of reason.",
  "Well, but it seems to me what we are doing is exploring the consequences of completely discarding the unitary theory.",
  "And so -- and the earlier questions, it seemed to me, were helpful. The Saturday/Sunday scheduling issue, it seems to me, pretty clearly on its face does limit competition. You -- you have one day instead of two days. Then Justice Stevens said: Suppose it makes them better players because they are rested and so they can perform better. I take it that was the purpose of the question. And I -- I still don't get any answers. I don't know where we are with this.",
  "And -- and it's a difficult area, but I’d like -- and -- but I’d like some guidance.",
  "Well, do we have to ask what was the intent at the beginning, as kind of an originalism thing? Everybody sits around and says: Let's have a football league. And 20 years later, they say: You know, the sale of hats and shirts is a pretty good thing; let's get into that business, too. That would -- that would -- that's case 1. Case 2 is, when they formed the league initially, 30 years ago, they said: And be sure we will sell hats, and -- I don't understand the base point from which I find that this is a single entity.",
  "Well, do you take issue with my question that this is a relevant inquiry? Is it part of the original agreement or isn't it, and why is it that the original agreement is somehow sacrosanct? I don't understand.",
  "Well, but I mean -- if you’re coming up and saying, well, we have a principal-agent here, I could understand that, but that's I didn't think the question we are here to decide.",
  "On -- on the tortious interference as to whether or not that's under 301. Sure, agent-principal, I understand that. But that -- that's a new argument so far as I'm concerned.",
  "Is it your briefs? Is it part of the question?",
  "Well, but the -- the basic question is -- the Chief Justice began with it -- isn't this -- isn't this a tort action? You say, well, it's grounded in contract. I -- I really have a problem with the word \"grounded.\" If you say it necessarily implicates or it's entangled, then I could understand that. But grounded in contract -- we ask what the source of the original obligation is. And these parties were not -- or the international was not part of the -- part of the -- part of the contract.",
  "Well, it seems to me the strongest argument you have is that this tortious interference is pre-empted under State law. So we have a -- a vacuum if we don't accept -- accept your view. Let me ask you this: My understanding is -- correct me if I am wrong, please -- this Court has not said that they -- that the State law cause of action for interference with contract relations is pre­ empted. This Court has not said that. Am I correct about that?",
  "The circuits have said that, but we haven't said that. Am I right about that?",
  "No, no. I’m talking -- I’m talking specifically that -- interference with advantageous business relations or interfering with an existing contract -- that, we have not addressed in this Court.",
  "But -- but it did not -- it did not include interference with a -- with a contractual relation. We have not, as a specific holding -- tell me if I’m wrong. I will look at Allis-Chalmers.",
  "It -- it would seem to me that one of your strongest points is that this is pre­ empted by State law. If -- if that's not true, then we would be deciding the case based on a premise that is -- is unclear.",
  "Do you take the position that the cause of action for interference with a contract has been pre-empted insofar as State law is concerned?",
  "What is your position on that point?",
  "Do you -- do you -- does your client take the position that that law is correct, that the Federal law has pre-empted State law actions for interference with -- with contract relations?",
  "All right. So then you are submitting to this Court that the purpose of the National Relation -- Labor Relations Act and its effect was to give immunity to unions for intentional interference with contractual relations?",
  "Well, isn't that the effect of your argument here?",
  "But if it's outside 301, where does pre-emption come from, Garmon?",
  "If I could interrupt just for a moment? Allis-Chalmers was 301. Allis-Chalmers says 301 covers contract, and, therefore, there’s a pre-emption. So I take it you’re not talking about Allis-Chalmers pre-emption. You are talking about Garmon or Machinists or something.",
  "But if you say both of them, then we’re back where we started. If 301 pre­ empts, then it should be within the ambit of 301's jurisdiction to the Federal court.",
  "Is -- is leaving the premises the sine quo non of a termination?",
  "But aren't there -- aren't there some operators that own their own premises?",
  "So only one of the three would suffice in your view?",
  "Just --",
  "Just testing your view, suppose there are two franchisees, and in each case the oil company reduces the amount they're paying for the gas. One franchisee can't afford it, leaves, quits -- termination. The other franchisee has a considerable amount of savings, and he protests, but he stays in business. Different result?",
  "No, no. In my first, he ceases to operate and he moves out of the premises.",
  "If the government comes up here, as I think they will in a few minutes, and tells us that there is such a thing as constructive termination, do you know what hypothetical they give us to illustrate how that would work? I mean, it's their argument, but I'm curious. I will be curious to know how you would respond to that.",
  "In other words, there is a small universe of cases in which there is a constructive termination without leaving the premises, without severing the fuel, et cetera.",
  "I just don't know what they're going to -- how you would respond to that?",
  "But then you'd just have a magic words test.",
  "But Justice Breyer asked you for a test. Maybe this would help you. If you are the trial judge, how do you instruct the jury to determine when there has been a constructive termination? You have to have an instruction.",
  "I'm quite frankly amazed that you say you don't have a test.",
  "You’re coming up here and telling us that there’s such a thing as a constructive termination, I mean -- but then you don't have a test for it?",
  "I may be incorrect. I -- I thought your friends for the Petitioners said there is no case in which there’s a constructive eviction but where the lessee remains on the premises. Maybe I misheard. What is -- what is your principal case where the lessee remains on the premises, but there is a constructive eviction?",
  "Well, just getting back to the constructive eviction, I took a quick look at the Marini and Ireland case that you cite, and I think the -- the Petitioner is correct. There, the tenant left part of the premises, and it was a constructive eviction as to that part. And it's a 1970 case. I just don't think you have many cases to help you in the constructive eviction area. It's kind of like the Holmes -- Sherlock, not Oliver Wendell --",
  "-- that says the dog doesn't bark. I mean, there is this huge body of landlord/tenant law, and you have just a few cases, and one of them, at least, doesn't appear to support you.",
  "But -- but I suppose the thrust of Justice Stevens's question was that if you have a very small population that we are concerned with, then the disparity can be very substantial, especially if you use the comparative disparity.",
  "And I think -- at least, I was interested in that aspect of his question.",
  "Yes, but we have a half­ hour. I’d kind of like to know how to --",
  "Are you -- are you saying that systematic exclusion -- and we are assuming good faith, no intent to discriminate --",
  "-- that systematic exclusion is always proven or disproven by statistics?",
  "Well --",
  "And I’ll -- I’ll allow you to answer, of course, but --",
  "If not, how do we show systematic exclusion? Again, assuming good faith, no intent to discriminate.",
  "Let me get that. If -- if a procedure routinely results in statistical underrepresentation that is significant, is that not a clear showing of systematic exclusion?",
  "Well, yes -- no, that's -- it's a hypothetical.",
  "Routinely results in significant underrepresentation, then that is automatically systematic exclusion?",
  "I mean, isn't the -- I'm trying to think about the third prong of -- of --",
  "-- of Duren. Isn't -- if it's routine and it's predictable and it's constant, isn't that always due to systematic exclusion?",
  "Well, that's policy. Can't you say that that is systematic exclusion because it's part of the system?",
  "Are you saying it's -- and these categories don't often help us. Is this a question of law? A mixed question of law and fact?",
  "And that's the statutory term? \"Benefits due under the terms of the plan\" is a statutory term?",
  "They have not had --",
  "You’re being careful not to not to say \"bad faith.\" There was no bad faith here?",
  "I'm looking for -- I'm still not sure of the standard.",
  "I'm the district judge, and I want to defer in -- in case A and not in case B. What -- what's the difference?",
  "Well, what’s -- what’s the authority for the government to enter into the agreement?",
  "I mean, if the statute says there has to be an offset, that's it.",
  "But do the guidelines reflect Justice Breyer's hypothetical?",
  "It seems to me the underlying assumption -- and some of the question would have been put to you by the court -- is that the government has somehow benefited because the money is created to offset the debt. It really isn't. It would -- this would be true if an attorney were suing a third party and creating a fund, and the government said, ah, there's the money. In this case, it's just being paid from one account to the other. The government would be better off if there were no suit at all.",
  "It's just paying itself from one account to the other.",
  "I’m having trouble with this aspect, and it may -- may be that it varies from State to State. But as a general matter, under State law, let's say that the employee makes a contingency fee arrangement with a lawyer to sue the employer and wins $50,000. It's a one-third contingent fee. The -- the employee already owes the employer $40,000. It would seem to me under the general principle of offset that the employer has to only pay $10,000, and the attorney is not going to get his full fee.",
  "And that's just -- that's just the law of offsets.",
  "Because again, it's the same party. If they created money by suing some third person, then that's different.",
  "And -- and so I -- it seems to me that what you're -- what you're asking for is just contrary to the standard law of offsets.",
  "And it's even worse because the Federal statute says that there shall be this offset first as a matter of priority.",
  "Well, in the generalized sense of -- of common law of offsets, as I've described to it, sure, the attorney has a beneficial interest, but he's not going to be able to collect it vis-à-vis the employer who is entitled to an offset.",
  "Do you calculate the fee under either the Social Security Act or EAJA, depending on the case? Do you ever calculate it under both so that you get some under each?",
  "The -- the -- you calculate it under both so you get some under each?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, actually in -- in this case, am I correct that -- that 9 years has gone by, but that's because of the litigation? The suit was filed, what, 4 months after the 300-day period ran?",
  "Was it -- was it 132 named people or was it just 132 undifferentiated?",
  "Well, could the government, I assume -- I assume you will say \"yes\" -- could the government forbid any NGO or other organization or person from giving tsunami aid to one of these organizations, from giving them money?",
  "Could they -- could the government prohibit that?",
  "Okay. Let's assume the government could prohibit that. Then the next question is: Could the government prohibit speech instructing the terrorist organization how to get the tsunami aid?",
  "Brandenburg?",
  "But -- but if you get tsunami money, that frees up your other assets for terrorist money. So why can't the government forbid teaching how to get that money?",
  "Then what's the test? Is it -- you say it's not Brandenburg?",
  "Well, suppose it's a ban just for travel to meet with terrorist organizations, Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical.",
  "But what about the -- what about the hypothetical?",
  "It's what the Chief Justice says: In any context, support ultimately will inure to the benefit of a terrorist organization, and we have a governmental interest in not allowing that.",
  "No, no. No, no. I thought that he was -- he wants to meet with the people. The New York Times didn't meet with Hamas to tell them how great their editorial was.",
  "But it didn’t -- it was not a statute which involves banning financial or other tangible support, and page 17 of your brief made -- this is a difficult case for me. And the second paragraph, page 17, you say: \"The narrow focus of plaintiffs' claims in this Court means that the case does not involve the propriety of banning financial or other tangible support.\"",
  "Then you say: \"Nor does it involve speech advocating or teaching criminal or violent activity.\" But it does involve speech, let's say arguendo, that is tantamount to material support.",
  "Suppose the speech is tantamount to material support in that it legitimizes, encourages, or strengthens the organization.",
  "And this is support. It's different.",
  "But there wasn't a statute on the books that prohibited material support --",
  "And here there is, and this is in aid of that prohibition.",
  "We have to be conscious of the white light. I have just one -- one question. The old equity rule was that you don't enjoin a criminal statute; you wait until something happens. And the reason is then we have specific facts. And if we said that here, you would say, oh, you’re chilling speech. What's your best case in the precedents of this Court for our entertaining an challenge that -- this is not really -- we usually talk about as-applied after the fact. Coates, there was a conviction.",
  "What's your -- what's your best case?",
  "Can they -- can they advocate to the association? There are many kinds of advocacy. You can advocate to the world that they are right. Can you advocate to the association that you should change your ways, that you should use Lexis to find international law precedents, et cetera?",
  "And suppose the organization's board of directors agrees with that and wants them to address the general membership on that point, and they are doing it with the blessing of the organization.",
  "Do you stick with the argument made below that it's unlawful to file an amicus brief?",
  "I think I'm right in saying it that that was the argument below.",
  "But Justice Ginsburg's question is: Can you advocate peaceful means? And let's assume that if they embrace peaceful means, they get more interest in their organization, the organization becomes stronger for all purposes. Can you do that? That was Justice Ginsburg's question.",
  "And here's how to do it. And here's how to go to the U.N., and here's how to apply for aid, and here's how to file an amicus brief.",
  "But -- but I have the same --",
  "I had the same question as Justice Stevens. It's a very odd as-applied challenge because there hasn't been a prosecution. And vagueness as applied, I think as Professor Cole can answer, is, it seems to me, if, you know, that it applies, it isn't vague. I don’t understand that, but --",
  "I -- I can't -- I can't think of a case in which the Court, pre-prosecution in a declaratory judgment, has said that it's improper as applied to certain things. Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I am missing some case.",
  "I -- I agree. And that was as applied to a conviction.",
  "I just haven't seen an as-applied challenge on declaratory relief. The government doesn't seem to object to that procedure.",
  "Can you give us the page?",
  "That’s -- yes, that’s Harris.",
  "What's the -- I don't want to interrupt your nice organization here. But what is the principle, the general rule, that you articulate to support the distinction between 30 being necessarily an element and 7 a sentencing factor? What's the general rule here?",
  "Other than, this is just --",
  "-- other than how awful this is.",
  "Please.",
  "Is that just based on empirical studies or is there guideline support for that?",
  "I understand. I understand that.",
  "It's a collateral point: Does the government have to show, or does the -- don't you have to find that the machinegun is operable?",
  "And do -- do they generally require registration even if the offense was committed before the registration act was passed in the State?",
  "So what you’re saying is that, even under your interpretation, there is going to be registration in at least one State?",
  "Under three.",
  "You answered Justice Alito by saying there are cases in which your inquiry is more searching, more demanding, under four. It might also be the other way around. I mean, if you satisfy -- if, under three, you find that it hasn't affected the outcome, then I don't know where you'd go under four.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. There -- there is an overlap.",
  "The point may be tangential, but if both counsel were aware of the date problem, that 2001 was the enactment of the statute, and the jury was later properly instructed, do you think that the government would find it important to introduce the evidence of the pre-enactment conduct, just to set forth scheme, plan, design, purpose, to tell the jury the story?",
  "Do you agree that this is ex post facto, as opposed to a general due process violation?",
  "Well, you -- you agree that there is a violation?",
  "Well, except that I think most trial judges would have admitted this evidence with the proper instruction to the jury, that it's background evidence so you -- you can't tell the jury the story and just begin in 2001, or it doesn't make much sense to them.",
  "Now, I agree there was not a proper instruction here, there should have been an objection, and so forth. But in an ordinary trial, this evidence would have come in with the proper limiting instruction.",
  "Of -- of -- of course, the jury would have to be instructed very carefully.",
  "And this was a long -- a long jury deliberation.",
  "Well, you can be pleased that I was not the trial judge.",
  "Well, I -- I thought what we have said that it's just a violation of due process to convict someone for conduct that was not criminal when the conduct was -- was made. It's -- it's -- it's just a due process -- it's a due process violation. It just -- it's a serious due process violation.",
  "Excuse me. What was the page? Nine --",
  "Were -- were these colloquies that are reported, the -- the pages we have just been reviewing, heard by the entire jury pool?",
  "Or were they just -- where the person -- the juror was standing in front of the bench for this?",
  "It's hard for me to think that the voir dire would have been much shorter even if there had been no showing of pervasive prejudice.",
  "Five hours sounds to me about standard for a case of this difficulty.",
  "Well, a concession that a bribe or a kickback scheme statute would not be vague is hardly a concession that this statute as written is not vague. In fact, I thought that was the point. The point is that the Court shouldn't rewrite the statute; that's for the Congress to do.",
  "What authority do I look to, to see that some employees are fiduciaries and others are not?",
  "If I look in the Restatement of Agency, and they have a section that applies to fiduciaries and non-fiduciaries, both of whom are employees?",
  "I would assume that any employee, even at the lowest level of the corporate structure, who has corporate property, a car or something, has a duty to protect that car for the employer.",
  "Is there a clearly established rule that in all of the circumstances of the case, we can find that there is coercion, time being one aspect of those circumstances?",
  "And so that is a clearly established rule, and then it's a question whether 2 and a half, 3 and a half, 4 and a half suffices. -",
  "But your -- your position is that if -- same facts, but it's 10 hours instead of 2 and a half, is that a closer case, at least? For --",
  "And does that show that – that the circumstances are coercive, so that even if there were a waiver it would be --",
  "You’re saying there’s a difference between a waiver and a failure to assert?",
  "So do you read -- yes. So do you read Miranda as saying that there cannot be questioning unless there is a waiver? Then we'll go on to -- or do you --",
  "Okay, you do not.",
  "So are you going to go on -- because this is right where you are. Are you going to go on to say that, in the Miranda context, the failure to assert can -- can suffice to allow the questioning to proceed?",
  "But why isn't that language that you quote a negative inference that there must be a waiver?",
  "So there’s a difference between waiving at the time of the interrogation and then waiving it at the time of trial? I don't understand that.",
  "But I just want to make sure where we are.",
  "You’re not -- you’re conceding, it seems to me, that there must be a waiver?",
  "I just don't understand -- why -- why can't --",
  "We have to guide the police.",
  "Why don't we tell the police, there must be a waiver before you can continue to interrogate?",
  "I don't know why you didn't answer Justice Stevens's questions by saying, Justice Stevens, I don't care about waiver. There was no -- there was no assertion of the right. But you’re not saying that. You are admitting there has to be a waiver.",
  "But there also assumes there has to be a waiver.",
  "What's your best authority for that proposition?",
  "Well, he -- he didn't say anything. You -- I think you could say that his conduct implied the very kind of statement that Justice Alito suggested in his hypothetical: I'll listen to you guys for a while.",
  "I thought, in order to test his knowledge of English, they asked him to read one or two paragraphs.",
  "I don't see how you square that with Moseley.",
  "Your argument would be the same if this was compressed to 45 minutes?",
  "Same result?",
  "30 minutes?",
  "I -- I have to say that -- page 475 and 476, particularly, of Miranda do talk in terms of a -- of a waiver. Did -- are there -- did the subsequent cases indicate an articulation of that view that’s closer to your position?",
  "Why should -- why should that be? Two cases. Two criminal defendants. One spends a lot of time trying to find the most competent lawyer he can, and he does. He finds a highly skilled lawyer, who makes one little mistake and it's negligence. The other doesn't care. He gets a lawyer that's really incompetent, and the lawyer is grossly negligent. Now, you would be penalizing the client who exercised the most diligence under your rule. I don't understand the -- the justice of that. It seems to me that the first client should be better off, not worse. Now, maybe this is for your friend on the other side to answer as well, but I'm not sure, even following Justice Alito's initial line of questioning, we can distinguish between gross and mere negligence, that -- that it's even fair that we do so.",
  "I didn't mean to interrupt his line of questioning, but it seems to be consistent with it.",
  "But what's the -- what's the point? What's the justice in doing that?",
  "Other than just limit the number of cases in which we are going to set aside convictions?",
  "I looked in the brief to see if there was reference to the merits, underlying merits of the case. Can you just tell me very quickly what the key arguments are, if we ever reach the merits?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I shouldn't probably take your time with that. I will look at the State record.",
  "The client -- this client was sort of the pesky client, but apparently knew a lot more about AEDPA than most people generally do. I mean, AEDPA's not exactly an ordinary term.",
  "And -- and suppose you have a client who is just bewildered. He doesn't know AEDPA; he doesn't know Federal court. Why should he be in any worse position than this client?",
  "It seems to me it would be the other way around. This fellow knew enough that, if he had really just done a little bit more, he would have -- well, he tried to file a petition, but he might have done a little bit more.",
  "But the uninformed client, the ignorant client, could never have approached this. I don't know why he shouldn't be more protected than your client, which goes back to Justice Alito's question. I'm not sure how we draw this line.",
  "And also, just in the course of your argument, how -- how often do these deadlines missed (a) in capital cases and (b) in AEDPA cases? Do you have any statistics on that, or can you tell us from your experience?",
  "I -- I -- I didn't hear. You say there has been discipline or there --",
  "If we or -- this would probably be the Congress -- assuming some rule maker had probably be the Congress, assuming some rulemaker had authority to do this, would it make sense to say that the State is going to be subject to equitable tolling on a rather broad standard -- we’re going to give equitable tolling often -- unless the State has attorney discipline procedures, so that this happens only once and then the attorney can no longer practice in the Federal courts?",
  "Obviously, what we’re looking for is some sort of a rule to keep the deadline, and if we’re going to accommodate your friend on the other side, to have -- to have some rule about exceptional -- exceptional cases.",
  "No, I understood the Chief Justice's question -- maybe I misunderstood it, but my understanding of the question as important is this: Under incorporation by reference, the States are bound by the rights in all -- with all of the refinements and sophistication with which we interpret them for the Federal Government. It's the same. You don't just apply the core of the right. You apply all of the right as it is elaborated by the cases. Is -- is that same consequence -- does that same consequence follow if we adopt the privileges and immunities interpretation that you are urging upon us?",
  "And it was also the Harlan view, although a separate opinion in the Griswold case and in Poe v. Ullman. Do you think that it best describes the approach that the Court has used over the years?",
  "I was going to ask Mr. Clement what test he thought the Court used. If you looked at all the cases, you think implicit in the concept of ordered liberty?",
  "But I thought its rationale was that because of its fundamental character, the right to bear arms must be understood as separate from the qualifying phrase of the militia clause, all people, most people in the United States. The public meaning of the Second Amendment was that there was an individual right to bear arms, and that's because it was fundamental. If it's not fundamental, then Heller is wrong, it seems to me.",
  "What is the due process liberty --",
  "But would self-defense be part of liberty under the Due -- substantive meaning of the Due Process Clause?",
  "And you’ve given -- you said there were two reasons. So you have given us both in your answer to Justice Alito's question?",
  "Without repeating that and just so I understand your position, how could some member of the Court write the -- this opinion to say that this right is not fundamental, but that Heller was correct?",
  "But there -- but there are provisions of the Constitution, of the Bill of Rights, that have been incorporated against the States, where the States have substantial latitude and ample authority to impose reasonable regulations, rights respecting -- rights respecting property, the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. We look to see what the political process does. We look to see -- why can't we do the same thing with firearms?",
  "Do you think there is existing authority with reference to other provisions of the Bill of Rights that would allow us to incorporate just the core of Heller with respect to the States? Just the core of the Second Amendment with respect to the States, along the lines to this question Justice Stevens was asking earlier?",
  "And if so, what's -- what case do we look to for that proposition?",
  "Counsel, at the -- at the very outset of your argument, Justice Sotomayor asked the question which, as I understood it, essentially said what are examples of privileges and immunities that are being denied by the States that -- which denial would be remedied by following your proposal to overrule the Slaughter-House case? And let's leave the Second Amendment out. Let's assume the Second Amendment is a wash; it's either going to be incorporated or not going to be incorporated the same -- to the same extent under either the Privileges or Immunities Clause or the Due Process Clause. Leaving the Due Process -- the Second Amendment out of it, what privileges and immunities are now being denied citizens of -- of the United States?",
  "What are examples of those? The jury trial in civil cases?",
  "And grand jury. What else?",
  "Well, I'm -- we’re using up your time. But --",
  "-- do you want me to leave the bench thinking grand jury indictment and civil trial and jury case -- that's it. There's no other -- what are these other unenumerated rights?",
  "But it seems to me that, quite apart from the Westfall Act, there’s a more -- more basic answer that you would make to Justice Sotomayor's question. And that is, because the nature of immunity clauses are to make the employees secure against unforeseen causes of action as well as foreseen. I think that's a principled answer you could make. If I made that answer, do you have authority I could cite for that proposition?",
  "Okay.",
  "If we limit it, then Congress would have to reenact a statute every time there was some new cause of action?",
  "Well, that would bar a later Bivens claim. I assume you could bring a Bivens action first, and the bar provision would not apply, assuming you can bring the Bivens claim.",
  "Yes.",
  "And Carlson is your best authority for that? Even though I don't think Carlson is directly on point, Carlson is still your best authority?",
  "In a different context, but that -- but Carlson is still your best authority for that proposition?",
  "Counsel, I -- I want to just say that I have one problem with the case at the outset. And I don't mean to interrupt the organization of your argument. You might want to address it later. And it’s a question that goes to the other counsel, too. I'm having difficulty seeing how the issues as presented in the brief really resolve very much. Let's assume -- I know this is not your position. Let's assume the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act grants immunity to the state for this conduct and for a then-serving official who is its agent and for a former agent. Let's assume there is -- there is immunity. Why isn't it just repealed, overridden, by the later enactment of the Torture Victims Protection Act? I just don't see the issue structured that way in the briefs, and I'm puzzled by it. But I say that at the outset, and I really didn't mean to interrupt your -- your good introduction.",
  "What -- what authority do you have for that?",
  "What case authority do you have for that proposition?",
  "It's like a -- it's like a clear statement rule?",
  "Of course, that -- again, the Torture Victim Protection Act says “an individual who, under actual or apparent authority, or under color of law of any foreign nation, subjects an individual to torture.” Why isn't that a clear statement? And then I’ll get off this hobby horse, and you can get back to talking about the FSIA.",
  "Well, and then I -- I had thought -- again, correct me if I am wrong -- that, ultimately, in this case, whether or not within the issues here present -- ultimately, you have two arguments. One is that it's just implicit, inherent, necessary for the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that agents be covered; otherwise it won't work. The other -- I take it you have a backup position that even if that's wrong, that under generally accepted principles of international law, that agents still have immunity. Or am I wrong about that?",
  "I had thought when I read the House of Lords opinion in Jones and they talked about the statute, that they took your position, this first position, that the Act just won't work unless there’s an agent -- immunity for the agent. But I take it that even if we reject that position, you still have a fallback position in the -- in the -- in further proceedings on remand?",
  "And your red light has gone off. I could just add -- make an addition to that same question. I would agree that the State Department might have some expertise in telling us what the facts were: Who was the government, who was -- who was in office at the time, what the policies were. But it's just not clear to me what body of principles the State Department looks to, to make this determination that, as Justice Scalia said, Smith is immune and Jones isn't.",
  "But I take it your answer to Justice Scalia with reference to the indictment against the Secretary of Defense, is that that's not covered by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. And if a state interprets international law to allow the suit, then it goes forward.",
  "But that just goes back to the Tate letter era, where we wait to get an e-mail from the State Department to tell us what to do.",
  "I thought that was the whole purpose of the Federal -- of Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.",
  "But in a sense that cuts against you. As I was -- when I was reading your opening brief, it seemed to me the tone was, well, if you accept the Respondent's position Congress did nothing at all. Well, they did do something very important. They had a formula for disposable income. The question is, does that formula apply to projected? Can that formula be modified altered or projected for projected? So it's not as if Congress did nothing or it's not as if the amendment accomplishes nothing even under the Respondent's view. It accomplished something very important.",
  "What -- where can you move it? I don't really -- this is the same line of inquiry as Justice Ginsburg. What's the -- what has to be the ending date if you move the -- you can't move it any -­ much beyond the date of what, the hearing?",
  "Without the word \"projected\"?",
  "Without the word \"projected\"?",
  "Well, I suppose in discrimination cases, if there is a discrimination men versus women one way to resolve it would be to have either -- either rule apply to both sides.",
  "And you reach that conclusion under the comity principles of Fair Assessment?",
  "Revenue depleting.",
  "I am curious to know why neither opinion in Hibbs addressed the comity principle and I would like your view on that. I know what you are thinking. Your answer is: Well, you tell me, -­",
  "-- but, why wasn't that addressed in your view?",
  "If -- just one more. If the remedy is likely to be we will leave it up to the legislature -- you had -- you had two or three different optional remedies -- would we say that that is an adequate State remedy?",
  "Contempt of the legislature? Contempt did you say?",
  "Well, just on this same point before Justice Breyer I think moves to another point. The statute does use the word \"quorum\" twice and, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, except that two members -- in its last phrase it uses the word \"quorum\" twice: \"Except that two members shall constitute a quorum.\" It doesn't say two members may act.",
  "It says shall constitute a quorum.\"",
  "But that brings you back to Justice Breyer's hypothetical. There's five members on the board. Clearly they can delegate under the statute. Now there are only four members. Something happens to the fifth. Under your theory, the entity that originally delegated no longer exists and therefore the group, the entity that received the delegation of powers, must cease, must cease to act.",
  "If the quorum of three that authorized two to act disappears and that means the principal is no longer there, so the agent can't exercise the authority, why isn't it the same when five become four?",
  "Well, I don't know how you could write the sentence without the \"ed\" unless you want to say -- to make your point, if the statute had been written the other way, to any group continuously being designated.",
  "Suppose -- suppose our first inquiry were agency law, and we concluded that under agency law when the principal ceases to exist the agent may no longer function. Let's assume we conclude that under agency law. Could you then cite us a case or a rationale for saying that agency law should not apply to a government agency, to a problem of this type, and if so, what is your authority?",
  "But that is like the de facto officer doctrine. It could be that, if the Petitioner prevails here, the de facto officer doctrine would leave in place everything that has been done.",
  "But it seems to me that's quite a different -- different point.",
  "What -- what authority does an ALJ purport and in fact exercise? He's not acting or she's not acting for the board?",
  "Under the Petitioner's theory, if there is no quorum would those appointments then be invalidated, too?",
  "I have one question. I know that it’s -- your white light is on. Can I assume that whether we rule for Petitioners or Respondents in this case, the shipping world, the cargo world, will immediately adjust to our decision? It's not going to be a problem. There are insurers, there are freight forwarders, there are form contracts. People will know exactly what to do. They will adjust in 1 week to what we do. Am I right about that? Or can you say that if we adopt the Respondents’ position, it will be disruptive to the shipping trade and so forth?",
  "Well, how -- how does the Chief Justice's hypothetical work with the language of the statute? They -- it just goes to Los Angeles and it -- there’s a railroad track right by -- by the wharf, and it's the Union Pacific Railroad.",
  "Well, I -- I'm not sure. And getting back to Justice Alito's point, if -- if we say that the conviction is separate from the sentence, he can't challenge the conviction without being -­ meeting the successive bar, what about the finding of death eligibility? Why -- why can't that be separated from the sentence just like the earlier conviction?",
  "That followed from the first conviction.",
  "Well, I -- I -- I want you to get -- on the assessment of the evidence, I just want to ask -- I probably should know this, and you can get back to Justice Alito's question as well. Under Alabama procedure, at the sentencing hearing both in the first trial and the second, is there evidence about the aggravating and mitigating, or do you just look at the evidence that was proven in the guilt phase?",
  "Is there new witnesses, et cetera?",
  "But then it's -­",
  "-- not clear to me why death eligibility wasn't a part of the first conviction.",
  "Well, how -- how does the State's definition at page 17 of the red brief not comport with the whole idea of second or successive?",
  "No, but that's not -­ that's not something that could have been or was raised.",
  "Well, if it's the second -- I see your light's on. If it's the second time around, then it's just barred by law of the case.",
  "I think you are right, but McCleskey was pre-AEDPA.",
  "What was the answer under AEDPA to Justice Scalia's problem?",
  "But we just found that to be successive under the words of the statute?",
  "What -- what case do I read that supports that proposition?",
  "I -- I had thought that law of the case issue preclusion would apply.",
  "Well, the old -- the former rule of course, was that you could bring writ after writ after writ.",
  "Was it -- was McCleskey the first time that that -- that that was foreclosed? No.",
  "That -- that just -- that just incorporated a whole body of law which was very much like issue preclusion, was it not?",
  "I'm not sure that it happens in advance of considerable discovery. I -- I -- I would agree that the judge can confine discovery to forum non conveniens or for personal jurisdiction, but in -- in these cases one of the things we are really talking about is the burden of discovery. That's the cost of litigation. You know that.",
  "Is the government going to tell us that its test, which differs from the foreign exchange test, is based on considerations like those suggested in Justice Breyer's Brooklyn Bridge hypothetical?",
  "Would the limitations on discovery give you substantial protection were we to adopt the government's test or say the foreign exchange test with the subset exceptions for the -- that takes account of the government's test?",
  "Is it a consideration that this discovery alone would be an offense to foreign -­",
  "Suppose there were litigation with substantial allegations of wire fraud violations as predicate for RICO violations, and the case begins to proceed, and then there is a second cause of action under the securities law. Would -- would the fact that there is going to be discovery and substantial litigation in the -- in the United States courts be a factor in retaining the -- the securities violation in this suit? Or would the test be just the same in your view?",
  "Well, then you give no weight to the fact that it was on the Australian exchange?",
  "Can you tell me, along the line of -- the same line of questioning, I understand about AEDPA. I understand about deference, the jurisdictions. Just tell me a little bit about how this often works in State courts and in Federal courts? Would it be good practice, in your view -­ and that may not control your case, but would it be good practice for the -- a judge to have had exactly this colloquy and then say: The jurors are dismissed while I talk with counsel. And you say: Counsel, in light of this response, I am prepared to declare a mistrial. Do you have any comment? Is that good practice?",
  "I'm asking -- I'm asking if it's good practice as a general practice.",
  "Because -- because that will bear, ultimately, on a constitutional issue. I understand deference. I understand that all intendments are in favor of what the State Supreme Court found. I'm just -- I want you to tell me how it works out there in the real world?",
  "That independent obligation is not reinforced by getting counsel's views just as a matter of good practice?",
  "Well, there was a ruling by the court: I hereby declare a mistrial. I suppose you could have an objection, but it would be very -- the jury was present when the judge said: I hereby declare the mistrial.",
  "So it would be rather awkward for the counsel at that is point.",
  "Acrimony, I recognize we have talked about it in Arizona, but it -- I mean, it could be that the jurors had all agreed on the murder count and they were just quarrelling over whether they should add the firearms count, or the other way around.",
  "In which case they would be much closer than -- than your comment about acrimony might indicate.",
  "And in that case, one of the specific factors was that he consulted with -- the judge consulted with counsel before making the ruling?",
  "In -- in Arizona.",
  "What do you do with -­ if -- it's a very short sentence? A year and a day, in your view, is a year and a day less 54.",
  "But 360 days, what do you do with that?",
  "Yes. If -- suppose it's for -- just -- the whole sentence is 360 days.",
  "No, 360. In other words, short of a year.",
  "So the person that gets a year and a day serves less than the person that gets less than a year?",
  "And each of those 4 years included 54 days of credit?",
  "Well, they are just not vested until the year has -- the full year has passed.",
  "Well, I -- I use it just in the calculating sense.",
  "We -- if we disagree with that, if we disagree that the BOP has authority in this area, then -- as Justice Ginsburg's question, I think, suggests -- does not the Rule of Lenity apply?",
  "Well, how do you explain the Granderson case?",
  "The Granderson case.",
  "I had thought that in that case, Justice Ginsburg, for this Court, established the proposition that the Rule of Lenity is applicable. I know it wasn't cited in the Petitioner's brief, either. That was a parole revocation case. But in -- in any event, the -- shouldn't the Rule of Lenity apply? If the Rule of Lenity is thought of as a notice requirement insofar as giving you warning to what conduct is punishable, that's one thing, but doesn't the Rule of Lenity mean more than that? It's a check against the power of the State, so that you simply mitigate the -- the power of the State in favor of the individual. In a case like this, apply the Rule of Lenity.",
  "Well, the Granderson case is cited in the brief for the National Association Of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and as I read it, it applies to this area and it seems to me that it ought to. I mean, you tell us this is not a criminal statute. I -- I certainly think it has -- it has all the impact and force of the State detaining a person for a criminal act.",
  "But the cumulated -­",
  "But what -- what we were -- what we were saying, is this is 36,000 years of prisoner time, I mean -- 36,000, that is older than Marbury versus Madison.",
  "Well, why is that? It's the same hypothetical of the Chief Justice. I'm not interrupting your -- your discussion with him. Suppose, pursuant to a permissible regulation, the BOP says: Just file paperwork with us, and if -- and if you show that you were under a crack cocaine sentence, you’re going to be reduced by X number of months, period. Just file it. What --",
  "Is there a problem with that? would be. And, again, I don't mean to be dodging the question. The problem is section 3582(c). Congress clearly indicated that it wanted these types of reductions to be treated differently than those under 3624(b), which are delegated to the Bureau of Prisons. And those types of reductions --",
  "No, but the -- the hypothetical is Congress doesn't do this. The",
  "What’s wrong with that?",
  "Okay. Then the Chief Justice's hypothetical, at least for me, meant: What -- why should there be a difference?",
  "I’ll make this brief because your -- your rebuttal light is on. Your answer made sense when we talk about term as opposed to sentence, if you just look at (c). But (b) says, “Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to imprisonment can be modified … a judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment.” Does (b) not apply to (c)?",
  "When the judge considers the adjustment motion under the -- under the section, does he consider how the prisoner has behaved in prison; i.e., if he has behaved very badly, he doesn't give the -- the reduction?",
  "But he -- but he can’t go below. The -- the Petitioner makes the argument metaphysically that there’s just a new sentence. In your view, is that refuted by the language of (c)(2) because they talk about in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and then they say the term can be reduced, and it doesn't use the words \"a new sentence shall be imposed\"? I assume that’s your argument.",
  "So, it's a one-way ratchet?",
  "The Petitioner's brief opens with a statement about his rehabilitation. We don't know if that has been contested. You don't respond to it. But let's assume that's all true. He established schools, and he helped young people and so forth. Does the Justice Department ever make recommendations that prisoners like this have their sentence commuted?",
  "And isn't the population of prisoners in the Federal prisons about 185,000 now?",
  "I think it is. And were there -- how many commutations last year? None. How many commutations the year before? Five. Does this show that something is not working in the system? 185,000 prisoners? I think that’s the number.",
  "In criminal cases, because I -- I -- correct me if I am wrong, but my -- my recollection is that orders to show cause for contempt in the civil -- on the civil side occur frequently, and that allows a jail sentence in California I think of 5 days -- and this is civil, because it's coercive. Now, you are talking about something different, I take it?",
  "Have -- have we had cases that said that Federal separation of powers principles are binding on territorial governments, for instance?",
  "And what is your position and can you advise us -- I know it's not in your case -­ if there is a plea bargain in the Southern District of New York, does it -- does bind, do you think, the prosecutor in the Eastern District? What is your view of that proposition? I know it's not part of this case.",
  "But can we get to the Brady? That was one of the questions I had, too. Let's say we have the -- we'll call it a private person as prosecuting.",
  "Does that person have a -­ a right to look at all the government files to see if there is any exonerating evidence?",
  "I mean, how does it work? That's what we want to know.",
  "But how does it work? Does -- does the -- does the person who is bringing this prosecution have the right to go in and -- and look at the -- all -- all of the files that the police have -­",
  "-- and that the prosecutor has? That's the only way Brady would work.",
  "Criminal -- criminal contempt prosecution or civil contempt prosecution?",
  "Well, there can be order to show cause, but you are saying that every state allows a private person to have a criminal prosecution for criminal contempt?",
  "Well, a -- a motion is different.",
  "Then the courts decide -­ then the court decides based on the position of the defendant, of the person who is charged with contempt -­",
  "-- whether or not to proceed. And the court certainly can appoint a prosecutor, and does in many states.",
  "Well, if there were a finding of innocent, or not guilty, by this prosecutor, could the official prosecutor then prosecute again, or would there be double jeopardy? If you are saying they are somehow separate, does the double jeopardy clause apply?",
  "Well, but that was the same authority.",
  "So you don't think this is a Bartkiss-like case, like Bartkiss v. Illinois?",
  "That a State prosecution doesn't bar a later Federal prosecution.",
  "But -- but does --",
  "But does it make the -- the second unlawful entry now lawful?",
  "I thought -- I thought it's a separate offense to enter, to reenter improperly, and -- and that stays no matter, isn't that correct, regardless of the correctness of the prior removal order?",
  "Or am I wrong?",
  "But we have five States, isn't it, that have no recidivist provisions?",
  "Is the thrust of your argument or the logical consequence of your argument, if you have one of those States with no recidivist provisions and you have ten separate possession convictions, they're still not a recidivist under the Federal rules?",
  "No, no. In my hypothetical, what would happen if -- if there was a deportation proceeding?",
  "Because there is no recidivist finding.",
  "Can you tell me what --",
  "What would happen if there -- forget the State. There are two Federal offenses. The first Federal offense is drug possession; the second Federal offense, drug possession, but the prosecutor is not quite sure that he has a strong case or she has a strong case for recidivism because of the first conviction. So the -- on the second go-around, the conviction is without the added finding of recidivism. What does the INA do with that case?",
  "What -- what would --",
  "If -- if I could just finish on this one -- this one. In this hypothetical that we’re discussing, the -- the two Federal offenses but no finding of recidivism, does the INA have the authority to question the first conviction because it was uncounseled or in effect collaterally question the first conviction?",
  "No, what -- our hypothetical here is Federal.",
  "Right.",
  "What -- what case do I read to establish that?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, but Almendarez-Torres was a different offense; was it not? I mean this is -- this is a drug offender who -- it's not like a burglar who stops burglary to take up a new trade. This is -- this is a drug offender who continues to repeat under the drug offense laws, and I thought the position was that this shows a particular propensity, a particular immoral attitude that’s not being corrected. And so that the recidivism makes him a worse person.",
  "We usually think of recidivism when we talk about statistics as being repeated for any crime. This is a recidivism of a special kind. It's repeating the same -- the same thing. Is that essential to your argument? I know it's essential to the -- to the Federal statute.",
  "Well, on that point, do we take it as the law of the case or as a given that it was illegal for I think Arch to turn over the transcripts to the police department? What do we do with that part of the case?",
  "On remand -- has there been a final judgment issued as to Arch, or is that just being held --",
  "So you have two arguments: One, that it's -- there’s no reasonable expectation of privacy; even if there were, that this was a reasonable search.",
  "Is that something like the plain view argument? In search and -- search and --",
  "Well, I'm serious. In other words, there is, under your view --",
  "-- legitimate grounds to look at the messages, and then once they see it, they don't have to ignore it.",
  "Let me ask you this: Suppose the department asks for opinion of legal counsel whether or not transmittal of the transcripts by Arch to the department was a violation of the Act, and the counsel said: This was a violation of the Act; they had no right to send them to you. Would the department then still have had a right to look at the transcripts?",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "No, but -- no, my hypothetical is that the -- that there is a legal counsel's opinion that this was in violation of the Act, and let's say the district court said it is in violation of the Act. Let's say we say it’s in violation of the Act. Is that the end of case? The department cannot look at the transcripts?",
  "Well, California v. Greenwood was a question of -- of a Fourth Amendment standard that had to be nationwide. So you say it's the same -- same thing here?",
  "Well, but Greenwood was in the -- in the context of the exclusionary rule in criminal proceedings. I certainly think that States -- at least we could make the reasonable argument that States can have different policies with respect to their employees, that have to be respected.",
  "I certainly -- criminal defense attorneys challenging probable cause would want to look at these. They would want to see if there is exonerating evidence, under the rule that all exonerating evidence has to be submitted. It would seem to me that it's quite likely, as Justice Stevens' question indicates, that there is going to -- that these are going to be discoverable.",
  "But you’re not -- you’re not a police officer who is making arrests. I mean, this -- this is part and parcel of determining probable cause and mitigating evidence.",
  "And he's talking with a girlfriend, and he has a voice mail saying that your call is very important to us; we’ll get back to you?",
  "Now, these are fundamental arguments, and I don't want to spend too much time on factual matters because that's frustrating to both the Court and the counsel. But we do have the problem of the stipulation. The stipulation makes it clear that Democrats and Republicans can both get into the other one's club. That's the Stipulations 17 and 18 at 220 of the Joint Appendix. You want to get away from the stipulation by what, according to your reply brief, Hastings said in its answer, but the stipulation supersedes the answer. So if both counsel could just address for a moment: What is the case that we have here? You have different views on what case is before us.",
  "You can do that, but you -- it's a much different case if Hastings treats the CLS differently than it treats the Democratic and Republican Clubs. That’s a much different -- frankly, it's a much easier case for you. But it's -- it's frustrating for us not to know what kind of case we have in front of us.",
  "Of course, that was not a religion case. Your argument at its most fundamental level is that religious organizations are different because religion is all about belief. But at that point don't we also have a tradition of separation? That's the whole reason why church and state for many purposes are kept separate, so that States are not implicated with religious beliefs. And it -- it -- it seems to me we have to consider that when we are considering your argument. Now, you can cite Rosenberger, but -- but I think this is different from that.",
  "I had thought that an important part of the case, of your case, is that belief is inherent to the idea of religious expression and must be protected. But if the protection causes problems within the school for other policies, then doesn't the separation policy come into play? That's -- that's what I'm asking.",
  "But that's different from Cantwell. Cantwell is where the Jehovah's Witness plays the record on the -- on the street. And -- and --",
  "No. No. And Cantwell said that belief is central to -- to religions and that people would disagree. But that's precisely why Hastings might argue to us that -- that this is inconsistent with their idea of what this forum is. And if -- will you just address that, please?",
  "Well, there are very few universities. But why doesn't this just all work out? If the Christian Legal Society has these beliefs, I am not so sure why people that don't agree with them want to belong to them. What -- doesn't this all just work out?",
  "And doesn't it work out that the Democrats -- they don't want to go in the Republican club and run for officership anyway.",
  "So why -- what’s -- what interest does this -- does the school have in this policing mechanism that it's imposing?",
  "It's also never happened from, what I can tell, that someone who disagrees with this group has applied for membership.",
  "I mean, that's -- that's what so puzzling about the -- the case.",
  "The predecessor group --",
  "-- and obviously uncomfortable with their position, so he or she left.",
  "That's the way it works.",
  "And what if we think that the policy has not been evenhandedly applied? Can't we decide the case on that basis, and then we could just assume arguendo Justice -- the answer to Justice Stevens' question.",
  "Let me just say, suppose it were shown that it were not applied evenhandedly, you’d have no problem with our saying that it’s then unconstitutional.",
  "Well, you’re not really -- you’re not really answering Justice Alito's question. He says he understands that, as I understand the question. We understand that argument. But it doesn't address the fact that the net result of your argument is (a) unfair to the victim and (b) inconsistent with the whole design and thrust of the Victims Act.",
  "And you, it seems to me, have to say: So be it; the technical rule prevails. That's too bad. I mean, that's your argument, it seems to me.",
  "Well, I just want to make clear where we are. Justice Breyer said, can the defendant appeal? You said yes. Suppose he said, must the defendant appeal?",
  "Must?",
  "Even though -- even though he says the restitution shall be held in abeyance pending receipt of information?",
  "You attach no significance to the fact that in this case the judge said: I shall order restitution? It's the same as if he said nothing at all about restitution, so far as you are concerned?",
  "I suppose that an answer to the Chief Justice's concern about the 1-week sentence and -- and he's not concerned -- is that all criminal defendants know that an adjudication of guilt is preclusive of later issues with -- with respect to civil -- civil liability, and they take their chances. But that -- that points up a difference between this case and Montalvo-Murillo. In this case, finality is central to the system, and that wasn't -- that's not really -- wasn't really true in Montalvo.",
  "Let me -- I’ve been thinking about the Chief Justice's question where the two people are pushed and you don't know which person -- or two people fired the shotgun, and there’s only one pellet, and you don't know which gun the pellet came from. In that case, I think we could stipulate that even by reasonable inquiry, you wouldn't know. In your case, I think the -- and I think the difference in the case is that \"reasonable inquiry\" means you should have known. So now we have a rule that excuses something you should have known but doesn't excuse something you -- you couldn't have known, which seems odd. And because it's odd, therefore, maybe that's why it only applies to clerical errors.",
  "Did your amended complaint contain any new and material allegations other than the name correction?",
  "When it's below them, you mean it owns all the shares in its -- in its subsidiary company?",
  "I have one -- one question about the face of the ticket, the one with the picture on it. Is it Costa Cruise or Costa Crociere that got this big award for “B.E.S.T. 4”?",
  "Pardon me.",
  "If I am right, is that a mistake?",
  "How many -- if you have a 1,000-page ticket, how many pages do you have to read?",
  "But this is the first one.",
  "The one I pointed out to you with the mistake, that’s the first one.",
  "Well, this district court kept jurisdiction over the action. He more or less waited to see how the story came out before he wrote the plot. Suppose the district court said: All you came to me for was an order for remand. I give you the order for remand. Case ended. At that point, he doesn't know how it's going to come out. At that point, can he -- can the district court award attorney's fees?",
  "So that even if, when it goes back to Reliance, Reliance finds that it’s patently frivolous, close to a fraud, she -- the employee still gets the fee?",
  "Well, I -- I can see now why the red brief has a very substantial appendix with statutes. Now, you say, oh, this is unique. Well, then we may have many, many different kinds of statutes. This does not provide for -- this is not a prevailing party statute.",
  "But just in going through the list of the statutes, there are many statutes that are not prevailing party statutes. And it seems to me that -- you say it's unique. Well, it's unique in the sense it's in ERISA, but I -- I think it's very close to many -- many of the statutes with the language there in the red brief's appendix.",
  "Well, under your -- under your rule would it be error for the district court to terminate its jurisdiction? It must keep jurisdiction to see how the play comes out in the end?",
  "Well, but it certainly has to in order to adopt the ameliorating factors that you -- that you use in order to justify this rule. And I -- I -- it's not clear to me that courts usually retain jurisdiction in these cases.",
  "The government in response to questions about the significance and the consequences of its position said, oh, this is a unique statute. ERISA -- it's is an ERISA statute. Do you agree that if -- if we rule for you, it would be applicable primarily to ERISA and it wouldn't have an effect on these other statutes?",
  "Why is it post-formation? Arguably, the -- one of the parties has such a strong hand that it forces the other party just to decide. It's almost like -- duress would certainly be for the court, would it not, if it’s a formation issue like Justice Ginsburg indicated?",
  "Well, I'm not sure what procedural unconscionability, but this is -- as Justice Ginsburg indicates, it's not clear to me why this isn't a formation issue.",
  "Well, do you understand -- and we can ask the Respondent. But, as you understand Jackson's case, is he saying that part of the clause, part of the arbitration clause, is unconscionable, that the whole clause is unconscionable or that the whole contract is unconscionable?",
  "Because the complaint is a bare-bones complaint, and I don't know if there’s anything in the pleadings that reflects what his answer to that question would be.",
  "After this --",
  "After this suit was filed and both parties are going up the steps to the court, could the attorneys and the parties stop and say let's arbitrate this issue of unconscionability and pick an arbitrator? Could they do that?",
  "No, then -- then the --",
  "Then the employee loses. He says: Oh, you have to have an open door; this was -- this was not properly before the arbitrator.",
  "Because, you see, if you say yes, that they can arbitrate this, then the question is why can't they do it when the contract's signed?",
  "Let's assume that the answer to my question is yes, they can put that to an arbitrator. If that's so, how can you prevail in this case if the agreement clearly comprehends submission of this issue to the arbitrator?",
  "I'm -- I'm asking, assume you do?",
  "But which is the stronger case for arbitration? Case one, you attack the arbitration clause only, part of the arbitration contract only, as being unconscionable. Case two, you attack the whole agreement as being unconscionable. Do those both stand on the same footing, or is one a stronger case for submission to the court than the other?",
  "I find that somewhat paradoxical, but I -- I agree that that -- that that's the law.",
  "So if you do go to the State court, suppose the State court says: I can't really decide this question about the one clause unless I determine the conscionability or the unconscionability of the entire contract, and I now proceed to do that. Do you have to wait and say: Stop, you can't do that?",
  "But suppose the State court judge says that he has to look at the whole contract. Do you say: Oh, I'm sorry to bother you; we have to go back to the arbitrator now?",
  "What's your -- no, it's a hypothetical case.",
  "What would your position be in the hypothetical case, representing your client?",
  "And what do you think the judge should decide as between those two possibilities?",
  "And is it your position that that gives you the hook, the entry point, for saying, well, now the district judge didn't just replicate in all respects the universe without the regulation; it had some specific injunctive relief, and it didn't go far enough? That’s --",
  "And in your view the correctness of that ruling has been preserved in the questions presented to this Court?",
  "But isn't one of the reasons that they litigated the injunction was that by its terms and because of its issuance the agency on remand could not have adopted some partial measures to allow controlled planting?",
  "But -- no, but isn't that -- isn't that the reason that the manufacturers, Monsanto, contested the injunction? They said -- because once the injunction is issued, as the government has told us today, they cannot issue some partial regulatory scheme with -- with safeguards.",
  "But that -- but that is substantial. It takes time, and the district court injunction that's now in effect prohibits that. And they have standing to challenge that.",
  "Or at least that's their argument.",
  "Yes.",
  "In deciding irreparable harm, what weight if any should be given to the proposition that there was an environmental impact regulation violation, as opposed to just a regular suit between, say, two farmers over a nuisance? What weight do we give to the fact that -- let's assume -- there’s a -- a violation of the rule requiring an environmental impact statement?",
  "That is not alone a sufficient harm to justify an injunction, is it?",
  "Well, let me -- let me ask you, could the opponents of a particular ballot measure organize a boycott for -- and picket businesses whose managers had supported that boycott?",
  "Had supported that initiative?",
  "Well, if that's so, then under Claiborne Hardware, which I -- I notice you didn't cite in your brief, but if -- if that's so, then it seems to me that the State's -- or that -- that the signers' interest in keeping their names private is somewhat diminished.",
  "It's a First Amendment activity.",
  "But --",
  "And so Justice Alito's question points out that this would be a very slim basis upon which to rest a holding in your favor. And just to go back to the line of questions of the first, the State of California has very complicated referendum and initiative matters. Don't you think it's relevant for the public to know that, say, a public employees union had paid solicitors to put those signatures on the ballot, or that the Chamber of Commerce or the National Association of Manufacturers had paid solicitors to put this on the ballot? Isn't that part of assessing the -- the reasons why this initiative was proposed? And isn't that vital to the voters -- to the voter in making an informed decision?",
  "Correct me, but the point is, isn't -- isn’t there an interest in knowing this information? Not -- not that it's paid.",
  "We'll leave that out. But -- but to know that -- that -- the persons that supported the amendment.",
  "Was that pursuant to the Public Records Act that we’re talking about --",
  "-- or was that part of the initiative and referendum structure before the Public Records Act was passed?",
  "So -- all right. So this -- the public record -- pardon me. The -- in California, we call it an initiative and referendum process -- existed and was in place before the Public Records Act added this additional feature of disclosure?",
  "So there was a judgment at one time by the State of Washington that it didn't -- that it didn't need the public records disclosure?",
  "What about a business boycott?",
  "What about a business boycott? Suppose that were a -- a likely outcome of disclosing the name?",
  "This case will likely be controlled by our First Amendment precedents, because that's the most fully developed. Did you look at the Petition Clause at all? In the early days of the republic, the petitions were the way in which you communicated with your legislator.",
  "And I tried to look it up. I have a recollection, but I'm not sure, that those petitions were sometimes put in the Congressional Record. But did you look at the history of the Petition Clause?",
  "But, of course, that can cut the other way, too, because then it's more like a vote. And there -- there is strong interest in keeping the -- the vote private.",
  "Do -- do we take this case on the assumption -- do you make the contention before us that the Secretary of State and those who assist it are not capable of determining whether the petition signatures are valid?",
  "I mean without public disclosure?",
  "Is that the general view of the courts? Is the answer that you just gave supported uniformly by the courts that have looked at this?",
  "Even -- in other words, even on this point, they are split?",
  "My question, incidentally, about courts was not with reference to the car expense. It was with reference to the hypothetical or to the issue proposed by one of my colleagues, that said, what if you don't -- Justice Kagan -- suppose you don't have the medical expense. And the answer -- and your -- and I wanted to know if your answer is supported uniformly by the courts that have looked at this, or if there is also a split on that point?",
  "And would your answer be the same if the allowance was set, the decree was made, and -- and the debtor then went out and bought the junker to put in his driveway just in order to get the 400-plus dollars a month, or would that be deemed an evasion of the law that could be addressed by the Bankruptcy Court?",
  "What we are talking about is a paradigm of someone -- we're comparing someone who has a $470-a-month car payment and he gets -- and he gets the deduction. Why is that, in light of the second sentence -- let's see, the third sentence of the statute, which says, \"Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the debtor shall not include any payments for debts.\" I mean, that would be the car company. And has -- has that point been litigated?",
  "No -- no, but it would -­",
  "It would eliminate the anomaly that -- one of the principal anomalies. There are many anomalies in each position. It would eliminate one of the principal asymmetries that seems to concern the counsel and the Court.",
  "That it?",
  "Well, I -- excuse me, Chief Justice.",
  "No, but the -- but the gravamen of Justice Scalia's question is: Why are you running away from 1a, which is what Respondent's counsel relied on? And if that were clearly relevant to this statute, it would seem to me to answer the question. Are you saying we -- we don't look at this because it's just simply an interpretation; it's not a regulation? What is -- what is -- in your view, what effect do we give to this language that Justice Scalia quoted? Nothing at all?",
  "Suppose we -- suppose we think the word \"applicable\" is ambiguous and difficult to construe. Do we then look at this language at 1a, or do you say it's irrelevant in all instance -- in all respects?",
  "And you -- you do not know if the man is running amok and threatening to shoot other people or if -- if he's drunk, if he's on a rampage, if it's a college campus, then it's -- it's -­ it's a sniper. You just don't know.",
  "But you can -­",
  "Well, I'm not -- I'm not sure that policemen should read Crawford before they perform their -- their peacekeeping duties. The -­ no -- no one questions the right of the police to -- to ask these questions and to use the word either \"happens\" or \"happening\" or \"happened.\" The question is whether the -- the answers are later admissible. Those are two different inquiries.",
  "And, of course, Crawford rejects reliability as a criteria.",
  "Did the police know that that was the case when they began the questioning? Did the police know that this man was not on a rampage, that he was not going to act in self-defense when they came after him?",
  "That he was not taking hostages?",
  "Let's say -­",
  "Let's say that we -- let's say that we agree with you that there was an emergency and the police were asking questions in order to mitigate the emergency. What would be the rationale for admitting this statement, then? Is it more reliable? Because if we say that, then we're undercutting Crawford, which says reliability is not the key. What is the reason for that? Is it because the police likely have less motive to manipulate the -­ the statements and to ask loaded questions? That in itself, it seems to me, is a reliable -- but what's the -- assuming we adopt your distinction, what's the rationale for the distinction?",
  "I didn't hear the end. In locating and?",
  "Apprehending.",
  "But I think you might have another -­",
  "Perhaps there is another answer that I would like to hear.",
  "I thought -- I thought the rationale for dying declaration admissions was that they are inherent reliable -- inherently reliable. You can certainly question that. But I thought that that was the rationale that the courts gave.",
  "On your death bed before you're going to meet the maker, you're not going to lie -- I think that was the test. So it was a reliability component, correct?",
  "Now, suppose that there is a universe of instances that we can identify as questions in order to alleviate and stop an emergency to prevent a crime from becoming aggravated and continuous. Let's suppose we can have a universe of those questions.",
  "Is -- is there an argument that responses made for that purpose are more reliable? Is that what -- is that what underlies the so-called emergency exception, do you think?",
  "So it -- so -- well -­ and, of course, Davis certainly does not rest on reliability -- or Crawford, rather, doesn't rest on reliability.",
  "But isn't that really the only way to explain the 911 exception?",
  "Isn't there a reliability component that underlies this whether we like it or not?",
  "But isn't -- isn't the reason we accept that is because it's reliable? It's an excited utterance. It's an account of an ongoing event. It's a contemporaneous observation. Therefore, it is reliable.",
  "But you -- you were the one that drew the line between a past event and an ongoing event. Suppose the sniper says, I've shot you now, and I'm going to shoot three other students, good-bye. That's a past event.",
  "Does the State make that payment under an Ex parte Young theory?",
  "If you sue the municipality, if they deny a marriage license, do you have to sue under 1983, or you can just sue alleging a Federal cause of action under -- because of a denial of a constitutional right?",
  "It would be like a Bivens action, I guess.",
  "The only way to sue a municipality for a constitutional violation is under 1983?",
  "But could you sue outside of 1983?",
  "Just to get -- the marriage license example -- just to get an order demanding issuance of the license.",
  "And that has to be a statute -- it has to be 1983?",
  "Can -- can Bivens actions be brought against municipalities?",
  "And can you -- can you cite me authority for that? And would -- do you think that the rationale for that is that since Congress has created an express cause of action, this impliedly pre-empts Bivens-type actions?",
  "And have -- have we said that in a case?",
  "Because it seems to me it would help you in this case, because you would say, well, if there's a real problem, the city -- the injured party can sue for an injunction. Perhaps the State was against the party first, and he can -- he can raise a constitutional defense or he can bring an action for an injunction, and it doesn't have to be under 1983. And it would seem to me that that would resolve it. And you then wouldn't have to pay attorneys' fees because there's no provision in the statute for it.",
  "No, I'm talking about under Federal law.",
  "But then you're not really hurt if -- or the system isn't really hurt by the rule that the city asks for. If it's so easy to establish a policy or custom requirement in cases where prospective relief is sought, then that's the answer. You can establish it. End of case. But you don't get it unless you establish the custom and practice.",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not sure I understand your submission. And it could be I'm just obtuse on this point. I interpret your remarks as saying that Monell does apply when there's an injunction. Do I misinterpret you?",
  "And you say, oh, it's so easy to do, it doesn't make any difference. Well, then, why are we here? Why isn't the city right?",
  "But the Ninth Circuit didn't think so.",
  "Did or did not? The Ninth Circuit did not?",
  "You agree with that statement, yes?",
  "And California itself or the Ninth Circuit had a case in which the county sheriff was directed by a judge to garnish certain wages or certain accounts; the sheriff had no choice, apparently, other than to follow the judge; and the Ninth Circuit held Monell is not required when you seek declaratory relief against future actions, and so attorneys' fees are given.",
  "It doesn't make any difference?",
  "And -- and if we did so, it would be because there is an underlying privacy right that's somewhat ill-defined or undefined?",
  "Well, does it -- does it help us in finding what this residual background right is and asking you: Why is it that you can't disclose it?",
  "Why can't you disseminate the information?",
  "Let's assume no statute.",
  "In other words, this is just testing whether there is some background constitutional right and how to define it, if we have to use that as a beginning premise.",
  "And what would be your position if the -- all this information were disclosed? Or that there was an attempt to disclose all the information, and they asked you for your advice - -",
  "-- on a constitutional basis?",
  "There are a number of statements in, I guess, the concurrence from the denial of en banc, explaining how JPL is fairly open, and it is close to the Pasadena courthouse. Pasadena residents and judges visit JPL often. Are there any statements of fact that you don't agree with that are not in the record, other than the matrix question? Leave that aside.",
  "Well, I -- I have to agree with the implication of Justice Ginsburg's remark, at least what I imply from it. Look at the private employment sphere. It seems to me that for a sensitive position, a bank who has people taking care of -- its employees taking care of other people's money, or the medical profession, that the employer could be sued and would be remiss if it did not ask this question. Do you know anything adverse about this person whom we're going to hire for a very sensitive position?",
  "This is done all the time, and we do it with -- a judge said below, with our law clerks.",
  "Question 42, do you have -- pardon me. Question 7 on Form 42, the -- the standard one -- do you have any adverse information about this person's employment, residence, or activities concerning, and so forth -- a violation of the law? Are you saying that private employers cannot ask that question?",
  "The prospective private employer?",
  "I -- I'm asking whether or not a private employer can ask third persons the question that's at Form 42 question 7. I thought your representation to me was that private employers cannot ask that question.",
  "But that was enjoined by the court below; was it not?",
  "All right.",
  "You said there are 22 people at JPL that are involved in the employment?",
  "On your instruction in - -",
  "-- at J.A. 28 second, would the instruction in your view have been proper, if the \"or\" had been replaced by an \"and.\" So: \"The situation involved a difficult choice and one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling.\"",
  "Has there been -- has there been any argument that you have waived your objection to the instructions?",
  "In other words, the pattern instruction was -- it was -- was rejected?",
  "But at the -- but at the outset it seemed to me -- and correct me if I'm wrong - - that you misstate the theory on which you seek to -- to have a reversal, and that this is a failure-to-train case. You didn't mention that.",
  "This is a failure-to-train case; is it not?",
  "Well, I think that's very important.",
  "And Miranda and proper supervision of affidavits in support of search warrants, and proper instructions that tell the police not to exceed the scope of the warrant. So this is -- our course is expanding.",
  "The -- the point of concern here is that we're going to have to go through a list, case by case, of everything there has to be training on.",
  "Well, of course, there's a - -",
  "There is a causation problem here. Even assuming training, if Deegan was going to destroy the evidence or remove it anyway, as he admitted later to Riehlmann, then the training or lack of training is just irrelevant.",
  "But I'm very concerned about that causation aspect.",
  "But that simply - -",
  "That simply points out that all of us in a pluralistic society have components to our identity; we're Republicans or Democrats, we're Christians or atheists, we're single or married, we're old or young. Any one of those things you could turn into a public issue and follow a particular person around, making that person the target of your comments, and, in your view, because this gives you maximum publicity, the more innocent, the more removed the person is, the greater the impact -- the Justice Alito hypothetical in -- in the grandmother case. So I -- I think -- I think your -- your public concern issue may -- may not be a limiting factor in cases where there is an outrageous conduct and where there should be a tort.",
  "But your position is that you can take this and you can follow any citizen around at any point? That -- that was the thrust of the questions from Justice Kagan.",
  "And -- and Justice Alito, and it seems to me that there -- you should help us in finding some line there.",
  "But in the -- but the hypotheticals point out that there can be an intentional infliction of emotional distress action for certain harassing conduct.",
  "But torts and crimes are committed with words all the time.",

  "You are assuming that the manufacturer knows something that the secretary doesn't?",
  "But -- but you assume that there is no clause or burden to the manufacturers who defend these suits to assess settlement offers. This is a -- this is a tremendous expense.",
  "It -- it may well be that the manufacturer has to settle a meritorious case; we all know that.",
  "Under your view, when does the manufacturer have to come forward and acknowledge that there is a defect in the design?",
  "But if the manufacturer is slow or remiss or negligent or willful in not giving the information to the Government, there is nothing the injured person can do. There is still complete preemption, under your view?",
  "The warning doesn't have to say, \"Warning: We could make something better if we wanted to.\"",
  "I'm still not clear -- I'm still not clear what answer you gave to Justice Ginsburg's question, saying: Why didn't Congress put this out in plain words: There should be no liability for design? Is the answer sloppy drafting? Are you reluctant to give that answer?",
  "Of course, it said -- it just said denied on -- on the merits. And it's still not clear to me how to -- pardon me. It just said \"denied\"?",
  "It's still not clear to me how to distinguish that, between denied, deny -- do we say, when there's a one-line order, as in this case, where it says simply \"deny,\" it is presumptively on the merits? I mean, how -- how do we interpret that?",
  "Then it is presumptively on the merits?",
  "They don't -- I mean, is that the way it's stated? Don't let me use my formulation. What's -- what's the State's formulation?",
  "But if I'm on the California court and I have two choices -- one is to say denied, no explanation, as this case; the other is to say denied on the merits -- if I have those two options, then why are they both on the merits?",
  "And what is the leading California authority on that proposition?",
  "That's the Robbins case. Okay.",
  "All right. Thank you.",
  "But isn't it the reality that sometimes the defense doesn't want to have an expert, because the expert may turn up findings that are adverse for him, and it's better for the defense counsel to just leave things murky and argue to the jury that the State didn't produce the evidence, either? That's a perfectly legitimate strategy, isn't it?",
  "Well, of course, Johnson had given so many inconsistent statements at the outset that he was a weak prosecution witness.",
  "It seems to me the defense could have pinned a great deal of hope on that.",
  "But if -- if the expert says that the pool of blood all belonged to -- I guess it's Johnson, I certainly think ethically that you could not argue otherwise to the jury?",
  "All right. So, that's a reason why defense counsel in this case and, the Chief Justice puts, in many cases prefers not to have experts, just so they can punch holes in the State's case. That's a -- that's a legitimate strategy. And this counsel was very -- an adept cross-examiner. There's no doubt about that.",
  "It's a little hard when we take away the finding that the confession was admissible. We have to extract that.",
  "I'm not quite sure what to do with the State court's case, assuming we have to presume, because of the posture of the case, that the confession was inadmissible.",
  "Well, I'd like to go back to the question -­",
  "I would like to go back to the question Justice Scalia filed just earlier.",
  "What -- what would you say about his point that it seems to me had substantial merit? It - it's really our determination -- our interpretation of what filing means might well depend on whether filing in -- or a complaint includes intracompany complaints, the grumbling of an employee and so forth; and I recognize this -- this argument comes up late. Has it been addressed in any of the other circuits?",
  "All have said that intracompany complaints -­",
  "In those circuits where they allow intercompany complaints that are oral, can you give me any sense of how often this leads to claim for retaliation? I mean, are they in the hundreds or.",
  "It's more of a question for the Petitioner's counsel than you, but are you aware of any cases in any other jurisdictions where there have been proceedings, actions for retaliation, based on complaints to third parties, like complaining to the press?",
  "It does seem odd, though -- and I don't want to jump into your argument too much, because you have got planned out what you want to tell us. It does seem odd that if your suit for DNA testing is not attack -- an attack on the sentence, that you asked for a stay. I mean, if it's not an attack on the sentence, why shouldn't that factor into our decision not to grant a stay or to grant a stay? It's -- it's an irony in your position.",
  "Well, we don't grant a stay in order to decide a question. We grant a stay because there's a likelihood of success on the merits. And that goes to the sentence. And now you're telling us that your attack doesn't go on the sentence. I don't see why we don't just lift the stay, under your own view of the case.",
  "If that's all it means, we shouldn't have granted a stay.",
  "Except that at page 18 of the yellow brief, where you did have time to explain your doctrine, you say a Federal constitutional issue arose only because the Court of Criminal Appeals' decision regarding the State law issue turned out to be so arbitrary and unreasonable as to denying Mr. Skinner's Federal due process rights. Correct me if I am wrong, but I think -­",

  "But that's Rooker.",
  "Filed in the -- in the court of conviction?",
  "Well -- well, that doesn't quite give us the added formulation that some of the questions suggest we need, if we're going to adhere to Dotson and still rule for you. There has to be some slightly different qualification. I'm not quite sure what it is.",
  "I -- I was going to ask if you have a few moments to address the Rooker argument. What -- what is your response to the Petitioner's counsel's explanation of why there is no Rooker here?",
  "But -- if I can have just 1 minute. Then if you do not file an article -- in a State court at all and you just go to 1983, you're back under Heck, and you haven't given us a qualification that works under Heck.",
  "Well, of course there's always -- there are always facts. There are often disputed facts. But suppose the issue is whether or not this right -- and maybe there are two rights here -­ this right was clearly established. That's -- that's an issue of law.",
  "And doesn't that fall within the \"except\" clause that the Chief Justice was talking to you about, which you haven't had much time to fill out, I understand. But -- well, if you're going to say -- and it's really not whether the summary judgment is -- is appealed. That's a little bit -- it's whether or not the issues resolved by the summary judgment motion are appealable. I read into your response, or implied from your response, what the Chief Justice did, that maybe sometimes the summary judgment motion, say, on an issue of law is sufficient to preserve the issue.",
  "Except that it begins, 2(a), \"Although courts normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment motion after trial on the merits, the denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is an exception to this rule.\" And that's -­",
  "That's the opening. That sets the stage for what follows.",
  "Now, it may be that everybody, including the Sixth Circuit, misapprehended the rule because there are some cases that depend on an assessment of the record and some cases that don't, but that's not what the Sixth Circuit said.",
  "I suppose there are some cases in which the failure of the court to give a requested instruction preserves the issue, and perhaps 50(b) is not required there. Were there any instructions proffered and denied in this case that would have preserved the issue for appeal?",
  "One -- one way to make the formulation work is to say whether or not the issue depends on an assessment of the record.",
  "Well, but we've been through this. I think it was Justice Alito who gave the hypothetical -- suppose that everybody agrees on what happened; the question is whether or not the right's clearly established.",
  "That's a pure issue of law.",
  "I didn't hear your -- your last -- are adequately preserved when?",
  "So you're saying that if there's anything in the record of the trial that indicates that the judge ruled on the issue, there need not be a 50(b) motion?",

  "Whether or not you've stated a claim upon which relief can be granted?",
  "Isn't it well established that part of the jurisdiction of the equity court when it requires an accounting is to give damages for breach of the trustee's duty? That's Hornbook.",
  "No, I'm talking about historically in equity. No. Historically in equity the trustee who breaches the trustee's duty in the equity court is required to give damages.",
  "It's not common law, it's not common law, it's equity. It's old law, it's equity.",
  "What about this -­",
  "When you are in the CFC, don't you get -- you aren't you asking for compensation for losses and injuries from the commingling or the misappropriation of assets?",
  "But your brief makes the -- seems to make the point that that's all just interest on capital. It's not for lost capital. But even as you described it, it sounds to me that you get damages for loss of capital plus interest.",
  "My problem is that I read the CFC complaint as including both. I will take a look at it. And I intruded on Justice Breyer's question.",
  "But in your case -- now, let's assume the government prevails. You go to the CFC, and you prevail on everything. You get all the findings in your favor and so forth. There is some relief that you don't get. I take it, unless I am missing something, that you could then, after the CFC suit is finished, go to district court and say: Now we want this added protection, this added relief.",
  "And the statute wouldn't have run generally, because if you are seeking the injunction, it's only latches bars you, and you are not barred by latches because you couldn't have gone sooner.",
  "But the accounting doesn't come out of the trust corpus if there is misfeasance, the trustee has to pay the damages for that?",
  "The government is going to tell us that the standard for waiver with respect to the Federal Government is different from the standard with respect to the State. Do you -- I think that's what they are going to tell us. Do you agree with that?",
  "But it seems to me that the States are in need of special protection. With -­ with the Congress, if it's a Federal immunity, the Congress can always -- always change its law.",
  "That just can't happen with the State.",
  "It's the suggestion of the opposite that -- that I am trying -- I am trying to explore. You have your white light on.",
  "But we are talking about general principles of interpretation and the proposition that we are suggesting is that the State surely should be entitled to the same dignity, the same protection against suits as the Federal Government, and you suggest just the opposite.",
  "And it seems to me that's contrary to standard principles of the Federal -- of protecting the Federal balance.",
  "But it's -- but it's only because they accept the funds at all that the Spending -- that the Spending Clause is even operative.",
  "And I'm -- this one question may be covered, but can you give me any examples where States have turned down money under the Spending Clause, say we don't want it, the restrictions are too great? Does this happen all the time, or ever?",
  "Where States tell the Federal Government: No, thank you, we don't want the money.",
  "Under programs like this?",
  "I mean other States -­ they say, oh, the liabilities are just too great, we don't want it?",
  "You -- you have already addressed this but I think it's their -- the position of your friend on the other side of the case is that with the Spending Clause you have a contract. The State has some extra protection, and therefore we need not be quite so strict in -- in construing waivers -- waivers of immunity, because you have the contract. Can you comment on that argument? And -­ and you might want to say that the Spending Clause is potentially so sweeping that the State should have special protection and we should be particularly careful about the clear statement rule. Or do you think the clear statement rule applies with equal force whether it's a Spending Clause or a direct regulation under say, the Fourteenth Amendment?",
  "Let me just make one comment on that point. It seems to me all or at least the great majority of the questions today are designed to probe whether or not this statute is vague. And you say the beauty of the statute is that it utilizes the categories that have been used in the obscenity area and that -- that there's an obvious parallel there. The problem is, is that for generations there has been a societal consensus about sexual material. Sex and violence have both been around a long time, but there's a societal consensus about what's offensive for sexual material, and there are judicial discussions on it. Now, those judicial discussions are not precise. You could have had the same questions today with reference to an obscenity statute, and we have -- we have said that with reference to obscenity, there are certain -- that there are certain materials that are not protected. Those rules are not precise at the margins, and some would say not precise in a more significant degree as well. But you're asking us to go into an entirely new area where there are no consensus, no judicial opinions. And this is -- and this indicates to me the statute might be vague, and I just thought you'd like to know that -- that reaction.",
  "I can see your white light's on. But even if we get past what I think are difficult questions about vagueness and how to interpret this law, isn't there a less restrictive alternative with the -- a V-chip?",
  "Yes.",
  "So V-chips don't work.",
  "Why couldn't you make the same arguments with respect to the obscenity statutes?",
  "Why shouldn't violence be treated the same as obscenity?",
  "Well, the courts -­",
  "The courts struggled for many, many years and are to some extent still struggling with obscenity. They came up with basically what we might call the Miller standards. And -- and the State has said this gives us a category that we can work with, with reference to violence.",
  "You could make all those arguments with reference to obscenity.",
  "Well, that's a sweeping rule. I was going to ask a related hypothetical. Suppose the -- the officer who's in charge, charged with the decision to terminate or not to terminate, says: I'm going to have a hearing. You can both have counsel. And you have -- who is it -- suppose Buck -- suppose the two employees that were allegedly anti-military here testified, and they said there was no anti-military bias, and the person is then terminated. Later the employee has evidence that those two were lying. Could he bring an action then?",
  "That's sweeping. That's almost an insurer's liability insofar as the director of employment is concerned.",
  "He has to ensure -- he -­ that he has done everything he can. He has a hearing, and he has almost absolute liability.",
  "Well, why isn't this just governed by the standard principles of tort for concurrent actors? Actor A was not negligent; actor B was; they both contributed to the accident. And we look to the Restatement of Torts, which is whether or not the wrongful actor made a significant contribution. That's -- that's the end of it.",
  "But we're -- but we're talking about the test. And the test I gave you is quite different from the \"cat's paw\" test. And if you use the test something along the lines that I formulated -- I don't know if that's precisely what the Restatement says -­",
  "-- but to that general effect, the instruction given to the jury was really overprotective of your client, under the standard concurrent -- concurrent causation analysis.",
  "But you are saying that once the government gives the manufacturer a choice, then the jury -- the -- the tort system can second-guess it; and that is not consistent with a likely government intent to allow the manufacturers a choice based on the technical advances to that date.",
  "Well, suppose the government says you have a choice and the State of Iowa passes a law and says you don't have a choice. No frustration of the governmental purpose there?",
  "No, there's just -- just the statutes as I have given them to you. That there -­ is there preemption just on the face of the statute?",
  "Of course, your theory is, if I understand your case -- correct me if I am wrong -­ if GM had installed Type 2, they could have been sued on the theory that Type 1 was better and there would have been no preemption.",
  "But under the theory of your case, that suit could go forward.",
  "Well, then, if the regulation comes out July 1, you say there is a preemption until midnight July 1, but as of July 2 there could be a suit?",
  "I just want to make sure I heard your answer to the -- you said the answer is yes. In other words, you agree with Justice Kagan's criticism of those cases, and you said, yes, she's right; those cases were wrongly decided.",
  "But you would have said there would have been no standing in those cases.",
  "Does the record show the extent to which there are donations by people who do not have students?",
  "Does the -- does the record show the extent to which there are these additional donations that you just referred to?",
  "Suppose that an STO -­ this is a hypothetical case -- discriminated on the basis of race. No Hispanic or no white or no black can receive our money. And suppose there's no Federal statute on it, no State statute prohibiting this. Would there be a constitutional violation, a Federal constitutional violation?",
  "No, it's an STO.",
  "All right. There are no attributes of State action that would suffice to allow a discriminated person to bring suit, a person who has been discriminated against?",
  "No, the hypothetical is no Federal statute, no State statute. It's a pure -- it's a State action question, is what I'm asking.",
  "Well, don't you think a strong argument can be made that it can be attributed to the State. The State has all sorts of rules about what an STO has to be. The State provides the mechanism through -- through the credit for the funding.",
  "What about -- what about -- what about the answer to my question?",
  "You're saying the STO -­ you're saying STOs are sufficiently private so they can do this.",
  "I'll -- I'll give you credit, Mr. Bender. In your brief, you say if you're wrong on that point, that you're folding your tent and leaving. There's -- that there's no standing and that there's no -- no violation. But I must say, I have some difficulty that any money that the government doesn't take from me is still the government's money.",
  "Let me ask you. If -- if you reach a certain age, you can get a -- a card and go to certain restaurants, and they give you 10 percent credit. I think it would be rather offensive for the cashier to say, \"and be careful how you spend my money.\"",
  "But that's the whole theory of your case.",
  "Exactly, and that's what it does under my theory, because there has been no first sale.",
  "Well, in their brief, the brief for the National Library Association indicates at the bottom -- the American Library Association indicates at the bottom of page 38 that \"made\" might mean cause to exist, cause to appear, and so that it applies the first time that U.S. copyright law lawfully could apply; so that if you lawfully import it into the United States, it would then apply at that time.",
  "And it makes the exemption work, then, too.",
  "Well, in your example, if there is a lawful importation of the foreign-made good, then if you interpret \"made\" as causing to exist of appear or under these laws, as the library brief suggests, the first sale doctrine would operate.",
  "I'll -- I'll think it through, but it seems to me that it's not consistent with what I thought the theory of your brief was for you to tell the Chief Justice that this is -- the hypothetical was a new claim. Take -- take the ACLU hypothetical that you discuss in your reply brief. Is -- is that a new claim?",
  "Okay.",
  "But if it's a new claim, then if -- we don't look to (d) because it wasn't adjudicated on the merits.",
  "-- and so you go to (e).",
  "Well then, now it seems to me that you're saying that this is an (e) claim and that you'll just fight the battle on whether or not it could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence. You're -- and you're out of the (d)(1)/(d)(2) framework that you've been arguing up to this point, based on the Chief Justice's question and your response.",
  "Well, I thought you said you agreed that it was.",
  "Okay. So then this is an (e)(2) case.",
  "Then it's a procedural bar? Is that -­",
  "Then it's a procedural bar case?",
  "All right. And this goes back to Justice Scalia's question. The question which we granted -- question 1 is whether the Federal court may reject a State court adjudication of a petitioner's claim as unreasonable based on a factual predicate for the claim that petitioner could have presented in the State court but did not. And that describes what you're talking about in response to Justice Ginsburg. Now, the Petitioner, unaccountably, has told us a few minutes ago that this is a new claim, which I think changes the whole question. But it seems to me the claim is whether there's ineffective assistance of counsel by reason of the mitigation evidence. And in that case, we go back to Justice Scalia's opening question to you: Was it the court relied on different evidence, evidence that was not in the State hearing? And that's the question, whether or not they can do that, if this evidence could have been presented. And certainly it could have been presented.",
  "But it seems to me that all State -- most State statutes pertaining to contracts pertain to a class that is not entirely universal. Suppose the State had a statute referring to banks, contracts with banks. That doesn't apply to all contracts. It doesn't apply to railroads. But we know that it applies to a class that generally includes both arbitration and non-arbitration. And that's this case, because there can be class action rule with respect to litigation and class action rules with respect to arbitration. So you have to have some rule that recognizes that you don't have to have the entire universe of contracts.",
  "And I'm not quite sure what your test is. You have a few of them in your brief.",
  "Suppose that this doesn't have what's called a blowout clause. Suppose that that kind of clause was not in there. And the consumer opts out of the arbitration. Arbitration doesn't -- doesn't go well. Anyway, can the consumer then insist on the arbitration that the consumer bargained for, the individual arbitration that the consumer bargained for?",
  "So then the bank has to have -- liability exposure for two different proceedings?",
  "But you are saying then California can say it's unconscionable to allow the parties to agree that there will be just the single arbitration proceedings? I don't see how the third parties are necessarily protected. If you say that the consumer still has the election, that certainly isn't what they bargained for. Maybe I'm -- maybe that's just a quarrel with the content of the unconscionability standard.",
  "Rather than FAA, but I think it does bear on at least section 4 of the FAA.",
  "If you stick with the theory that the test is whether or not the law in question is inconsistent with the idea of arbitration -­ whose idea of arbitration? What about, suppose it's the bank's idea of arbitration, that we -- we want this settlement, say; we do not want that; that's the bank's idea of arbitration that the parties agreed on.",
  "But in light of our AFC case, it seems to me that what you are arguing is that the statute -- the effect of your argument is that the statute gives more protection in the case of non-property taxes than property taxes, and that's an -­ an odd reading of the statute, which is directed primarily to the -- to the property tax.",
  "But in this case -­ correct me if I'm wrong -- off-road users, agricultural users, and construction and timber companies -­",
  "-- have the same -- have the same tax structure as the railroads.",
  "So there is an objective reference, neutral, and it seems to me that that's just quite rational to put the railroads there and not in the category of road -- road users. Now, if -- unless you are arguing the discrimination has to have -- has to have a purposive component. That might give you a different case. I'm not sure you prevail on that, either.",
  "Suppose a -- suppose a tax were structured so that the same tax applied to railroads and -- and -- and motor transport, but because of the way the tax was assessed, the railroads paid far more per mile than -- than the -- than the road transport. Could the railroad then come in and say: Oh, we want to be like the farmers; we are off-road? I mean, I can see you making that argument -­",
  "-- in case -- in case number two, welcome back. That's going to be your argument.",
  "You present the case to us as if it's either/or: That we must either in disagreement with your position, to say that it doesn't apply to exemptions; or if it applies to exemptions, it must be remanded. Can we say that the exemptions are not covered by the act unless the railroad is a target of an -- an isolated target and it's clear that it's discriminatory? I mean, do we have to have your either/or position?",
  "Well, it may be because the universe of non-property taxes is -- so infinitely large that there's a much greater room for -- a much great danger of discrimination. We know all States have property taxes.",
  "Then you need to give us a test, and the test is whether or not the railroad is singled out as a target group for discrimination.",
  "Something like that -- for discrimination, something like that.",
  "What -- what authority do you have for the proposition that the clear statement rule applies to the exercise of the congressional power under the Commerce Clause? Is that -­",
  "-- some general rule that we've always had?",
  "Is -- is this your -- are you taking this in the direction of an argument that Congress gets less deference in determining nationality than it does with admission to aliens?",
  "But you -- you want us to write an opinion that says Congress has less deference when it considering -- when it determines who should be a national of this country than it -- than when it determines who should be admitted as an alien?",
  "Are you asking us to write that formulation in an opinion?",
  "If I -- if I take that as a \"yes\" answer, what is your authority for that answer? It seems to me that it ought to be just the other way around.",
  "Of course, but it was Congress that made the distinction. But you are asking us to say that Congress has less authority over this essential issue as to who should be nationals in the United States.",
  "Maybe there is some authority for that. Do you have any authority? Is there something I can read that tells me that?",
  "That was an alien admissions case. You are talking about nationality.",
  "But any of -- of the remedies that you are discussing with Justice Scalia involves this Court in a highly intrusive exercise of the congressional power. Let me just ask you this as an analytic matter, or as matter of logical priorities. We usually talk about substance first, remedy second. Do you think it's permissible, logically, for us to say that because the remedies here are so intrusive, that bears on our choice of whether we or not we use intermediate or rational basis scrutiny, and because the remedies are so difficult, we are going to use rational basis scrutiny? Is that a logical way to proceed?",
  "Let's assume that we adopt your formulation generally, that it has to be for legal error, collateral review has to be for legal error, and we could even add what the Ninth Circuit has found, it has to be by a court in order to avoid clemency, parole review boards, and so forth. I don't see why you don't lose anyway, because the allegation here, the complaint, the argument, may be that there was an abuse of discretion, and if there's an abuse of discretion, that is a legal ground to set aside the -- the sentence.",
  "Well, it's a motion made in a court, reviewable by the appellate courts of the State.",
  "It's a little odd to say that that's not legal. If -- an abuse of discretion standard is something we're quite familiar with in the law. We've never thought of that as being somehow extra-legal.",
  "So after a conviction in the State, if there's an appeal with a number -- on direct review, with a number of issues, improperly admitted evidence and so forth, you -- the lawyer can't add: And, in addition, he was sentenced under the wrong provision; he was given 5 years too many because the judge cited the wrong provision. You can't say that on direct review?",
  "Is there a citation for that, that you have? Is it your -­",
  "Is it arbitrary and capricious for a court to take the ground of least resistance, to decide the case on the easiest issue that's presented? Is that arbitrary and capricious?",
  "The phrase is \"substantial delay.\" Are there factors other than temporal factors that go into whether or not the delay is substantial; that is to say, the prisoner had difficulty contacting his counsel and so forth? Is that what the court looks at -­",
  "-- when it looks at \"substantial\"? And is there -- are there California cases that tell us what the -- how do we define \"substantial\"?",
  "It's supposed to be filed within 60 days. I don't -- this is along the same lines as Justice Kagan's question. Suppose there's the first round of habeas, and then he waits 60 days and files the new claim. Would that be substantial? Because you're indicating that failure to include it in the first review is a factor to be weighed against him. And I think that's what the Justice is inquiring about.",
  "Of course, but the problem I have with that, Mr. Phillips, is that at some point the court has to say: You've been given enough time; the constitutional violation still persists, as the State itself acknowledges.",
  "Overcrowding is the principal -- overcrowding is the principal cause, as experts have testified, and it's now time for a remedy. The court can't -- has to at some point focus on the remedy, and that's what it did, and that, it seemed to me, was a perfectly reasonable decision.",
  "Well, at some point the State itself said that if it had, I think, 7 years, it could get down to 137.5 and didn't seem to object to that.",
  "Yes, but the State -- the State did not claim that either order in either case has succeeded in achieving a remedy. You've never claimed that.",
  "And -- and just if I could have your attention for a moment. I have this problem with the case: Overcrowding is, of course, always the cause. If I'm running a hotel -- if I'm looking at a highway system, I need highways, what's the number of cars? If the problem is bad service in a hotel, well, it's the number of employees per -- per guest. I mean, that's fairly simple. Now, I recognize, of course, that Congress has -- had imposed a special duty on us. But I think it means that overcrowding must not be ordered unless that is the only efficacious remedy in -- in a permissible period of time. And it seems to me there is massive expert testimony to support that proposition on the part of -- of the prisoners.",
  "Well, but the experts testified to that effect.",
  "And the strike force and the governor's -- governor's commission reached the same conclusion.",
  "The strike team, I think they called them.",
  "They had a -- they had a cutoff date of some 2 months before the trial -­",
  "And that was a -- and -­ but before that point, the experts that were -- had testified were aware of the conditions that existed.",
  "What about the argument that there was evidence that should have been admitted but that was not, with reference to new construction?",
  "I have this question, and this goes just to remedy.",
  "I recognize the district court has to be given considerable discretion. It shows the 137.5 figure because it's halfway between 145 and 130.",
  "I think that certainly the Prison Litigation Reform Act means that you have to, if you -- if there's going to be a release order, it must be releasing the minimum amount -­",
  "-- that will effect the purposes of the remedy order. There was substantial expert opinion that 145 -- 145 percent would be sufficient. Isn't -- doesn't the evidence indicate to you that at least 145 ought to be the beginning point, not 137.5?",
  "That there was no -- and I understand -­",
  "There were more -- correct me if I'm wrong -- there were more experts that testified that 145 would work than there were that 130 was necessary.",
  "And -­",
  "But the experts -­",
  "The experts that -- who were testifying were quite aware of the fact that overcrowding related to the constitutional violations. That was their whole theory.",
  "And any number of them suggested that 145 would be sufficient.",
  "I see no evidence in the record that the State -- that the -- pardon me -- that your clients said that 145 wouldn't work.",
  "I -- I don't see a finding by the three-judge court that 145, is it, would not be an efficacious remedy. I know that it -­",
  "I know that it would for 137.",
  "If you take the State's concession that it can meet a goal in 5 years and the Federal court order is 2 years, we're talking about 3 years. Is there any indication of how fast the State's remedy would click in? Are we talking maybe about a 5 percent differential for the last 3 years, or -­",
  "No, no. I'm saying, assuming -­",
  "Compare what the State concedes that it will do with what the court has ordered it to do.",
  "Excuse me, Chief Justice.",
  "Well, turning to (a)(3), I have two questions. One is, as you -- and this is probably for your friends on the other side more than you. But as you understand the \"likely harm\" standard that prevails in the Second Circuit, is it likely harm to a majority of the members of the class, all of the members of the class? Do you know? Has the Second Circuit told us what that means?",
  "Or -- or a significant number?",
  "My question had no import. I really wanted to know the answer to that.",
  "Your white light is -­ just one more thing. If you proceed under (a)(3), doesn't Mertens bar the award of -- of monetary damages?",
  "Well, then -- then you're not offering us much. You say: Oh, please go under (a)(3), but then you go back and say: Oh, well, you can't get monetary damages.",
  "Well, that seems to me like just a roundabout, complex way of saying that you must recover under the plan, because if reliance is not required then there must be some basis on which you must recover, and that recovery must be under the plan. So it's -- it's -­",
  "I mean, if you say -- if you say injury is not required, then -- then I don't see how the SPD can give you recovery, unless the SPD is the plan, which brings us right back to the argument, which is your argument, under the first -- under the first section, under (a) -­",
  "-- (a)(1), (a)(1).",
  "So there's a -- there's a presumption that everything in the plan is favorable? I still don't see how you get it both ways. If it -- if it understates the benefits, that doesn't count?",
  "So you say under standard trust law once you show there's a breach, the burden shifts to the trustee to show that there's no harm?",
  "I mean, I understand that to be the Second Circuit rule, but I didn't understand that to be the rule generally in the law of trusts, and I quarrel with the Government's brief on that. I think the Government's brief is quite wrong to suggest that this is part of the law of trusts.",
  "Now, it could be the law of ERISA under the Second Circuit, but that's something quite different.",
  "But that's not under trust -- trust law, or correct me if I'm wrong.",
  "Under your proposal, I assume, if you prevail, under your position, the -- the summaries will now become part of the plan. So that even if there's no intent to mislead, there can be a class action if the -- if the SPD is in anyhow at variance with the plan -­",
  "-- and to the -- to the detriment of the employee.",
  "The minute you get away from contract -­",
  "Well, if it's a contract case as you're submitting, then the burden-shifting rules, it seems to me, that apply in trusts don't apply.",
  "Well, and in all of that -­",
  "-- I think, under trust law, there has to be a showing of breach and harm before there is -- the burden shifts on causation. And your brief left out the -- you indicate the burden shifts just so long as you show that there is a misstatement.",
  "Of course, if that's -- if that's the outcome of this case and if you prevail, that would mean that more things will be classified and withdrawn wholly from scrutiny; whereas, if other exemptions are used, they can be shared to a greater extent. So really what you're arguing for is for withholding more information from more people.",
  "Well, if the -- if the agency has a rule that says put explosive A in building 1 and put explosive B in building 2, that's hard for me to explain that it's just a personnel rule, other than, as Justice Scalia says, everything -- all functions have to be undertaken by humans.",
  "Well, what about my hypothetical? Why -- why is that person -- primarily or solely personnel rule?",
  "But that goes back to the point that -- I forgot about a computer age, but, forgetting that, humans have to do most things now.",
  "Would you classify those as internal procedural rules -- personnel rules? And would you also classify architectural specifications as internal personnel rules?",
  "What about architectural specifications?",
  "But there are a number of instances in the States where constitutional officers have their separate autonomy, their separate responsibilities. And it seems to me to follow inevitably from your position that the attorney general of State A could sue the governor of State A saying the governor is being sued in an Ex parte Young capacity because the governor is not following Federal law. I think that's just inevitable from your -- from you position, and that seems to me a vast extension of Ex parte Young. It's true, I think, that we've never said that the identity of -- or the permissibility of an Ex parte Young suit depends on the identity of the plaintiff, but don't we have to say that here if we're going to allow the States to structure their -- their own governments as they choose?",
  "Well, he would tell the governor that the governor is not giving adequate protection to prison inmates or State employees, that the -- that the governor's own personnel regulations are incorrect, and he would sue under Ex parte Young.",
  "There are all kinds of Federal rights.",
  "And the question is: Can one State entity enforce it against another State entity in a Federal court?",
  "Well, but that's -- but under -- under your theory there would be, because under Ex parte Young, the whole point of it is that a -- a person can allege that this fictional private individual who's really a governmental individual is violating a Federal right. That's the whole point of it.",
  "All State attorney generals have the -- have the obligation to enforce Federal rights for all of the citizens of their States.",
  "Well, that -- that issue -- I know your white line is on. You -- you indicated that there are certain cases in which dams can be authorized by the Federal Government, I think, contrary to State laws, with municipalities. Do you know what those are? There's an Iowa case; there's also a Washington case you were talking about.",
  "Do you have the citation?",
  "I've been looking for it. Okay.",
  "Going back to your exchange with Justice Breyer, I assume that you could stand by your answer and say the attorney general could sue the governor, because he's not suing the governor in his official capacity. He has a Federal right under Ex parte Young to sue the governor as an individual. It's a fiction; we all know that. But that's the way it works, and this is a Federal right.",
  "I think that's your position.",
  "Of course -- of course, Verizon was a private party.",
  "Are there other areas -­ and I can't come up with the name of the case. It was suggested by counsel, your friend, in the -- in his opening argument. I thought there were cases in which a subdivision is not -- a political subdivision of a State is not allowed to build a dam by State law, and yet it can go to the Federal Government, get a license, and build the dam anyway and just bypass the restrictions put upon its parent. The agent has more powers than the principal gives it because it relies on Federal law.",
  "In -- in this case, could Virginia sue VOPA in Federal court?",
  "You think it could or could not?",
  "Well, it would be the parent suing the -- the subsidiary, and -- and VOPA is not the State.",
  "In what percentage of the cases is there a representative?",
  "And you say -- you say that 80 percent of the time there is a registered -­",
  "-- advocate or counsel?",
  "Stone was somewhat mixed, though. It was a motion for reconsideration of the agency, whether or not that tolled the time to go to the court; am I correct?",
  "That's sort of a hybrid problem in the context of Justice Ginsburg's dichotomy.",
  "But it won't be disastrous if they can ask to be registered.",

  "If Congress reenacted 3742(g)(2) tomorrow, would it be valid?",
  "Well, but there are two explanations for your hypothetical. One is there has been a real change that affects the judge. The other is where you -- where you began, I thought you were going, where the judge is evading the court of appeals. Those are two different things. I mean, one may happen, and one may not.",
  "Could she have gotten reinstatement on the grounds that his continuing inability to be employed by the company is an ongoing hurt to her?",
  "Suppose an employer -­ suppose an employer dismisses an employee on an impermissible ground, impermissible under Title VII, and it's a very valuable employee. Can the shareholders sue on the ground that the shareholders are now injured because the company is worth less, having lost this employee, under Title VII?",
  "No, it's the same hypothetical. We'll just say Regalado, all the same facts, except she is very valuable to the company. The company is now worth less; shareholder sues.",
  "And in -- in your view, could Regalado have brought this suit or brought a suit?",
  "Well, if that is so, why doesn't that vindicate the purposes of the Act?",
  "Well, but I -- I assume that part of the thrust of your argument is that this was designed to hurt this -- Regalado, that she was hurt, that this was injurious; then you say, oh, well, it's not important enough for her to sue, so somebody that's more remote can sue. That's an odd rule.",
  "So you're saying an employer could adopt that policy?",
  "Are you saying an employer could adopt that policy?",
  "So if an employer says, now, if anybody makes a discrimination claim, we're going to fire two other employees just to show you that we run an efficient corporation out here, you say that that is -­",
  "-- that's proper or improper?",
  "But the -- the persons -­ the two people in the hypothetical that are fired can't sue?",
  "But can -- can we discuss the case, and -- and perhaps you don't think so. Can't we discuss this case, must we not discuss this case, on the theory that JCM's scienter, JCM's knowledge of a false statement, is a given in the case? Now, maybe you'll be able to prove otherwise. You say that they're not liable anyway.",
  "And it seems to me that's what the argument here is mostly about.",
  "But, once again -- once again, if the complainants in the case, the plaintiffs in the case -- hypothetical case, not this case, hypothetical case -- were injured shareholders in the fund, I take it you say still they could not sue JCM?",
  "Well, let's say that JCM's principal officers and managers wrote the statement. You still say there's no liability?",
  "Yes. It's not attributable, at least publicly, to JCM.",
  "Is there an alternate theory that JCM is really the day-to-day managers in day-to-day active control of the fund, and, therefore, it should be chargeable as if it and the fund are the same for purposes of making the statement?",
  "And we would say that that's different from, say, an outside law firm or an auditor?",
  "Just -- just to clarify Justice Breyer's hypothetical. In your -- in the hypothetical you gave where the president gives an innocent board of directors false information and the prospectus goes out, is the company liable because their agent -- is the company liable under 10b-5?",
  "Yes.",
  "So what you're saying is that the -- the agency relation that the president of the company holds is different that than the agency relation that JCM holds?",
  "Why is that?",
  "Well, but -­",
  "So even though they did those things, they acted in excess of their authority?",
  "But that's the allegation.",
  "Well, suppose it were proven that they did do those things. Suppose it were proven that they did 100 percent of the prospectus work. The only thing that the fund did was to mail it.",
  "But there was -- there is nothing in the record to indicate that that statement was attributed to JCM.",
  "You can -- you can play with the words \"make\" as you choose, but do we take the case on the assumption that you can show that it was attributed to JCM? I -- I see nothing in -- in the record that would justify that.",
  "You think attribution to the actor is not necessary for the actor's liability for a statement?",
  "Your point is that -­",
  "Well, when I picked up this -- this brief and looked at this case, I thought: Oh, well, licensing, that's a defined term; I'll look in Corpus Juris Secundum or ALR or something. But it really isn't. Your brief indicates you start with dictionaries, fair enough. You indicate what Federal licensing laws are. But I see no limitation on what the State can decide is a license in any jurisprudential principle that you've cited.",
  "Well, why is it -- this is the same question you're answering. Why is it suddenly not a license because the -- because the State imposes an additional condition, where it was a license before?",
  "And I -­",
  "But the Chief Justice -­ the Chief Justice can insist on the answer to his own question, but it seems to me his question is why isn't that still a licensing law?",
  "But in the child labor example, why isn't that a -- an addition to a regulatory licensing scheme so that it's a licensing law?",
  "But underlying Justice Ginsburg's question is why would Congress want to do that?",
  "But you are taking the mechanism that Congress said will be a pilot program that is optional, and you are making it mandatory. It seems to me that's almost a classic example of a State doing something that is inconsistent with the Federal requirement.",
  "Just so you know, I interpret your answer as confirming the implication of Justice Breyer's question, that there is a very substantial difference in Federal and State law on this point. I mean, you've told about -- you know what lawsuits are about. If you're -- if you're home free by a driver's license and Social Security inspection under Federal law and you're not under State law, that is a difference -­",
  "Judge Cudahy in dissent relied very much on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking.",
  "Judge Cudahy in dissent relied -- put considerable reliance on the ANPR.",
  "And when was that staff comment made?",
  "You talk about the plain meaning or -- I thought you agreed that the -- that the regulation is ambiguous.",
  "I thought you did.",
  "Well, suppose -- suppose you stipulate, in response to the Chief Justice's question, that it's irrational, that it's probably baseless, but that the market will react adversely. Is there a duty then to address the claim?",
  "But -­",
  "But if there's a baseless report -- and we stipulate that, although it's baseless, it's going to affect the market -- could that be the basis for an allegation, assuming the requisite scienter, that there's liability?",
  "But it's not the allegation. It's the fact that the market may be affected.",
  "Well, I thought this might come up. At some point, do we look at scienter and then go back from that to whether or not it's material, i.e., the argument would be the company knew that this would affect the price, and that's why they didn't disclose it, and therefore that shows it's material? Or do we do this with two isolated boxes -- one, materiality; two, scienter -- and we don't mix the analyses?",
  "But why doesn't the language in article V(A) -- and this is not too helpful -- simply restate the issue before us, what is a beneficial use by the upstream owner?",
  "But all that shows is -­ or might show in a particular case, is that the amount of water is reduced. Now the -- then the question is have the senior appropriators or the upstream appropriators reduced it in a way that's inconsistent or that's an overuse of their beneficial rights, and you're right -- again right where we started from. And then you have to regulate exactly how each irrigator is using the appropriative right.",
  "So the -- so the flows don't necessarily answer the question.",
  "I thought you referred us, just while you're going through your notes, to page 82, and there's an intriguing footnote where the Special Master talks about his own -- his own book. But that doesn't seem to me to be conclusive on your point, because he's saying the area is confused. And his point -- it seems to me it brings up what the special -- I'm taking over your answer to Justice Scalia's question. It is page 82, footnote -­",
  "There's a footnote on that page, yes.",
  "Do you have ultimate liability to Montana -- pardon me -- to North Dakota for -- for overuse?",
  "Well, I won't -- I won't get into that, but it does seem to me that the Chief Justice asked the question, if you're entitled to take the water, you can use it for any purpose. I -- I take it the answer to that is it has to be a beneficial use, it has to be for approximately the same crop, but that brings us to this -- to this gray area that the Special Master refers to on page 82 as confusing. And I think -- was it page 65 -- he talks about this is a confusing area of the law. What is your best authority for your position? What is the best authority? Do you have a case or a -- a paragraph in a treatise that's -­",
  "The Utah case is your best case?",
  "But what is the controlling principle in answering the question that I think you properly put? Could these irrigators switch to something like rice, which absorbs a tremendous amount of water, or are they -- when they switch crops it must be reasonably close to the earlier beneficial use? What is -- what is the standard that we look to, to answer that question?",
  "The standard of?",
  "Suppose the first -­ suppose the first crop absorbs 50 percent of the water and returns 50 percent by seepage. The second crop that they switch to still absorbs just 50 percent of the water but because of the -- of the pattern, the other 50 percent just evaporates?",
  "But are you addressing the word \"depleted\"?",
  "But are you saying that \"depleted\" means only what's withdrawn, and it's not calculated by -- with reference to what is returned?",
  "And so, once again, you're saying that depletion is a calculation of what is taken without reference to what returns?",
  "And your best authority for that is?",
  "Could you -- and this is II -­",
  "In II -- in II(H), do you think \"beneficial use is hereby defined to be that use by which water supply is depleted\" -- and we're looking at \"depleted.\" Do you define \"depleted\" as what is taken without any reference to what is returned?",
  "Well, I mean, that's -­ that's the key to this case, I take it. Wyoming is telling us that what goes back is irrelevant so long as what is taken is for a recognized beneficial use.",
  "Your answer to Justice Ginsburg -- I don't want to make your argument for you, but it seems to me rather strange. All of a sudden you're talking about how Ohio law will help you out. I thought the question was, from the standpoint of the defendant at least, whether the defendant purposefully availed itself of the forum. And you would say the defendant here purposefully availed itself of Ohio by choosing an Ohio distributor. But you don't make that argument. You're talking about a contract, an indemnity, which seems to me another step. That's choice of law and applicable law.",
  "Would you say the same thing if, hypothetically, since we're engaging in a hypothetical, the distributor were in France -- machine manufactured in England, distributor is in France, and the distributor then selects the United States and then the same facts, New Jersey? United States would be an appropriate jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, but not New Jersey?",
  "Assuming the statute that Justice Scalia hypothesizes.",
  "It's a little odd that the States, which have residual sovereignty, which are not limited sovereigns, would not have jurisdiction, but the United States, which is a limited sovereignty other than in the foreign affairs area, which may be relevant here, does have jurisdiction. That seems backwards.",
  "But the question is why the State can't make the same choice that the Congress does. The State lacks foreign affairs power, to be sure. Is that the only distinction? That doesn't sound to me like due process. What we're talking about is a source of authority, not fairness to the defendant.",
  "Does your argument depend on whether the manufacturer is the manufacturer of the whole machine as opposed to a component part, like Asahi? Suppose there was a little battery or lever that was manufactured, I don't know, in France, and it was sent over to this English manufacturer, and they were -­ this part is incorporated in many different kinds of machines, but the part then -- and then the facts are the same: It goes to the Ohio distributor and New Jersey, but the part is what causes the injury. What results?",
  "Well, it's like Justice Breyer's hypothetical. He wants to sell to the entire universe if he can.",
  "But -- but you were cut off before you finished your answer. I want to make sure I understood it. I -- I make the inference that you -- you would say that if there is an advertisement, not a sale, just an advertisement on the Internet, replacing the trade show, that that is a significant availment -- a purposeful availment, and there can be jurisdiction in New Jersey. Same factors here -­ somebody who doesn't go to the U.S. trade shows, but he does put it on the Internet, the same result?",
  "I want to know what your position is.",
  "But was the sale here negotiated in -- or part of the sale negotiated in Nevada or the person just -- the New Jersey manufacturer just was interested in the machine and then later contacted the Ohio distributor?",
  "No, I'm -- I'm trying to relate what happened here to the Internet hypothetical. I have the -­",
  "-- Internet hypothetical where there's just an advertisement.",
  "And, at first, I thought you were saying that's sufficient. Now you say no, because they have to be part of the contract. I'm trying to make the Internet equivalent to the trade show.",
  "Okay. But not just an advertisement?",
  "Even though that's the cause for the buyer's interest in it and he pursues -­ pursues his -- his transaction after finding out all the information on the Internet, but he phones the Ohio distributor?",
  "Again, this is preliminary, and it just goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question. Suppose you could help me out. I assume that there's general jurisdiction over the parent company. Then under respondeat superior, it would be liable in North Carolina for the -- all the acts of its agents.",
  "Then why isn't it automatically liable for all the acts of its subsidiaries?",
  "And -- and does that get -- and does that get into what in the Federal practice would be necessary parties?",
  "I -- I was wondering why -- why is your interest in this case so much greater than it would be in -- in the other case, and this -- I've been wondering that at the outset, and this sentence that Justice Kagan points out brings that into full focus.",
  "Well, then, you don't defend the reasoning of the State supreme court?",
  "Well, that's an -- that's an odd way to think about general jurisdiction. General jurisdiction is principally status -- your residence, the principal place of business, the place of incorporation. And this -- these factors that you're mentioning are -- in fact, some of the factors you mention in the brief are quite different than that.",
  "I'm sure you'll do so in the course of your argument, but at some point give us some examples of violations of -- of this -- this statute which from a commonsense standpoint don't involve a serious risk. There was something in the brief about, oh, well, the defendant might want to just find a safe place to pull over. I -- I didn't follow that because it's an intent crime. I just don't see how that would be a violation. But if at some point in your argument you could address those points.",
  "You're supposed to stop dead in your tracks and not pull off on the shoulder? I mean, I don't -- I just don't understand this. I'll go read the case, but -­",
  "Maybe that's why -- why it's a risk. You stop in the middle of the road and then everybody -­",
  "To knock on the door?",
  "They must have probable cause to knock on the door?",
  "No. All right.",
  "Okay. Take us -­",
  "Take us through it -- take us through it chronologically. The policeman is walking through the hallway. He has no probable cause. He -­ he -­",
  "He smells marijuana -­",
  "-- then he knocks on the door. When did the probable cause arise and when must it arise?",
  "But -- this may be a bit rudimentary, but can you tell me why isn't the evidence always being destroyed when the marijuana is being smoked? Isn't it being burnt up?",
  "So the distinction is being destroyed as opposed to being consumed?",
  "Well, I -- I think the Court is interested in taking the case on the question whether or not the police may create exigent circumstances and use those exigent circumstances to enter. Now, whether or not there were exigent circumstances here because of the sound is -- is, it seems to me, a subsidiary question.",
  "Well, of course, you're arguing the principle. What would have happened if the class had gone -- those who wanted to be in the class had gone first to the West Virginia court, and the West Virginia court had denied class certification? Would that preclude a later Federal court from granting class certification?",
  "But just on notice, does the record show when the client first came to the attorney?",
  "I have this -- this question about due process: The components of the due process analysis, it seems to me, are what is reasonable, what's necessary in the case, what's unconscionable. That it seems to me is just an extrapolation of what Reynolds said, and I don't know why we don't have that just as a law of -- of -- the Federal common law of contracts. I don't know why we need to elevate this to a due process analysis.",
  "Assuming that we're -- we apply Reynolds, which -­",
  "Well, that -­",
  "That just restates the question of what -- what do you do if you apply the Reynolds principle to this case, and they would say, well, you could have put it in your contract, too, and I think that's almost a wash.",
  "We can -- we can do it as a member -- as a matter of the law of contracts. And when we look at the law of contracts in Reynolds, Reynolds talked about the moving party, and I'm not -- I'm not sure that that phrase either had or has really definable content in our law. It seems to me it's just a question of the burden of persuasion. At one point, the contractor has to proceed. He makes -- it makes a certain showing, and the government has to go back and forth. And if at some point, the person with the burden of persuasion invokes the privilege, then we have to ask whether it's fundamentally fair as a matter of the Federal law of contracts.",
  "Did the contract -­",
  "Did the contract contain the term \"moving party\"?",
  "Well, in a whole law of contracts, you could say, oh, the contracting parties could have put this down, anticipatory breach, we don't need to have rules on that, that the parties could have negotiated that. That's not the way the contract law works.",
  "Is there any authority -­ this began as a motion for -- for nondischargeability.",
  "Is there -- is there -­ are there any cases in the -- in the Federal courts which tell us that a motion for nondischargeability does or does not require the pleading of a counterclaim?",
  "Well, that's because there's a basic sovereign immunity. The government doesn't have to be sued at all.",
  "-- so it can -- so it can make conditions, but that's not this case.",
  "But that's because of the limitation of sovereign immunity, and you don't -- and you don't have that analogue here.",
  "Excuse me, I just couldn't hear. On what grounds did he reverse himself, do you think?",
  "Is -- is?",
  "Before the statute was amended by I think the Patient Protection Act and there was a breach of the agreement, did the government assess penalties?",
  "Because -- and the reason I'm asking this is that you indicate that the government had a contract remedy. It seemed to me it had a regulatory remedy.",
  "What was the contract remedy that it had at the time this case arose, which was before the -- these mechanisms.",
  "Well, I -- I don't understand why what Justice Scalia said isn't the same as what you said. You said no, Justice Scalia, Restatement of Contracts. But what he said the question is whether or not did the parties intend -- and it's an objective intent -- to confer these rights on a third person. And -- and you said no, no, that's not it. But then it seems to me that your answer that you gave was just what Justice Scalia said. I -- I missed something.",
  "Well, in that instance, does the corporation have standing to raise that objection on the employee's behalf?",
  "Well, as an administrative matter, can the corporation make a FOIA objection on behalf of its employees?",
  "All right. That's the next -- that was going to be my next question: So the corporation can raise FOIA on its own behalf?",
  "Do our -- any of our opinions talk about the standing of the defendant? I can't think of one at the moment.",
  "So you want us to say that when there is a specific injury, specific to your client, that your client has the right to make any argument to show that the government has exceeded its powers under the Constitution, because those powers are limited to protect the liberties of the individual?",
  "But you're -- you want us to say that, even if the defendant in some case might show that a constitutional violation is causing that defendant specific injury, the defendant may not be able to raise the claim of its, what you call sovereignty claim? In Thornton v. Arkansas, the term limits case, we allowed a citizen of a State to bring a challenge to a statute that the State had enacted inconsistent with its Federal powers. Now, that's the flip side. That was a State statute, not a Federal statute, but it seems to me that is inconsistent with the position you're taking. And it seems to me also consistent -­ inconsistent with the rule that separation of powers claims can be presented by defendants, in Chadha v. INS, Clinton v. New York, a line-item veto case. The whole point of separation of powers, the whole point of federalism, is that it inheres to the individual and his or her right to liberty; and if that is infringed by a criminal conviction or in any other way that causes specific injury, why can't it be raised? I just don't understand your point.",
  "Well, all you're saying is that there's -- in that hypothetical is that there's no violation?",
  "Everybody goes home.",
  "Suppose a State wanted to be commandeered in Printz? Suppose they said, we really like having sheriffs take the Federal gun registration law?",
  "I -- I have -- I have -- I have serious trouble with that. A State can surrender its -- its -- a State can confer more authority on the Federal Government than the Constitution does?",
  "Your underlying premise is that the individual has no interest in whether or not the State has surrendered its powers to the Federal Government, and I just don't think the Constitution was framed on that theory.",
  "But the Chief Justice says only if it -- it's really a circular argument -- only if it results in a delay. Well, suppose it doesn't result in a delay?",
  "But that doesn't -- that prove the point that I think is the concern of the Chief Justice's question, that in some cases the delay -­ there's a delay that results and in other cases there isn't.",
  "You said at the outset that things have been working fine. Of course, the whole point of the Act was to hold district judges to a pretty strict standard, and the concern is that there might be a very complex case the judge just really wants to put off as long as possible and will continue to accept motion after motion. Is there anything I can -­ I can read or consult to show that this has been working very well and that there's not a problem?",
  "And I can't stand the suspense. I -- I would like to hear about the delay point.",
  "Well, here the agreement at various points says that the parties agree on the calculation of the guideline. I think it's paragraph 11 and 12. They say that the sentence is according to the guidelines. So there's reference to the guidelines throughout, and the court made the guidelines calculation.",
  "So it seems to me fair under the statute to say that it is based on the guidelines.",
  "And there are other provisions in the agreement you might argue about.",
  "Well, they do come up with a recommendation, which is three levels below the otherwise applicable guideline.",
  "Yes, but that's all based on the guidelines.",
  "But that doesn't mean that the court can't base its conclusion on his independent -- on its independent judgment on the guideline.",
  "Well, you're talking about what \"based on\" means, and that's an important part of your argument. If I could just, while I've got you, jump to this question of what happens on remand if you lose the case. On remand, I take it, you're not bound by the agreement because of the last -­",
  "-- the last of section 24 says the defendant argues for any sentence other than the one to which he has agreed to and breached the agreement.",
  "Would you -- what would that mean?",
  "Well, it's got guilty pleas on all of the counts. We know that.",
  "In your position, in your view, would the government be able to take the position that the guilty pleas stay in place, but it now wants maximum?",
  "Maximum guidelines.",
  "Yes, except that the agreement does. The agreement relieves you.",
  "Of any obligation. I see what you mean.",
  "So you say the judgment's final, so the fact that the plea -- that there's a breach of the plea agreement is irrelevant at this point?",
  "But didn't we take this case to determine whether or not deliberate indifference is the standard? I mean, willful blindness -- I don't think an opinion for this Court has ever sustained. Santos was a judgment -- was not a majority opinion. That's just a subset of knowledge. If we leave that out from it, isn't the dichotomy that you present to us the difference between deliberate indifference and knowledge or -­",
  "-- or purposeful, culpable expression, the -- the Grokster standard?",
  "I had thought that you wanted us to take the knowing standard in (c) and apply it to (b).",
  "Correct me if I'm wrong.",
  "And you say it's purposeful, culpable.",
  "It is in the red brief, the Respondent's brief, page 26, toward the bottom it says if you find, I have a problem that I do not know that they preserved this objection, but let's talk about what the standard ought to be. At the bottom it says, if you find that the someone has directly infringed a patent and that the defendants knew or should have known that its actions would induce direct infringement. So this means to me that in order to be liable for an inducement you can be liable if you knew or should have known. Now, if we can just discuss this for a moment. It seems to me that this is the important point in the case because if you say should have known, then you have a standard that is less than intentional for inducers. And that means that every supplier, every business person that takes a product from a manufacturer has the duty to inquire and to find out if there is a patent. And it is a standard that is less than intentional and that is a very substantial change or a very substantial burden to impose on those who are selling and distributing products.",
  "Well, if you say should have known, that is the necessary consequence of the holding.",
  "Well, as you say, willful blindness was never used really until this Court and this Court has never in a full opinion for the Court adopted it even in the criminal context. So can we talk about knowing as opposed to should have known.",
  "But you're presenting to us the proposition, I take it, correct me if I am wrong, that we should write an opinion that is saying that know or should have known is the standard for an inducer. And I question whether that is a wise interpretation and a necessary interpretation of (b), especially as we are informed through (c) as to what (b) might mean.",
  "If we are arguing about whether or not you can protect your judgement based upon all that's in the record, I think you may have a strong point. But I am interested in what the standard ought to be. I'd like you to know what a properly instructed jury should be told with reference to knowledge or something less than knowledge.",
  "So you're saying that (b) should have a lesser standard of culpability than (c)?",
  "You're not immune from liability for direct infringement. You're immune from liability, under the hypothetical, for actively inducing. And that is where there is a very substantial policy difference.",
  "So are you saying that the standard of knowledge would be the same for direct infringement as for active inducement?",
  "Would you say, even though you -- I think you disagree with this in this case, would you say that there is a reasonable argument in our precedent for saying that the standard of knowledge under (b) should be greater than reckless disregard?",
  "All right. Would you say that there is substantial authority for the proposition that it should -- the state of mind should be greater than \"should have known\"?",
  "Could you tell me, assume no Federal act, let's just talk about two -- or parties that are not involved with the Federal Government. Inventor agrees to assign to A; then inventor -­ inventor in fact assigns to B; then A gets the patent -­",
  "In this case, if you do not prevail on your principal argument, have you preserved the point that the assignment to Cetus was contrary to public policy?",
  "But the court of appeals didn't seem to discuss that.",
  "Well, but Justice Ginsburg's question, and I have the same concern, is that why can't we resolve this case in a simple way? What you're asking for, based on submissions to us of amici, of amicus briefs, means a very great change in how -- how -- how patents are held. If we can resolve this case on a simple contract basis, why not do it?",
  "You mentioned leaves several times, and you talked about that in your -- in your brief. If this were a trial court and we had two world-class chemists, strictly from a chemical standpoint wouldn't they tell you that the cocaine in a leaf is in a salt form, not a base form?",
  "Does that depend on the age of the leaf or if it's been in the sun or is -­",
  "No, no, no, no.",
  "I thought that the chemists said that it's always a salt. And you -­",
  "-- I thought that was the government's position, that it's a salt.",
  "But you ended by saying oh, sometimes it's a salt.",
  "Of course, there are two issues here, and I hope we do get to th substance. Can you tell me Camreta's current occupation? Does the record establish that? Does the record tell us what Camreta is doing now? Is -­",
  "Which is?",
  "This is a Monell claim, and it's -- and the district court has held its ruling, I take it, in abeyance pending -- a ruling for reinstatement of that claim, pending our decision here?",
  "Well, on -- we're getting to the merits. Do you agree that search -- strike that -- that seizure under the Fourth Amendment is the relevant category here?",
  "You agree that the child was -- was seized?",
  "What -- what happens if the teacher tells -- the student is misbehaving on the playground: Go back in the classroom. You can't -- you sit there by yourself. You can't be part of recess. Is that a seizure?",
  "What made this a seizure? The fact that it wasn't a teacher?",
  "Well, but I'm -- I'm asking for your view of the proper category to apply in these cases, and if it is a seizure, then -- then it's just a question of reasonableness, and we'd look at all the circumstances.",
  "It seems to me it would affect Camreta's behavior and that of other child protective officers. The lawyer would explain: Now, legally this is not binding; it just never happened. But three judges of the court of appeals in a reasoned decision have explained why this is contrary to the Constitution, and it would seem to me that any conscientious law enforcement officer would -- would take that seriously into account.",
  "Well, but Justice Alito's question was addressed to the Ninth Circuit. In the Ninth Circuit, it's not going to come up again if we assume that our public employees are going to be law-abiding. They're bound by this in the Ninth Circuit.",
  "And you -- and you want them to be bound, and yet you say there's -- that the case is moot. I just don't understand it.",
  "But there's nothing in the record that indicates that you're withdrawing your Monell action against the municipality, is there?",
  "But isn't it -- isn't a motion to reinstate it still pending in the district court?",
  "All right, so it's still alive. And -­",
  "-- there's nothing in the record to indicate that you won't ask that it be reinstated.",
  "Suppose that in this case, the agency has said: Well, we have 10 files where these documents are, and we'll make them available you to in the reading room. Go to the reading room. Is that a report?",
  "Well, I don't know if the files are digitized or not, but if they want this particular veteran's report, suppose you could just push a button, and they all come out. Is -- is that a report when those veteran's documents are just put together in a rubber band and shipped off?",
  "But that's the way the Second Circuit defined its own, or limited its own definition. But why isn't it -- why isn't the Ninth Circuit incorrect -- pardon me, the Second Circuit incorrect when it says that this is not a governmental end? It is a governmental end.",
  "I -- I don't understand that. How is that any different than the supervisor of the lab saying, I know what these people do, I -- I watch them on a day-to-day basis, and they perform their work correctly?",
  "What the State wanted to introduce is the result of the exam, and the Chief Justice gives you the hypothetical. Say, two people are necessary for the exam. You say only one has to be there if both saw it?",
  "But it -- but it's hearsay as to what the first person did with -- with crimping -­",
  "-- crimping the thing. It's not direct testimony from that person. You didn't say, are you experienced in crimping? Did you use your right hand or your left hand? Is there a danger of spillage? And so on. All that is beyond the ability of the defense to ask.",
  "You always take your chances with a business record. That's a given, of course. Of course, the State takes a chance with the -­ with the admission of any admissible hearsay testimony that the jury will be -- that you'll make the argument to the jury that you should discount it if the person isn't there. That's always true.",
  "Now, I take it it's a testimonial statement that this blood that was taken at the hospital was the blood of the defendant. That's a testimonial statement?",
  "And so I assume that in this case, the nurse and the police officer were both present.",
  "But I assume under your position, you could not have a record showing that the -- the nurse withdrew the sample at 10:08 p.m. on such-and-such a date and that she followed the regular procedure. That would be insufficient if the State wanted to introduce just a certificate or just -- just that record?",
  "It does -- it does not -­",
  "But the chain -- the chain of custody does involve a testimonial statement that this is the blood, that I took it out at 10:05 p.m. on Saturday evening. That's a testimonial statement. It's the defendant's blood.",
  "Well, but if you want to tell us, don't worry, it won't happen, I think that's an unacceptable argument. You're saying the defense has certain rights, and we have to presume there is a defense attorney who's going to afford his client every right the Constitution has. So the fact that we're not supposed to worry because it won't happen very often is (a) it seems to me, an unlikely hypothetical; and (b) it seems to me, irrelevant to your argument.",
  "Well, let's say that this Court holds that the Confrontation Clause requires the presence of the actual analyst to testify about the sample. Is there anything in the law that says that that testimony is suddenly excused, and you do not need the analyst if there's another sample available for the defendant to test? That's not the rule, is it?",
  "But I'm saying that analytically that does not bear on the question whether or not the sample that's introduced by the State requires the -- the analyst to be present. They're just unrelated.",
  "That may -- that may show that the confrontation rule is a silly rule. But it doesn't -- but it -- there's -- assuming confrontation is required, it's not excused -­",
  "-- by the presence of another sample.",
  "Do the rules of criminal -- do the rules of criminal procedure in New Mexico say it should be prima facie evidence?",
  "What's your best authority that at -- at common law or the common law tradition, there is absolute immunity for witness -- for the issuance of witness warrants?",
  "Then a second question, quite apart from immunity, just addressing the substantive constitutional issues under the statute, suppose that the prosecutor has probable cause to indict and try the person for the crime. Suppose also that there is good reason to show that he would be a material witness as to another participant in the crime. Does the government have any duty to proceed with the indictment, or can they just hold the person as a material witness without indicting?",
  "Just a point of detail. I -- I may not be recalling correctly. You said this statute is rarely used. I thought there were 4,000 material witness hearings a year. Is that mostly because of the immigration?",
  "Do we -- do we -- do we have statistics for the States, how many States hold -­ how many people are held under State material witness statutes?",
  "I'm not sure why that just can't be resolved under the issue of materiality. The magistrate asks the prosecutor why he wants to do this, and he infers from what the prosecutor said that -- just what you say. Then it's not material. It's not a case.",
  "Yes, but just to pursue Justice Scalia's point: The good faith rule is itself a rule that's intact, that's a precedent, that was on the books, and the good faith rule qualifies the exclusionary rule. So why aren't we just following the good faith rule here?",
  "I mean, there's nothing retroactive or prospective about it. It's just -- it's just applying the existing law.",
  "Well, that's an application of -- that's a subset, it's one application, of the good faith rule, which is an overall principle. But we're being faithful, under the government's view, it seems to me, to the overall principle.",
  "Well, you might respond that the government's going to say, well, there's Monell that's in their brief, and you'll probably say that that's a weak substitute for a criminal defense attorney's doing it in the trial itself.",
  "Suppose we were concerned with the costs of your rule in the sense that Gant does have some exception for the safety of the officers, and I think you can read the case if there's some general safety considerations for not securing the car in a neighborhood rather than leave it by itself. If we adopted your rule, the prosecution in all those cases would not have had the opportunity to make those additional defenses or those -- to advance those additional justifications for the search. Maybe you'll say, well, I'm just trying to resurrect Linkletter.",
  "Well, those cases were pending. I was concerned with cases that were closed, I suppose.",
  "There is something ironic in your position that the defendant who lives in the circuit that is most clearly wrong is treated worst.",
  "In -- in -- in one -- in one sense if we're talking about costs, the rule the government proposes is -- is defendant friendly, in that this Court may be more willing to impose stricter rules under the Fourth Amendment, if it knows that the good faith rule will protect against the -- the costs of -­ of overturning the conviction.",
  "But that could work to the benefit of defendants as a class, not the particular defendant?",
  "This -- this goes back to a question Justice Alito asked in a probably more artful way, but I'm not quite sure what's supposed to happen under your view after this stop. They stop the person, they get the information that he's driving under a suspended license, and are they supposed to say, Oh, you know, we shouldn't have stopped you; I'm sorry, have a nice day, go ahead, and then he leaves? Is that what goes on?",
  "Well, why isn't impounding the car the fruit of the illegal search?",
  "But why doesn't the public safety interest then permit us to use this evidence in order to protect the public safety further by punishing him for -- not driving? I don't see the difference.",
  "Well, why wouldn't you say the same thing about impounding the car?",
  "And so how does that fit with your earlier answers that his identity here could be suppressed? And then I'll ask a second question. If you say that you can suppress his identity from information they gained after the stop when they saw him, why couldn't they say, well, we saw this man before we stopped him?",
  "Of course we know it's too loud. It's always too loud.",
  "Do you -- can you think of any instance where speech by the employee would not be protected under the Pickering-Connick free speech calculus but would be protected under the Petition Clause?",
  "Well, under -- under the First Amendment speech clause -­",
  "We have said that an employee's, public employee's, right to speech can be regulated, can be confined, can be restricted beyond what the State could do for a nonemployee. Are you saying that if -- if the Petition Clause is involved there is no right to restrict what the -- employer does?",
  "Then you have to offer a test and you don't want the public concern test, so what's your test?",
  "And you would be content to apply that analytic, broad analytic framework to the Petition Clause?",
  "In the Garcetti case, the district attorney was disciplined for sending a memo because he disagreed with how the trial strategy was supposed to unfold, and then he actually made that argument in court and was disciplined for that. Would he have been protected if he had just gone to court to sue the office of the district attorney on some sort of a prospective injunction saying, with reference to all search warrants you should follow the following procedures? Would that have been protected, even though the memo was not?",
  "Would you have objected if the same analysis were used in the Petition Clause case as in the actual case? Just take the -­",
  "Just white out \"Speech Clause\" and put in \"Petition Clause\" and file the same opinion?",
  "I want to know how the analytic framework differs.",
  "Well, you're the expert in this area, but that -- that surprises me. I thought it was quite common in the early 1800s for you to go to all your neighbors -- and the book \"Quarreling About Slavery\" explains this, where there were petitions signed by many of the constituents in the congressman's district.",
  "And there were scores, scores of -- of signatures on these petitions. So that's like your card table.",
  "That was the Calhoun position, not the John Q. Adams position.",
  "Did we take the case on the assumption -- your -- your predecessor and you may disagree -- but did we take the case on the assumption that this was a frivolous cause of action?",
  "Well, that's not quite right. To the extent they overlapped, even on the theory the Federal claims were presented, the plaintiff below was seeking attorney's fees -­",
  "-- under 1983.",
  "So the city's liability would be greater.",
  "And I don't want to have you adopt this phrase, but just to clarify, are you saying that it's a but-for test, that you get only those fees for time that was -- that would not have been incurred but for the frivolous claim?",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not familiar with Louisiana standards of pleading. Afforded -- under 16 at page 41, the rights, privileges and immunities afforded Petitioner by our Constitution, Federal, and laws, State and Federal.",
  "It would seem to me reading the complaint would permit that.",
  "I -- I don't know what degree of specificity is required.",
  "Why isn't this all subsumed under the voluntariness rule?",
  "Well, at least it's the court performing it, not the interrogating officer, as Justice Scalia's questions point out.",
  "And then is it your point that he has to do something more than the read the standard Miranda warning? Suppose he read the standard Miranda warning? End of case as far as you're concerned?",
  "Well, but doesn't it follow from there that we have to have a -- we have to change the warning?",
  "I guess part of my problem is it's just in some respects hard to put the Miranda in the context of a -- let's say a 13-year-old alone. It may be that Miranda warnings, \"You have a right to remain silent, anything you say can be used against you\" -- might terrify the kid just to hear about it. I'm just wondering how the Miranda warning works here anyway. The school is in loco parentis, it has certain -- it has obligations and privileges with respect to the student.",
  "But you say associated with a reasonable man, and when we construct the reasonable man, you're asking me to think of a 25-year-old sitting in a seventh grade social -- social studies class.",
  "That's a little hard for me to imagine.",
  "I'm sorry. I just -- the only statements that could be suppressed -- I just didn't hear.",
  "Well, my -- my question just follows from what I think Justice Ginsburg must have in mind. My understanding is that it's a commonplace if the witness declines to testify even though the witness has immunity, or the attorney or the witness declines to produce a document, the judge says you will remain in jail until you comply. In most of the States, I think he's allowed counsel, but does the broad statement that you -- or the broad argument that you responded, that you're making when you answered Justice Ginsburg's case, apply there, so we are in effect saying in all these cases you must have appointed counsel?",
  "You're committed to custody until you testify.",
  "\"Mr. Bailiff, take him out.\"",
  "Well, I -­",
  "My concern is -- and it's been brought up in some of the other questions that Justice Ginsburg asked earlier. I just have the sense that there are thousands of these hearings around the country, and they're -- and they're very important in order to ensure child support, and that if we adopt your rule, in many cases where counsel are now waived or not present because of the -- the noncompliant parent is going to ask for counsel and that we're going to change the entire landscape of domestic relation proceedings, the Heisenberg principle.",
  "In every case? I mean, doesn't the defendant have to -- or the -- or the noncompliant parent have to ask for counsel?",
  "My question is: Do you -­ are there any data -- are there any data to show that in most of these cases, counsel does, in fact, appear? My -­",
  "My assumption is not, but I just -­",
  "Is it correct for me to think of both the Petitioner's argument and your response as a Mathews v. Eldridge problem?",
  "Well, it -- it does seem that absolute right and Mathews v. Eldridge is not quite a -- a good fit, but it seems to me that most of Mr. Waxman's argument can be subsumed within the Mathews v. Eldridge framework.",
  "But just -- just assume that we could somehow block out that category. If you could focus just on the domestic relations support proceedings, would there be a basic change in the way those proceedings are being conducted in other States, if we ruled in favor of Petitioner and said there's an absolute right?",
  "Yes, and I -- and I suppose you could say that in -- in advance that the judge and the appointing authority simply wouldn't know.",
  "It's a little difficult to write the opinion, if you are to prevail, saying there's no absolute right, but there might be in some other case, depending. We don't give much help to the system that way, because it might be that ultimately we would find that the balancing test is more complex than simply appointing the counsel.",
  "Well, then you do think we should lay out the factors? And, if so, what are the factors?",
  "Well, I -- I just don't know that all those things are properly before us.",
  "How did it happen that in FELA we have proximate cause light? It's just a different proximate cause than we see in other -- in other torts cases. How -- how did that come about?",
  "Can you read the cases as indicating that more deference is given to juries in FELA cases than in other cases?",
  "Do you think that over the last few decades, there's been an increasing emphasis on foreseeability as a component of proximate cause?",
  "Although your proposed instruction didn't use the word \"foreseeable\"?",
  "Do you think that the phrase in the statute \"in whole or in part\" allows juries to impose liability based on but-for causation?",
  "Why -- why not?",
  "You're in the jury room and a juror says: This wouldn't have happened but for the wide locomotive; therefore, there should be liability. What -- and assume the jury has all of the Federal reports in there and the judge lets them read. What -- what is there for another juror to say that this is wrong?",
  "Well, at -- at -- at least that, it seems to me, is a jury question.",
  "But -- but -- but it was not instructed on foreseeability?",
  "In -- in this case, do you think the law is content-neutral within its own universe, which applies just to political speech, so it's not content-neutral in that sense? But within the scheme that it sets up, is it content-neutral?",
  "Why?",
  "In Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical -- I'm still trying to think about -­ suppose there is one candidate for the -- for the pink party, and then three candidates for the orange party, and all three candidates for the orange party received the lump sum Justice Ginsburg was talking about. But there's only one candidate on the other side, and he has to face, or she has to face, three. Is that constitutional?",
  "One person is on one side; three people are on the other side. And under the Arizona law, if the three people on the other side are all participating candidates, each of them gets a bonus if there's only one person speaking on behalf of the non-participating candidate, right?",
  "All right. So $10,000 by the non-participating candidate triggers off $30,000 against him?",
  "All right. In Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, wouldn't you have the same problem in different terms, in that one candidate faces three people, all of whom are funded by the -- by the government?",
  "I'm just asking as a theoretical matter whether there would be a constitutional problem in the case that I put under Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.",
  "How about under the First Amendment?",
  "Do you think it would be a fair characterization of this law to say that its purpose and its effect are to produce less speech in political campaigns?",
  "Do you think that one reason for people to decline participation in the program is because they do not want to deter independent expenditures? And let me -- we'll talk about independent expenditures for just a few minutes if you don't mind. You indicated independent expenditure has gone up. I thought there was some data in the record that showed the population has gone up and so there's an argument about that. But just as a common sense matter, if I'm someone with the capacity and the will to make an independent expenditure, why don't I think twice if this is going to generate an equal amount on the other side, which might be better spent. Sometimes an independent expenditure is not really that effective, it's in a bad market, it's a bad message. But this results in cash to the participating candidate, who then can use it in the most effective way.",
  "All of which is designed to probe this idea that this somehow does not deter independent expenditures. I frankly am tempted to believe the opposite view, so you can tell me about that.",
  "Are you saying that anything that has to be disclosed can also be prohibited? I mean, I just don't see the equivalence here.",
  "It seems to me that this law has a severe criticisms leveled at it, severe legal invalidities alleged, quite without reference to disclosure.",
  "Well, in your hypothetical of the -- of -- of a participating candidate who spends up to the limit, what happens if independent expenditures are then made on his behalf?",
  "No, no.",
  "There's -- there's -­ there's two participants -- there's two candidates, one who's a participating and one who's not. The participating candidate spends up to his limit, he can't spend any more money. But then he gets a lot of additional support from independent groups, correct?",
  "I mean, that could -- that could happen?",
  "But the -- but the point that you made that the participating candidate is limited leaves out the fact that there can be additional expenditures on his behalf by independent groups?",
  "The Chief Justice's question reminds me somewhat of our rule in Monell under 1983: A city is not liable for a -- a constitutional violation unless it has a policy. Would you think that we could use that as an analogue to determine whether or not there is a common question here?",
  "Suppose, following the Monell analogue, there's -- it's a -- there's a showing of deliberate indifference to the violation. Would that be a policy?",
  "It's not clear to me: What is the unlawful policy that Wal-Mart has adopted, under your theory of the case?",
  "It's -- it's hard for me to see that the -- your complaint faces in two directions. Number one, you said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on. Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these supervisors have too much discretion. It seems to me there's an inconsistency there, and I'm just not sure what the unlawful policy is.",
  "Well, is that disparate treatment?",
  "Well, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought the Teamsters case was an action by the government that wasn't a class action case.",
  "Pattern or practice, that's correct. Help me, if you can, with this. Let's -­ let's suppose that experts' testimony, sociologists and so forth, establish that in industry generally and in retail industry generally, women still are discriminated against by a mathematical factor of X. You have a company that has a very specific policy against discrimination, and you look at their -- the way their employees are treatment -- are treated, and you find a disparity by that same mathematical factor X, does that give you a cause of action?",
  "The -- the -- the disparity with -- that women are subjected to are the same in the company as they are -­",
  "-- society wide, but the company does have a policy against discrimination.",
  "Would that be true even if you could not show deliberate indifference?",
  "Where there's no deliberate indifference and a specific policy prohibiting the discrimination, can you still proceed?",
  "Well, if it's standardless and -- and recordless, then why is there commonality? It seems to me that what you -- your answer that you just gave really is a -- shows a flaw in your case on commonality.",
  "I don't -- I think Justice Alito can protect his own question, but I don't think you've answered it. You've put in realistic likelihood. He's asked you whether or not as a matter of law, assuming that you're a juror and you read the statute and you were instructed on the words of the statute and you have Justice Alito's hypothetical, what result?",
  "The reliability under the statute under Justice Alito's hypothetical.",
  "All right. Then Justice Alito's next question -- again, he can protect his own line of questioning -- but what does that have to do with realistic likelihood? There's no realistic likelihood; it was only a half of 1 percent chance that the communication would be made. So, that takes realistic likelihood off the table, and if it's off the table, you have to give us a different test.",
  "But suppose in Justice -­ please continue. I interrupted you.",
  "Suppose in Justice Alito's hypothetical, two guys on the park bench, and they find out that the man with the gray coat behind them was listening. They say, we have to get the man with the gray coat. They turn around and they shoot a man with a gray coat, but it's a different man. What result?",
  "It wasn't the man that was listening. They got the wrong guy.",
  "The intent was there.",
  "But then your realistic possibility -- the realistic probability standard just falls out of your test.",
  "Well, I think it's very difficult to instruct the jury, to say, now, sometimes there's realistic probability, sometimes there isn't. I just don't know what this jury instruction is going to look like.",
  "I don't see what that has to do with the defendant's intent.",
  "Then you have to change your answer -- right? Maybe you don't -- to my hypothetical where they shoot the wrong man.",
  "Can we call this the take steps -- is this the take-steps doctrine, for purposes of discussion here?",
  "It's not clear to me whether you say that that is preempted or just that it was not well-pled. I'm not -- I'm not sure of your position on that point.",
  "Is -- is there any breakdown as to how many of those requests are generic and how many from branded?",
  "Buckman was a case -- I'm pronouncing it right, I think, Buckman -- where it was a branded manufacturer, was it not?",
  "A medical device manufacturer. So there it was -- it was an FDA process, and we said there's no State cause of action for saying that the FDA process -- that's slightly different from saying that you have a duty to warn the FDA. You might say it's a fortiori.",
  "Does the -- does the -­",
  "What is your -- what is your explanation for why Buckman isn't applicable here?",
  "Well, the suit was brought by the injured person in Buckman.",
  "And it's similar in that respect. And in Buckman there was a -- a formal relationship which did not permit the cause of action, and it seems to me you could at least argue that a fortiori there should be no cause of action when there an informal relationship.",
  "I have just one small question on that.",
  "Suppose that there are two competitors and each of them wants to connect, but each of them wants to connect at a different point and in a different way. Must the incumbent accommodate both if they're technically feasible?",
  "You say that this is a link, and your -- the opposition says that it's a -- that it's transport. Is that correct?",
  "But the -- but the reg says interconnection does not include transport.",
  "I have -- I've got it in front of me. It says, \"This term does not include transport.\" But you -- you say it does?",
  "No, I'm talking about --",
  "-- interconnection.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I don't know why -- why it's so hard. I mean, I got out my orange cord, and I --",
  "But I -- I wasn't sure of if -- if it was a transport or link. That -- that's my concern.",
  "Burden of going forward or burden of persuasion?",
  "Well, there are case -­ there are cases in which the presumption disappears?",
  "Yes. Well, I mean, there -- there -- there are instances in which a presumption disappears and then the -- the parties begin again with burden of persuasion, et cetera.",
  "You have, in effect, a one-way ratchet. If the judge really thinks rehabilitation is a -- a -- a primary or an important component of the sentence, then it reduces the prison term. It could never increase it. So you have a one-way ratchet.",
  "Suppose -- suppose the case in which the judge is going to sentence to 2 years no matter, but there is a 2-year rehabilitation program, and the defendant is -- the prisoner is receiving that. Would you say that, at that point, the prisoner is receiving an imprisonment term and rehabilitation?",
  "Hypothetical. The term isn't affected by the program, but the judge recommends the program, and the prisoner is receiving it.",
  "Would you agree the prisoner is then receiving both an imprisonment term and rehabilitation?",
  "I -- so then, we can use those two goals of sentencing in -- in the conjunctive -­",
  "-- and you can have imprisonment and rehabilitation at the same time?",
  "I'm just talking about a matter of diction. You would agree there are instances, in a hypothetical -­",
  "-- case, where you can receive imprisonment and rehabilitation at same time?",
  "We're -- we're talking about what the statute says, and the question indicates, the hypothetical indicates, that those are not mutually exclusive. You can have imprisonment and rehabilitation at same time. Now, this case is a little different because she didn't get it, but let's just talk about the hypothetical.",
  "Suppose the judge said: I'm going to sentence you to 12 months. Now, there is a particular facility where there is a drug treatment program that you can really benefit from, and you'd be a safer citizen, but I'm not going to mix up imprisonment and rehabilitation. I'm not even going to make that -­ I'm not going to consider it. All I'm interested in is imprisonment. Is that an abuse of discretion? The failure to consider the factors that Congress set forth, including rehabilitation?",
  "No, he said I -- no, he said I'm not going to consider that.",
  "Right.",
  "All right.",
  "So -- so then he must consider rehabilitation in the context of imprisonment?",
  "It -- it does seem to me that the principal trouble I have with your argument is that, as Justice Scalia mentioned, the judge can't be certain that the treatment will -- will be provided. And in an answer to an earlier question you said, well, 90 percent of the time the judge's recommendation is followed, the program is -- is offered. Suppose we're only 10 percent of the time? Suppose only 10 percent of the time could or did the Bureau of Prisons follow the judge's recommendation, wouldn't your interpretation of the statute then be very difficult to sustain?",
  "But I still find it hard, if I were going to write the opinion, to rule for your position to ignore the 90 percent-10 percent hypothetical problem I have, to say, well now, 90 percent of the time the judge's rules are going to be followed or the judge's recommendations are going to be followed. That's an odd way to support the interpretation of the statute that we have to -- that we have to adopt in order to rule in your favor because, as I say, suppose his position, his recommendation, were followed only 10 percent of the time?",
  "Well, if -- if you had a State court suit with a State plaintiff, wouldn't the State be able to adduce Federal common law as a ground for recovery? And then we would get to the merits and see if there is a Federal common law cause of action.",
  "Well, we all -- we all know that you sometimes have to peek at the merits to see if there's standing. There's a little cheating that goes on. But -- but in this case it does seem to me that you're lacking any clear precedent. When I think of standing, I think of Frothingham v. Mellon. That isn't this case.",
  "I'm more receptive to this kind of argument if I know we're going to the merits as opposed to standing -­",
  "-- and I recognize that we slip in and out of the two categories, and don't want to make it difficult on you. But I take it that these arguments also go to whether there's a cause of action on the merits.",
  "Is part of the inquiry, part of the dynamic, how imminent the Federal regulation is?",
  "Well, again, that just goes to the merits. You make that argument to the district court that your injunction is meaningless, equity does not require an idle act. End of case.",
  "Well, I'll think about it, but Newdow was a case where we thought that this particular litigant was not directly injured. Here the State said it's directly injured. That's the distinction.",
  "Same -- same hypothetical, assume no Federal statute, and -- and assume no Federal common law. What about State law? Does State common law become displaced because it's a matter of Federal concern? We don't -- we don't -- we don't usually have preemption of Federal common law.",
  "The hypothetical is that the Federal law -- Federal statutory law doesn't apply.",
  "It would be very odd to say that there's no Federal common law, but also that there's no -- no displacement of State law. That -­ that seems to me odd.",
  "We can concede that, but we still have the displacement argument -­",
  "Other than the time and expense of going through voluminous records, which is obvious, is there any other harm to the government in being required to show that there's a competing interest that makes disclosure unnecessary or improper?",
  "I hadn't thought about your argument until this -- until you made it this morning, that if there -- if -- if the tribe is correct that it owns these documents and gets -- can get them anytime, but the -- the -- the trial court here divided the documents into five categories.",
  "As to some of those categories it -- it denied -- it denied production.",
  "And I take it did that in the context of recognizing the attorney-client privilege, including work product, which were the accountant's records.",
  "What's your best case that you have on that in the private trustee context? I had thought your answer was going to be that in that case, the fact that the payment is made by the trustee out of the trustee's own funds and not out of the trust funds might be dispositive and might give him the privilege. But you -- you seem to say, in answer to the questions from the Court, that, other than this distinction you make between what the personal liability is and how he ought to manage the trust, which I think is a murky distinction, that the documents have to be disclosed. What's your best case for that?",
  "Which means you can't get preventative advice, which is one of the most important kinds of advice an attorney can give.",
  "But it also has broader authority, and that's just their point, I take it, for many other areas. The sovereign can't easily divest itself of its responsibilities. A trustee can so conform and shape its business that it doesn't have conflicts. A government just can't do that.",
  "Is this true regardless of the fact that the government may have a very powerful interest in seeking neutral, independent advice from an attorney, and that were you to prevail that advice would become watered down?",
  "The rule isn't, I take it -- or correct me if I'm wrong -- that simply because the issue is on a class-wide basis, it can't be challenged at the certification stage. We don't have a rule that's that broad, do we? Or am I missing a point?",
  "But suppose there's no demonstrated basis that that common issue exists?",
  "And except, just to add to the Chief Justice's question, an efficient market theory?",
  "In -- in the hypothetical where the penalty is increased, would there be an ex post facto problem?",
  "Could that data be sold to a university for research purposes? The university says: We really want this information to do some research. Could the data be sold to the university for that purpose?",
  "Could the researcher then have a profile, a data bank, that is very helpful to the general public, and sell that to the general public, to the newspapers and so forth?",
  "No, no. It's sold to the researcher. The researcher then comes up with a design or database that is very fascinating for a number of reasons. Can that researcher sell it to the New England Journal of Medicine?",
  "I still am not - I still am not sure. In my hypothetical, what would happen?",
  "The pharmacy sells to the researcher.",
  "The researcher is at the university. The researcher has a data bank or has some results that are very fascinating. The researcher then wants to sell that to the New England Journal of Medicine. What result under the statute?",
  "Well, I think maybe you're being -- you were the one that made the argument that the State has an interest in reducing health care costs. I assume that is by selling generics. And the Chief Justice asked you a question: In effect, aren't you doing this by regulating speech? And you say no, you disagree. I don't understand that answer that you gave to the Chief Justice.",
  "But isn't this inconsistent with what you told the court of appeals?",
  "So you -- you're representing to us that you told the court of appeals the statute should be interpreted as the SG is interpreting it here; that's your representation?",
  "Well, that's because the pharmaceutical company deems this to be the most efficient. What you're saying is that the State can prohibit the most efficient sort of speech, whereas if it just had general dissemination which didn't serve any particular purpose, that would be all right.",
  "-- but if it becomes -­ becomes focused and important and effective, then the State can prohibit it.",
  "What was your page again?",
  "Suppose you had a statute in which the pharmacy cannot give the information or sell the information to anybody; it must remain with the pharmacy.",
  "A copy of the prescription must be given to the State of Vermont. The State of Vermont then has the same restrictions that this statute has. That would be LAPD.",
  "And what -- and I want to know what your answer would be. If LAPD is correct -­",
  "Then what ruling would we have to make in my hypothetical case?",
  "It's not exactly not this case but just in the abstract, do we have a rule that if there are two statutes, A, the statute is passed for a bad purpose, B, the statute is not passed for a bad purpose, if the statute is otherwise the same, are they both unconstitutional or just one and why? And what case do I look to other than maybe Church of Lukumi?",
  "The -- the -- the case is -- is presented to us with briefs that seem to pass in the night. Your emphasis was on whether or not there was a right to vote that's protected under the First Amendment, and -- which is what the Nevada court held and you're quite correct to address it. But the Respondent says: Well, this interest has a chilling effect on -- on protected speech. I think we have to reach both parts of that argument. Do you -- DO you agree with me?",
  "Well, if we -- if we say that intermediate scrutiny is the test, even under that test, certainly under that test, the regulation cannot chill speech any more than necessary to fulfill the governmental interests, even under the intermediate standard.",
  "And -- and it just seems to me it's difficult for it to just address the standard of proof without deciding the case. Maybe you're right. Maybe we can just answer the -- the question that was certified and -- and send it back, if -- if you prevail. I'm not sure.",
  "But the -- the objection to the statute on the grounds that it's vague doesn't go away simply because intermediate scrutiny applies, does it, assuming intermediate scrutiny?",
  "Suppose that you spent your life in the civil rights movement or the right to bear arms movement or one or the other sides of the abortion debate, and these are your acquaintances, this is your -- it's been one of your principal activities, not for pay, but just because of your civic commitment. And then you are elected to the legislature and under this Nevada statute that controls, must you recuse whenever an officer of that association has -- is paid?",
  "They have coffee together every morning and they're in the same book club.",
  "It doesn't apply to outside advocacy? It just applies to advocacy within the limits -­",
  "But even if you have a law which is not directed to speech and is directed at conduct which is not speech, that law is still -­ correct me if I'm wrong -- even under intermediate scrutiny, subject to invalidation if it has a chilling effect on -- on speech as an incidental matter, if that chilling effect is more than is necessary to accomplish the purpose of the statute. Isn't that correct?",
  "But it -- it seems to me that if you're going to make this argument -- and this is the point we discussed with Mr. Elwood -- there are two ways to do it. Number one, say this infringes the right to vote, which is a First Amendment right; or you can say that this impinges unduly on necessary rights of association that preceded your election to the legislative post. It seems to me that the latter is the only way that you can make your case and to avoid the force of the argument that the Petitioner makes.",
  "Well, I mean, but that -­ but that's unworkable to say, you know, that every potential -- I think I might run for office next year and so I'm going to get advice from some committee as to who I can associate with? That just is unworkable.",
  "What's the standard for vagueness that we apply? We apply vagueness to First Amendment prohibitions or restrictions on speech. We apply vagueness to criminal statutes. This isn't a criminal statute. It does have a civil penalty. What is the case that I consult to see what standard of vagueness I apply?",
  "Could a State in its own courts provide for procedures whereby adversely affected parties could test the regulation?",
  "It seems to me you have to say that. Otherwise the next question would be under Gonzaga, you wouldn't say that a State can entertain a monetary cause of action. So, I think that's consistent with your position.",
  "Well, when you say -- that brings me to a slightly different point. You -- you introduce the fact or the consideration of what's administratively workable. The brief by the former HHS officials says quite to the contrary. It -- it says that there are almost $400 billion of HHS expenditures that are supervised by 50 people. That works out to 800 million each; and they say, we don't have time for this. And it's much more efficient and it's much more consistent with the application of -- proper application of Federal law to allow this action to be brought in the -- in the courts.",
  "Well, I mean, that's \"the sky is falling\" -- 700 judges. It would be just each district if it were in every district. And it -- it -- and certainly to the extent we are involving a State, there would be only one State involved. So -- so, there is just the State of California, and there are only four districts there, and the suit could only be brought in one. So, I -- I think that's an -- you know, I don't think that the \"sky is falling\" argument really works.",
  "Well, the courts, I take it, have the prerogative, perhaps even the obligation, under the primary jurisdiction rationale to simply withhold adjudication until the agency acts.",
  "But that's an abuse of discretion, not an absence of power. You're arguing an absence of power.",
  "Under the --",
  "Under a pre-emption -- would it be a pre-emption argument?",
  "Do you --",
  "Do you agree with the counsel for the Petitioner that if the State chose to allow its courts to issue an injunction on Supremacy Clause grounds in the State courts, that that would be impermissible?",
  "So, what is the best authority in our cases, other than Ex parte Young, or in a treatise or in recognized statements of the difference in law and equity for the proposition that in this area we can make a distinction between law and equity after centuries in which we've tried to say that that distinction ought to be blurred?",
  "I mean, do you want us -- would you want us to write an opinion and say, oh, there's a difference in damages at equity?",
  "What do I -- other than Ex parte Young, what do I cite for that?",
  "I know, but see --",
  "But that -- but that wouldn't explain the case like Gonzaga where there was no State entity. Gonzaga was a private institution.",
  "So, I'm -- I'm wondering. I understand the Eleventh Amendment dynamic, which --",
  "-- as Justice Scalia points out, was the whole driving force of -- of Ex parte Young. Is there -- is there any other basis for us to say that there has to be a law/equity distinction? You say, well, that's because there is no adequate remedy at law. But that's circular; that assumes because there's no cause of action -- so, that doesn't work.",
  "The Supremacy Clause says that judges in every State shall be bound thereby, but if you want to amend it so that judges in every State and all administrators should be bound thereby, then you have a Supremacy Clause action against every Federal agency. That doesn't make sense.",
  "Number one, it doesn't say that. There's no -- it doesn't say \"all circumstances.\" It doesn't say that.",
  "I'm -- well, no. Justice Scalia's question was related to a Federal agency. The Federal agency does something that's inconsistent with the statute, arguably, and you say there's a Supremacy Clause violation? That's novel.",
  "I -- maybe I just don't grasp the core of the case then. I thought this was a criminal conviction and that you were arguing that it's a criminal conviction because the conduct that's prohibited by the statute was conduct that covered this class of people by order of the Attorney General under the interim regs. I mean, is that wrong?",
  "I'm asking, isn't this is criminal conviction that resulted from the fact that your client was within the class of persons covered by the statute? The Government says they're covered anyway. You say they're covered only because the Attorney General acted, but then you say it's a criminal -- it's a civil provision? I -- I -­",
  "But we want to know what rule you're advocating in this case.",
  "We want to know why you're not advocating for what Justice Breyer and Justice Alito indicate is an endless right to claim that all previous counsel were ineffective. You say, oh, no, you're not arguing that. What is the rule that you are arguing for? What limiting principle do you have so that we do not have an endless right of counsel?",
  "But -- I understand that. But what is it that prevents the Petitioner from saying that the first counsel in the collateral proceeding was ineffective and that so was the second?",
  "But can I -- can I leave this argument with the -- with the judgment that you've offered me no limiting principle on how many proceedings there must be - -",
  "-- before there's an end to the argument that previous counsel were inadequate? I understand, this is the -- in this case, it was the first counsel in -- in the first collateral proceeding that we're talking about. But why couldn't it be the second? You don't give us a limiting principle.",
  "And if you want to say there shouldn't be, then that's fine.",
  "But those -- those were - -",
  "-- cases in which you could not raise -- pardon me -- in which you could raise the particular issue at hand. But that's not this case.",
  "The question is whether or not the rationale of those cases, which you state correctly, is applicable to a different set of circumstances.",
  "But -- but those were, correct me if I'm wrong, cases -- those were not cases in which the issue could only be raised on collateral.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan's question indicates that there are States, as you know, where on direct appeal they can allow for an evidentiary hearing on IAC. And as I understand your answer, is if that happens, the proceedings that precede the resolution of the issue on direct appeal, being probably conducted by the same counsel who is taking the direct appeal, can be conducted and he can be -- and the counsel, he or she, can be inadequate in the conduct of those further inquiries. That seems to me very strange.",
  "You're suggesting that there's no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel on direct, when he conducts some supplementary proceedings. That's very strange.",
  "Well, not if you adopt the -- the one-proceeding rule that I think counsel for the Petitioner was suggesting. He suggested Arizona is one of those few States where you could only raise this issue on collateral, and, therefore, you are entitled to effective assistance of counsel on that collateral. Then he would stop there, for statistical and for - - reasons, probability reasons, rather.",
  "But he didn't have a mail drop? I just didn't hear what you said.",
  "Let me ask you --",
  "Let me ask you this, if I may. I don't know if -- I don't think the briefs covered it. It may be in there. Do you know, in Alabama and/or nationwide, in how many capital cases there is no appeal?",
  "Well, in -- in this -- in this case, there was a direct appeal, and then there was this proceeding that we're talking about here. The trial judge waited for 18 months. So, you would think there's some merit to the underlying claim. Any statistics on whether or not -- on how often an appeal is abandoned or not pursued in this kind of case? No statistics?",
  "I'm -- I'm aware of the allegations.",
  "Particularly in a -- in a capital case.",
  "I just have two questions going back to the very beginning, when we were talking about the misaddressed or the unreceived mail. When the notices come back \"no longer at Sullivan & Cromwell,\" that's just as if it said, functionally, don't you think, \"wrong address\"?",
  "I mean, it's pretty clear that they didn't get their -- get the mail, get the letter, because it's sent back.",
  "One other thing while I'm talking with you, and it's a tangential point, perhaps. Could the State of Alabama under your laws waive what you allege to be the procedural default? If you thought there was substantial merit to the underlying claims, even though you take the position that they ultimately should be rejected, could you have simply waived the procedural default and allowed the appeal to proceed?",
  "Has Alabama ever waived lack of timely appeal in a capital case?",
  "Well, this goes to my earlier question, and continuing Justice Alito's line of questioning. If the State of Alabama had told the State court, in all of the circumstances, we think there should be an out-of-time appeal granted -- you're -- are you indicating that the State court said, well, that's a good idea, but we can't do it because it's not appropriate in these circumstances?",
  "Could the State in -- excuse me. Could the State in the -- in the Federal litigation have waived the procedural default?",
  "Except when they say you have to leave, one way to interpret that or to analyze that might be to say: You're in custody no matter.",
  "And when you say you have to leave, that's almost coercion -- coercive of them to say, because he doesn't want to have to go back to the cell.",
  "Right.",
  "But I think it makes your case weaker, not stronger, that statement.",
  "No, no. No, no, that's not the way Miranda works. Miranda suppresses a statement that is adverse to the person who was questioned. And the police doesn't know when the adverse statement's going to come. So, you're running away from the hypothetical. It just doesn't work.",
  "And what you infer is the rule that incarceration constitutes custody.",
  "But that is --",
  "But that is Shatzer, and Shatzer was careful to say we've never decided that issue.",
  "Well, it states in broader terms. It says we've never decided whether incarceration constitutes custody for Miranda purposes and, indeed, have explicitly declined to address the issue.",
  "It talks about Bradley, which was definitely where the issue was.",
  "Forties.",
  "But it seems -- but it seems to me that that was rejected in our most recent -- an earlier case on copyright.",
  "Yes.",
  "Can you tell me a little bit about the phrase and the argument about the public domain? Is, in your view, that just a synonym for when the time has ended? Or is there something more substantive to it that -- is it your position that the public somehow owns what's in the public domain? I'm --",
  "But -- but how does the phrase -- so, the public domain is simply a conclusion to express that, the operation of that principle? The public domain doesn't have any more substantive meaning other than to just express the conclusion that there's a limited time?",
  "Once again, it's just a conclusion for the argument.",
  "But now you're saying that there is a substantive component to this public domain argument, that the public does own something. And that's different from what I thought you answered earlier when you said it's just conclusory for a limited time.",
  "Well, it seems to me what you're saying, and I'm glad you gave this answer because originally I thought I was going to put in my notes the First Amendment doesn't apply to the copyright area -- and that just can't be. What you're saying is, is that this law will pass intermediate scrutiny. It's an important governmental interest, and it's substantially related to that.",
  "But -- but --",
  "But can you -- can you cite me to some -- some authority which says the First Amendment doesn't apply to a copyright --",
  "The First Amendment test doesn't apply. There has -- there has to be a -- a test. Now, maybe -- say it isn't immediate scrutiny but something else. But -- but certainly the First Amendment is implicated.",
  "But here what we have is a claim of retaliation, so that she can't even get a hearing. So, we can look at the various tests that are proposed here, and I think it's difficult to formulate the tests, but this can't even be -- be litigated because she is discharged. The allegation is that there's a retaliation for even asking for a hearing where these tests could -- could be applied.",
  "Again, that -- that could be an argument you could make in the -- in the pretext hearing.",
  "But you're asking for an exemption so these issues can't even be tried.",
  "It's almost like a summary -- like a summary judgment argument.",
  "And that's the -- that's the analogy, I think.",
  "No, no, no. What she is saying is that you basically gave me summary judgment; you didn't allow me to go to the agency to have a proper test applied. The summary judgment was just an analogy. Forget it.",
  "But I'm saying if there are some substantial interests the church has that can be litigated in EEOC hearing. She was fired simply for asking for a hearing.",
  "Lay people in many - -",
  "But the answer you gave to the Chief Justice seems to me to be this case. I was interested. I didn't know about this -- this minister capacity in this particular church. And as the Chief Justice indicates, many churches don't have -- some churches don't have what we think of as professional or full-time ministers at all. They're all ministers.",
  "And you said, well, that -- that can be litigated, that can be investigated. And I suppose when we do that we say, how many secular functions do you perform? And that's what this case is. But you don't -- you don't even want that issue to be tried. You say that issue can't even be explored.",
  "While Justice Ginsburg is looking, I had -- I had the same impression, that whether you're commissioned or not commissioned doesn't necessarily mean you can't teach a religious class.",
  "And again, that's something that -- that can be heard. You don't even want to hear it.",
  "But - -",
  "But if -- if you had said status or situs, then it seems to me it would have made more sense, given the language of the statute. We will all have hypotheticals. We won't have too many, but it's quite common on oil rigs that the employees bring some of the equipment back to the land, clean it, prepare it, and so that they can bring it back to the next -- the next shift on the rig. And some of this machinery is complicated. It has springs in it. Suppose that the worker brings the machine back from the rig to the land, to the base of operations that's land-based, and is injured in repairing that machine. Under your view, no coverage?",
  "I think that's quite difficult to square with the \"as a result\" language because this is a result of the operation. Let's just say the machine got broken because of the -- of the operations, and there -- and he's fixing it and he's injured.",
  "Well, the Government and - -",
  "The Government and the Ninth Circuit take care of that by saying that the person has to have -- the injured employee has to have spent substantial amount of time on the -- on the offshore operations. So, you could add that.",
  "Yes, I agree. I thought you had a backup argument - -",
  "-- in your -- in your reply brief.",
  "Would you call status - - if the test is where you spend a substantial amount of time working, is that what you call status?",
  "You -- but you call that status?",
  "That's what brings me - - I'm looking at petition appendix 96, 903(a) that you referred us to. I wasn't quite sure of your argument with respect to this statute. This statute is a situs-based statute.",
  "But since Congress didn't follow this model in the -- in subsection (b) that we're looking for and used \"as a result,\" why doesn't that show that Congress meant something different? I didn't hear your argument on that point.",
  "I don't see, in other words, how 903 doesn't hurt you more than it helps you.",
  "But it doesn't; it talks about where the injury occurs, and that's not what - - and that's not what (b) says.",
  "Does -- do we owe -- do the courts give some deference to the director's position?",
  "Is it 30 percent of his time over his career or that month or in a year?",
  "Let me ask -- let me ask this. There was a second half of the Chief Justice's --",
  "-- question that you never got to, but since we're on --",
  "-- the GVR, I have one more question on the GVR, at least. If you had sought -- if you had been counsel -- you're not. If you had been Greene's counsel and you had sought cert from this Court, you would have sought cert to the supreme -- the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, to the intermediate court, correct?",
  "Which indicates that that is the decision that's -- that's involved here. And once that decision becomes final, then you have a problem. If -- if the protocol or the practice or the rules had been that you would seek cert to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, then you might have had an argument about finality, but now you don't. But you can get to that later, because the -- the Chief Justice had a second part of his question which was collateral.",
  "And just to follow up on that question, the statute says it was \"adjudicated,\" past tense, and the decision \"resulted in,\" past tense.",
  "You said -- you don't contend that -- what's --",
  "You said you don't contend that, and I didn't hear -- was an unreasonable? I just didn't hear it.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, and, of course, those are ongoing injuries where the person continues to be confined.",
  "I'm not sure there's an ongoing injury here. All we're doing is talking about a trial error. That's -- that's different than --",
  "What's that? Cause and prejudice? What's the --",
  "Oh, actual innocence.",
  "Is Griffith a constitutional case?",
  "Would the -- would the Congress of the United States have the authority, looking at this case, to direct Federal courts to issue habeas in this -- on these facts?",
  "Is that then a restriction on habeas corpus?",
  "Is there a rule of constitutional avoidance that we should interpret the statute to avoid? Any inference that there is a restriction on habeas corpus?",
  "No. That's not argued. I agree.",
  "While we're discussing-- on a different point. What response do you make to Mr. Fisher's point about Graham and Roper v. Simmons?",
  "But do they?",
  "Do they meet the Teague exception?",
  "It seems to me it's not a question of a new trial. It's just a question of looking at a continuing sentence and seeing the validity of a continuing sentence.",
  "In a standard arbitration agreement, if Smith and Jones agree to arbitrate and Jones then brings suit in court, and that action is then stayed pending arbitration, has there been a breach of the arbitration agreement simply by bringing the suit?",
  "I mean, doesn't that happen rather often?",
  "And, of course, suits are brought after arbitration to enforce the arbitration award.",
  "Can you get -- can you get damages in the arbitration for the cost of attorney's fees to go to the court to say that you had to go to the arbitration?",
  "Suppose the case were reversed. The liability section says you have a right to sue, and the disclosure section says you have a right to sue or go to arbitration. What result then?",
  "It seems to me that under your -- well, I'll let you answer.",
  "Well, a lot -- a lot of the statutory changes in the policies of the INS date back -- was it the Second Circuit's case in Francis, which talked about the equal protection component of the two classes comprised of those in exclusion proceedings and those in what were then called deportation proceedings? Do we just accept that? It -- it seems to me that that whole equal protection rationale is quite doubtful.",
  "So, if we thought that they had gone down the wrong path originally, there's nothing we can do about it, and we just say we're in this wilderness and we can't get out?",
  "Is the reasonable suspicion test more easily met if it's a felon detained for a serious felony?",
  "In your -- in your view?",
  "Well, then you are going on a case-by-case basis based on the offense.",
  "But I take it -- I take it what we're trying to do is to protect the individual dignity of the detainee. But it seems to me that you risk compromising that individual dignity if you say we have reasonable suspicion as to you, but not as to you. You're just setting us up, and you're setting the detainee up for a classification that may be questioned at the time and will be seen as an affront based on the person's race, based on what he said or she said to the officers coming in.",
  "And so, it seems to me that your rule imperils individual dignity in a way that the blanket rule does not.",
  "Well, I'm not sure if it's their rule or our rule. Ultimately, it's going to be our rule.",
  "A common?",
  "Well, is the rap sheet always available immediately? I thought it was rather common -- correct me if I'm wrong -- just based on practice some years ago, that it -- it would take maybe 24 hours, 48 hours for the wiretap -- for the wire services and the Internet to -- to report that he was wanted for questioning for some very, very serious crime in some other State. I mean, in my practice at least, county jails were much more dangerous than penitentiaries, because you don't know who these people are. You arrest them for traffic, and it may be some serial killer. You do not know.",
  "But you -- you would -­",
  "-- have to keep the person in custody, say, for 24 or 48 hours until the medical personnel could come. Do you have 24-hour medical personnel for intakes that are at 2 in the morning?",
  "You're telling us that every county jail in -- in the United States has medical personnel on duty 24 hours a day ready to do a -- a search?",
  "Does the record or common experience justify an argument that if you have the person who's stopped just for a traffic ticket, but that person is going to be in custody for 5 or 6 days, that person might well prefer an institution where everyone has been searched before he or she is put into the population with -­",
  "I understand most of the general propositions that your side is advancing, but I have to say I was somewhat surprised at the evidence of the amount of contraband that was discovered, the amount of weapons that was discovered that's in the literature and that's in the citations, of course, was somewhat skimpy. I thought there would be a stronger showing than I -- than I found in the briefs.",
  "Suppose this were a death -- a death case, and roughly the same facts, failure - - failure to communicate. And that leaves me just one other question based on your opening remarks. We can think about adjudication as having a constitutional violation, injury, and remedy. Are you saying that there was a violation in the abstract here but no injury, or was there a violation and an injury but just no remedy?",
  "So if you could do all of that, including the death penalty, I - -",
  "Well, but you skipped over a step. I think we do assume that the deficient advice led to the -- the determination to plead not guilty.",
  "Well, but that's the question -- that's the question we're confronting. So, I think - -",
  "-- your answer was a little too facile on that point.",
  "We have to assume there's ineffective assistance of counsel in advising the client the nature of the charge for the -- so that the client can make up his mind whether to plead guilty or not guilty.",
  "We have to assume that in this case, correct?",
  "And that would also be your position in a capital case?",
  "That gets back to my question: Is it a violation in the abstract then, of damnum absque injuria?",
  "Damage without injury.",
  "Well, it's correct, but is it enough? Do you want us to write an opinion that plea negotiations are not a critical stage of the criminal process unless at the end of the day a guilty plea results?",
  "Okay. So, we - -",
  "Justice Kagan and I want to know what your test is.",
  "What -- what is the judge supposed to do? Let's say the remedy is it goes back before the judge. We're trying to unwind the clock or whatever the metaphor is. Does the judge have to prescind all knowledge of what he learned in the trial?",
  "Well, I'm asking what - - I'm a conscientious decisionmaker, and I'm asking for your advice on what I should do.",
  "I know the details of this crime, which were more horrific than I would have expected, because I've heard them at the trial. Do I just somehow forget about that, prescind that?",
  "So, the answer is \"yes.\" I -- I ignore everything that I learned during the trial.",
  "Well, you say that. But, as an administrative matter, I think we have to have some concern that these plea negotiations and discussions are in myriad circumstances. The defense attorney is by the water cooler; the prosecutor walks by and says I'm thinking of offering you a good bargain in the Jones case. He knows he's going to have that prosecutor in court the next day and really beat him. He thinks he's going to soften him up. So, he doesn't communicate it to the client, and the prosecutor later says withdrawn. We're going to have inquiries post hoc on all of these negotiations and discussions. And it seems to me that, absent some other rule, which I don't think we have the authority to impose, that all plea offers must be in writing and be stated with specificity, that if -- what you're proposing is simply unworkable.",
  "I think you can - -",
  "-- answer the Chief Justice's question. The Chief Justice said how are you going to know -- you have to show prejudice.",
  "How are you going to know that he would have? Of course, he's always going to say he that would have, but how is the trial judge going to make a credibility determination on that -- on that issue? I guess it's just a credibility determination. I don't know how he's going to do it. I think you can answer the Chief Justice's question yes or no.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "You're saying it was unfair to have a fair trial?",
  "You're saying it's unfair to have a fair trial; isn't that correct?",
  "That has to be your position.",
  "I have one, but it's more appropriate, I think, for the Government of the United States. Under the Federal rules, Rule 11, there has to be a colloquy before a plea is entered. Do you think the Federal rules and perhaps State rules should be amended so that judges, trial judges, before imposing a sentence inquire: Have there been plea offers; have they all been communicated to the defendant? Is that good practice?",
  "Well, if they had -- if plea offer had come out -- well, I don't know how it would work. When you enter a not guilty plea, you enter a not guilty plea.",
  "But we take the case on the assumption that he hadn't heard of the earlier better offer. Am I wrong about that?",
  "Well, regardless, your legal position is that there is no basis for setting aside the plea if an earlier, better offer was not communicated. That's your legal position, right?",
  "You say -- you say there's - -",
  "-- no Sixth Amendment violation when the counsel fails to communicate a favorable offer to the defendant. That's your position.",
  "That's what we took the case for. We didn't -- we wouldn't have taken the case if we were concerned about what happened in March and what happened in February. We took the case because of your position, that this is not a Sixth Amendment violation in these circumstances.",
  "It's -- it's very odd for you to say that -- to me -- that this is not a critical stage. If it results in a guilty plea and the -- and the attorney has not done sufficient research to uncover a defense, it can be set aside then. So, it's -- so, you're saying it's not a critical stage depending on what the end result is. That's very difficult. I thought we were going to tell attorneys, you have an obligation during the plea bargain process to use professional competence. And you say, well, you do or you don't. That doesn't make much sense.",
  "If defense counsel gives wrong information to the defendant about witnesses that can testify on his behalf and so forth, very bad legal advice, that's -- that can be ground for setting aside the plea, correct?",
  "All right, so -- and that's because counsel pre the entry of the plea did not adequately advise his client.",
  "Why -- why is there no problem when he doesn't adequately advise a client of earlier better offers?",
  "Well, suppose the case in which a plea offer's made, not communicated, and expires. Then there's a guilty plea hearing. And he doesn't -- and the defendant enters a -- a guilty plea but doesn't know about the prior offer. Is -- is there injury?",
  "No, is the plea involuntary? Is it -- pardon me. Is it unknowing?",
  "And what would he -- what would he have done had he known?",
  "Well, you know, Judge, I'm really sorry I didn't accept responsibility 3 months earlier.",
  "Can you tell me why it is that you care in this suit? If you're telling us, oh, don't worry, there's going to be liability and probably perhaps even more extensive liability than in Bivens, what difference does it make? Bivens doesn't give you attorneys' fees. Now, it's true that the Federal question may get you into Federal court.",
  "Just because of the statute of limitations?",
  "If we're looking -- if we're looking forward beyond this case - -",
  "-- and there's no statute of limitation problem, does it really make any difference that he have this second cause of action that's just - -",
  "-- (a) duplicative or (b) arguably narrow, more narrow?",
  "But why? What - -",
  "What difference does it make?",
  "Who cares?",
  "Suppose an important witness is reluctant to testify but is issued a subpoena by the United States attorney to appear before the grand jury, and then with reluctance he comes forward but, under oath, provides all of the key testimony necessary to indict? Is he a complaining witness?",
  "Well, what's the test we're supposed to use to decide?",
  "In the hypothetical I gave, what's the answer?",
  "Well, do you agree that we should vacate and remand according to the suggestion of the Solicitor General?",
  "And why is that?",
  "Is it just because of your view of the evidence, that there's no evidence to justify the remand?",
  "Well, you're saying that this was waived and was just not in the case? Because usually if the issue wasn't discussed, that's the reason we remand.",
  "Well, but if -- if there is -- if there is a theory of liability and we find that there is -- that that theory is baseless, we don't generally dismiss the complaint if there are other allegations in the complaint that could support liability on another theory.",
  "Can you -- can you make the argument -- does it help you, in distinguishing the notice of appeals section, to -- to say that the notice of appeal has to say the judgment or order that's being appealed? That's almost clerical. It doesn't require any -- any discretion on the part of the judge or extensive review of the record, whereas in the COA, there has to be an element of judgment in deciding what the constitutional issue is. Does that help you distinguish the two? You rely on the fact that the notice of appeals cases were decided before our -- our case indicating that it has to be clear language.",
  "In this case, suppose that the police talked to this -- to the lady that was in the -- in the apartment and saw the thing out the window and said: We -- we think we've solved this case, but you can't look at this man. We don't want to you look at this man. Don't tell us. We're not going to let you look out that window. It seems to me that the defendant might have a due process argument that the police interfered, that she couldn't say, right when he was there, that's not the man. I don't know what you want the police to do in this case. It seems to me it would have been (a) risking this argument from the defendant and (b) improper police conduct not to ask the woman, is this the man?",
  "But, again, that was in the context of procedures that the police had instituted.",
  "And your -- and your rationale goes much beyond it. In a way, you're infringing on the province of the jury. I don't usually like to reminisce, but there was a case I had where a prosecution witness was very, very certain, all too certain. And I said: Do you ever take your wife out to dinner or go out to dinner with friends? And he said: Oh, yes. I said: Has it ever happened to you that midway in the meal you say, is that our waiter? And you've seen -- the waiter has brought you the menu, he has taken your order, he has brought your food, and you were under no stress at the time.",
  "And there was good light. So, you teach the jury this way. And you're just -- you're just usurping the province of the jury, it seems.",
  "But we've said in our case, Neil v. Biggers -- that was a rape case, and we allowed it. We allowed the eyewitness.",
  "And, in fact, we said that it was unnecessarily suggestive but that it was still reliable.",
  "Well, it seems to me - -",
  "And what you're -- what you're saying, I take it, in the answer to Justice Kagan, was that there's really a two-part step. First, was the police procedure unnecessarily suggestive? And then if it was, are there other reliability -- was reliability impaired? So, you go -- you ask both questions.",
  "What -- what about cases with inflammatory evidence, too many lurid photos or testimony that ignites prejudice in the community? That's -- that's a -- that's reliability.",
  "It is interesting. I was trying to find a case where some other class of evidence was excluded because it's unreliable. And as - - Thompson v. Louisville, as you say, is just insufficient evidence, and that's different. Inflammatory evidence might be an example.",
  "Lurid photos or something like that.",
  "I think there were some early cases when fingerprint testimony couldn't come in, when fingerprint technology was just new. I don't know if those were due process or not.",
  "Was the -- was the Daubert case, our expert witness case where you have to have a threshold showing -- was that due process or was that just -- that was just rule of evidence.",
  "Is tea-leaf reading okay?",
  "And that it's willful. And that it's willful.",
  "That it's willful. Whoever willfully makes a false statement.",
  "So, it's not correct.",
  "Well, correct me if I'm wrong. It would seem to me, just from reading the statute unless we have some gloss on, that if you think it's true but it's false, from the way you were indicating, would be a violation. That's not the way I read it. Now, have we said something other than that in later cases?",
  "Well, under your -- under your theory -- and this is just following on Justice Ginsburg's question, I think. Under your theory, what foreign relations determinations are for the President alone to make?",
  "Are there any foreign relations determinations that are for the President alone to make under your theory of the case?",
  "And those are?",
  "In other words, who gets the telegram or something?",
  "Is there any treatise writer or decision of this Court that supports such a narrow, crabbed interpretation of the President's foreign affairs power?",
  "Of course -­",
  "-- in part the Jackson tripartite division, this famous division he had, I think assumes the validity of the congressional statute at the first step of inquiry. And here that's the whole question.",
  "But that wasn't a case -­ that wasn't a case in which the Congress had said you may not seize mills. And that's what your case is. So, there's a difference.",
  "It -- it is if you assume that the statute is valid.",
  "If the statute is -- if the statute is invalid, we're in category one.",
  "Or two.",
  "That seems to me different than the rationale of the D.C. Circuit. It seems to me you're not defending the rationale of the D.C. Circuit -­",
  "-- that there's no jurisdiction.",
  "And, you know, it's -­ it's always awkward for us to tell counsel what's in their best interest, but -­",
  "But it does -- it does seem to me that your position would be much stronger if you said there is jurisdiction, and the President wins.",
  "Because if this -- if this rationale remains the law and is the law, then you have the specter of constant legislative determinations that are not clearly -- not clearly invalid. And it seems to me that's, again with all due respect, not in the best interest of the ultimate argument you're making.",
  "I didn't hear the third.",
  "I have just -- I have just one question on -- on Washington's recognition of revolutionary France. You cite in the reply brief the fact that the administration was simply following what it deemed to be a dictate of international law. Do you want us to infer from that that he was not exercising a real discretion there?",
  "Well, under that rationale, could you put a beeper surreptitiously on the man's overcoat or sport coat?",
  "Oh, no. This is a special device. It measures only streets and public elevators and public buildings.",
  "Well -- and on that latter point, you might just be aware that I have serious reservations that there wasn't -- that there -- about the way in which this beeper was installed. But you can get to that at -- at your convenience.",
  "Well, but the owner of the can at the time it was installed consented, and that is not this case. There is no consent by the owner of the property to which this device was affixed. In fact, it was done, as Justice Scalia indicated, surreptitiously.",
  "We don't need to get into it, but \"Live Free or Die\" was spelled on the license plate.",
  "Why does it have to be cost-free? Suppose the police department says: We've got two things; we can put 30 deputies on this route and watch this person, or we can have a device with a warrant. What difference does it make?",
  "But suppose what they got is nothing more than what they would have had if they had 30 deputies staked out along the route. That's all. They'd get the same from 30 deputies. A constitutional violation?",
  "Well, no. We're assuming that there's no initial trespass, which is a problem in this case.",
  "You're saying it's -- it's the quantity and -- of the information seized and the time over which it's seized. And that's the proposition we're testing. And it seems to me what you're saying is that the police have to use the most inefficient methods.",
  "I'm fully aware of the 1984 ministry of love, ministry of -- of peace problem. But this -- your argument, it seems to me, has no principled distinction from the case that I put.",
  "But you're - -",
  "You're mixing -- you're mixing two things. You're the one that -- I thought your position was that the initial trespass is not important. That's the narrow way to decide the issue. You don't want us to do that. So, now we ask you about Karo, and you say, oh, well, there was a trespass. So, that's -- that's not -- that's not a responsive answer.",
  "Lots of communities have, including Washington, cameras on -- at intersections on stop lights. Suppose the police suspected someone of criminal activity, and they had a computer capacity to take pictures of all the intersections that he drove through at different times of day, and they checked his movements and his routes for 5 days. Would that be lawful?",
  "You think it would be?",
  "You have -- you have a targeted invasion. It's over a period of time. It's over a long -- it's over a wide space, and it seems to me that -- it seems to me you have to answer my question \"yes\" to be consistent with what you've said earlier.",
  "You probably haven't had the opportunity to go into the cases. A hypothetical. Suppose exactly these facts, only the police aren't involved. A neighbor does it to another neighbor in order to see where that neighbor is going, and when he finds out, he tells his wife and other neighbors. Do you think that in most States, that would be an invasion of privacy?",
  "We measure it by expectations of privacy under the Katz test if -- that may or may not be controlling.",
  "It found that there was no expectation of privacy.",

Were these statements, the first two -- the one at 252 in the joint appendix and then the statement on March the 2nd, which is the one you just referred to, 296, were parts of those statements given to the defense counsel or none of the statements? And how long were the documents? Were they 20 or 30 pages? Can you tell me a little bit about that?",
  "I shouldn't have said \"statements.\" None of the reports.",
  "Can you just tell me, how does Brady work? Is there some obligation for the defense counsel to say please give me all relevant reports?",
  "But just on the materiality point, I -- I just have to agree with Justice Ginsburg. What you're telling us is that when the defense stands up and said, and isn't it true that, in this statement which you just have testified to on direct and which the police have put in on direct, you also said you could not identify any perpetrators of the murder -- and then the prosecutor says immaterial, and the judge says strike it.",
  "I just can't believe that.",
  "I'm talking about the Boatner statement of 3/6/95, in which Boatner told police he could not identify any of the perpetrators of the murder, JA 259-60.",

  "Because it was not - - because it was not turned over. And with all respect, I think you misspoke when you -- you were asked what is - - what is the test for when Brady material must be turned over. And you said whether or not there's a reasonable probability -- a reasonable likelihood -- pardon me -- a reasonable probability that the result would have been different. That's the test for when there has been a Brady violation. You don't determine your Brady obligation by the test for the Brady violation. You're transposing two very different things. And so, that's incorrect.",
  "In that respect, do State inspectors routinely go on the premises of slaughterhouse to ensure that their coextensive laws are properly enforced? And if that's so, are there problems of judgment, that a Federal inspector says, no, this is okay under Federal law, and the State official says, no, this is not okay under the State law, even though they say the same thing?",

  "Now, I know it's use on the line, but it seems to me that the repair shop is an obvious extension of the line. Everybody knows that it's going to have to spend, I don't know, 1 day a month in the repair shop, and that's just part of -- of the use.",
  "Suppose - -",

  "Well, the reason it seems to me somewhat important is that I can't conceive of 50 different State regulations for the kind of gloves and things that the engineer has to wear on -- when he's running the train on the track. And if that's so, it seems to me it would help you to say that the shop was the same, but you seem to say the shop was different.",
  "Well, do we have to reach this failure-to-warn problem in this case?",
  "I'm not sure I'm understanding your answer, because I have one of the same problems as Justice Breyer. Of -- the design of this statute, from what I can infer what the congressional intent was, is for an individual person to be able to go into small claims court. And the defendant will usually be the telephone company that wants to remove it to Federal court and, as Justice Breyer said, instruct the attorneys always go to Federal court; the word will get out. And you're saying, oh, don't worry about that; that won't happen? That will happen. That's exactly what's going to happen.",
  "Whether the word gets out or not, they will all go to Federal court.",
  "Could you clarify one point for me. You indicated that no State has said that you cannot bring an action, and yet -- then you said that Texas said it has to be specifically authorized. Did the legislature of Texas specifically authorize it?",

  "Well, that -- that leads me to this -- I thought -- I never thought of title insurance companies as being fungible, and some were very, very good about narrowing the exceptions, about working with the seller of the property, if you represented the buyer, to get rid of the exceptions. And so, I'm not sure that it's just a question of a policy versus no policy. There's a -- there's a quality to the -- to the research they do. And the next -- and related to that is this: You -- you put the case as if the price is going to be the same for the insurance. (A) I think there's nothing in -- in the State law that permits the insurance company to get -- to set a lower rate; and, second, don't the title companies charge other fees, title search fees and so forth, other fees in addition to the price of the insurance? And those other fees, arguably -- I know she didn't allege any damage -- but those other fees arguably are too high because of this fixed market.",

Would that be enough?",

Under standard agency law, could the vehicle owner get disgorgement?",

  "In -- in your argument, do you have to avoid the concession that the term might be ambiguous? I know your position is that liability for damages is expressly waived, but then you stop there, and you -- and you say that -- you resist the idea that the definition of actual damages has to be unambiguous. Is that a fair characterization of your argument?",
  "You would say that at the time of sentencing, there were no multiple terms of imprisonment; is that your point?",

  "In other words, what the statute does -- it's phrased in terms of place, but it really has consequences as to time. Einstein would have loved it: You can't define space without time.",
  "But -- but I take it that it can also be retroactive. If you have a prisoner who has served -- has been sentenced in the Federal system, then goes to the State and is serving in a State facility, he then comes back to the BOP, the BOP can retroactively say we designate the place of imprisonment for the last 3 years as that State prison where you've been serving and we credit you with time served; is that the way it works?",
  "That -- that's an amazing interpretation.",
  "That's an amazing interpretation of the statute, but I understand that that's the way it's being done.",
  "Well, but I suppose in the Chief's example a super-cautious State court judge would say: I see you've got a 15-year sentence here. I don't know if it's going to be concurrent or consecutive. So, I'll sentence you to nothing at all. I mean, I suppose -- which shows that there -- if -- if you follow your rule, you may be infringing on the Federal balance, but then you would say the BOP can do the same thing.",
  "Well, you're saying that your position is really more consistent with the Federal balance because it allows the State to know what it's deal with?",
  "In the background of this case is -- is this question: A suspect has a weapon. He flees. As a general rule, do you think that warrants can say that when they search the home or the place where this person is likely to be, they can seize all weapons? Just as a general rule?",
  "So -- so, the test is whether or not he is likely to commit another crime?",
  "I mean, that's -- I thought the Petitioner said -- I didn't have the time to interrupt -- that under California law, they can search for anything where he's likely to commit another crime.",
  "Well, just suppose they're searching the suspect's own house.",
  "And there's -- he's used a specific gun, a 12-gauge Remington shotgun, and they've -- and they're looking for that. And these facts are the same. He may continue to elude the police; he may attack again. And they -- and they're searching the house, his own house. They see the one gun. They see a second gun. They cannot take the gun, the second gun?",
  "On what basis do you say they can take the second gun?",

  "When the FDA was writing the codes, was -- was it writing about the scope of the patent or was it writing about labeling?",
  "I mean, we can ask the Government, but why did it think that it lacked the expertise, because it didn't want to opine under the patent laws?",
  "Would it suffice in the description just to give a cross-reference to the patent, to say the use of this drug is described in patent claim number 43?",
  "Just one more question on how this works. Why does the FDA rely on use codes in the Orange Book to make the carve-outs if it doesn't do anything to ensure the accuracy of the code?",
  "Yes.",
  "So -- so, how do -- how do you describe what the FDA does as your third --",
  "Well, but abuse of discretion doesn't mean that the judge operates in a vacuum. If we make -- issue an opinion and say, oh, well, that the standard is an abuse of discretion, that doesn't tell people too much. Abuse of discretion based on what standards, what inquiries? And that's -- and I'd like to know what your position is on that, because it seems to me that, at the end of the day, it's going to be something very close to interests of justice.",
  "But we know what was in his thought processes, Mr. Waxman, because 14 days later he issued a 60- or 61-page opinion with -- dealing with 47 different claims, many of which, many of which, related to actual innocence, which was the -- the gravamen of the letter of the complaint on the 16th. So, you -- you can't consider the letter just in isolation from the 61-page opinion that's issued 16 days later.",
  "Abbinanti testified that she did the blood test and it went into the State database with reference to the other crime, not this crime; am I correct?",
  "But she's an expert. She testified how she did the test and what the -- and that she put the DNA result into -- into the data bank.",
  "And she -- and she goes further. She says: And based on that, which I believe to be true. She didn't say that, but this is the implication. Based on that, which I believe to be true, this belongs to Williams. This DNA is Williams's DNA. And if she weren't relying on the truth of the assertion from Cellmark, it would be irrelevant for the jury. Isn't that your point?",
  "Well, you're -- you're saying that the State of Illinois case is weaker here than in Melendez, where they had a certificate, and in Bullcoming, where they had somebody from the lab testify as to lab procedures. Here they have neither. And, yet, Illinois somehow says it comes in.",
  "But the -- the chain of -- the chain of custody are just supporting actors. The key actor in the play, the Hamlet in the play, is the person who did the test at Cellmark, and she or he is not here. And if you want to say, oh, this is not -- tell the jury, now, we're not saying that this is admitted for the truth, we're not saying that this is Williams' DNA, the judge would say, well, then it's irrelevant, it's excluded.",
  "And it seems to me, in -- as in response to Justice Scalia, that not only does he indicate that this is hard to distinguish from Bullcoming; in Bullcoming, at least you had an expert say how the laboratory works. Here, you don't even have that.",
  "You have less here with reference to Cellmark than you did in Bullcoming.",
  "Well, in Bullcoming, we said that was not sufficient. And in that case, the person was from that lab.",
  "I don't know how that's any different from Bullcoming and Melendez-Diaz.",
  "In other words, you had something more than you have here; and, therefore, it goes out and this comes in? That doesn't make sense.",
  "It's the limited purpose of -- of explaining the basis for her opinion. But her opinion is that this is matched to Lambatos.",
  "Her opinion is that this is a match to Lambatos. But if -- if the match material isn't admitted for the truth of the matter asserted or isn't considered for the matter asserted, then that testimony is irrelevant and meaningless.",
  "If that's so, why isn't there insufficient evidence in this case?",
  "None of -- none of which has anything to do with the accuracy of the test.",
  "As you understand our precedents, would this have been a stronger or a weaker case if a representative, an employee, of Cellmark had come and said, although I didn't do this sample, I want to tell you how our procedures work and why we're a respectable lab, et cetera, et cetera?",
  "Are you aware that in Illinois they have an instruction -- assuming it was a jury case, this is a bench case, but if it were a jury case: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you are not to presume or assume that the DNA tested by Cellmark came from this sample.",
  "And then they routinely give that to juries?",
  "When -- when the Respondent addresses this, will they take issue with the way you describe what has been pre-empted, or as you read their -- we'll ask them -- but as you read their brief, is this crystal-clear?",
  "In thinking about what's pre-empted, I looked at the Diehr case involving the rubber molding --",
  "-- and the constant monitoring. And if you could take an analogy from that, let's -- let's suppose that there was a system of measurements that you take every half-hour which constantly monitor how a drug is being retained in the tissues, and that there is a protocol for the admission of some two or three different drugs to get the balance right. In other words, it's much more complicated. Is there some point at which that is patentable, even though this pre-empts a -- a whole range of different choices?",
  "And it's hard for you to answer -- you know, there's a million hypotheticals. But I'm just trying to --",
  "-- see what the process is here.",
  "I thought your answer to Justice Scalia would be -- and please correct me -- the difference is, is that what the Respondent is claiming is a -- a patent on the measurement of the result.",
  "But you're giving a different answer.",
  "I mean, that's how I would have answered the question. But that's obviously not --",
  "-- the right way to do it.",
  "Nature always -- nature always has a reaction to the drug.",
  "Nature always has a reaction to the drug.",
  "It's hard to resist the temptation to peek into the obvious component or the nonobvious component and then go back and apply it to 101.",
  "You want us to discipline ourselves to talk just about 101 in this.",
  "Well, then why -- then why didn't you answer her first question that it was -- that it was not patentable? I have the same --",
  "I think I'm having the same trouble as Justice Kagan.",
  "Why can't you just go -- the hypothetical was -- was one range, one result. Pardon me. One measurement, one result. Suppose that just continued over a range. And they said if it's 40, then you have this; if it's 50, you have this.",
  "Well, I'm not so sure.",
  "We're talking about summary judgment. It seems to me, rough rule, that summary judgment would be much more -- much easier under 101 than 102 and 103.",
  "Why couldn't someone come up with the idea that at a level which is in the range that's within your patent, if at a certain level for a certain -- a person of a certain age, you administer a new drug, you have a new result? Why isn't that like the fax machine?",
  "But the --",
  "-- Petitioner is saying that if you think about that, it's an infringement.",
  "Well, is your point that there should be a Federal rule of laches or estoppel, or are you just building up to the fact that this is traditional, well-recognized doctrine and there's been -- and there's been a sudden change?",
  "But how would the boat get up there? Does it just jump over the 10 feet?",
  "Okay. Then that would work.",
  "Then that would work.",
  "But as -- but as the Chief Justice is indicating, I think, this concerns who owns the bed; and that's different from navigable waters of the United States. And some of the answers you gave to Justice Alito about -- that the purposes and the reasons for navigable waters of the United States are quite different, really, than for the considerations we have about riparian ownership. Navigable waters of the United States can be controlled by the United States for many purposes, but that is concurrent with a separate document -- doctrine for underlying ownership of the bed.",
  "And it's not clear to me that the test for navigable waters is the same in each case as to the whole river.",
  "Would you help me with this? Navigable waters of the United States for purposes of Federal jurisdiction over many activities such as boating is one concept. Navigable waters of the United States for purposes of State ownership of the bed serves different purposes. Are the -- are the boundaries and the definitions of what is navigable co-extensive and parallel and -- and precisely the same in each case? Or, on the other hand, are there some cases where a body of water, say the falls, is navigable waters of the United States but not navigable waters of the United States for purposes of bed ownership by the State?",
  "And -- and if there is a difference, can you tell me a case? And I think Justice Scalia basically was asking this earlier.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "But it is conceded, is it not, that -- if we rule for the power companies in this case, there still may be a situation in which these waters can be navigable waters of the United States for other purposes, other than ownership of the bed? Or am I wrong on that?",
  "Did he write that during his 30-day -- 32-day portage?",
  "And what were your -- what were your other four points you were going to give us?",
  "Can you tell me, what would be the scope of your holding? How would -- how would -- if you could write the opinion for the Court on this part of your case, what would the rule be? I mean, health inspectors go into restaurants all the time and say: Unless you fix this, I'm going to give you a citation. Fire inspectors, the same thing. And I'm -- I'm wondering how your general theory or your general principle that you want us to adopt would fit with that rather routine type of enforcement?",
  "So, this is under -- this is under the APA.",
  "This is the APA prong of your argument.",
  "To apply for a - -",
  "But then the compliance order would automatically be vacated? I mean, doesn't the compliance order presume that they are wetlands? Hasn't the agency already made that determination?",
  "If they're wrong about that, if there is a finding in the APA process that these are wetlands, is that the end of it? Or within that, the context of that review, can you say, well, they are wetlands, but only to a minor extent, and these conditions were onerous and -- and far more than necessary to protect the wetlands? Can you argue that in the APA review? Or is it just up or down: Wetlands, you lose; not wetlands, you win. That's it?",
  "They were getting a good night's sleep? But they are getting a good night's sleep before they read your brief?",
  "Are there cases in the courts of appeals or the district courts where landowners, having received these notices or compliance orders, have said that there's a taking of the property, inverse condemnation?",
  "What evidence - -",
  "Oh, please, continue.",
  "Well, that was -- that was Judge Newman's view, but the en banc court took the middle position. Often, in trial court evidence problems, the judge says, well, it goes to its weight, not the admissibility. And it seems to me that's what Judge -- the en banc majority was saying, that the fact that it was not presented before or that it points in a different direction from what the PTO found goes to its weight, not its admissibility. In other words, they will give consideration to the fact that it wasn't introduced and -- and maybe discount it as a result, unless there's a reason. So, it just depends on the facts of the case. Number one, am I reading or am I summarizing the en banc majority correctly? And, number two, why isn't that a sensible way to interpret the statute so, as Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, you give some meaning to 145? It's -- it performs a function that 141 does not.",
  "Well, then -- then you're saying that we -- that we should choose either between your position or Judge Newman's position.",
  "If the judge does that, what -- how does he articulate the weight that he gives to what the PTO find? Does he say I give deference to this? I give substantial deference? This was all discussed -- page 9 of your brief, you summarized what the majority opinion of the en banc court did.",
  "And in that connection, on this same line, do you -- do you agree with that summary?",
  "Well, in line with Justice Breyer's question, can you give us an example of some other agency review proceeding that is somewhat like this, or is this just unique?",
  "And you agree with that?",
  "I -- I noticed that.",
  "Just one more question.",
  "Background question about preclearance. Assume that the court of appeals -- that the three-judge district court in Columbia in the preclearance proceeding finds some problems with two or three of the districts, say, in the congressional plan. Does it just say we -- there are problems with these districts, we therefore deny preclearance; or does it then give guidance and say we would give preclearance if you made the following changes? Does it -- in other words, does it give you a road map? How do these decisions work? That's what I'm asking.",
  "At face value. But you don't have any problem -- if I'm a district judge and I think there is a substantial likelihood that a particular challenge will succeed, you don't have any problem with my drawing an interim plan to avoid that likelihood.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Section 2.",
  "Can you -- can you tell me with reference to the two districts, other than the senate district, congressional and State house districts, did Judge Smith defer or use the -- the Texas legislature's 2011 plan as a benchmark to some extent?",
  "So, you would fault his solution for giving insufficient deference to the State of Texas 2011 plan?",
  "Let me ask you this: Suppose that this -- all the facts are the same except that this is in a State that is not subject to section 5. Would there be a problem in your view with what the district -- with what the district court did, with Judge Smith -- with what Judge Smith did?",
  "Right.",
  "And then we could -- then there would be no problem with using Texas as a benchmark, the Texas 2011 as benchmark, as a starting point?",
  "As a starting point?",
  "Isn't it odd that this is a section 2 suit, and yet section 5 seems to be driving that -- driving it. That's the problem with this litigation, it seems to me.",
  "And section 5 applies only to -- to some States and not others. Texas is at a tremendous disadvantage here in defending the section 2 suit and in drawing -- and in having -- and the judiciary is at a disadvantage in -- in framing a remedy for a likely -- a likely section 2 violation in some of the districts.",
  "Well, I wonder if it should take precedence in a section 2 suit. That's all this court -- this is the primary obligation of the Texas district court, is to address section 2 violations.",
  "Well, it's not giving effect to the uncleared plan. It's giving effect to a legislative judgment as to what is workable for all the factors and criteria that Justice Alito referred to, county lines, et cetera.",
  "But could it -- could it look at the district and say, well, it respects county lines; it follows a river; it's got urban and rural. Could it look at it for that reason?",
  "And rely on the legislative judgment as making a sound judgment that the river runs through here, and the county line is there and so forth? That's -- that's what seems to me the difficulty with saying, oh, you can't look at the plan.",
  "Can we infer from either the ambiguity or -- or the other reading of the sentence that the Chief Justice suggested that, in the court's view, it was desirable to have a minority coalition district? I draw that inference.",
  "A minority coalition district?",
  "All right. So, you would defend the plan on the ground that this is a sound result?",
  "Is there anything in the opinion from the three-judge court in the District of Columbia that indicates that there are some likely potential violations that are section 2 violations as well as section 5 violations?",
  "And -- and I can amend that to -- and in the submission of the parties?",
  "Yes.",
  "The second -- the second being section 2 violations as well.",
  "Do you have substantive objections to the plans suggested by Judge Smith in the house and congressional districts?",
  "Oh -- no, do you have some section 2 objections? Well, that doesn't quite work. You have to talk about retrogression, I suppose.",
  "Well, are you saying that this is capable of repetition, yet evading review? I'm not quite sure.",
  "Does the injunction have future -- future terms? Is it a permanent injunction or is it just an injunction that relates to the notice that's required in this case?",
  "Do you make that argument in your opposition?",
  "It -- it seems to me that this answer is -- is so confusing that the Court probably should consider whether or not an opt-in requirement is -- is preferable. I -- we're talking - - in the first exchange, you had with Justice Alito, he gave you a very simple question: 90 percent and 10 percent. Then, it's reversed. Special assessment for 90 percent political. And the point there was that you're taking someone's money contrary to that person's conscience. And that's what the First Amendment stands against. And you simply wouldn't answer that question. You would -- and then you say, well, maybe that it's - - it's fungible, it's hard to - -",

  "Let me ask you this - -",
  "-- by way of background: In collective bargaining negotiations, do the unions consider the -- as one factor the importance of ensuring that the governmental employer has fiscal stability?",
  "Well, isn't that ultimately a political judgment, so that even collective bargaining involves a core political judgment?",
  "But you -- you concede, in ordinary collective bargaining, there are critical and important political -- significant political judgments that are being made by the union in the course of collective bargaining with chargeable expenses?",
  "I didn't quite understand that. Today there's a -- there's either a potential or a fact of violent and objectionable broadcasting in radio? I didn't quite -- just to understand your point.",
  "Yes, I understand that. Yes.",
  "What -- what you're saying is, is that there is a public value in having a particular segment of the media with different standards than other segments. And forget radio. Let's just talk about television. But -- you know, in the briefs, it says how much -- how many cable stations there are, and you, what do you call it, surf the -- you go through all the channels. And it's not apparent to many people which are broadcast and which are not. But you're saying that there's still a value, an importance, in having a higher standard or different standard for broadcast media on the television. Why is that, when there are so many other options, and -- and when it's not apparent to many viewers which of the two they're watching? Just because it's an important symbol for our society that we aspire to a culture that's not vulgar in -- in a very small segment?",
  "Well, but --",
  "But then there's -- and then there's -- and then there's the chip that's available.",
  "And, of course, you ask your 15-year-old, or your 10-year-old, how to turn off the chip. They're the only ones that know how to do it.",
  "But is your point is -- is that the chip technology works better if you have this differentiation between broadcast and cable media?",
  "Well, in a way, that's circular. That's what we're here to argue about. I'm asking --",
  "-- is there a functional, a pragmatic, a practical difference between the two?",
  "But isn't the --",
  "-- inevitable consequence, or this precise consequence that you're arguing for on this fleeting expletive portion of this case, that every celebrity or want-to-be celebrity that's interviewed can feel free to use one of these -- one of these words? We will just expect it as a matter of course, if you prevail. Isn't that the necessary consequence of this case?",
  "Well, I mean, even you did in this one. You said now remember you're on television, which was just, you know, giving an added incentive for these vulgar comments.",
  "But, I mean, isn't it inevitable that this will happen?",
  "By \"sanctioned,\" you mean punished as -- as opposed to \"blessed\" sanctioned?",
  "Well, we -- well, we have to anticipate what the natural results or consequences of our decision will be.",
  "As I understand it, the same rules that we apply to obscenity for printed material, under your view, would apply to television.",
  "In other words, if it's -- if it's not obscene, you can publish it. Period.",
  "Well, I thought that was the whole gravamen of your argument.",
  "Because this is for money damages.",
  "Because this is for money damages. Ex parte Young was just injunctive relief. The Eleventh Amendment primarily protects the treasuries of the State against money damages.",
  "It's not Ex parte Young.",
  "Well, then we're back - - we're back to (b) overrides (a). You -- you're saying that (a) would be interpreted in favor of the Petitioner but for (b)?",
  "Because I agree with the Chief Justice. Without an award, it seems to me it tends to help the Petitioner.",
  "And I -- I suppose you can argue that there is a built-in limitation because the question doesn't even come up unless there's state action. So, there has to be close enough cooperation so there's state action. I had never thought that when a private attorney gives an opinion letter to a government agency or government entity at its request that there's any state action there at all. So, that question -- so, there the question just wouldn't even come up; am I correct? I assume - -",
  "It's just hard to imagine anything more imbued with state action than imprisoning someone. That's -- that's the problem I have in thinking about the case.",
  "Another question that's not teed up and I guess not presented -- I'm just curious to know about the history of the case. Was it argued that there was no state action here? Or is there -- and in your view, is that a very simple question to answer?",
  "Well, but -- but you're saying -- and I'm just trying to supplement Justice Scalia's question so -- so you can continue to answer it. You're saying that the split is somehow more obscure or more imprecise in its formulation than what Colony did. You're saying that, oh, if Congress knew about Colony, they would have done it differently, but it was a split, this was close enough for government work. That seems to be your argument. And I - -",
  "I still don't understand why the world was different after Colony addressed the split than before Colony addressed the split. The issue is still the same.",
  "And what was -- and what was the date of that, Bakersfield?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "Just on that point -- and we'll find out in a minute -- is the Respondent going to say, well, it's always implicit that you have a basis; everybody knows you have a basis?",
  "So, that's -- so, that's necessarily what you're telling the government.",
  "Were most of the - -",
  "And I - -",
  "I was going to ask in conjunction with Justice Kagan's discussion, were the pre-Colony cases that involved splits -- did most of those or any of those relate to the sales of goods and services or were they all real estate sales? Do - -",
  "Well, but the Congress drew it, as I think is implicit in Justice Kagan's question, when it talks just about goods and services.",
  "And the other reason, it was goods and services. There's always FIFO and LIFO. I mean, there's -- you know, taxpayers who sell goods have inventory cushions. And so, the IRS is very, very well aware that that kind of judgment is involved in all these statements. It's not quite the same with basis.",
  "So, you draw the line - - your position is that only those who have entered a guilty plea are entitled to the presumption against non-retroactivity, but not those who've been found guilty?",
  "Is that change alone sufficient for us to say that this is -- was a clear indication by the Congress of an intent or purpose to alter the imputation rule?",
  "Can a parent ask for a permanent resident status for a 5-year-old child?",
  "So, if you have two cases, one -- two 5-year-olds. One, as in this case, lives with the parent, but the application has not been granted or not been filed; and the other, the application has been granted. And they're treated - - they're treated differently?",
  "Can you give me an example of an instance in which a child who is the child of two lawful permanent residents cannot get lawful permanent resident status for himself at the age of 8, but that he can at the age of 15? I mean, what commonly happens between that period that would make him ineligible - - eligible only when he is 15, other than just as a matter of providing all the documents?",
  "Well, you -- the whole point here is that some children are given lawful permanent resident status and -- and some are not. But I'm asking, does the passage of time, assuming two lawful resident parents, ever make it so that a child who was formerly ineligible is now eligible? He was ineligible at 5, but he's eligible at 14? I mean, how does that work?",
  "Oh, I don't mean a visa number. But nothing -- nothing with -- with respect to the child's real status other than his -- where he is on the queue in the immigration department?",
  "It's a little odd that the domicile is the more exacting of the two requirements, and yet the Congress allowed imputation in the domicile case but not -- not in the residence case. It seems almost backward.",
  "Congress enacts a more forgiving and less exacting standard, but then takes away the imputation.",
  "What would - -",
  "Mr. Kinnaird, what would happen if the child remains with the grandparents in Mexico and his parents are living in Los Angeles for 6 years until they can afford to take him. Is the parents' residence then imputed to the child so that when he moved to Los Angeles in year 7 he is deemed to have been there for 6 years?",
  "Mr. Kinnaird, I'm having trouble figuring out, is your view that non-imputation is just unreasonable per se, or is your view that they didn't explain non-imputation properly?",
  "Is -- is there some advantage to giving parents an incentive to apply for early lawful permanent residence? Because under your view, parents wouldn't have to bother to apply for it at all. I'm -- I'm wondering about the - -",
  "-- the consequences of deciding in your favor. And the other one, quite distinct, is it seems to me that there probably would not be some floodgate of -- of imputed residence cases.",
  "Right.",
  "The -- the Respondent said that the BIA gave no policy reason, no policy justifications, for its -- for its interpretation. Is that correct in your view?",
  "Have we said in some of our cases, oh, don't worry, this is within the discretion of the prosecutor, close enough for government work?",
  "Does HUD have expertise in interpreting criminal statutes?",
  "Well, I'm not sure. It seems to me that even under the Respondent's view of the statute, you have to inquire into reasonableness to see if the fee was earned.",
  "Well, is it true that as a matter of common usage, when we are talking about oral testimony in court, we often use \"interpretation\" and \"translation\" or \"interpreter\" and \"translator\" somewhat interchangeably, but when we're talking about rendering a document into -- into a different language, we generally talk about that as \"translation\"? This is a matter of common usage. Do you think that's correct?",
  "That wasn't quite my point.",
  "My point was that I think we say -- in fact, in a Supreme Court case, we've said in the Hernandez case, when we're talking about oral testimony in court, we tend to use \"translator\" or \"translate\" and \"interpreter\" or \"interpret\" somewhat interchangeably. Is that correct?",
  "Well, what's -- what's your position? I -- I take a deposition at -- in my law office and I have to have an interpreter there. Is that recoverable or not?",
  "Well, how do you think it affects the way you read the statute? What do you think should be the result?",
  "Let me ask you this question: In the background here, is there some concern that we're going to have minor cases but with huge translation costs, and it would be simply unfair? And if the answer to that is \"yes,\" isn't that taken care of by the statutory direction that the court \"may\" give costs?",
  "Well, isn't that an abuse of discretion?",
  "Well, I mean, in other words, if the court sees that the cost of preparing documents into an English-language is quite substantial in light of what's involved in the case, and it's just not fair to -- to award them, can't that court in its discretion deny that, or is that not the way it works?",
  "Suppose the -- suppose the court said, after this colloquy, I want you to go back and think about this whole case again. Could the jurors then have revisited the first count?",
  "The capital murder count?",
  "No. The colloquy is what we've got.",
  "And the judge said I want you to deliberate more about this entire case. (A) was he permitted to do that under Arkansas law, I guess is one of my real questions.",
  "Nothing -- nothing -- Arkansas law doesn't permit the jury to -- before it's delivered its final formal verdict, to think about the case again and vote on it again?",
  "Well, but I -- I think this may be what Justice Alito asked. Well, I -- I don't think it gave a verdict here. I don't think it's revising its verdict.",
  "It's mid-deliberation, as Justice -- Justice Scalia said at the outset.",
  "Well, but then I'm not sure it's just a matter of State law then, we're -- what we're doing here is talking about the constitutional minimum. And I -- Justice Scalia gave a hypothetical, you can have a more -- even a more principled juror than that. He says, you know, now that we're thinking about manslaughter, it is true that thus and so happened; maybe we were wrong on the first -- first-degree count. I mean, that's perfectly plausible.",
  "Why should there --",
  "But that's -- but that's after a verdict. Why is it that the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause are implicated when a jury, before it delivers a final verdict, says where -- where it is mid -- mid-deliberations? The defendant, of course, is terribly disappointed if they go back and then find him guilty. So, I guess there's a personal disappointment interest for the few hours that it takes for the jury to come to a different verdict, but he doesn't have to prepare the defense again; he doesn't have to go to trial again. It's all one trial. I don't see why there's a double jeopardy interest in the Massachusetts case that you point out. I don't see where the double jeopardy interest was in saying that you can't go back.",
  "What -- what --",
  "What purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated by the rule that says you can't go back?",
  "I'm asking why it's the heartland of the Double Jeopardy Clause.",
  "I question that.",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that that's quite correct. It has said it often but always in context where it is well understood that speech can injure. Defamation, Gertz -- page 12 of your brief, you make this point, and it's what Justice Sotomayor is indicating. You think there's no value to falsity. But I -- I simply can't find that in our cases, and I -- I think it's a sweeping proposition to say that there's no value to falsity. Falsity is a way in which we contrast what is false and what is true.",
  "And -­",
  "But that's in the context of a defamation case.",
  "And you want to take the Gertz case, where it's well understood that defamation is actionable, and say that as a general matter, that the government can inveigh against what's false.",
  "But that's -- that's for submitting résumés. That's -- when -- that's fraud.",
  "They were -- they were in a context, though, of recognized torts, intentional infliction for emotional distress. Here it does seem to me that you can argue that this is something like a -- a trademark, a medal in which this -- the government and the armed forces have a particular interest, and we could carve out a narrow exception for that. I think we'd have to do that. But just to say that the cases you mentioned say that there's no value to false speech, I just simply cannot agree that they stand for that broad proposition. They do in the particular context of a recognized tort like intentional infliction of emotional distress.",
  "It seems to me your best analogy is the trademark analogy, Olympics case, et cetera. You put that in a rather minor -- not an afterthought, but it's a secondary argument in your brief. It seems to me it's the -- it's the strongest one. The whole breathing space thing almost has it backwards. It presumes that the government is going to have a ministry of truth and then -- and allow breathing space around it. I just don't think that's our tradition. On the other hand, I have to acknowledge that this does diminish the medal in many respects.",
  "Well, it's a matter -­ it's a matter of common sense that it, it seems to me -­ that it demeans the medal. Let me ask you this: What do you do with the statute that prohibits the wearing of a medal that has not been earned?",
  "Well, I'm not so sure. You know, the Tinker case with the arm band; it's purely expressive speech, it seems to me. I think if you prevail here that the wearing prohibition must also be in serious doubt.",
  "But I think it is, if the whole purpose of the person who puts the medal on his tuxedo that he didn't earn is an expressive purpose. That's pure expression.",
  "Well, don't you think that's the case? There's no non-expressive purpose that I can think of.",
  "That's just the basic definition of fraud in the criminal law.",
  "My -- my only -- one of my questions is the slippery slope problem, college degrees and so forth. Could you address that?",
  "But -­",
  "College degrees.",
  "What --",
  "-- what would happen if -- if the employee is fired because of his or her religion and he goes to MSPB?",
  "And this is a First Amendment claim. MSPB has to say, well, this is not adequate cause, and -- and then they find something else in the statute? It can't look at the constitutional aspect of the claim?",
  "Well, because -- well, let's -- then I have to do a new hypothetical.",
  "Because he gave a -- a speech --",
  "-- saying there's no global warming or something.",
  "But the MSPB says we can't look at the First Amendment?",
  "What I'm asking --",
  "But I -- I was leading up to the fact, why should there be a difference? If the MSPB has this expertise in as-applied, why doesn't it have it for facial? I mean, the expertise question is -- it can't be a matter of expertise; or am I wrong about that?",
  "But, counsel, for me, the case turns in large part on this: Page 17 of the red brief says, \"International law does not recognize corporate responsibility for the alleged offenses here\"; and the -- one of the -- the amicus brief for Chevron saying \"No other nation in the world permits its court to exercise universal civil jurisdiction over alleged extraterritorial human rights abuses to which the nation has no connection.\" And in reading through the briefs, I was trying to find the best authority you have to refute that proposition, or are you going to say that that proposition is irrelevant?",
  "And it's -- it involves your whole argument, of course.",
  "But in -- in the area of international criminal law, which is just analogous, I recognize, there is a distinction made between individuals and corporations.",
  "But I agree that we can assume that Filartiga is a binding and important precedent, it’s the Second Circuit. But in that case, the only place they could sue was in the United States. He was an individual. He was walking down the streets of New York, and the victim saw him walking down the streets of New York and brought the suit. In this case, the corporations have residences and presence in many other countries where they have much more -- many more contacts than here.",
  "But you go much -- you go much further. Suppose an American corporation commits human trafficking with U.S. citizens in the United States. Under your view, the U.S. corporation could be sued in any country in the world, and it would -- and that would have no international consequences. We don't look to the international consequences at all. That's -- that's the view of the Government of the United States, as I understand.",
  "Can you tell me why --",
  "Can you tell me why you think they did that? I mean, for us, the -- respondeat superior is so simple. Why isn’t it a big deal in international law?",
  "Well --",
  "-- I wonder if you don't concede away too much when you say, well, there's a difference in substance and -- and remedy and questions of jury trial, damages, and so forth. That's domestic. Those were the concerns that the U.K. and the Netherlands addressed in their brief as saying why corporations shouldn't be liable for acts committed on foreign -- foreign territories. Those -- that was the whole reasoning of -- of the U.K. brief.",
  "But the Chief Justice's question was why did Congress do that? What were the reasons for that?",
  "Can you tell me -- I'm curious to know, if other States have provisions like the Barrett Law and they're concerned about this, can they provide in the initial documents a -- a promise that there will be no forgiveness, so that there would be a contract clause sort of argument against what happened here? In other words -- and if we could explore that for just a minute, I'm going to ask what it is that you thought constituted a promise in this case.",
  "And maybe not a promise in the contract sense.",
  "On the other aspect of my case, do you think other States could provide protection against this, in the event you do not prevail here, and -- and put in the documents that it is understood that a condition for your approving of this, these sewers, will be that there will be no forgiveness?",
  "Would that then be enforceable under the contract clause, do you think?",
  "Give you a warning?",
  "So, I think maybe if you prevail in this opinion, we should say the principle we are adopting in this case is: Don't trust the government.",
  "But you don't -- you don't -­",
  "You don't dispute that the city would have that option if we rule against you.",
  "Just not to forgive the unpaid balances. The city has the option, I assume.",
  "That's a -- that's a big difference. In one case, there's an expectation; in the other case, there isn't.",
  "But that just -­",
  "That just underscores the promise of the State -- or the city that all owners will be treated equally. That just underscores the point that that was the understanding and the commitment.",
  "Well, why is that -- why is that a big deal for us? I mean, that's the law. You get your -- your choice.",
  "What do you do with the hypothetical about the income tax and the sales tax? So, you don't pay any income tax if the sales tax had gone into effect.",
  "Would you tell me if -- if the Capato twins are both found to be -- be children within the meaning of the Act, will they meet the dependency or the deemed dependency requirements? Or is that a back-up argument that you have? Or --",
  "You don't have a position on that here? Or -- you want that to be elaborated more by the agency?",
  "What have we said is the standard for fines?",
  "What have we said with reference to a jury trial when fines are involved? Does it have to be a substantial fine or do we have a word that we use?",
  "But this was in the context where the entire defense of the corporation was consistent with what the indictment said. It was between the dates on or about, and there -- it would be very strange under this evidence to think that it was only there for 1 day, when it was spilled and they came back. And so, that just doesn't make any sense.",
  "I think there's -- that's just more a sense of background. I do think we have to reach the issue you -- you present as if it were just -- as if there were no evidence.",
  "But I -- like Justice Ginsburg, I was very surprised the government didn't allege -- didn't stress waiver here. You didn't submit an instruction?",
  "If you were to prevail, I -- I think it would be a rather simple matter for the parties to frame an instruction: We find the defendant guilty and that the pollutant was retained for X days, much of what they do in a drug case. That's one way to do it. Could the government do it by the indictment? Could it indict alternatively, indict on count 1 for 10 days, count 2 for 50 days, or something like that?",
  "Maybe -- is that the way it often works or --",
  "Well, that's why I am surprised the government waived it, and I thought that's what the evidence showed anyway. But that's not before us. That's not the way the case is presented here.",
  "And that makes it clear to you that there's no overlap between property and liberty, so that no matter how much of your property are taken and what circumstances, it's just property; there's no liberty involved?",
  "But you want -- want us to write as part of that decision that no matter how great the fine, liberty is not involved?",
  "Liberty in the sense of what the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth amendment say.",
  "So, you're saying it would be unprincipled for us to say -- or at least unsupported for us to say -- that the sentence cannot be mandatory, but that in some cases, it might still be imposed.",
  "If you take that off the table, then you leave us with nothing but saying that the sentence is never permitted or that it's always permitted.",
  "That's difficult because the statistics show there are 2300 prisoners now under sentence of -- with life without parole for juvenile murders and they're -- that were committed under 18; 2300 nationwide.",
  "So, it's very difficult to assess your answer to Justice Alito that, oh, the legislatures don't know about this.",
  "If we can focus on the mandatory aspect of the case, I think -- I know you'd prefer a more general rule -- it may be that we have to have your general rule. I'm not sure. If I'm the trial judge, and I have to determine whether or not I'm going to give life without parole, and it's discretionary, what -- what do I look at? Are -- can I get social scientists to come in and tell me what the chances of rehabilitation are? Are there -- are there statistics? Now, we have some quite compelling stories of rehabilitation in this case. I don't know if they're isolated; I don't know where they are in the statistical universe of how often rehabilitation is -- is demonstrated and is real. What do I look at? What's a judge supposed to do?",
  "Well, again, it seems you're just forcing us into a -- a bipolar position. We're either going to say that you can't prevail at all or that everyone under 18 is -- cannot get life without parole. I don't see this middle course --",
  "-- which you seem to have abandoned, and you can't tell me how a judge would apply it if we -- if we chose not to abandon it.",
  "Life without parole is the minimum?",
  "That's also -- that's also the maximum because there could be no death penalty.",
  "Are juries instructed that life without parole is a necessary consequence of their decision? I suppose a defense attorney could argue it.",
  "I would think so.",
  "In the -- in the Petitioner's briefs, the idea of deterrence kind of drops by the way side. Have there been any studies that show that there is a deterrence value? I remember in Roper, there was actually discussion among the young people before they committed the crime as to whether or not they could get the penalty. It was actually right there in the record. Does the State rely on the deterrence component of the punishment here?",
  "Is it retribution?",
  "Retribution, of course, is related to personal culpability. We said that in Tison, and that loops back into the minor problem.",
  "Are you aware of any statistics that give us some quantitative sense as to how many juveniles after years and years of prison show significant rehabilitation? Do we know anything about that?",
  "If the judge were to determine under a rule that the sentence can't be mandatory whether or not life should be imposed, what would be the sorts of factors that he would look at, or do you think those are just too ineffable, too imprecise to be considered?",
  "They're the standard sorts of mitigating circumstances that we see in capital cases, you think?",
  "What -- what are the factors the judges and prosecutors use in making that determination?",
  "But -- but if you submit that as a justification for your scheme, why couldn't those same factors be applied to the judge -- by the sentencing judge after the conviction? In other words, all of the -- all of the discretion is up front before the conviction.",
  "I guess my point is, if the concern is that -- that we have too indefinite standards, too few specifics to guide the judge in determining whether there should be a life sentence, the same criticism could apply to the determination to send him -- put him in the adult system at the outset.",
  "I assume discretion is guided by certain standards, or it's no discretion at all. So, there are standards.",
  "How many commutations of life imprisonment sentences are ordered every year in Arkansas?",
  "From life sentences? From life without parole?",
  "My problem --",
  "-- is I can accept that formulation certainly for purposes of this case. I just don't see where in the opinion -- I have the opinion of the court of appeals -- it focused on the wrong test. It didn't use the magic words, and it started out with let's look at the big picture, and it said, well, here's the defense he elected to put on, and this is a tough sell because. But then it quotes what happens with the jury. It -- and it -- and it ends its analysis for -- saying: We -- this evidence would have moved the jury to convict Vasquez without a nudge from anything it heard in the government's case. I just -- I just don't see that you have supported your theory by what the -- by what the court says.",
  "Where -- where is that statement? Where is that statement?",
  "Yes.",
  "But -- but in the context of the opinion -- and this was my first question -- they then proceed to analyze -- and that's toward the very end of its discussion -- what happened in this particular case. And it concludes, from this evidence we believe -- \"This evidence we believe would have moved the jury to convict.\"",
  "Is your argument something like this? Let's assume there are 10 pieces of evidence. Evidence 1 through 9 are properly admitted. Evidence item 10 is (a) wrongfully admitted and (b) so prejudicial that that's all the jury looked at. There is a substantial likelihood of that. I think this is your argument: If the jury was so obsessed, focused, transfixed by item 10, which was improperly admitted, what would happen if we concluded that this jury in this case on these facts, if they had looked at 1 through 9, would have convicted? What result?",
  "We're not only saying it's possible to convict, but that likely, probably would have happened.",
  "No, my hypothetical is that the court of appeals says that if the jury had looked at 1 through 9, which was properly admitted before them in this trial, they would have convicted, likely. Now, we -- then the hypothetical is: We don't think they did because this item was so prejudicial that all they looked -- that's all they looked at. Is that what your argument is? It seems to me that's stronger than the argument you're making. I'm not sure even that works for you.",
  "Suppose you have a case in which, after the verdict of guilty, there's a motion for a new trial, and it's being heard by the trial judge, and the trial judge said: I now acknowledge that this court committed error in introducing item 10 in evidence. And the court remembers that when this came into evidence, the courtroom was quiet, the jury was transfixed, jurors were weeping. This was the high point of the trial. That's wrong for the judge to say. All he has to say is, well, I have to ask whether items 9 -- 1 through 9 would have been in, and some other jury, a rational jury -- so, that's the end of it. Judges do the -- do what I suggested all the time.",
  "Suppose -- suppose the judge concludes that both this jury that I had and some hypothetical rational jury would have been so focused on this evidence that that's all they would have looked at, but if they had looked at 1 through 9, the admissible evidence, they would still have found guilt. Is that -- is that what you're -- is that --",
  "-- a proper application of the -- of the framework?",
  "The Chief Justice allowed me to ask one question. Could I amend your statement so that you would say a rational jury in all the circumstances of this case, given what this jury heard, would have?",
  "There's just a little bit of noise in the courtroom, and I'm -- I have a little bit of difficulty hearing your very opening statement.",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Does your rule apply regardless of the degree of animus that the agent is alleged to have had as to the particular view being expressed?",
  "You might apply the same immunity for selective enforcement based on race?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I'm aware of the reservation in Whren. Why should there be a difference in the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and First Amendment speech?",
  "Why will the administrative remedies rule not be applicable, exhaustion rule not be applicable?",
  "Well, but courts apply the exhaustion rule. I mean, I know you've studied this. I'm just not following it. Why couldn't the court say, well, you haven't exhausted your remedies; no injunction?",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "It's easier to talk about this case if we just forget the words \"for the purpose of restraining assessment or collection.\" In a sense, that brings the jurisdictional question and Justice Breyer's question together. It seems to me -- maybe you could just comment on that language. Is that sort of language usually contained in a jurisdictional provision? I mean, you often don't know the purpose of a suit until after the thing is under way. I can see it with malicious prosecution and some civil rights cases. Does it strike you as somewhat unusual to have this provision in a jurisdictional sense?",
  "Yes. Excuse me.",
  "That is correct, although in the refund context, you have the sovereign immunity problem, in which we presume that that has not been waived.",
  "But you're correct on - -",
  "The language is quite parallel.",
  "Yes.",
  "Don't you want to know the answer?",
  "But you indicated -- there was a discussion earlier about why does the government really care, they have competent attorneys, et cetera. But -- and you began your argument by saying it would be very troubling to say that it's not jurisdictional. I'd like you to comment on that. It's not for us to tell a party what's in its best interests. It would seem to me that there might be some instances in which the government would want to litigate the validity of a tax right away and would want to waive. But you say it's -- that's not true; that it's very troubling.",
  "Can you create Congress -- commerce order to regulate it?",
  "Could you help -- would help me with this? Assume for the moment -- you may disagree. Assume for the moment that this is unprecedented. This is a step beyond what our cases have allowed, the affirmative duty to act to go into commerce. If that is so, do you not have a heavy burden of justification? I understand that we must presume laws are constitutional, but, even so, when you are changing the relation of the individual to the government in this, what we can stipulate is, I think, a unique way, do you not have a heavy burden of justification to show authorization under the Constitution?",
  "Well, then the question is whether or not there are any limits on the Commerce Clause. Can you identify for us some limits on the Commerce Clause?",
  "But why not? If --",
  "If Congress says that interstate commerce is affected, isn't, according to your view, that the end of the analysis?",
  "I'm not sure which way it cuts, if the Congress has alternate means. Let's assume that it could use the tax power to raise revenue and to just have a national health service, single payer. How does that factor into our analysis? In one sense, it can be argued if this is what the government is doing, it ought to be honest about the power that it's using and use the correct power. On the other hand, it means that since the Court can do it any way -- Congress can do it any way, we give it a certain amount of latitude. I'm not sure which way the argument goes.",
  "But what Congress --",
  "Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "But the -- the reason this is concerning is because it requires the individual to do an affirmative act. In the law of torts, our tradition, our law has been that you don't have the duty to rescue someone if that person is in danger. The blind man is walking in front of a car, and you do not have a duty to stop him, absent some relation between you. And there's some severe moral criticisms of that rule, but that's generally the rule. And here the government is saying that the Federal Government has a duty to tell the individual citizen that it must act. And that is different from what we have in previous cases.",
  "And that changes the relationship of the Federal Government to the individual in a very fundamental way.",
  "Is the government's argument this -- and maybe I won't state it accurately. It is true that the noninsured young adult is, in fact, an actuarial reality insofar as our allocation of health services, insofar as the way health insurance companies figure risk. That person who is sitting at home in his or her living room doing nothing is an actuarial reality that can and must be measured for health service purposes; is that their argument?",
  "But they're in the market in the sense that they're creating a risk that the market must account for.",
  "I agree -- I agree that that's what's happening here.",
  "And the Government tells us that's because the insurance market is unique. And in the next case, it'll say the next market is unique. But I think it is true that if most questions in life are matters of degree, in the insurance and health care world, both markets -- stipulate two markets -- the young person who is uninsured is uniquely proximately very close to affecting the rates of insurance and the costs of providing medical care in a way that is not true in other industries. That's my concern in the case.",
  "But I'm still not sure, what is the test -- and this was a colloquy you had with Justice Scalia with the Cornhusker hypothetical. I need to know what standard you're asking me to apply. Is it whether as a rational matter the separate parts could still function, or does it focus on the intent of the Congress? If you -- suppose you had party A wants proposal number 1; party B wants proposal number 2. Completely unrelated. One is airline rates; the other is milk regulation. And we -- and they decide them together. The procedural rules are these have to be voted on as one. They are both passed. Then one is declared unconstitutional. The other can operate completely independently. Now, we know that Congress would not have intended to pass one without the other. Is that the end of it, or is there some different test? Because we don't want to go into legislative history, that's intrusive, so we ask whether or not an objective -- as an objective rational matter, one could function without -- I still don't know what the test is that we're supposed to apply. And this is the same question as Justice Scalia asked. Could you give me some help on that?",
  "And which one -- and what test do you suggest that we follow if we want to clarify our jurisprudence?",
  "And that objective test is what?",
  "But there's no Article III jurisdictional problem in Justice Alito's hypothetical, that this is a remedial exercise of the Court's power to explain the consequences of its judgment in this case.",
  "But when you say \"judicial restraint\" - -",
  "When you say \"judicial restraint,\" you are echoing the earlier premise that it increases the judicial power if the judiciary strikes down other provisions of the Act. I suggest to you it might be quite the opposite. We would be exercising the judicial power, if one Act was -- one provision was stricken and the others remained, to impose a risk on insurance companies that Congress had never intended. By reason of this Court, we would have a new regime that Congress did not provide for, did not consider. That, it seems to me, can be argued at least to be a more extreme exercise of judicial power than to strike - - than striking the whole.",
  "I just don't accept the premise.",
  "But I still don't understand where you are with the answer to Justice Alito's question. Assume that there is a -- a substantial probability that the 350 billion plus 350 billion equals 7 is going to be cut in half if the individual mandate is stricken. Assume there is a significant possibility of that. Is it within the proper exercise of this Court's function to impose that kind of risk? Can we say that the Congress would have intended that there be that kind of risk?",
  "But isn't that -- isn't that the point, then, why we should just assume that it is not severable?",
  "If we -- if we lack the competence to even assess whether there is a risk, then isn't this an awesome exercise of judicial power?",
  "To say we're doing something and we're not telling you what the consequences might be?",
  "I don't quite understand about the employers. You're saying Congress mandated employers to buy something that Congress itself has not contemplated? I don't understand that.",
  "Based on the assumption that the cost of those policies would be lowered by certain provisions which are, by hypothesis -- we're not sure -- by hypothesis, are in doubt.",
  "But you're saying we have -- we have the expertise to make the inquiry you want us to make, i.e., the guaranteed issue, but not the expertise that Justice Alito's question suggests we must make.",
  "I just don't understand your position.",
  "So, do you want us to write an opinion saying we have concluded that there is an insignificant risk of a substantial adverse effect on the insurance companies -- that's our economic conclusion -- and therefore not severable? That's what you want me to say?",
  "Is that the real Congress or a hypothetical Congress?",
  "I thought you were going to say this statute is your money and your life.",
  "If the inevitable consequence of your position was that the Federal Government could just do this on its own, the Federal Government could have Medicaid, Medicare, and these insurance regulations -- assuming that's true -- then how are the interests of federalism concerned? How are the interests of federalism concerned if, in Florida or Texas or some of the other objecting States, there are huge Federal bureaucracies doing what this bill allows the State bureaucracies to do? I know you've thought about that. I'd just like your answer.",
  "And just a small point, and please correct me if I'm wrong. It -- does this Act not require States to keep at the present level their existing Medicaid expenditure? So, some States may have been more generous than others in Medicaid, but this Act freezes that so the States can't go back. Or am I incorrect?",
  "I suppose one test could be -- I just don't see that it would be very workable -- is whether or not it's so big that accountability is lost, that it is not clear to the citizen that the State or the Federal Government is administering the program, even though it's a State administrator.",
  "And I think that's unworkable.",
  "In your view -- in your view, does federalism require that there be a relatively clear line of accountability for political acts?",
  "Is that subsumed in the coercion test, or is that an independent test?",
  "Yes.",
  "But do you agree that there still is inherent, implicit in the idea of federalism, necessary for the idea of federalism, that there be a clear line of accountability so the citizen knows that it's the Federal or the State government who should be held responsible for their program?",
  "And does coercion relate to that, or is that a separate --",
  "-- is that a separate doctrine?",
  "Well, but I think the answer would be that the State wants to preserve its integrity, its identity, its responsibility in the Federal system.",
  "But the -- but the point is -- but the point is --",
  "-- there's no real -- there's no realistic choice. There's no real choice. And Congress does not in effect allow for an out -- opt out. We just know that.",
  "And it's substantial.",
  "I recognize the problem with that test.",
  "Even though they're now frozen in, per our earlier discussion, to a large extent.",
  "Of course, they have to do so by hiring a very substantial number of more employees. There will be State employees. There'll be substantial State administrative expenses that are not reimbursed.",
  "And these are all -- these are all within the Fair Labor Standards Act?",
  "Are there any occupations or pursuits that are not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act because -- on the rationale that they are out, that they are unsupervised, and so forth. In other words, if you were arguing the case of the Respondent, would you -- would you have any close analogies to areas that are not -- that are exempt; in other words, they wouldn't be salesmen, but there'd be some other classifications to fit them in?",
  "And it's gone on for 70 years, and you're -- and instead of doing a regulation, amended regulation, as Justice Breyer indicates, you're filing amicus briefs quietly in different -- different courts. It seems to me that's not nearly as fair or straightforward or as candid as -- as an agency ought to be.",
  "What is -- what is this commitment? Is the commitment in writing?",
  "Would it be lawful to make it -- put it in writing?",
  "Would it be lawful to put it in writing?",
  "That sounds to me it's not a commitment, unless the doctor says: Well, I'll look at this, this is interesting; I'll go home and read your material, I'll think about it. Is that -- is that a --",
  "And that's why -- and that's why it's not in writing.",
  "Well, let me ask you this, and I'm not well versed in all -- in all of the specifics, but my understanding is that the Federal Government has expressed new concerns, has new regulations, new rules about these outside sales. Does that mean that the nature of the work has changed in the last 5 or 10 years, so that the 70 years we are talking about is not relevant? Would you comment on that?",
  "What's the case that I cite if this opinion is written the way you -- you propose, and the -- this Court says, well, this has been 70 years, or maybe in 10 years if you take the new regulations as setting a new regime, and the Department has never made an objection. And, therefore, it follows that the Department's interpretation is implausible or improper, and then I cite some case from our Court. What -- how do I write this?",
  "Well, I'd like one.",
  "But the district court here made a finding -- this is at 42a of the appendix for the Petitioners: \"Sales volume is directly and exclusively driven by the number of prescriptions written by physicians, and plaintiffs' job was to encourage such prescriptions.\"",
  "Well, on your statement that the -­",
  "-- one Congress cannot bind a later Congress, do you mean we're not supposed to look at 109? We're not supposed to look at the Dictionary Act?",
  "So, then -- so, then the fact that 109 is on the books is relevant. And -- and it's not a question of one Congress binding the other. It's a question of what the second Congress did.",
  "Well, so then we -- we ignore the Dictionary Act?",
  "And we ignore 109?",
  "Well, why doesn't it -­ why doesn't that bring us right back to what 109 says?",
  "But the Government is arguing and the Petitioner is arguing for a uniform rule, the rule that the time of sentencing controls.",
  "So that uniformity doesn't quite answer it, unless I misunderstood -­",
  "But Justice Kagan's question concerning what interest is served by your position has particular force when we're talking about the sentencing judge. The hardest thing -- as we know in the judicial system, one of the hardest things is sentencing. And you're saying that a sentencing judge who knows the law has been changed, who knows the law has been criticized, is nevertheless bound to determine that it's fair for this -- for this person to be sentenced to the longer term. That's a very difficult -­",
  "-- position to put the judge in. Now, I would -­",
  "Go ahead.",
  "All within the -- all within the dollar amount that was specified by the Congress in the \"not to exceed\" language.",
  "I had exactly the same question. The \"not to exceed\" language, which I think is the word, \"not to exceed,\" hasn't been mentioned by you yet because -- maybe you haven't had time.",
  "But -- but I thought that was what Judge Dyk said --",
  "-- was the critical -- the difference between this and even the Cherokee case.",
  "And so my question is -- is the same as Justice Ginsburg's. Isn't a principal part of your argument that this contract said not to exceed, and then the sums differ from year to year, but let's say $95 million?",
  "When the Congressional Budget Office, or whatever agency it is that figures out whether there's a deficit and, if so, of how much, do they look at \"not to exceed,\" and do they take that amount seriously? Or --",
  "But the -- but the position of the Respondents is that it makes no difference.",
  "So Congress is saying nothing at all.",
  "I take it the Respondents' position is that the contracting officer says, now, this is going to go over the not to exceed amount, but not to worry, just sue us under the Judgment -- just sue us under the Judgment Act.",
  "So you think now -- you say you don't want us to mention \"not to exceed\" in our opinion --",
  "-- other than to say that it's irrelevant?",
  "Does the Redbook talk about \"not to exceed\" as being any different from general appropriations?",
  "Does the Redbook --",
  "Does the Redbook refer to \"not to exceed\" -- the \"not to exceed\" language?",
  "Does the Redbook have -- refer to the \"not to exceed\" language?",
  "So, in your view, if the tribe comes to the government, and they say, look, we've been looking at what you've done with the other tribes, you've appropriated $95 million, and the appropriation says \"not to exceed $95 million,\" but go ahead and make this contract with us anyway, no one cares. And you say, go ahead and make it. Right?",
  "That's your -- that's your position, isn't it?",
  "Suppose you did know. Suppose the tribe knew that the 95 million -- let's assume that that's the not to exceed amount -- had already been obligated. Could the tribe then go ahead and make the government -- a contract with the government, and would the government have to make that contract, in your view?",
  "Is it your argument that the answer to that is yes?",
  "Isn't this more specific language than the general language? Doesn't this specific language, \"not to exceed,\" supersede the general obligation to make the contract? Otherwise, it's meaningless. The \"not to exceed language\" is meaningless.",
  "You say it's meaningless.",
  "You just go to the Judgment Fund --",
  "-- which makes it meaningless.",
  "On what date was it -- on what date was it clear that the use would be gaming? There is some suggestion in the briefs that, oh, well, it could be light industry and it was zoned for economic use generally. At what point was it acknowledged by all that this would be for gaming? At the very outset?",
  "At the very outset.",
  "Well, then your -- your argument is just one of timing and not the fact that the reliance is on the -- is on the QTA. The tribe says, isn't it ironic that if you really have a claim in the land as a property owner, you can't sue under the QTA, and this person is much further removed. Well, that's because he has a different ground for relief. That's all we're talking about.",
  "So the fact that the QTA suddenly, deus ex machina, pops onto the scene doesn't mean that it -- that that changes his -- his ground for relief that he's -- that he's relying upon. His ground of relief has always been the same, APA.",
  "What were the provisions, if any, in the Indian Reorganization Act itself that show a concern for the kind of standing that you're alleging here? It seems to me you're talking about environmental effects and so forth under the Indian Gaming Act, but yet your primary suit is under the Indian Reorganization Act. So I don't see -- I understand how that might give you standing, but how does it give you a cause of action for relief under the Indian Reorganization Act?",
  "The Indian Reorganization Act, just to help pursue the question a little bit further, has a provision about the public interest, but not in the section that you're relying on. It doesn't say anything about the public interest.",
  "463 does, but you're going under 465.",
  "What is the specific provision of the IRA that you rely on? You -- do you go back to 463? Because there's nothing in 465 that answers your -- this question, I don't think.",
  "That's helpful. Just a different question, going back to what -- Justice Alito's question. It does seem that we may be wasting our time. I'm not suggesting that the State -- that the case is moot, but you did wait for some 3 years before you brought this suit. The building was built. It seems to me there's a considerable laches problem. I suppose that's just not before us.",
  "But that was under the MichGO suit, not yours.",
  "Oh, your suit had been filed at that point.",
  "Mr. Miller, one -- one question, if -- if I may. The government takes the position -- at least this was the way the Respondent puts it -- that it can basically moot their action by turning this into a quiet title action just by taking title. And let's assume that that's one characterization of your position. And the Respondent on the other hand says, oh, well, this is an APA action, we can -- we can wait forever, at least for 6 years. Is there some midway position that the government can't moot the case too soon, that it must wait a reasonable time? Or is there no basis in the statute or in the cases for that position to hold?",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "Well, in other words, you're -- you're sticking with your position. You say you can basically moot a suit at any point you want just by taking title, so you're -- you're not accepting any qualification to that proposition.",
  "All or nothing? Okay.",
  "Suppose it takes two weeks to make that determination, can the alien be held by the state for that whole period of time - -",
  "-- just under Section 6?",
  "What -- what would be the standard? You're -- you're the attorney for the -- the alien, he -- they are going to hold him for two weeks until they figure out whether this is a removable offense. And you say, under the Fourth Amendment, you cannot hold for -- what? More than a reasonable time or - -",
  "But, I think - -",
  "I think Justice Scalia's question was the -- was the broader one, just as a theoretical matter. Can we say -- or can -- do you take the position that a state must accept, within its borders, a person who is illegally present under Federal law?",
  "And that is by reason of his alien - -",
  "Would you agree that -- would you accept, as a working hypothesis, that we can begin with the general principle that the Hines v. Davidowitz language controls here, and we're going to ask our principal -- our primary function is to determine whether, under the circumstances of this particular case, Arizona's law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress? Is -- is that an acceptable test from your standpoint?",
  "But -- but then the government on this section is going to come and say, well, there may be -- this must be -- this -- the enforcement of this statute, as Arizona describes it, will be in considerable tension with our -- with our basic approach; isn't that what I'm going to hear from the government?",
  "Would -- double prosecutions be -- suppose that an alien were prosecuted under Federal law for violating, basically, the terms of 3. Could the states then prosecute him as well?",
  "But the hypothetical is that that's all the legislature is doing.",
  "Now, are you talking about 3 now or - -",
  "-- or does this argument relate to 2 as well?",
  "Suppose -- suppose - - well, assume these are two hypothetical -- two hypothetical instances. First, the Federal government has said, we simply don't have the money or the resources to enforce our immigration laws the way we wish. We wish we could do so, but we don't have the money or the resources. That's the first -- just hypothetical.",
  "Also -- also hypothetical is that the state of Arizona has -- has a massive emergency with social disruption, economic disruption, residents leaving the state because of flood of immigrants. Let's just assume those two things. Does that give the state of Arizona any powers or authority or legitimate concerns that any other state wouldn't have?",
  "And can they go to their legislature and say, we're concerned about this, and ask the legislature to enact laws to correct this problem?",
  "So you're saying the government has a legitimate interest in not enforcing its laws?",
  "What effects that commenced in the United States or that are closely related to the United States exist between what happened here and what happened in Nigeria?",
  "And just to make it clear - -",
  "-- it's your position -- and I believe it's the position of the United States; I'm not sure -- that if a U.S. corporation commits an international law violation in the United States, that U.S. corporation can be sued in any court in the world?",
  "But then -- but the way I stated the hypothetical, or the proposition, that is your beginning proposition -- although there might be some defenses. But as a beginning matter, that they can be sued in any country in any court in the world.",
  "Well, we assume - -",
  "-- we assume a violation of international law - -",
  "-- as part of the hypothetical.",
  "Well, you know, Justice Alito can protect his own hypothetical, but it seems to me you're walking away from it. The question as I understood it assumed that there is a violation of international law.",
  "But that proceeding with this particular case will, because of some other reasons - -",
  "-- involve the United States or its citizens living abroad in serious complications with a foreign Government. That's not a political question.",
  "There's political consequences, but that's the whole point.",
  "There's -- there's -- you can't cite a case -- but maybe you can, please do if you can -- that this is part of the political question doctrine.",
  "Well, that answer would apply if you were answering Justice Ginsburg's question in the affirmative by saying that there is 1331 jurisdiction, but you need not go so far, given Sosa.",
  "Well, maybe it's just history and background, but I would really like you to answer Justice Ginsburg's question. Suppose we had granted cert in Filartiga before Congress acted? What -- under your position, what should have been the result? I think that was the purport of her question, and I would appreciate an answer to it.",
  "But in Filartiga, why wasn't there an aiding and abetting? I think it was pretty clear. He probably was working for the government, which is even worse.",
  "But -- and I am interested in Justice Ginsburg's question.",
  "Just assume we think the Second Circuit was right, pre-congressional action under the Alien Tort Statute. Is -- is there any way in which we can use the principle of extraterritoriality to rule in your favor?",
  "Well, but in -- in your brief, I really lost count, but I think it's six times on the first two pages, you talk about indefinitely moored. Now, the facts are in dispute, and we're not quite clear of the facts, but let's assume that this magnificent structure is -- which was mercifully destroyed -- let's assume that it was attached to the dock by a rope, a garden hose and an extension cord, and that it could leave within 30 minutes notice. Is that indefinitely moored? And if the answer is yes, is that because of subjective intent of the owner?",
  "But suppose - -",
  "-- you know the law school game, suppose it was moved every month.",
  "That would be indefinitely moored, in your view?",
  "But it was still -- it was still tied to the land with roads and ramps and so forth. Here you've got the hose and the extension cord and the rope.",
  "And it seems -- and it seems to me, suppose you -- you want us to make some universal definition of we know what a floating home is. Suppose this -- suppose there were -- another owner of a structure like this, and it moved to a different slip every week to get more shade or more wind or something. Then that would be different?",
  "And suppose it moved - - suppose it moved up and down the canal to get better or worse weather during different seasons.",
  "Well, I have the same problem Justice Kagan says. The whole point is that it can move. That's the whole -- that's the reason you have it.",
  "On the first question, purpose or function, what did they know that we can't know by looking at this picture and listening to these arguments?",
  "I mean, I would be willing to stipulate they are better at this than we are, but let's -- let's assume.",
  "I want to be fair to the Court of Appeals, well, now, you tell us what the purpose and function is.",
  "Don't we know that?",
  "We -- we want I suppose to give the courts of appeals a test that works. I -- see if this is, sums up your argument, or your position. You look to see the objective characteristic, the physical capacity of the -- of the structure, and then you look not to purpose but to its objective function: Does it carry goods under the statute. And then I suppose you could under that say that this is a vessel, but that this presumption is overcome if it's permanently moored in a way the Evansville dredge was. Is -- is that your argument?",
  "Even if it's rather permanently moored with a, with a -- like the Intrepid on the Hudson River - -",
  "With about -- aircraft carrier. But it's really fixed in there with regular walkways and so forth. Very -- it would cause a lot of work in order to move it.",
  "I've probably led a charmed life, but I've never heard of mixed case until this matter came before us. And I was -- I suppose you have to adopt the phrase, but the statute 7703 just say \"cases,\" \"cases of discrimination,\" which is what this is. We don't usually think of cases that we call a discrimination case based on whether or not it contains other issues. It's a case.",
  "I mean, I think that helps you.",
  "But is this a money-mandated statute?",
  "Well, we can continue and probably should talk about this broad theory that you want us to adopt. Really, in this case, the court of appeals in -- in the state system cited Nesler, and Nesler in turn cited, at page 104 of the petition appendix, a Supreme Court case you don't even -- you say citation, you don't even give -- but it -- it's -- it's the Supreme Court case, United States v. Wood, written by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes. And it seems to me it’s very clearly ties its state analysis to the Federal Constitution and a Sixth Amendment discussion in Wood. So it seems to me that you're -- you have a very strong argument that they did adjudicate the Federal claim anyway. I know you want us to maybe reach the bigger issue, but -- and your brief almost downplays it -- but it seems to me pretty clear that you have the argument, that you don't strongly make, although you don't, by any means, abandon it, that -- that here the state law was tied to the Federal standard, and the Federal standard was the basis for the entire jurisprudence.",
  "Well, suppose that the --",
  "Well, I suppose -- I suppose the broader rule, if you took $28.52 out of the State's judicial budget and bought them all a stamp which just says, we have considered and rejected all constitutional claims, then there would be no problem?",
  "Well, I have to -- I mean, this takes us into the merits, which is really interesting, but I -- we probably shouldn't go there, but, as long as we're there for a minute, I agree with Justice Ginsburg. I've never seen a procedure like this. And I looked -- I looked at this -- the Federal cases, Brown and Thomas, that the Cleveland court cited. Those -- and Wood was voir dire, was not mid-jury. I just hope this doesn't happen with much regularity. And the fact that the trial judge is upset, that's the reason that you should leave the jury alone, it seems to me. I think it's very troublesome.",
  "Of course, again this is fact-specific to the case. It doesn't address the rule that we want to address and was the reason for us taking the case, but 104a, the State court, State appellate court, cites the United States v. Wood, and -- and it also cites Cleveland, and Cleveland had three circuit court cases, all of which involved the Sixth Amendment. It seems to me that the Federal constitutional claim was intertwined with and -- and controlling of the procedural matters that the court discussed. I just don't see the case is here even on your theory.",
  "I guess what we're asking you is, how do you define the baseline of protected expectations for the property?",
  "You've indicated, I think, in your brief that one year won't do it. This was six or seven years. If that's a baseline of expectations, the Government cannot change that, even if it thinks that there is a higher and -- and more urgent priority in protecting some other land?",
  "But my question is how do you define the baseline that gives a legitimate expectation, if the Corps of Engineers -- did not happen in this case, but in the hypothetical case -- makes the finding that there is a more urgent and -- and a higher priority for other lands, and it changes its policy? It cannot do that?",
  "Well, what you're saying is that it can't make that change without paying, right?",
  "Now suppose, at the very outset of the dam, the -- the Government says, we've got to put this water someplace, we're going to put it on the left bank, not the right bank. That's not a taking as of that time - -",
  "-- if the land was always flooded anyway on the right?",
  "But what I want is the definition of the operable baseline that we can use in order to define whether or not there has been a taking.",
  "Well, the question is what do we say to the circuit? What do you want us to tell the circuit to do on remand?",
  "And the only difference in that formulation and this case is that it was for seven years and not permanent? Is that your - -",
  "Well, the hypothetical is, suppose it doesn't. Suppose that there's some land that's up -- that's fairly far upstream from the main reservoir, but it's flooded once every other year.",
  "Your -- but your position seems to be that if it's downstream, somehow it's not the Government. There's a series of administrative actions and it's not really the Government's water. It's like -- it's like the old moral refuge that the rocket designers take: You know, I make the rockets go up; where -- where they come down is not my concern.",
  "How -- how would you define that standard? What standard do you suggest?",
  "And if it isn't solved after 9 months, then what?",
  "If competency cannot be restored?",
  "Based on the record.",
  "Well, is he under duty to raise it as soon as possible, at the risk of forfeiture if he doesn't? That's the import of the question.",
  "Well, that's why I'm asking.",
  "Well, why -- why shouldn't the rule be that an indefinite stay is -- is never necessary? You just proceed based on the evidence you have? Sometimes, we have evidence where a witness is missing. We have to go on with the case. Then it could be open to argue in a later case that there was new evidence that was not available.",
  "What about the second part of -- of the equation? So, suppose that there's no stay, that the habeas proceeding is adjudicated against the petitioner. He then becomes competent and claims there's new evidence. Would -- would that be grounds to reopen, you think?",
  "And would the backstop be newly discovered evidence?",
  "Could -- could you help me with your discussion of 2244(b)? I have it in front of me. And the hypothetical was that he's incompetent, the claim is adjudicated, then he becomes competent, and he says now is there some new evidence, which could not have been discovered. I thought you told us that you not only have to have new evidence, but new law. That's not the way I read - -",
  "-- (b)(2)(B)(1), unless I misunderstood you.",
  "No, no, no.",
  "No, no. This says, \"or the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence,\" period.",
  "Yes?",
  "Yes?",
  "Yes, clear and convincing, that's true.",
  "But then -- but then you are fighting the -- the arguendo assumption. Let's assume that the Ford standard -- the standard for competence should be executed, is more lenient, less -- less forgiving than competence to assist counsel. Let's assume that. Then Justice Scalia has to be right. You've -- you've simply eliminated the Ford standard altogether.",
  "Am I -- am I -- is it correct that the petitioners in both cases -- pardon me, that the criminal defendants in both cases here, the Respondents, have all but conceded that there is no Constitutional basis for the right to competency during habeas, or am I overstating that?",
  "But once you concede the Constitutional point, so that there's no fundamental unfairness, then it seems to me that -- that you have all but given away your case.",
  "Well, it's fairness that's not fundamental -- or - -",
  "It's unfairness that's not fundamental.",
  "And this was -- and this was before the adoption of the plan.",
  "Could you comment on this -- and then I hope we can get back to Justice Alito's question. You argue that the University's race-conscious admission plan is not necessary to achieve a diverse student body because it admits so few people -- so few minorities. And I had trouble with that, reading the brief. I said, well, if it's so few, then what's the problem?",
  "Then -- let's assume - -",
  "-- that it resulted in the admission of many minorities. Then you'd come back and say, oh, well, this is -- this shows that we -- we were probably wrongly excluded. I - -",
  "I see an inconsistency here.",
  "Is it -- are you saying that you shouldn't impose this hurt or this injury, generally, for so little benefit; is -- is that the point?",
  "Well, perhaps you could summarize by saying -- by telling us, from your point of view, this plan fails strict scrutiny on one or two or both levels, A, because the objective is inappropriate or ill-defined, and, B, because of the implementation is defective. Which or both of those are you arguing?",
  "And in what respect does this plan fail strict scrutiny under either of those - - under both of those categories?",
  "So what you're saying is that what counts is race above all?",
  "Well, that's the necessary -- that's the necessary response to Justice Alito's question.",
  "You want underprivileged of a certain race and privileged of a certain race. So that's race.",
  "But the -- but the reason you're reaching for the privileged is so that members of that race who are privileged can be representative, and that's race. I just - -",
  "If I could, before we get to that.",
  "Suppose we -- that you, in your experience identify a numerical category a numerical standard, a numerical designation for critical mass: It's X percent. During the course of the admissions process, can the admissions officers check to see how close they are coming to this numerical - -",
  "You -- you cannot do that?",
  "But isn't that what happened in Grutter; it allowed that.",
  "So are you saying that Grutter is incorrect?",
  "I'm -- I'm asking whether or not you could do that. And if - -",
  "I just don't understand this argument. I thought that the whole point is that sometimes race has to be a tie-breaker and you are saying that it isn't. Well, then, we should just go away. Then -- then we should just say you can't use race, don't worry about it.",
  "It's -- it's a massive amount of conduct that -- that the statute contemplates? The statutory scheme -- I just didn't hear. I just didn't hear.",
  "Again, I didn't hear.",
  "They want to do it in every - -",
  "At the -- at the beginning of the State prosecution?",
  "All right.",
  "Would it -- would it be permissible -- I had the same question. Would it be permissible - -",
  "Or would you be back up here saying that this violates the statute?",
  "Do you have any statistics -- if you take the whole universe of convictions under the Georgia statute, what percentage of them are for these minor offenses and what are for the major? Do we have any handle on that at all?",
  "But you've answered Justice Kagan's question by -- she said, doesn't your own interpretation of this statute require the opposite result and -- or the -- the harsh result? And you say, well, suppose Congress wrote a statute this way. But that wasn't her question. The question is - -",
  "You -- you said that Congress could write a new statute. Of course, Congress could write a new statute, but what about this one?",
  "If you do not -- if you do not prevail in this case, can you simply solve this problem in the discretionary removal proceedings?",
  "You just say we're going to -- we're going to order you removed, unless you bring in evidence that this was a minor amount, period.",
  "Well, don't you think it's -- it's, under the law and under administrative practice, that it's an option available to you?",
  "Is the test that you propose that the injury -- I think your brief used the word imminent -- is another way of saying that -- is it unfair to characterize the government's position as saying that you're submitting that the injury must be certain?",
  "Well, let's assume - - let's assume for the moment that the lawyer would be - - that the lawyer would be injured if his communication with the client were intercepted, or at least that he would have standing to prove injury. Let's assume that for the moment. If that is an acceptable premise, assume that it is, are you saying that it has to be certain to occur? And another test is there's a reasonable likelihood, and then we get in the middle, is it a substantial likelihood. You have to say -- you say imminent.",
  "Certainly impending.",
  "Is it -- you were talking -- you wanted to say there's a cascade of inferences, I think was your phrase.",
  "You want to tell us that in your view these -- all these inference that we're required to go through, if the Respondents' theory is adopted, you were going to tell us about - -",
  "But you're -- you are saying that the government has obtained this extraordinarily wide-reaching power and we have extraordinary risks that face this country and the government's not going to use it. That's just, it - - it's hard for me to think that the government isn't using all of the powers at its command under the law - -",
  "-- in order to protect this country. And you -- you want to say: Oh, well, don't worry that it's not happening. There is another statute. That -- that's the problem I have with this line of argument.",
  "Well, it's Justice Kagan's hypothetical. The lawyer -- and I don't forget about the -- I think the ethics problem is, is a very substantial one. I think the lawyer would engage in malpractice if he talked on the telephone with some of these clients, given this statute.",
  "But it's still the reality. He still has to change his conduct.",
  "But both in Summers and Monsanto the government tells us: We knew that the governmental act was occurring, and then once we knew that, the question was substantial risk.",
  "The government argues in effect for -- what we might call it -- a common law adaptation of Bobbs-Merrill.",
  "We need to know about those hypotheticals in order to decide this case.",
  "You're aware of the fact that if we write an opinion with the -- with the rule that you propose, that we should, as a matter of common sense, ask about the consequences of that rule. And that's what we are asking.",
  "I mean, that just can't be a proposition that we can accept across the board. Nobody under that view has an interest in contraband in their home. The question is, can you find out the contraband? It's just a circular argument. And if -- and in the -- was it the Caballes case that talked about that, if I have the right name? That was where the contraband was visible; it was almost like the smoking gun falls out. Well, of course, there's no interest in the smoking gun when it falls out in front of you. So I just don't think that works.",
  "I just -- again, as I told Mr. Garre, I just can't accept that as the premise for the case. The argument we're having about whether there is a reasonable expectation in society generally, whether or not the police because of limited resources are not going to have -- that's all fine. But this idea that, oh, well, if there is contraband, then all the -- all the rules go out the window, that's just circular, and it won't work for me, anyway.",
  "Fine - -",
  "-- but don't ask me to write an opinion and say, oh, we're dealing with contraband here, so we don't need to worry about expectation of privacy. There is simply no support for that because Caballes cited Jacobsen, and Jacobsen was where the contraband fell out of the package and it was in plain view. So that just doesn't work, at least for me, in this case.",
  "Again, I don't think the cases go that far because those were cases in which the contraband -- Jacobsen -- was in plain view. Everybody knows that it falls out of the package. At that point, you don't have any - - What you're saying is, oh, well, if there is contraband in the house, then you have no legitimate expectation of privacy. That, for me, does not work.",
  "That's fine. We can talk about reasonable suspicion. That's all okay.",
  "That's your first reason and I don't want you to be deterred from giving us the second, but if we can concentrate on that for a minute. That seems to me a proposition that's equally unacceptable to what the government is saying, that you have no interest in contraband. The police often, when they have ordinary conversation with people, want to find out the details of what that person is doing, where the person lives, what goes on in the house. \"Hello, have you had a nice time at the - - at the park today? I see you're coming home with your children; is this where you live?\" This is all routine conversation that we always have in order to try to find out what people are doing, what they are like, where they live. So I -- I think the statement, and you - - you repeated it quite accurately from what you have at page 16 of your brief -- just goes too far. Our decisions \"establish that police action which reveals any detail an individual seeks to keep private is a search\" -- that is just a sweeping proposition that in my view, at least, cannot be accepted in this case. I think it's just too sweeping and wrong.",
  "Well, the police officer talked with somebody at the police station, or walking down the street about what their occupation is, do they work at home. They're -- they are trying to get information. That's perfectly legitimate.",
  "Well, then your broad statement simply does not work.",
  "Yes, I was going to ask for your second, your second point.",
  "How is that different from what Justice Breyer I think correctly indicated, our inquiry as to whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy? In a way, that's circular because if we say there is, then there is, if we say there isn't, then there isn't. But if we're looking at community values in general, isn't it a reasonable expectation of privacy?",
  "Let me ask this. I think I know what your answer would be. Suppose the policemen have little microphones on so they can talk into their radio, the microphone on their lapel. Suppose the policeman goes to the homeowner and he has the microphone in his lapel on so his partner can hear the conversation, and they can -- the two of them talk about it later. They're talking to the homeowner. Is that an unlawful search?",
  "It doesn't occur to him that that mike is on.",
  "But -- but maybe it is a reasonable expectation, maybe it isn't. I frankly think that might be harder than the dog case or that you can make a stronger case for a reasonable expectation of privacy. If the -- if the homeowner is making a lot of marijuana with -- with odors coming out, he knows that a dog or a person might smell it.",
  "It does hinge on what is a reasonable expectation of privacy.",
  "And that's what we're trying to find out.",
  "And judges do this thousands of times in thousands of cases. They ask: Was the tip reliable? There are any number of permutations. It's a question of whether or not the trial judge was -- made a correct determination in determining that there was or was not sufficient cause for the police to proceed. It just happens every day.",
  "Do you understand the government to disagree with that general position? In other words, the trial court, if you have an attorney that's really concerned about the training of this dog, they can ask about it.",
  "Excuse me. Did you say it can or it can't?",
  "If -- if you think that leaving the scene -- in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that he's leaving the scene with incriminating evidence, at that point you have -- you have a Terry stop? And he's right at the scene; he's just leaving the premises, at the end of the driveway or something?",
  "What would you think generally in my hypothetical? There'd be hundreds of other facts, but - -",
  "Just -- just before the search, yes.",
  "Right.",
  "I think -- I think we have to take the case on the assumption -- I agree with you there probably was probable cause -- but I think you have to take the case on the assumption that there was no probable cause to arrest, because they didn't -- they did not rely on that authority.",
  "Justice Kagan had the hypothetical of the person leaving to go to work, the 9:00 to 5:00 person. Suppose the warrant's going to be executed at 5:00. Can they detain him at his office so that he doesn't go back - - He always goes right home. He takes the Number 3 bus, and he will be there in 20 minutes. Can you detain him at the office under your rule?",
  "No, under the rule you're proposing.",
  "I don't know -- I don't know why not, under the rule that's proposed.",
  "Well, suppose that a really skilled attorney, after negotiating a plea bargain, or even representing a client at trial but then losing, is very skilled in ensuring that the defendant can go into the general population, not into solitary confinement; but also a skilled trial attorney, he's just not very good at that, so the defendant goes to solitary. Could -- if there was an evolution of the law of adequate assistance of counsel so that this Court later held, oh, conditions of confinement have to be a part of the attorney's -- skill and competence in representation, that that would be retroactive?",
  "So that there are then, in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, some cases in which there could be a new rule of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland?",
  "Well, I don't understand how that works with my hypothetical.",
  "Well, it just seems to me that the predicate question that we decided in Padilla was that Strickland applies to matters not within the control of the trial judge. That it seems to me was a holding the Court had not addressed before and that other courts had not addressed before.",
  "No, this is --",
  "-- a predicate question.",
  "Do you want us to write this opinion in support of your position, and to begin by saying, prevailing professional norms do not change?",
  "It seems to me that you're -- that the defense bar generally would want to say that prevailing professional norms change, but that -- that hurts you in this case.",
  "I notice -- I'm not sure it was cited in the brief, but the ABA comment in 1999 said, now the ABA standard applies to professional standards, and that goes beyond the constitutional minimum. So that doesn't seem to me to help you, either.",
  "It said, it should be stated that these standards do more than enforce the constitutional minimum.",
  "Well, I'm talking about the -- I'm talking about the ABA here, if you want to give some other authority; but, I say that, it seems to me, does not help you.",
  "Well, except -- except that -- and I'm interrupting, in a sense, but it's on the same track -- except that it seems to me that Teague does serve the interest of repose, quite apart from interference with a federal proceeding, and that interest is surely sacrificed by the holding you wish us to make here.",
  "Perhaps on rebuttal -- I recognize the white light's on -- you could address what is -- what is the standard you want me to apply to determine retroactivity? The brief says, oh, well, it's just new facts applying to the same general rule. Well, danger invites rescue; the assault on privity is proceeding to pace; MacPherson v. Buick and the Erie Railroad case -- it seems to me that those were probably new rules, but there -- it's because the facts told us what should be negligent. If at some point you could address that, I don't --",
  "Well, as I recall, correct me if I'm wrong, one of the principal sources the Court cited in Padilla was common sense.",
  "Does common sense change?",
  "I mean, Tom Paine wrote about it, so, you know, since its original.",
  "What is -- what is the standard that you wish us to apply? A new rule is announced when -- when you fill in the blank. And after you fill in the blank, is your principal argument that here the distinction is between the direct consequences of the conviction that are under the control of the Court and collateral consequences? Two different questions.",
  "That's a little bit like the AEDPA standard.",
  "But the second part of my question that you were about to answer was whether or not it's dictated by precedent, and in this case, it was not dictated by precedent because it applied to collateral consequences; or, what's the because?",
  "Are you saying that there -- are you saying that there is a difference between materiality for the fraud-on-the-market theory and for direct reliance or that there can be a difference?",
  "And that if there was fraud on the market, that is a materiality question addressed at the certification stage, but if the class isn't certified, the investor can still show that he had had direct reliance that was reasonable?",
  "Am I -- am I right about that? Or --",
  "Do the first part.",
  "Doesn't -- doesn't that assume that the efficient market theory is always relevant to materiality? And there might be instances in which there is subjective reliance, which we inquire into, that is objectively reasonable, but that does not involve a fraud on the market?",
  "Well, that -- that --",
  "You -- you are saying that, if everyone loses, if it's not material, that's a common issue, and therefore, the trial court at the certification stage does not have to determine it.",
  "I'm not sure how that's different from what I said. But in other -- in other words, you are saying that market efficiency is just presumed, and everybody wins or everybody loses, and so you can have a class action, even though the trial judge is convinced that there is no adequate common market theory to support the common -- the common injury.",
  "Well, you have the -- you have the burden of justifying class certification --",
  "-- is that not correct?",
  "All right. Now, suppose there is some real question of whether or not the causal chain hasn't been broken, the causal chain between the misstatement and the movement in price. Don't you have to prove the integrity of the causal chain?",
  "At the certification stage?",
  "You say it's material even though there is no cause in fact? I don't understand that.",
  "Well, that then -- that imparts the question of 24 years of economic scholarship -- I think that's how long it's been since Basic was decided -- has shown that the -- the efficient market theory is -- is really -- really an overgeneralization. It could be much more subtle than that and so you have an advanced theory. But you want us to ignore that.",
  "I did -- are there cases in the -- in the ordinary course of class actions -- I know they are all different -- where the district court can find that common questions do predominate, without addressing the question whether damages can be proven on a class-wide basis? Or are they always interlinked?",
  "One of my -- one of my questions in the case is this: There was a question to Mr. Estrada with reference to a jury trial. But there's -- there's -- the judge doesn't really have a gate -- what do you call it -- a gatekeeper function here. There is no -- there's no jury. And if the judge admits the evidence and if it turns out that that doesn't meet the standard of reliability, then he can exclude it. I don't -- I don't see why the judge has to say, all right, now, first, I'm going to do Daubert, and next, I'm going to do whether this is reliable. This is just a magic words approach, it seems to me.",
  "Well, I -- I take it there is no argument over whether or not the expert is qualified.",
  "The question is just whether his -- his theory makes any sense.",
  "And the -- and the Petitioner says it doesn't.",
  "Well, Mr. Barnett, I -- I can think of -- my initial reaction -- it has been an awful long time since I have been in the courtroom -- is -- is that that's whether or not this man is -- is qualified to give an opinion.",
  "Step one. The next thing is does this opinion make any sense?",
  "That the court as the trier-of-fact chooses to -- that the -- not reserved to cases where there's a jury? Is that --",
  "It seems to me that, as I indicated before, that the whole question of weight and admissibility is somewhat less important when the trial judge is not the gatekeeper. The trial judge, at the end of the day, can hear the testimony and say, you know, I admitted this testimony, but it doesn't make any sense, it doesn't work.",
  "Well, he does what I said, but then he has 100 pages of findings.",
  "No, I think that's where we disagree. The judge has to make a determination that, in his view, the -- the class can be certified.",
  "And that includes some factual inquiries as -- as to the damages alleged and the cause of the injury and whether or not there is a common -- whether or not there's a commonality.",
  "Well, that's not -- I'll think about it, but that's not my understanding. I thought the judge has to make a determination that, in the next case we are going to hear this morning, that the representation is material or it affects the market. The judge has to make that conclusion, make that finding.",
  "Well, of course, there matters for the trier of fact to determine at the merits stage, but under -- under Daubert and under Rule 702, the judge has to say that the evidence is relevant to the task at hand, and it has a reliable foundation. I can see a judge saying, well, now, this theory that you're using, this theory works, I think it's accepted in academia. Then he hears all the testimony, and he says, It just doesn't work here.",
  "I'm -- I'm not sure what I just described is not Daubert.",
  "But once -- once the judge determines, quite erroneously, that it has to be a dwelling -- midway during the trial, I'm the judge, I consider this has to be a dwelling, is there any way I can make that point, make that ruling, without invoking double jeopardy?",
  "But -- but if I persist in that view, there's nothing the government can do?",
  "What -- could a state provide a procedure where, if a judge makes a critical ruling mid-trial, that at the request of the opposing counsel, jury proceedings are suspended for 48 hours, and the aggrieved party can run to the court of appeals to get a mandate?",
  "Because of?",
  "Well, in my hypothetical, the state said -- and this isn't a final determination; the ruling doesn't become final until you have 48 hours and go to the court of appeals.",
  "I'm not sure I understand the rationale for your answer to your own hypothetical. The judge characterizes a prosecutorial -- or a misconduct incident as a grounds for acquittal; it really isn't. Then you said the court of appeals could straighten that out?",
  "On what rationale -- so what's the general principle that allows the court of appeals to do this sometimes and not others?",
  "Oh, I thought -- I thought it was the judge just subjectively does this, but he doesn't say any -- he just characterizes it as an acquittal?",
  "Have any states done that? I -- I'm somewhat concerned about telling a judge that, if the judge's best judgment says there's insufficient evidence, that then it has to proceed with a trial.",
  "But what the Chief Justice indicates, it seems to me, is that if we accept your view, then there is going to be a different statute of limitations for each member of the conspiracy. And so you have four or five different statute of limitations. I find that -- I find that puzzling.",
  "Isn't it essential to your argument that the very definition of a conspiracy is a crime that continues over time?",
  "And I suppose that a conspiracy is defined by relation to its criminal objects, not to its membership. If there's five people that conspired to rob a bank and one of the conspirators has said, I'm out of here, I withdraw from the conspiracy, metaphysically, you might argue, well, it's a new conspiracy because it's a new group. But there is no support of the law for that, I take it.",
  "Because it's the criminal objects that define the conspiracy?",
  "And I didn't hear you.",
  "I was just -- I was curious. In 1997, the Petitioner did report the identity of another cooperating witness to Gray. You don't -- you don't rely on that as showing that he was, indeed, part of the conspiracy? That's just irrelevant to your case?",
  "Well, that was -- it was kind of a throwaway line. But why isn't that dispositive for you?",
  "If -- if I were to write an -- an opinion indicating that there's a chill here because distributors and retailers will see that there's been this suit against the -- your client and they will be reluctant to distribute, would there -- would I just make that up? Or is there something I can read to find out -- to find that out, or --",
  "Well, the -- the evidence here was that they did need investors, and investors were reluctant.",
  "It wasn't specific evidence, but then I -- anything besides that?",
  "Okay. Is that -- is that in the record?",
  "When you said it's incredibly costly to do this and so forth, is that in the record?",
  "I mean, it makes sense, but I -- I'm a little reluctant to take judicial notice of the shoe business. I mean --",
  "And I would think that you would add this as well, that, for a competitor to demand that the other competitor tell its plans, its marketing, is, to say the least, patronizing, and -- and probably quite injurious, in and of itself.",
  "But, again, there's -- do I just know that because I'm a judge? Or is there someplace I can look for that?",
  "Could we say there is just a presumption, that, if you're in the business, that you probably are interested in future design, period?",
  "Wouldn't establish a --",
  "But its future -- its future shoes are clearly -- and I thought the counsel for the Petitioner might have -- might have added this in his answer to Justice Sotomayor, that its future shoes are not covered by this. And the -- if -- if Nike has the heavy burden of proof, can it have discovery and take depositions on what their plans are, what their marketing plans are, what designs they're thinking about?",
  "So then -- so then the covenant not to sue gives Nike an advantage that no other manufacturer has.",
  "Do you mean any manufacturer without -- without any litigation can ask Already, well, tell us your plans, what shoes are you thinking about?",
  "But why should Already have to do that to anybody?",
  "So Nike has an advantage over Already that no other manufacturers had. It can demand what its future plans are.",
  "Let me just ask one question on that, and it's a little bit off of what we've been talking about. You say, in your brief, well, now, don't worry, what you can do is you can go to the trademark -- the PTO board, and they'll -- they'll adjudicate this mark. And so -- you know, you can really go out of the courts and go to the administrators. Suppose Already goes to the administrative agency and loses. Can it have judicial review? And is there -- is standing easier to show, once there has been an adverse action in the administrative office? Or are we right back where we started? So once you go to the agency and you try to appeal, the Court says, well, this is an Article III court, we need a case of controversy, and you're right back where we are now?",
  "That was a big part of your argument. You were telling us, oh, don't worry, you can always go to the patent level.",
  "No. My -- my question is: Is the Article III requirement that Already has the same in this case as it would be if they sought judicial review from an adverse order of the administrative agency?",
  "I'm talking about going to court.",
  "Is -- is -- is the Petitioner -- do you anticipate that the Petitioner will agree with you, that this covers future products?",
  "But you have two categories. You have current and previous, as to which the covenant runs to everything. Then you have what you say is future, and that has to be a colorable imitation.",
  "So it -- so it -- so it does cover some future designs. And they're correct about that, and you're incorrect.",
  "That's because it usually sues. Page -- page 114 of the Joint Appendix says, \"Your Honor, over the past eight months, Nike has cleared out the worst offending infringers. Now, Already remains as one of the last few companies that was identified on that top ten list of infringers.\" I mean, that -- that's your company's policy. That's your attorney, I take it.",
  "Well, but that's because you gave them the covenant after you sued them.",
  "They are on the top ten list of infringers.",
  "You -- you referred, just in a fleeting way, to the fact that they can go to the PTO and to the board?",
  "What about my question, and I wasn't -- it was probably my fault --",
  "-- I didn't quite understand the government's petition. Is the standing burden any less after there is a -- an administrative adjudication and you go to court for judicial review?",
  "Well, but to -- to follow the Chief Justice's question, suppose it were shown that there were many rural counties -- rural areas in Georgia, very much like this one. Would that change this case? I thought that was the purport of the -- the thrust of the question.",
  "Well, I know Georgia has 158 counties or something.",
  "So I think they probably have many rural areas with one or two hospitals. That's just a guess.",
  "Well, is it a fair characterization of your argument -- is it a fair characterization of your argument to say that the possibility that the hospital authority can use this general power in this way is tantamount to or equivalent to the legislature intending that it be used that way? Is that your argument?",
  "Well, if you adopted that rule I suppose you could couple it with an increased duty of care on the part of the employer to take necessary steps to prevent forbidden harassment. In other words, you up the duty of care on the part of the employer generally.",
  "I -- I recognize that we're talking about a matter of Federal law here. What about the law of most of the States? Suppose there's an agreement with an insurer and an insured, that says the insured gets 100 percent of the proceeds. I would think that the law of most States gives a superior lien to the attorney for the contingent fee, notwithstanding the agreement. I'm not sure of that. It's just an assumption.",
  "That -- that's the summary of the plan that's at A20. That's not the plan --",
  "Well, I mean, you -- you want us to decide a case without looking at the plan? I have before me the same language that I believe Justice Ginsburg is looking at, and I think she's quite correct, that the word \"abrogation,\" of course, is not used, but neither is the concept.",
  "Well, \"simply because the plan language.\" I mean, obviously, we have to look at the plan language to see what the -- you're -- you're relying on the plan language. And you cite the summary, but you don't cite the main plan.",
  "Justice Kagan's question had two parts. She said, tell me about the two boxes, subrogation and reimbursement. I think there is quite a bit to your argument that this is not subrogation. The plan is rather confusingly drafted. The plan calls it subrogation. I don't think it really means subrogation. If it's not subrogation, Justice Kagan's question was, what then? The -- the common fund rule still does not apply? Because?",
  "But you are still in equity, pursuant to the statute.",
  "And are you saying that there is no discretion in the equitable decrees that the judge made?",
  "The general rule in equity was that the equity court would not give a specific performance decree to pay a certain amount of money, was the general rule. Were there exceptions?",
  "And -- and if so, do those exceptions bear on this case?",
  "We -- you don't view the case as?",
  "Well, it would be narrow in the sense that substantial rights would have to be affected and the other conditions of Olano met. But I think, consequent on Justice Scalia's question is, that itself would be another issue in every case. Is this one of those cases: Number one, it was wrong; number two, it's new; number three, is it clear under all the Olano criteria. And that would have to be decided in every case.",
  "So at the end of the day, it could be a small subset of cases, but the number that would be presented, both to this Court and the court of appeals, would be quite substantial.",
  "I suppose one answer to Justice Scalia's question is that, well, if you require an objection, and you have to have a laundry list of everything that might change, but the answer to that, in turn, is, if -- if you use that rationale, then we're just asking the attorney to conceal from the judge every -- everything that's important.",
  "It would seem to me the laundry list, even though that's perhaps an initial objection to Justice Scalia's concern, is, frankly, preferable to a system where we just don't -- don't talk about what might be clear error.",
  "And let me ask you, I don't wish to sidetrack the discussion on the metaphysics of the Plain-Error Rule, because it's important and it's the -- part of the case, but in this case, there wasn't going to be a new trial. There wasn't going to be a new jury. It's just the sentence. Has any argument been made that we should have a different rule for sentences than for errors that would require a new -- a complete new trial?",
  "And is there any relief for him in the -- in the regulations of Bureau of Prisons or the government -- other than a pardon, I suppose, of defendants?",
  "Eligible for?",
  "Well, let me ask you this --",
  "Let me ask you just this question -- just tell me as a matter of common practice, do district courts enter judgments against plaintiffs routinely when a full offer of settlement has been made and the defendant just is silent? I mean, does this happen? I just can't remember seeing a -- but this --",
  "It may -- it may be that it's common practice that, if the plaintiff doesn't reply and there's an offer that's filed with the court, the court says, I haven't heard anything, I'm going to enter judgment.",
  "As a matter of housekeeping, you could --",
  "Right.",
  "Well, your -- your offer says, you hereby offer to allow entry of judgment under Rule 68.",
  "But the -- but the question from Justice Alito was, what happens, does the court have authority to have a hearing?",
  "And you said, oh, well, this is not under Rule 68; but -- but you offered to allow entry of judgment under Rule 68.",
  "And incidentally, you never did follow up and say that you wanted an entry of judgment. You just wanted a dismissal. And that's another point.",
  "Do we take this case on the premise that you would have objected if a judgment had been entered in your favor for the full amount, plus attorneys' fees?",
  "Am I correct or incorrect that a considerable number of these roads are -- a significant number of these roads were built initially by the logging industry?",
  "And it's a little hard for you to say that, when these were built by the logging industry and presumably maintained to some respect by the logging industry, to say, oh, well, these are used by hunters and so forth. I -­",
  "Is it your submission that we should issue an order vacating this moot or issue an order for the court of appeals to consider whether it's moot?",
  "What is your submission?",
  "But -- but, in other words, it goes -- under your view, it would go back to the district court; the district court would try all this. And, as the Chief Justice says, we know what the law of the case is, if -- if the opinion stands.",
  "And -- and so isn't -­ isn't it fairly clear, well, we know that the district court must do under the court of appeals' decision?",
  "Excuse me. This is page 18. That's -- that's the last page?",
  "And -- and so I'm reading under where it says, \"stormwater discharges\"?",
  "Thank you.",
  "But then -- but then why -- why isn't your -- aren't your concerns met if we vacate for the court of appeals to consider, in the first instance, the extent to which this regulation may bear on its opinion?",
  "I'm not sure how we can limit this to agency misconduct. Suppose there is a computer glitch in a program, completely good faith, and the computer just spits out the -- the wrong information, and nobody knows about it. That's not misconduct.",
  "And -- but --",
  "But you would say no equitable tolling in that case?",
  "I mean, that would be good cause. It seems to me that would be good cause under the -- under the Secretary's rules.",
  "Well, I don't know -- I don't know why it wouldn't.",
  "You mean to say that if that happened, under the Secretary's rule, the Secretary would abuse its discretion in extending the time for 3 years?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I just find it hard -- hard to see why this is -- you're saying that the equitable tolling rule -- the agency does have the 3-year rule.",
  "It is limited to misconduct?",
  "So you're arguing for -- in a way, for a narrower rule than what the government --",
  "What page again?",
  "Suppose that the district has 85 percent of the water by volume that's put into this river, and then you have this high pollution index. Does that make it an easier case for the challengers? Or is that just irrelevant?",
  "I have one different question. This is hypothetical. It's not in the case. It's just for me to understand that. Suppose you have the river, and part of it is a concrete bank, and then there's a more natural bedding and then another concrete bank. And when the -- in the dry season, they fix the concrete bank, but they use bad concrete. And a lot of pollutants are coming out of the concrete, but it is in the river. Is that a discharge under this statute?",
  "Would there be any --",
  "And that's -- that's a separate provision of the statute, nonpoint source pollutions.",
  "Well, that's not in this case.",
  "It was just a background, background question for you.",
  "Is it your position that the rivers -- the two rivers in question are outside the MS4? I thought there was a suggestion in the government's brief that you could have both the river and the MS4 that could cover the same area.",
  "But you still have to show that there is a contributor. And I've been through these sections, and it seems to me that a reasonable interpretation of this section is that there is a violation if a particular permittee violates. And what I'm taking away from your argument is that, once there is a violation, all the permittees are liable, and that just can't be.",
  "Is that the 109 language you cite?",
  "Why is there no -- where do I look to find out that the district is making a discharge of polluted water, other than under the Ninth Circuit's theory that it's in the river itself?",
  "So is your theory that, if the district is permitted to -- on a scale of 1 to 10, to discharge up to 2, but that if the monitoring station in the river shows an 8, then it is automatically liable for the increase, even though other dischargees might have made this?",
  "I don't get that from what you have read. I've looked at --",
  "-- the text you've read and it looks to me like it's permittee by permittee.",
  "So if each permittee is allowed to put in a 2, but one permittee puts in an 8; then both permittees are liable?",
  "No, no, we now know the facts because it's the hypothetical.",
  "So have the State proceedings been dismissed? Or are they in suspense?",
  "So it would be your position that the Alabama courts still have jurisdiction over the child and the mother?",
  "And would you go further and say that, if a stay is not in place, that that still does not deprive the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to resolve the case on the merits?",
  "Well, except he might have assumed that the issue of fees would still be alive if the Eleventh Circuit ruled on the merits.",
  "And he -- he was just trying to have a single appeal.",
  "Well, appellate courts all the time have issues where they apply different standards to multiple issues in the case.",
  "Well, that, of course -- on your premise, that's right. On their premise, it's wrong, that -- the issue of custody is still alive under their perspective. That's what we are arguing about, so you're just assuming your own premise.",
  "But I am -- I am quite surprised that you would say that prior residence can never bear on present residence. In custody disputes, this happens all the time. The child spent 5 years in this country, 4 years in that country; now, for the last 2 years, the child has been in this country -- the previous experience of the child has a tremendous bearing on custody. To say that it's only now, prospective only, after the child has been removed, I just think is wrong, as a matter of custody law.",
  "Well, again, you're just assuming that the district judge is right, but that's the whole issue. And as the Chief Justice indicates, under your position, we give a premium to the very sort of precipitant action that the Hague Convention is designed to avoid.",
  "Are you -- are you saying that (6) doesn't apply at this point?",
  "Because (6) talks about class action, and it says the duty of the district court --",
  "-- is to aggregate the claims of the individual class members.",
  "But what you're saying in your answer to Justice Breyer -- and I don't think you've really addressed his point -- that the statute number 6 says \"shall aggregate the individual claim.\" What you're saying is that the simplest thing is to evade the statute. Evasion is simple. And therefore, we still use that approach because the simplest is the best. That just is not responsive to his question.",
  "Suppose the Court were to say, we now hold that the modified categorical approach applies to this statute and to these facts. Would the plea colloquy suffice to show that under the modified categorical approach the defendant necessarily was convicted of a crime that's equivalent to the generic crime of burglary?",
  "But if he necessarily - -",
  "-- the defendant necessarily was convicted of an offense that had the elements of a generic crime, if he necessarily was convicted of that, would that suffice? And if it would, does the -- plea colloquy suffice to show that?",
  "It is a two-part question. I hope I can get an answer to each.",
  "But if under the modified categorical approach we -- we insist that in the particular case before us the generic components of the crime must necessarily have been found by the jury, and if we say that that's the rule, that's inconsistent with your view of what the law ought to be?",
  "But under the modified categorical approach the whole point is that we do look to the plea colloquy.",
  "Of course, which is why you say you don't think the modified categorical approach should apply. But I'm saying suppose we say that it does and we look at the plea colloquy. What do you want us to conclude from that?",
  "Excuse me. Justice Ginsburg points out that you're talking about the statute, but the statute uses the term \"accrual.\" Is it correct to say that the term \"accrual\" is not used in statute of limitations for crimes -- generally -- for crimes?",
  "Right. And this -- and this talks about accrual. So that is indicative -- is indicative of the fact that Congress is using a civil analogue in the drafting of this statute.",
  "In a civil -- in a civil action brought by an injured investor or private party, can that plaintiff, the injured investor, the private party, in the ordinary course plead and rely upon an earlier government determination that there had been a violation and so that that's presumptive showing of liability?",
  "In other words, the SEC makes an investigation, finds a violation; can a private investor then rely on that as a presumptive showing of liability?",
  "No, not the allegation. It's an ultimate finding.",
  "But then under your rule. The plaintiff would be deprived of that.",
  "But if the government's statute of limitations runs out and the private investor is on his own, then the private investor doesn't have the advantage that exists in other cases of reliance on a -- SEC finding as a presumptive showing of liability.",
  "Are -- are there cases discussing whether or not a government agency has been diligent in pursuing a fraud, a fraud investigation? You see, in the private context we have some sense of what the plaintiff has to do to protect the plaintiff's rights. He has to be diligent. But to transpose that to a governmental agency -- suppose the agency's over -- overworked or underfunded? I don't -- which way do you come out when the government says that?",
  "Well, perhaps I've missed something. I -- I came in here thinking that both parties were willing to concede for purposes of this case that there was a fraudulent concealment. Is that -- is that wrong?",
  "I mean, for purposes of presenting the statute of limitations issue that's before us.",
  "That's correct.",
  "I don't want to take up too much time talking about Andrews, but it seems to me that what the North Carolina Supreme Court said in Andrews is that in those States where there is a prior determination, that controls, but the -- North Carolina is entitled to adopt a different procedure and have a one-third across-the-board rule. That's the way I read it.",
  "Does -- does that accord with your understanding?",
  "Yes.",
  "If we are talking about reasonableness, do you think it's relevant for us to look to the rules and practices of other States?",
  "But the fact that those States do have a warrant requirement and from what we can best tell make it work very well, including some expedited procedures where you can get warrants within minutes -- it takes usually the policemen, say, 20 minutes to get just to the hospital or the police station anyway.",
  "But we have -- have always -- correct me if I'm wrong. I think that we have always thought of Fourth Amendment reasonableness standards as being a national standard. Suppose 40 States -- you know, we can play the game. Suppose 40 States had rules that you have warrants and many of them had expedited procedures. That's still irrelevant? We don't look at that at all?",
  "Is there any showing that conviction rate in those States is lower than in the States where the practice is -- is to take the test without the warrant?",
  "Well, we have -- I don't want to because you have multiple answers -- but on that point, we do talk about exigent circumstances. If -- if we proceed as Justice Ginsburg's suggestion indicates, then the fact that you can't get a warrant within 45 minutes is the exigent circumstance.",
  "But Justice Ginsburg said 30 minutes.",
  "I thought -- I thought that we often said that you look at whether or not you can get a warrant before you can break in so that the drugs aren't flushed down the toilet and so forth. We make that judgment all the time.",
  "And if that showing is not made, you must get a warrant.",
  "So I think it's quite incorrect to say that we -- we don't look at the time factor.",
  "We look at it all the time.",
  "I agree that there is a uniform standard. But -- and I don't know if you ever did finish the answer to Justice Ginsburg, but she -- she had suggested that we have a uniform rule of exigent circumstances. That -- her suggestion complies with your objection.",
  "Now, I think you should be fair. He doesn't have to prepare a written affidavit in a number of these States. It's a telephonic warrant. You have to give us that.",
  "Incidentally, it wasn't clear to me: Is that 1 hour from the time of the -- pardon me -- two hours from the time of the stop or two hours from the time he put him in the back of the patrol car? Do we know?",
  "Suppose the magistrate is unavailable because he or she is ill?",
  "Would you agree that that's an exigent circumstance which would allow a warrantless blood sample?",
  "Well, we -- we know the defense attorneys love it when there's a delay because then the retrograde analysis has more and more contingencies that make it unreliable.",
  "I mean, you'd much rather examine the State's expert if the sample was taken three hours than if it were -- after the arrest than one. I mean, that's a given.",
  "Well, aren't we going to be told the whole essence of the class action is you have to see if there is an injury that goes beyond some particular clients that you know. And isn't this -- isn't this investigation in anticipation?",
  "Well, the anticipation is, are -- are you willing to join the class?",
  "Isn't that critical?",
  "Well, I do think you are helped somewhat by the -- the chronological progression here, is it including the service of process, which means the case has already started, and then investigation in anticipation of the litigation that follows the service of process. So it -- it is true that there is a chronological aspect. In order, it seems to me, for the Respondents to prevail, they have to say that investigation in anticipation of litigation also precedes service of process.",
  "Well, are -- are you saying that the study must be either a solicitation or an investigation? It can't be both? Why can't it be both?",
  "Well, I -- I understand your argument about (12), but I -- I do think that you ought to assume we might interpret this statute, so that each of these is independent, and you have to concentrate on (4). You keep going back to (12), when we're talking about (4). If you talk about (4) for a minute, it seems to me that you might give away too much because the statute says, \"including service of process,\" which means the suit has to begin and then investigation in anticipation of the litigation that will follow after that suit has come in. But you seem to give that away. You seem to think that investigation in anticipation of litigation can be before the suit is filed. You -- you seem to concede that.",
  "I don't know why you concede that.",
  "I want -- I want to interrupt just -- just one moment. I may have misheard, or you may have misspoke. I thought you said that no requests were sent until the suit was filed, but the request was -- the first FOIA request was June 23rd, 2005; the second FOIA request was August 24, 2006; and this Herron suit was filed August 29, 2006.",
  "So letters were sent before the suit was filed.",
  "But the -- yes, but the FOIA suit was made before the suit was filed.",
  "But in anticipation of litigation does come after service of process, and an additional way to harmonize this statute with (12) is to say that, after the suit has been filed, then -- in anticipation of the litigation that that suit will engender, then you may get the information. But you didn't do that.",
  "That's the way the statute's written.",
  "Well, that's because -- that's because the State is allowing solicitation, and it puts certain conditions on what your solicitation --",
  "You point to page 94, you say, oh, it's just the last line, the whole thrust of the letter was solicitation. You have to be fair about that.",
  "You have to be fair about that.",
  "But the question was what -- what strategic decision do you think the lawyer should make?",
  "So you -- but -- but Justice Alito has a real problem. What -- don't you put the defense in a very difficult position?",
  "But -- but isn't it difficult for you to say he had nothing to do with the drugs, plus the drugs didn't weigh more than a certain amount?",
  "I think that I am hearing that, in every case, you are going to want witnesses -- you are going to insist on a jury determination of the amount. That's kind of what I'm hearing.",
  "Justice Alito says why doesn't that put defense counsel in a very difficult position?",
  "Well, we're not getting far with this. But one answer you could say is that, in order to preserve the constitutional right, you want us to have a bifurcated trial. I thought you were -- might say that.",
  "That's good because that's an extra problem.",
  "But you could say that with reference to the -- to the maximum. Everything you said could be applied to the maximum, and Apprendi says you can't say that.",
  "Can you -- can you tell me why that is not what occurred here?",
  "What about -- what about the basic problem in this case, as I understand the question presented, is should the State be responsible when the funding problem is at a local level? So suppose you have a State that says -- you know, we have had problems in funding; if we give this to the counties, it's going to be much better, and the counties are very, very good at raising money and knowing who the counsel are. And so it's all handled by the county. Then one county has a disaster, a hurricane in that county, particularly. Is that not a reason for delaying? Or does the State have to immediately step in and -- and supplement the funding? Can't the county say, oh, we need another two years?",
  "I take it that's the issue that we're trying to decide here.",
  "I -- I would like to get the structure of your argument. You began to say there's three reasons. I would just like to hear those three reasons, so that I can understand the framework for all these questions.",
  "The three reasons that we should affirm.",
  "Okay. And the second?",
  "Okay. Thank you.",
  "In law review commentaries and maybe in lower courts' opinion, is there -- is it fair to say that the weight of authority is to criticize the battery-negligence distinction as being productive of litigation and not really making a lot of sense?",
  "Well, you did -- you did say, in the reply brief, that the point of the Gonzalez Act, it says, \"would enable plaintiffs to pursue those claims against the United States.\"",
  "I know you would have been disappointed if we didn't ask you about this.",
  "And I -- but it -- and Justice Kagan indicated, this wasn't just an aside. This was rather a central theory for your interpretation of the Act; maybe not the only theory, but a central theory.",
  "Suppose the district did -- did have, as I think it did here, a uniform policy that, for every acre you develop, you have to preserve 10 wetlands -- 10 acres of wetlands. And then two cases, both hypothetical, one is somebody had an 100-acre parcel, and they want to develop five acres, and they have 50 acres that they mitigate for wetlands. The other person has only one acre, and he wants to -- and he has to develop the whole acre. Can the district then say, we'll give you the one-acre development permit, if you reclaim wetlands on 10 other acres that you -- that we can designate for you elsewhere? The hypothetical being designed to point out whether or not the crux of your argument is that he had to go off -- offsite.",
  "So, in my hypothetical, you would -- would there be a violation in my hypothetical, as you understood it?",
  "I -- I have one question. I know we -- you are running short on your rebuttal time. Assume that, when we look at this record, assume we think there is a due process violation, not a taking violation. That is not before us here, is it?",
  "Suppose -- suppose the agency said, we are really short of revenue; we will let you develop your land, if you contribute a million dollars to our new football stadium?",
  "Well, let's -- let's put -- let's put it this way: I take it, it's -- it's a given that the government cannot take an easement on your property. It cannot use your property for its own purposes. It cannot park its trucks there. It cannot cut the grass. Why is it that, if it can't do those, it can still force you, as a condition to using your property to its highest and best use, to pay them money?",
  "Why isn't that an equal burden -- why isn't that an equal use of the property by the government?",
  "Well, in Penn Coal v. Mahon, the government didn't enter the property. It didn't take the property in the physical sense of moving in inappropriate. It just says, congratulations, you have some coal under your land, and we hope you enjoy it because you can't move it. And we said that is a taking, that is a regulation that goes too far. And it deprived, as Justice Breyer indicated, the owner of investment-backed expectations, although that word wasn't in Penn-Mahon.",
  "Let me -- me ask this question: Suppose you have two cases, hypothetical, case A, case B, both involve the Experimental Use Doctrine in Federal patent law. In case A, it's a very weak argument; it's most unlikely it's not going to apply. Case B, very strong argument, Experimental Use Doctrine applies. Any difference in the removability in those two cases?",
  "Well, if -- if you say -- since you're going to say it -- I mean, if it's a \"substantial\" Federal issue, then it's substantial in hypothetical B, but not in hypothetical A?",
  "Let -- let me ask you this: The Brighton Miller treatise is rather complimentary of Grable, it says it brought considerable certainty to the area. I was pleased to hear that because I'm not sure that it's true.",
  "But can you just tell me, as an -- as an empirical matter, does \"arising under\" for removal jurisdiction cases consume a tremendous amount of time in litigation in the Federal courts? It's just --",
  "So my question was even broader. Let's say we resolve legal malpractice. Then -- then we will have products liability with a particular product, and then we will have some food and agriculture cases. It goes on and on.",
  "But getting back -- Justice Ginsburg simply made the point, I had thought, that you place a good deal of reliance on the fact that there is exclusive jurisdiction. And her question to me pointed out how far-reaching this case might be because it -- it could involve patents, copyright, all other areas of exclusive jurisdiction. If that is going to be your special rule, it's not so confined as you suggest. That's all that question meant to me. Certainly -- certainly, you -- you could have cases where there is concurrent jurisdiction, 1983, in which we'd have the same problem.",
  "Are there some statutes where parts of the statute are subject to the agency's Chevron rule-making authority and its zero plus one jurisdiction and other parts are not? You just mentioned the case by Justice Scalia -- and I'm not sure that that involved that because it does seem to me, just reading through, that \"reasonable time,\" that sounds like something that -- where we can have a specific elaboration of what it means. And to say that the jurisdiction of the agency or the authority of the agency does not extend to rules seems a little odd at first. I recognize the federalism problems and so forth.",
  "And could you add that, in those three cases -- or at least Meade, some respect was given to the agency's due?",
  "It was just not the sort of deference that's so wooden under Chevron.",
  "And you might also have said, it seems to me, that that assumes the issue -- assumes the premise.",
  "The question is, is there jurisdiction or not?",
  "If you say, when there is no jurisdiction, why do you give deference, that -- that assumes the very step -- the very question we are trying to resolve.",
  "Well, I wouldn't know when to go to court.",
  "Let me -- let me ask you this: Suppose there is a provision of this statute which is very difficult to understand.",
  "Does that bear on the Chevron Step Zero analysis on the question of what you call jurisdiction?",
  "All right. It seems, to me, that Justice Ginsburg identifies a real point. I was looking at this statute, and I say -- you know, how do I know when this agency has failed to act? I don't -- that's a very obscure data point.",
  "Was that at 209?",
  "As -- as to that specific provision?",
  "But the -- the agencies have no historic responsibility or tradition, quite unlike Article III courts, of safeguarding the Federal balance.",
  "Unelected Federal bureaucrats.",
  "Chevron is at an end. It's unravelled.",
  "As a general matter, first in the States and then in the Federal Government, is a correctional officer or prison guard usually deemed to be a peace officer? Do you know?",
  "I think it is true that there is a strong textual argument for your position. But let me ask this: Are there any studies or any statistics we can look at to see as a predictive matter how many prison suits against the government this ruling that you propose would -- would cause? It seems to me we have close to 200,000 Federal prisoners, I think, and this prison work, there is a lot of shoving, guards have to break up fights. So there is going to be any number of instances where the question is did the guard overreach. And if I make the assumption, and it's just an assumption because I haven't looked at any statistics, but there is -- this is going to vastly expand the number of cases in which the Government is the defendant. Doesn't that bear on the likelihood of the congressional intent to adopt your position?",
  "Okay. And then -- then take that theory and track through the statute to show me how that theory works, which is what your opening argument was going to do.",
  "So how does that argument help your case?",
  "A prisoner -- a prisoner is supposed to be back in his cell block at 6:00 in the evening, he isn't, he's on the recreation yard, he's somewhat recalcitrant, and two guards carry him back to the cell block. Is that an arrest?",
  "Well, he's violating the prison regulations.",
  "And that's not a law enforcement function as contemplated by the statute, in your view?",
  "Well, I think you may be right in the way you characterize Monsanto's argument, and I have great difficulties with characterizing it that way, as Justice Scalia's question indicates. But Monsanto can still prevail if you say that there's a patent infringement, if he plants it for seed and uses the seed to replant. That's not as far as Monsanto goes, but it seems to me it's one way to characterize their argument and to make it sensible.",
  "I have only one question so far, it's a farming question. With some crops if you are going to make seeds, you leave the crop in longer. In -- what about soybeans? If the farmer has the north 40 and the south 40, the north 40, he's going to plants soybeans to be used for flour, human consumption, and south 40, he wants seeds. Does he leave the plants in the ground the same amount of time?",
  "You would not? Okay.",
  "But that's -- if you're going to use the soybeans for seeds as opposed to flour, do you leave them in the ground any longer?",
  "Okay.",
  "Please correct me if I am wrong. I thought that's exactly what Bowman did here. He went to a grain elevator and he -- he used the seeds, and -- and he didn't know exactly the percentage mix, but he used them.",
  "So he did exactly what you said is uneconomical.",
  "But correct me -- correct me if I am wrong; I thought that is what Bowman did.",
  "Could -- could you prevail in this case if we focused just on use rather than make?",
  "I do have this problem that goes back to Justice Scalia's example. What about the commodity bin that has 2 percent of the patented seeds in them? Now, you get away from the article by saying, oh, well, almost all seeds are Roundup these days. But let's have some different commodity where there are three or four different patented items, but 1 percent, 2 percent of the seeds are in the bin. You can't -- you can't sell those. That seems to me a very extreme result.",
  "You can't sell them if they know they are going to be used for seeds, and you can't use them for seeds even though there is only 1 percent of the seeds?",
  "What's your closest case in support of the proposition that this is impermissible as a discrimination against interstate commerce? What's your best case?",
  "If -- if you -- you are arguing, as one of your arguments here, that this is discriminatory as to -- as to interstate commerce, as I understand your argument, what is the best case you have to support your position? What's the closest case?",
  "Well, my question is what's the best case you have for your argument?",
  "But that wasn't a discrimination. That wasn't a -­",
  "That's just -- that goes to the question whether or not this is commerce.",
  "What -- what is your best case to show that this is discriminatory in violation of our precedence?",
  "Now -- if I have to write the opinion, what case do I put down? I'm waiting.",
  "That's why you're here.",
  "Are you -- are you telling us that there is simply no commercial consequences to this statute at all, that Virginians find this to be of no commercial value, in any instance?",
  "Well, you were the one with summary judgment. Now, maybe -- maybe they didn't come forward with the information, but we interpret summary judgment in favor of -- of the losing party. And you're -- so you say you are totally agnostic. I am concerned that you are preventing them, by the summary judgment, from showing that there -- even with Virginians, there is a commercial value frequently to this information.",
  "It's not just political.",
  "Let's talk about -- let's talk about the Commerce Clause. You are saying you are agnostic. You have no idea whether or not there might be some commercial value to this information. I would think, as an officer of the State of Virginia or as a matter of judicial notice, we could -- we could take notice that there is.",
  "Of course, that assumes the question as to whether or not there is a general commercial interest in these -- in these -- in these documents. And you say, oh, you are agnostic. At least that means you are open to the possibility that there might be a commercial interest.",
  "But Pike is not relevant here. Pike involves -- the Southern Pacific v. Arizona the -- where there were -- where there were melons -­ where there were melons, and Arizona wanted to make sure that you had labels and packing of the melons in Arizona. That was -- that was discriminatory against -­ against interstate -- against interstate commerce. That's not -- that's not dormant Commerce Clause, but that is discrimination, and there is discrimination here.",
  "You -- you could say the same thing, we don't discriminate against Californians who want to come and pack their melons in Arizona.",
  "It -- it would surprise me if an out-of-State investor, who was thinking of putting a large plant in Virginia, had absolutely no interest in Virginia's tax policies.",
  "Suppose everyone in the case conceded that the purpose of this statute was to compensate the government for having valued the shares at too low a price, and this was stated right in the enactment. Would that change your argument?",
  "Well, suppose we think this is both a tax on profits and a tax on low value. Then what do we do?",
  "Suppose it's a one -- if I could just -- suppose -- we say, well, this is a one-time tax, in order to recalculate, reassess the value. If it's on income, it's still an Excess Profits Tax, in your view?",
  "How -- how do you want us to formulate the rule if we write the opinion in your favor? If a State does not give a realistic opportunity -- a feasible means for expanding the record on direct review, then Martinez applies because it is the collateral proceeding that is the meaningful one -- and then we go through 50 States to see if that rule applies?",
  "I'm -- I'm not sure exactly what Justice Ginsburg's formulation was, but I didn't -- I don't understand why you didn't say, oh, yes, that's right, there has to be one full fair opportunity to raise the issue. And that's what we are arguing here.",
  "Then the next -- then my question is: Does this apply just to capital cases?",
  "Could we in a -- oh. So this doesn't apply just to capital cases, in your opinion?",
  "And because of the rather sharp disagreements in the briefs on what the actual facts are here, I looked at the brief filed by the State Bar of Texas in support of neither party. Can you tell me -- and that they are critical of having new counsel work simultaneously on a simultaneous timeframe concurrently with the -- with the new direct appeal counsel. Can you tell me how anything that's said in the Texas Bar briefs helps your case?",
  "But then -- but the comment is that the record has to be done within a very short period of time, and the -- and the trial record isn't even available for -- the transcript, for some 7 months.",
  "So the new counsel on direct waits for 7 months, gets the transcript. In the meantime, let's assume has made some investigation, and he said -- and he tells the appellate court, we have some very important material that we want to introduce and we need to supplement the record; please remand this case.",
  "That -- that has never happened in the State of Texas in a capital case, I take it?",
  "Well, but you -- you say it's before, but this -- this indicates how Texas views its system. And, as Justice Ginsburg indicates, Texas views this system as being one in which the collateral appeal -- or the collateral proceeding counsel is in the best position to raise IAC claims. That's -- that's just where it is. And the -- the State Bar says -- agrees with the Respondent -- pardon me -- with the Petitioner on this point.",
  "This is -- this is very amusing in a capital case. Let me ask you this question: Is there anything in the State Bar brief that substantially helps your position? I'm -- I'm very interested in the State Bar brief. It's a little hard for me to parse. It did say there is a conflict of interest in -- between the habeas counsel and the -- and the counsel on direct. And it also -- it also indicates that the habeas counsel has to file the application in the convicting court not later than 180 days after -- or not later than 45 days after the State's original brief, which seems to help the Petitioner here because the original brief in -- in the direct appeal proceeding is deemed important for the habeas counsel.",
  "But what about -- what about the 75-day --",
  "I understood that, if the 30-day rule had been complied with, within the 75 days, you can ask the appellate court to please remand because there is some additional evidence to be --",
  "-- to be determined.",
  "The statement?",
  "It's a small point and doesn't go to the general issues you have to discuss with us, but just, on the small point, he gets -- I forget exactly the detail -- he gets an affidavit that Jones did it within a year. He has one.",
  "Now, if I were the prisoner, I'd say -- you know, this one might not work. Maybe I can get two, and then he gets a second, which makes a certain amount of sense to me -- although a substantial period of time elapses -- and the same thing happens with the third. It makes sense to me that the prisoner might try to wait for the third. How -- how does that factor into your diligence, assuming we get there?",
  "I'm not quite -- excuse me -- I'm not quite sure that wouldn't mean that you have a whole raft of -- of petition-protective decisions waiting on the shelf in the district court. That -- that -- that causes its own congestion problems in the district court, it seems to me.",
  "Your -- your three-way classification, you began with Herrera?",
  "And -- and, in a way, you're saying that you're three loops back in the Herrera a bit because, here, the innocence is the factual predicate.",
  "But are -- are you saying that this case is a fortiori from a successive petition? Because this isn't a successive petition.",
  "Well, you're saying that Congress knows how to write --",
  "-- an exception if -- if they want it. But this (b) does apply to successive petitions and this is really before that.",
  "Are bribed jurors not a miscarriage of justice?",
  "A juror who's bribed, is there no -- no miscarriage of justice there?",
  "But we're -- we're talking about the meaning of the term \"miscarriage of justice.\" It seems to me there -- there are many serious errors that can be described by that general phrase.",
  "Do you want to say it's a term of art? Fine.",
  "Is it -- is it your position that this is a search incident to an arrest?",
  "Why isn't this is a search incident to an arrest?",
  "Just -- just like taking the pockets out and -- and seeing what's in the person's overcoat and so forth. It is a search incident to an arrest.",
  "He was held -- he was held with probable cause --",
  "-- and his -- and his custody was restrained. He was in a police station.",
  "Were handcuffs put on him during the transport process? Do you know?",
  "But they -- they could -- they could have been?",
  "So his liberties were constrained in all of those respects. He would have to take off most of his clothes, subject to a patdown search?",
  "They could look -- they could look in his -- in his briefcase?",
  "I think -- I think there is some merit to your argument in that regard. In Samson, he was a parolee, and he actually, as I recall, signed a -- a consent form as part of the probation.",
  "A person -- a person has been arrested for a felony and is in custody, do the police -- does the justice system have an interest in knowing whether that person committed other crimes?",
  "My question is whether or not the police, who have John Doe in custody for a felony, have an interest in knowing, at the outset or within a few weeks' time, whether or not that person has committed other crimes?",
  "But they also have a reason for keeping him in custody.",
  "And my -- my question is, do they have an interest -- a legitimate interest in knowing if that person has committed other crimes?",
  "But we are also talking about identity. I assume that, in Maryland and in a number of States, the time between release on bail and return for trial is more than four months. And, if it's found, as an identity matter, that this person has a criminal record or that they are -- suspected of serious crimes, that is a mandatory ground for reconsideration of bail. And you say there is no interest in that.",
  "Does a felon who's been arrested have a reduced expectation of privacy at the time of arrest?",
  "Does a felon -- does a person who has been arrested for a felony have a reduced expectation of privacy at the time of his arrest?",
  "Your -- your brief spent some time on statistics, how often this happens. But I take it you're not saying that our inquiry is a statistical one. You're simply saying that the statistics bear out that, as an objective legal matter, the framework that you are explaining to us is and must be followed?",
  "And would it be ex post facto in -- in the hypothetical Justice Scalia gave?",
  "Could you remind me -- it's in the briefs -- if a sentence is appealed, what is the review authority of the appellate court? It must begin with the guidelines as the framework?",
  "But when -- when it comes to the court of appeals, that's different. The court of appeals begins with a framework of whether or not it's within the guidelines. That's how it begins to measure the exercise of discretion.",
  "Yes, I agree with Justice Ginsburg's follow-up question. It seems to me you avoided the question. You said, oh, well, the judge looked at all this and selected the sentence he did. But he did so because he referred to the later guidelines, and I think that you have to recognize that. Unless -- unless I'm --",
  "Well, I'd like to finish. Unless I am wrong under the record.",
  "Well, but that -- that gets back to -- to your argument. You're -- I sense that you want me to leave the bench saying the guidelines just don't make any difference. Suppose the -- suppose the district judge said, you know, if it were just up to me, I would give this lower sentence, but the guidelines are an important institutional part of our system. Uniformity in sentencing is desirable. For us to take into account the experience of other -- of other courts and what the Sentencing Commission does is very important. Therefore, my discretion is guided by these guidelines.",
  "You don't want me -- you don't want me to say that.",
  "But your -- your statement to me was -- and to us earlier -- was that the -- there is no legal constraint on the exercise of discretion. I agree, the judge -- everybody knows the judge can go lower, but that overlooks the fact that discretion is defined by legal standards. That's how we begin to think about discretion. That's how appellate courts weigh discretion. And, again, you want to give the guidelines no effect in determining how that discretion is shaped, guided and exercised.",
  "Would you accept the fact that they define the discretion, even though they don't constrain it?",
  "One of the ways I have been thinking about this case is to think about arbitration and the whole point of arbitration is to have a procedure where you don't have costs, you have as an arbitrator an antitrust expert or the best in the class in the third year antitrust course in law school. And they cite reports, and -- you know, it's classic to have contractors sit in as arbitrators in construction claims; just because it's cheaper and they know -- so I was thinking that that's substantial justification for your position. But your argument so far seems to say that doesn't make any difference. Even if they can't bring the suit in an economic way -- the arbitration in an economic way, that that's irrelevant. That's -- that's what I'm getting from your argument.",
  "No. No. It's saying that there's an alternate mechanism for resolving disputes. It's called arbitration. And arbitration does not necessarily or even as a matter of fact often as a practical matter involve the costs and the formalities of litigation.",
  "Well, I mean maybe it is litigation if you need a $300,000 report. But why do you need a $300,000 report? That's what we're asking. And I just can't -- it seems to me that I have to engage in speculation about the limits of arbitration in order to resolve in your favor. Now, to be sure, they took a -- a more rigid view below, so we don't have much of a record.",
  "Well, do we have a factual record? Suppose, I think, based in substantial part on Justice Breyer's suggestion, that we could have an arbitration that's effective and we could have a trade association prepare a report, and we could do one arbitration and then see if it applies to others. Suppose I think that. Do I -- doesn't that bear on this question? And if it does, I don't have a factual record to support my assumptions.",
  "I suppose the thrust of the questions so far has been if you would be covered under any formula that most likely would be drawn, why are you injured under this one?",
  "But that's -- that's the hypothesis. If you could be covered under most suggested formulas for this kind of statute, why are you injured by this one? I think that's the thrust of the question.",
  "Well, some of --",
  "Some of the questions asked to this point I think mirror what the government says toward the end of its brief, page 48 and page 49. It's rather proud of this reverse engineering: We really knew it was some specific States we were interested in, and so we used these old categories to cover that State. Is that a methodology that in your view is appropriate under the test of congruence and -- and proportionality?",
  "Suppose -- suppose there were and suppose that's the rationale because that's what I got from the government's brief and what I'm getting -- getting from some of the questions from the bench. What is wrong with that?",
  "Well, and -- and I don't know why -- why you even go that far. I don't know why under the equal footing doctrine it would be proper to just single out States by name, and if that, in effect, is what is being done, that seemed to me equally improper. But you don't seem to make that argument.",
  "I would like to hear the answer to the question.",
  "Your time is --",
  "-- about ready to expire for the rebuttal period. But I do have this question: Can you tell me -- it seems to me that the government can very easily bring a Section 2 suit and as part of that ask for bail-in under Section 3. Are those expensive, time-consuming suits? Do we have anything in the record that tells us or anything in the bar's experience that you could advise us?",
  "Is this an effective remedy?",
  "This reverse engineering that you seem so proud of, it seems to me that that obscures the -- the real purpose of -- of the statute. And if Congress is going to single out separate States by name, it should do it by name. If not, it should use criteria that are relevant to the existing -- and Congress just didn't have the time or the energy to do this; it just reenacted it.",
  "Well, the Marshall Plan was very good, too, the Morrill Act, the Northwest Ordinance, but times change.",
  "Well, I -- I do think the evidence is very clear that Section -- that individual suits under Section 2 type litigation were just insufficient and that Section 5 was utterly necessary in 1965. No doubt about that.",
  "But with -- with a modern understanding of -- of the dangers of polling place changes, with prospective injunctions, with preliminary injunctions, it's not clear -- and -- and with the fact that the government itself can commence these suits, it's not clear to me that there's that much difference in a Section 2 suit now and preclearance. I may be wrong about that. I don't have statistics for it. That's why we're asking.",
  "Can you tell us how many attorneys and how many staff in the Justice Department are involved in the preclearance process? Is it 5 or 15?",
  "Well, what does that mean?",
  "Do you think the preclearance device could be enacted for the entire United States?",
  "And that is because that there is a federalism interest in each State being responsible to ensure that it has a political system that acts in a democratic and a civil and a decent and a proper and a constitutional way.",
  "But if -- if Alabama wants to have monuments to the heros of the Civil Rights Movement, if it wants to acknowledge the wrongs of its past, is it better off doing that if it's an own independent sovereign or if it's under the trusteeship of the United States government?",
  "But a Section 2 case can, in effect, have an order for bail-in, correct me if I'm wrong, under Section 3 and then you basically have a mini -- something that replicates Section 5.",
  "I -- I assume the other children did not have an interest in the business, but just the trustee and the mother did. Or is that clear from the record.",
  "The briefs -- the briefs on your side of the case say, well -- you know, there is a series of words here: Fraud, defalcation, embezzlement, larceny. But really, fraud and defalcation are defined in a further way where embezzlement and larceny are not. Fraud and defalcation, while acting in a fiduciary capacity, then embezzlement and larceny. So I'm not quite sure it's fair to say that all four words must be consulted for the use of generous because fraud and defalcation are qualified by \"in a fiduciary capacity\" and then a comma.",
  "Yes. In that respect, I think the word \"fraud\" gives you some assistance in arguing your case.",
  "Was there a finding of recklessness in the State court?",
  "Is the crime of embezzlement proven if you show recklessness? Or do you need a further criminal intent?",
  "Well, of course, that's one of the things we are arguing about here. I don't think that's conceded.",
  "Well, a number of embezzlers -- not all of them -- many embezzlers fully intend to pay everything back once things turn out all right. But there's still an embezzlement. But there is also a criminal intent at the time, or a wrongful intent, even if -- even if you plan to pay it back. And it -- it seems to me that you're standing very firm on the fact that defalcation means something different than fraud in the first clause, or embezzlement and larceny in -- in the following clause.",
  "And the problem is, as the -- your friend on the other side points out, that there's two problems with this. Number one, it's not consistent with these -- with the meaning of the other three terms in the -- in the statute; and two, it's not consistent with the idea that discharges should be freely given so that debtors can begin again.",
  "Unlike fraud -- fraud, larceny and embezzlement?",
  "Could you also ask for an address, for proof of the address, or proof of date of birth?",
  "But then again, it seems to me the Federal form, as some of my colleagues have indicated, is not worth very much.",
  "Well, I take it -- I take it that -- that counsel on -- on -- on the other side will disagree with that and they say, well, this is -- this is the line to be drawn. The -- the postcard is presumptive evidence of registration and -- and of qualification. And if you have evidence to the contrary, then it's different. But otherwise, the whole utility of the single form is missing -- is gone.",
  "Other than the statutory words that authorize the use of the form.",
  "The Court of Appeals said that there's a different preemption test under -- for this law under this Constitutional provision than there is under the Supremacy Clause. It seems to me that that ignores the proposition that the State has a very strong and vital interest in the integrity of its elections, even when those, and perhaps especially when those are elections of Federal officials. And it seems to me the Ninth Circuit's new test did not give sufficient weight to that interest.",
  "How would you define the duty that New Hampshire imposed here according to the First Circuit and according to the Respondent?",
  "Do you want me to write down in this case, from my understanding, that under New Hampshire law, strict liability is determined quite without reference to the adequacy of warning?",
  "Now wait. What's -- what's a factor? The warning is or is not a factor?",
  "Well, but that's -- that's not the thrust of your argument. And I think it was a factor here for some of the reasons Justice Kagan has suggested.",
  "I mean, which does -- was the warning relevant or not relevant to the determination of strict liability?",
  "I'm talking about the definition of the duty. Was it permissible for the jury to define the duty here and the breach of the duty in part by -- by reference to the adequacy of the warning? And I -- I now understand your answer to be yes.",
  "But is -- is the upshot of your argument then that filing means different things under different provisions of the Act?",
  "And if that's so, it tends to weaken the force of your reliance on -- on filing in the statute -- on the word \"filing\" in the statute of limitations section.",
  "Well, I meant -- I meant that just to supplement Justice Kagan's question. I didn't mean to cut it off.",
  "The shadow trial brings up the answer that you were giving to the second part of Justice Alito's question, which you never got to finish.",
  "And you were saying -- you were giving the example, suppose this were a question of timeliness.",
  "And when did the fact of the vaccine first -- or the symptoms first become manifest, and you were -- and you said that this should not be tried because -- and this is finishing off Justice --",
  "-- Justice Alito's dichotomy.",
  "But the very fact that it's streamlined indicates to me that we should be very careful to enforce the policy of the rule which is to deter the filing of stale claims. And your -- your rule certainly undermines that.",
  "It does seem to me, I did not have the opportunity to ask the government this question, that the equitable tolling argument undercuts the government's position that no petition may be filed, as being an absolute. Because we all know, I take it the government concedes, that there is equitable tolling.",
  "Or there can be equitable tolling in some cases.",
  "You were going to address the shadow trial?",
  "Procedural grounds because the affidavits aren't sufficient or --",
  "Are there regulations or rules establishing hourly rates?",
  "But you -- you began by saying that these are merits defenses, but you wanted to focus first on -- on the jurisdictional question that's before us.",
  "Well, to get you back to the -- the jurisdiction point, let's -- let's just assume a hypothetical case where a regulated entity has to pay an exaction which it deems to be a penalty. And let's assume it can go to the Court of Claims, but it doesn't. It waits until the penalty's assessed and then when the penalty's assessed it says, this is a taking. That -- is that the case that you want to discuss with us today?",
  "But then you just -- but then you just lose on the merits. What the Ninth Circuit says, they can't even argue this.",
  "I -- I thought that what we were going to decide was whether or not, assuming you can go to the Court of Claims, you must go to the Court of Claims, can you prefer to wait, have a penalty assessed against you and say this is unconstitutional, it's a taking. Your position is you can't say that. I don't understand why. Other than, if you want to talk about Williamson and so forth, we can get into that.",
  "Suppose they do have standing. Could they raise the claim?",
  "You say no.",
  "Let's assume they have standing. Could they raise the claim --",
  "-- that this is an unconstitutional taking?",
  "No, no. In the administrative proceeding where they are charged with -- where a penalty is being assessed against them.",
  "So your rule is that although we must defer to an arbitrator's interpretation of the contract, in this case, there is an exception because?",
  "So -- so we make that rule just with reference to the word \"arbitration\" when it's in the class action context, or does this apply to other words as well?",
  "I'm -- I'm just not sure what the --",
  "Could they -- could they opt out?",
  "But -- but how could -- how could they opt out if the arbitrator said -- says, as Justice Scalia and Justice Alito are suggesting, we have -- I have jurisdiction to decide this case. I decide that there is a class action, all these people are in the class.",
  "Well, let me ask -- ask you this question because I think it's consistent with the answer you're giving to the Chief Justice, a little bit different, though. Suppose you have -- and this is a hypothetical case, this is not this case because I don't know the facts. Suppose you have an attorney in a small town, well respected, doesn't have a great big practice, and he's chosen as the arbitrator. And if he arbitrates the one case, he's going to get a fee of, I don't know, $10,000. He says -- you know, if this is a class arbitration, I can keep this going for 11 years, I will make a million dollars. Does he have the obligation to say, I'm going to decide the class action issue under this theory that is decided here, and after I do that, since I have a conflict, I'll bow out. I'll just say, there is a class action, and then I will leave it for some other arbitrator. Does he have that obligation? And if he doesn't, should that bear on our decision here?",
  "But -- but tell me why -- why is that a factor or not a factor in -- in our decision? That should not be a factor in our decision?",
  "What is your significant point?",
  "And one way is to assess the validity or the strength of the infringement case?",
  "That's -- that's my concern, is your test is the same for a very weak patent as a very strong patent. That doesn't make a lot of sense.",
  "Why wouldn't that determination itself reflect the strength or weakness of the patent so that the market forces take that into account?",
  "Is that the 18 -- the 18-month rule primarily?",
  "Right. I mean 180 days, yes.",
  "Would it -- would it help if you were -- were thinking about rules and caps, to consider not what the branded company would have -- would have made, but what the generic company would have lost? And -- and use the latter as the limit?",
  "Well, you -- you have to make an extrapolation, yes.",
  "Well, if the generic wins, though, its -- everybody's profits are lower. And you can gear it to just what the -- what the generic would have made.",
  "What -- what do we look at to verify what you say? Is that -- is that all in the briefs?",
  "Because I had thought, as Justice Kagan's question might indicate, that the 180 days is crucial, it allows you to go to the doctors, to give them the name of your generic equivalent, et cetera, and that that's a big advantage.",
  "And now, you're -- now, you're indicating that it isn't.",
  "Well, suppose -- suppose that hypothetical is correct. That's what was my concern, too. What the brand company can lose is much greater than what the generic can make. So why don't you just put a cap on what the generic can make and then we won't have a real concern with the restraint of trade, or we'll have a lesser concern. I think that's the thrust of Justice Ginsburg's question and it's my concern as well.",
  "Well, but it's not hypothetical that if the generic wins everybody -- the brand companies’ profits are going to go way, way down right away and generic profits are not going to be that great.",
  "Well, but so then the question still holds. If you -- if you key your payment to what the brand company will make, it's just a much higher figure, and a greater danger of unreasonable restraint.",
  "Okay, I will grant you that point that the 180 days is not that big a difference, and that there are many generics out there. But isn't that true in every industry? You said at the outset, oh, well, now in the drug industry there are a lot of people ready to pounce in. Isn't that true in any industry?",
  "I think it's correct that to develop a new drug sometimes you need not just scientists and attorneys, you need investment bankers. And you then need marketers because the cost of these drugs can be hundreds of millions. Is there anything in the record that shows the development cost of this drug?",
  "It can be a billion.",
  "Anything in this case?",
  "Anything in the record?",
  "Well, the Chief -- the Chief Justice and Justice Kagan have given a proper hypothetical to test your theory. But in this case the proponents, number one, must give their official address, they must pay money, and they must all act in unison under California law. So these five proponents were required at all times to act in unison, so that distinguishes -- and to register and to pay money for the -- so in that sense it's different from simply saying any citizen.",
  "Do you believe this can be treated as a gender-based classification?",
  "It's a difficult question that I've been trying to wrestle with it.",
  "Well, then are -- are you conceding the point that there is no harm or denigration to traditional opposite-sex marriage couples? So you're conceding that.",
  "Well, but, then it -- then it seems to me that you should have to address Justice Kagan's question.",
  "I -- I think there's -- there's substantial -- that there's substance to the point that sociological information is new. We have five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years of history or more. On the other hand, there is an immediate legal injury or legal -- what could be a legal injury, and that's the voice of these children. There are some 40,000 children in California, according to the Red Brief, that live with same-sex parents, and they want their parents to have full recognition and full status. The voice of those children is important in this case, don't you think?",
  "But this is not whoever it wants. These are five proponents of -- of the measure and if we were to accept your argument, it would give the State a one-way ratchet. The State could go in and make a defense, maybe a half-hearted defense of the statute, and -- and then when the statute is held invalid, simply -- simply leave. On the other hand, if -- if the State loses, the State can appeal. So this is a one-way ratchet as it favors the State and allows governors and other constitutional officers in different States to thwart the initiative process.",
  "That's really -- that's a broad argument that you -- that's in this case if the Court wants to reach it. The rationale of the Ninth Circuit was much more narrow. It basically said that California, which has been more generous, more open to protecting same-sex couples than almost any State in the Union, just didn't go far enough and it's being penalized for not going far enough. That's a very odd rationale on which to sustain this opinion.",
  "The problem -- the problem with the case is that you're really asking, particularly because of the sociological evidence you cite, for us to go into uncharted waters, and you can play with that metaphor, there's a wonderful destination, it is a cliff. Whatever that was.",
  "But you're -- you're doing so in a -- in a case where the opinion is very narrow. Basically that once the State goes halfway, it has to go all the way or 70 percent of the way, and you're doing so in a case where there's a substantial question on -- on standing. I just wonder if -- if the case was properly granted.",
  "But that's not the issue the Ninth Circuit decided.",
  "It was hundreds of years old in the common law countries. This was new to the United States.",
  "So -- so that's not accurate.",
  "And you might address why you think we should take and decide this case.",
  "In Federal court's jurisprudence, are you saying there's a lack of adversity here?",
  "Can you give us a pigeonhole?",
  "But it seems to me there -- there's injury here.",
  "But then why does he enforce the statute?",
  "But let me ask you, suppose that constitutional scholars have grave doubts about the practice of the President signing a bill, but saying that he thinks it's, unconstitutional -- what do you call it, signing statements or something like that. It seems to me that if we adopt your position that that would ratify and confirm and encourage that questionable practice because if the President thinks the law is unconstitutional he shouldn't sign it, according to some views. And that's a lot like what you're arguing here. It's very troubling.",
  "Well, that -- that assumes the premise. We didn't -- the House didn't know it was unconstitutional. I mean --",
  "We are talking about ex ante, not ex post, what is standing at the outset? And the House says this is constitutional.",
  "So you don't think that there is anything to the argument that in Chadha the House had its own unique institutional responsibilities and prerogatives at stake, either the one-house veto or the legislative veto?",
  "That's irrelevant?",
  "Under your view, would the Senate have the right to have standing to take the other side of this case, so we have the House on one side and the Senate on the other?",
  "Well, why not? They're concerned about the argument and you say that the House of Representatives standing alone can come into the court. Why can't the Senate standing alone come into court and intervene on the other side?",
  "That -- that would give you intellectual whiplash. I'm going to have to think about that.",
  "Well, it applies to over what, 1,100 Federal laws, I think we are saying. So it's not -- it's -- it's -- I think there is quite a bit to your argument that if it's a tax deduction case, which is specific, whether or not if Congress has the power it can exercise it for the reason that it wants, that it likes some marriage it does like, I suppose it can do that. But when it has 1,100 laws, which in our society means that the Federal government is intertwined with the citizens' day-to-day life, you are at -- at real risk of running in conflict with what has always been thought to be the essence of the State police power, which is to regulate marriage, divorce, custody.",
  "Well, but it's not really uniformity because it regulates only one aspect of marriage. It doesn't regulate all of marriage.",
  "But I – I see an illogic in your argument. I -- I hadn't thought of the relation between Section 2 and Section 3 in the way you just said. You said, now Section 2 was in order to help the States. Congress wanted to help the States. But then Section 3, that Congress doesn't help the States, which have come to the conclusion that gay marriage is lawful. So that's inconsistent.",
  "We're helping the States do -- if they do what we want them to, which is -- which is not consistent with the historic commitment of marriage and -- and of questions of -- of the rights of children to the State.",
  "Well, but your statute applies also to States where the voters have decided it.",
  "Well -- just to be clear, I think your answer is fair and rational. We've switched now from Federal power to rationality. There is -- there is a difference. We're talking -- I think we are assuming now that there is Federal power and asking about the -- the degree of scrutiny that applies to it. Or are we going back to whether there is a Federal power? They are -- they are intertwined.",
  "Well, I think -- I think it is a DOMA problem. The question is whether or not the Federal government, under our federalism scheme, has the authority to regulate marriage.",
  "You think Congress can use its powers to supercede the traditional authority and prerogative of the States to regulate marriage in all respects? Congress could have a uniform definition of marriage that includes age, consanguinity, et cetera, et cetera?",
  "Well, but then there is a federalism interest at stake here. And I thought you told the Chief Justice there was not.",
  "But you're -- you are insisting that we get to a very fundamental question about equal protection, but we don't do that unless we assume that the law is valid otherwise to begin with. And we are asking is it valid otherwise. Is -- what is the Federal interest in enacting this statute and is it a valid Federal interest assuming -- before we get to the equal protection analysis?",
  "Well, suppose you just stick with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, or perhaps not even a hypothetical, what happened in this case. Just assume that the defense attorney likes this judicial intervention and he -- he wants this to take place. It -- it seems quite unfair to talk about the plain error because he doesn't tell -- as Justice Ginsburg says, what does the defendant know about Rule 11(c)? He doesn't know about it.",
  "That's -- what happens under -- under the rule if the magistrate asked that the defendant be excused -- I don't know quite how you do that, the defendant has to be present. But can the -- can the judge just have the attorneys before him and say, now, I want you to be very, very clear that this is a mandatory minimum, that we should try to avoid if at all possible. Can he do that?",
  "It's awfully hard to have a hypothetical where you exclude the defendant.",
  "I -- I don't want to interrupt your opening because I think -- I just didn't hear your first -- \"by foregoing\"?",
  "By foregoing.",
  "I don't know when it can happen because there's no colloquy when there's a guilty plea. The colloquy happens when there's a not guilty plea.",
  "No, no -- you're correct. You're correct.",
  "From what you know and from what the record shows, would the process of tagging the isolated DNA be patentable? The process of tagging, we just don't know about that or is there a patent on that?",
  "Under our -- our law, is a patent ever divisible so that if it's valid in part but invalid in another part, it can still stand as to the part?",
  "But if you haven't challenged this, then -- then where are we with respect to the tagging? I don't quite understand. Because the -- the entire patent, which includes tagging, would fail under your argument.",
  "Well, I'm not sure the Court can decide the case on -- on that basis. I'm sure that there are substantial arguments in the amicus brief that this investment is necessary and that -- and that makes sense. To say, oh, well, the taxpayers will do it, don't worry, is, I think, an insufficient answer. As Justice Kagan's follow-up questions indicated, I thought you might say, well, there are process patents that they can have, that this is sufficient.",
  "But I -- I just don't think we can decide the case on the ground, oh, don't worry about investment, it'll come. I -- I just don't think we can do that. It may be that the law allows you to prevail on the fact that this is -- occurs in nature and there's nothing new here, but that's quite different.",
  "When I first looked at this case, I -- I thought that maybe the cDNA was kind of an economy class gene, was -- it wasn't. But my understanding is that it may have a functionality that the -- the DNA isolate does not, easier to tag, et cetera. That may be incorrect for the record, but that was my present understanding.",
  "Is all the tagging done on recombinant DNA?",
  "Well, suppose his understanding is correct. Suppose your misunderstanding -- suppose your understanding is not correct.",
  "But when you -- when you isolate the DNA, that by itself cannot be used as -- as a probe until you add tags and -- and other chemicals that make it probe.",
  "So it seemed to me your -- your answer was not quite accurate when you said, well, it can't be used in the body to detect breast cancer. Neither can the isolate without some additions.",
  "Now, if it's -- if it's the process or the additions that make it patentable, fine. But you're say that the moment it's snipped, it's patentable, and that it seems to me was -- was the point of Justice Kagan's question.",
  "Well, we could have said that with atomic energy, with electric, but so far the choice -- electricity -- but so far the choice of the patent was that we have a uniform rule for all industries.",
  "And -- and that avoids giving special industries special subsidies, which is very important it seems to me. Let me ask you this, and it's consistent with my -- my preface. If we were to accept the government's position that the DNA is not patentable but the cDNA is, would that give the industry sufficient protection for innovation and research? And if not, why not?",
  "Is it part of your argument that the city contracts with the port and then the port contracts with the truckers, but at that point, the ports are -- are confined in what they can do? There can be really no bargaining between the ports and the truckers based on what the city has already told the port?",
  "You are saying that you can do by contract what you cannot do by regulation. And I don't understand that argument when there are criminal penalties that attach to the breach of the contract.",
  "In -- in your view, at what point, at what date did the Indian father lose the right to ask for custody? Because he changed his mind in -- in January, there was about a 5-day period there.",
  "The adoption proceedings had not concluded.",
  "And at this point he said, in effect, I've changed my mind.",
  "So the State law determines when his rights under the Federal Act end?",
  "Well, and even in that sense, serious emotional and physical damage is a much different threshold than the best interests of the child, even on the statutory terms.",
  "And I -- and I take it you'll say that that goes back to this South Carolina court if you prevail?",
  "If the best interest of the child is the uniformly accepted standard in State courts, and if we forget constitutional avoidance problems which I -- I think exist here, is there anything in the statute that allows us to import the best interests of the child into the statutory language, or do we have to just rely on constitutional avoidance and -- and really rewrite the statute?",
  "And do you -- you want us to write the case as if this is just a standard best interest determination and -- and this federal statute is irrelevant? I don't understand your argument.",
  "Well, these -- these considerations are why domestic relations pose the hardest problems for judges. Our domestic relations judges all by themselves every day have these difficult problems. If we could appoint King Solomon, who was the first domestic relations judge, as special master, we could do it. But we can't do it.",
  "But is -- is that true under South Carolina law?",
  "Under South Carolina law in this adoption proceeding, the -- if it had not been for the statute, the best interest of the child standard would not have applied?",
  "But -- but -- did you -- at your -- when you began, do you use \"paternity\" in the biological sense?",
  "As -- as you -- as you interpret the statute, \"paternity is the biological sense,\" not -- not an --",
  "-- not an existing parental relationship.",
  "Well, but it's -- it's well settled that, when you're -- wherein you're examining the witness and he takes -- and he suddenly says, I don't want any more questions, that that's -- he's waived if you're in court, if you're examining a witness on the stand. So, against that background, suppose, in this case, the facts were just about the same, and he said what -- the police said, what would you do if we matched the shotgun shells? And he said -- he said, \"Well\" -- and then he starts to cry. He said one word, \"Well,\" and he started to cry. Admissible?",
  "Because he said, \"Well\"?",
  "But -- but could the police officer also testify that and then he started to cry?",
  "Or the prosecution could say, Well, he said, well, and started to cry, and he never told us anything else. That -- that final sentence that I used is impermissible?",
  "Is -- I don't want -- are you saying that, before the Miranda warning is required, you cannot invoke the Fifth Amendment?",
  "I mean -- that's -- that's how I understood that.",
  "I know you're not arguing that, but that's why I'm --",
  "Well, but it can be invoked, and that might make a big difference. In your -- in your brief, you acknowledge that most citizens know they have a Fifth Amendment right.",
  "And so if there's -- if questions are somehow troublesome, you say, I'm invoking my Fifth Amendment right; go away, even if you're not in custody, even if Miranda doesn't apply.",
  "And your client didn't do that here.",
  "You're -- you're giving us Miranda, not Miranda, custody, not custody, gray area. That -- that's what you're arguing. You want a gray area opinion to be written?",
  "Well, but, in Berghuis, we found no implication.",
  "So -- so Justice Kagan's question stands.",
  "Well, a few, as I recall.",
  "Well, what is your answer to Justice Kagan's earlier question to -- of the hypothetical of the defendant that says nothing for 20 questions?",
  "Then there's no -- and there's no Miranda warning and no custody.",
  "The discussion so far has assumed, your discussion primarily, that there's this line between civil and criminal, we don't need to worry about ex post facto. Is that line made clear in our precedents or is there some room to argue that if the line is somewhat blurred that there may be ex post facto concerns here and that that in turn is a reason for constitutional avoidance when we evaluate your argument? Is that -- is the civil -- a criminal distinction with reference to Ex Post Facto Clause absolutely foreclosed and clear in the facts of this case?",
  "In other words, they're preempted, but the whole purpose of the preemption can be thwarted.",
  "But -- but quite apart from -- from that, it -- it seems to me that under your proposal the Congress would actually have accepted a situation where one spouse sues a former spouse. In other words, you have a -- that's the whole design of this statute. Would the insurance company -- if you were representing the insurance company, would you tell the insurance company that they were completely safe in paying the benefits to the first spouse even if there's going to be a suit afterwards?",
  "Or would the insurance company itself be under some liability?",
  "That's the design of the statute.",
  "But I'm just wondering whether under State law the insurance company, if it -- if it knows this doesn't have some duty to refrain from making the payment or to put it in escrow or to interplead.",
  "And if you're representing the insurance company, you wouldn't say you better interplead to be on the safe side?",
  "In the -- in the Wissner case, there was a community property State. Do you know, under the statute we're dealing with here, is community property in those States also preempted so that the -- the insured is the sole owner of the policy?",
  "Because it was a specific provision on that point in Wissner, and I -- or the Court so read it. And I take it the same provision applies -- exists in this statute?",
  "But your -- your concern is there might be fraudulent wills?",
  "Well, it seems to me that's grasping at straws.",
  "One -- one thing before your time is up. I have the same concerns that Justice Ginsburg expressed about the difficulty of simply creating structures in -- in foreign countries. If -- and I've looked through all of your cases. What's your closest case -- your best case for the fact that you should get extra deference because this is the foreign affairs field? I mean, I think of U.S. v. Curtis Wright. Anything more specific than that?",
  "But let -- let me -- let me ask you this: Suppose that you're a Congressman or a Congresswomen, and you are a constitutional expert, and you take your oath to uphold the Constitution very seriously. A funding bill comes before you. You're the chairman of the committee, and you decide that you're going to fund A, rather than B, because you like their speech much better. Is that a violation of the Constitution?",
  "Because you like their policies much better?",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not quite sure I -- I see the difference, that the -- a conscientious Congressperson cannot -- can, in your view, say, I'm going to prefer organization A over organization B because I like their policies better --",
  "-- across the board, with reference to drugs, with reference to guns, with reference to public health.",
  "Let me -- let me just ask -- ask this one more time. It seems -- because it seems to me that, when you get into the details of your answer, you indicate, oh, well, the government has lots of other criteria it could use, which seems to me just an invitation to disguise what the government's real motive is. Suppose the government's interested in preventing and stopping the spread of malaria. And there's an organization that's marvelous at delivering the proper message for this, but they criticize the United States often. So they choose an organization that's not quite as good, but is quiet on these other issues. Is that permissible for the Congress to do?",
  "Well, this isn't -- no. My concern was that your position was pretext. Here, the Congress is right upfront.",
  "And they say, the reason we're not giving to organization A is because it's always critical of the United States, even though its technical skills are better, we prefer organization B. Congress cannot do that?",
  "And your best case for that proposition is what?",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not sure they should if they're going to -- if they're going to be able to establish the principle that allows them to prevail in this case, and that's why I'm asking.",
  "It's -- it's my understanding that there is a place where Texas can put a line into the river, and then a subset of that question is, the main stem of the river, through -- without going through Oklahoma property, other than perhaps just the bank itself.",
  "But you say entirely within Oklahoma, just because of ownership of the bank?",
  "Or because of there's also some intervening property between Texas and the bank that Oklahoma owns?",
  "Do -- do the current laws prohibit that --",
  "At any point?",
  "Well, I -- I am not quite sure I agree with your reading of the Court of Appeals' opinion. It seems to me the Court of Appeals' opinion is consistent with the Respondents' argument that they looked at the terms of the Compact. And it seems to me that you may be right that the Compact either says you get the water or you don't, and the dormant Commerce Clause is just irrelevant. But I read the opinion of the court of appeals as being quite consistent with that proposition. You win or you lose, up or down, under the Compact. The dormant Commerce Clause doesn't -- just doesn't have much to do with it.",
  "But that's the way I read the analytic approach of the court of appeals at 39A, when it starts talking about the point of -- Section 5.05.",
  "Just to be clear, in your view, Texas can, without going on Oklahoma property, take water from the main stem in Basin 5?",
  "But my question was, can they take it from the main stem --",
  "Is that the part that, under their allegation at least, is saline?",
  "All right. Is that the part that --",
  "-- they are referring to --",
  "-- when they say it's too saline?",
  "Well, this is a -- a perfectly legitimate argument for you to make, but I want to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question. At least as I understood it, it's this, I want you to assume -- I know you don't agree with that -- I want you to assume that the Compact gives Texas a right to 25 percent of the -- of the excess - - of the water above the cubic foot.",
  "I want you to assume that. Now, wouldn't the Compact be meaningless if Texas couldn't actually reach that water?",
  "If the jury had -- had returned the verdict, which is at JA142, and it had marked that the attempt to extort was to extort the commitment, you might still maybe have some causation arguments, but I assume the property argument you're about to make is just irrelevant.",
  "Could -- could the case have been indicted -- has it been charged as one in which what they were taking was the commissions that would ultimately have been generated?",
  "Well, here, what the Petitioner wanted were the commissions, ultimately. And you can't commit extortion in order to get -- and that's real money. It's for the Government to answer, not you, but can -- do you have any idea why they didn't charge that?",
  "I see. I see.",
  "Well, I took you away from your argument about intangible property.",
  "Well, just let me make sure that I understand your position. Suppose roughly these facts, the general counsel is threatened with something very serious, let's say violence, unless he makes a favorable recommendation. He does. They act on that recommendation, it's -- it's a substantial cause in making the investment, and the investment is made and they get the money. Violation?",
  "Well, but -- but that's a causation argument, not whether or not you received property.",
  "But so far as the property point in my hypothetical, if the recommendation leads to the contract and the contract leads to the commission and the commission means money in your pocket, that's property.",
  "And so then we just have a causation argument, not a property argument.",
  "Just to add to Justice Breyer's question, it's -- suppose the secretary/typist is -- the stenographer is charged with typing the letter \"I do not recommend\" and they bribe her and she says \"I recommend.\" She has an interest in her integrity to give an honest transcription. Under your view, and this is what Justice Breyer is getting at, I think, that -- that secretary has property that you are taking. That's very far-reaching.",
  "It -- it does seem to me important that you can't give us a common law case because common law is extortion -- at common law is extortion, it's usually the other way around. It's usually the official who's doing the extorting.",
  "At -- at common law, could anyone ever extort an official, or we just don't have those cases?",
  "Do -- do you agree with the government's position that the limited affirmative defense provisions Congress enacted, that is to say, limited damages when there's multiple or mixed motives, would also apply to retaliation cases?",
  "But I thought -- I thought the thrust of Justice Alito's question was that retaliation claims are -- are now quite common, and they can almost be used as a defensive -- as a defense when you know you are about to be hired. And, if that's true, shouldn't we be very careful about the causation standard?",
  "And so -- so that -- that was the thrust of -- of his question.",
  "Well, but under -- under that analysis, you don't need the final clause on page 17a of your brief of 3, \"because he has opposed.\" Race is enough.",
  "Was the 1973 case that you mentioned based on a statute, or was it based on, allegedly, a vacuum that the statutory structure allowed the court to fill? I mean, is that the way the 1973 case came about? And was the 1973 case followed by other courts? Or was it just an isolated precedent?",
  "Are there any States with a statute identical or -- or close to the Michigan statute that have interpreted the statute to say it does include diminished capacity?",
  "This statute is -- fairly well tracks the common law tradition, which indicates that diminished capacity is not a defense.",
  "I'm just curious to know if any State courts have reached an opposite conclusion under a statute like this.",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm a little surprised at your answer, and Justice Scalia's question indicates the same. If the law was as well settled as you say it was in the appellate courts, then it seems to me, certainly, counsel should raise it and is arguably deficient for not doing so. Whether or not he'll prevail at the end of the day is something quite different.",
  "If you -- if you prevail here, it may well change the dynamic for State supreme courts. State supreme courts, much like us, they wait until courts of appeals have issued their opinions. They wait to see how the practical application of those works, insofar as of the fairness of the trial. They wait to see about scholarly commentaries, and then they -- and then they take the case. If you prevail, State supreme courts are -- are going to say -- you know, if we don't take this case, even though it's -- does not present the issue as clearly as some late case might, we don't rush in, then we're going to be foreclosed. I think you're proposing a dynamic which makes the Federal courts intrude on the way in which State courts choose to develop their law.",

  "I agree. And I'm asking what is the rationale that you would use to answer Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical in the ­­ in the opinion for the Court that is ruling in your favor?",
  "And my question is whether or not by creating Mercedes U.S., Daimler didn't purposely avail itself of the forum?",
  "Because?",
  "Just as a way of getting you to state your general theory of the case, let me ask you, do you have a recommendation as to whether or not we should remand this case? If we accept your theory of the case, which I'll let you explain, does that require a remand?",
  "And that is because?",
  "Under tradition, if you have the universe of agent and principal, an independent contractor, is the subsidiary of the latter or is it something ­­ is it some third ­­ some third animal?",
  "Generally, if you have a ­­ a corporate parent and a subsidiary, do we usually think of a subsidiary as an agent?",
  "Do we think of it as ­­ what do we think about it as? An independent contractor? Or just something else?",
  "Well, I ­­ I understood the concession as being, that if Mercedes were the only corporation involved in this dispute, there would be specific ­­ sufficient contacts. That ­­ that doesn't tell me anything about Daimler.",
  "I'm ­­ I'm not so sure that this concession is that troublesome for Daimler.",
  "So how does that answer the question about Daimler?",
  "There has been one?",
  "But I think their concession is quite consistent with the proposition that the distinction between parent and subsidiary is meaningful for jurisdictional purposes. And that you're not just automatically an agent ­­ you, yourself, do not defend the Ninth Circuit's position that, if Daimler gives enough functions to Mercedes that it has to give, that then Daimler is ­­ is liable. You don't ­­ your footnote, I think page 35 of your brief, you ­­ you don't take the Ninth Circuit's reasoning to its full extent.",
  "Well, while you're on Seattle, can you ­­ I have difficulty distinguishing Seattle. One factual difference is that there was a school board there, a directly­elected school board elected for a short term of years. Here there's a board of trustees. Is that ­­ is that the distinguish ­­ a distinguishing factor in the case in which a principal distinction could be made?",
  "But you're saying there ­­ there are three things. One, the first you reject.",
  "The law was a racial focus.",
  "Okay. And the second was an incremental improvement in the ­­ in the democratic process ­­ or democratic responsibility?",
  "Responsiveness, I guess.",
  "And was there a third, did you say?",
  "That, it seemed to me a good distinction for Hunter and Mulkey v. Reitman, which the briefs don't talk much about.",
  "But not necessarily a distinction in Seattle because Seattle you could argue, well, there are other methods that are less racially divisive.",
  "What would you do with a constitutional amendment that said pro­affirmative action laws, and only those, require a three­quarters vote of the State legislature?",
  "Well, there are two things. Number one is it delegated to the faculty. And number two, they're election ­­ they're elected only rarely and in staggered terms.",
  "Well, I'm not sure I understood the answer you gave to the Chief Justice's hypothetical. Maybe I misunderstood the hypothetical. Suppose the board of regents have a rule, it's written, it's a rule, that the faculty makes a determination on whether there should be affirmative action.",
  "Five ­­ and the faculty votes for affirmative action. Three years later, the board of trustees said we're abolishing the rule, we're doing that ourselves. Violation?",
  "So the ­­ so the regents can take it away from the faculty?",
  "But can the legislature take it away from the regents?",
  "No, no. Hypothetical case.",
  "But then the voters can't take it away. At what point is it that your objection takes force? I just don't understand ­­ I just don't understand ­­",
  "­­ the declension here ­­",
  "Or the crescendo, whatever you call it.",
  "That applies in the Chief Justice's hypothetical or my revision of it as between the board of regents and the faculty, or between the faculty and the legislature.",
  "Why is ­­ why is the faculty administration, a faculty decision, any less outcome determinative than what the voters would say? I ­­ I think there would be people that might disagree with your empirical assumption.",
  "But I still don't understand your answer to Justice Alito's question. Suppose the dean has authority in the bylaws of the university to reverse what the faculty does, but you have a dean who just does not like affirmative action. He is dead against it. And he makes the decision to reverse the faculty. Do you have a remedy?",
  "All right. Then you have Justice Alito's question. Then it's the president of the university, and then it's the legislature.",
  "Is there any evidence in other circuits that have this same rule that ­­ that the approach the Respondents advocate has caused difficulties and disruption and unfairness?",
  "But in this case, as Justice Ginsburg indicated at the outset, there was a period of, I think, just over a year, in which it was very clear that the administrative process had ended and nothing happened. I don't see the unfairness in the application of the rule in this case.",
  "Well, but there is also certainty and fairness in processing the claim, and when evidence is lost, especially in cases where employees who were key witnesses have likely departed, that's another very important consideration.",
  "Those are general statutes, so they would be preempted just in this class of claims. So lawyers would have to know that this statute is still valid for many purposes, but not for",
  "But then you have ­­ you have lack of uniformity within the State on when these claims must be brought under an insurance policy.",
  "It's fair to say, in other words, that it's typical in the insurance industry that statute of limitations run from proof of loss?",
  "From occurrence? Occurrence ­­",
  "In your view, what weight does the court ­­ the trial court in this hearing, give to the fact of the indictment?",
  "So no weight. We've now had a hearing, I ignore the indictment, and let's have a trial. That's your position?",
  "No. I would think the government has the burden of proof.",
  "What about ­­ what about a detention hearing? Same rule?",
  "It would be the government under a detention hearing ­­ pardon me. The trial court under the detention hearing ignores the fact of the indictment?",
  "And it was a case with very substantial documents, et cetera?",
  "Is that how they interpret weight of the evidence at this ­­ the Bail Reform Act says that the trial judge must determine weight of the evidence. And in practice, and perhaps in reported decisions in the circuit, do the courts say we don't need to talk about weight of the evidence once there's a grand jury indictment ­­",
  "­­ end of inquiry?",
  "I'm asking, perhaps not too clearly, I'm asking what function, what weight, what relevance do courts give in day­to­day hearings on detention to the Bail Reform Act requirement that judges must determine, as part of the bail determination, the weight of the evidence?",
  "But ­­ but that's two different things. Is the only thing the judge considers the risk of flight?",
  "So then don't talk about risk of flight. What weight does the judge give in determining whether or not the charges have merit to the Bail Reform Act's direction that he must determine the weight of the evidence?",
  "I understand that.",
  "But the court must determine that under the Bail Reform Act.",
  "No ­­",
  "Do you concede that there must be a traceability hearing?",
  "I mean, in the general run case, so you agree that due process does require a traceability hearing?",
  "And the defendants have the burden of proof in that hearing?",
  "What­ what is your view as to what the Constitution requires in that respect?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, one other question. It's the question I asked before. I still don't understand. Under the Bail Reform Act, the issue is pretrial detention. The defendant says, Your Honor, under the Bail Reform Act, you must determine the weight of the evidence, and this is a skimpy case. The judge says, the grand jury is all I need as probable cause. Can and do judges say that? Does that",
  "Well, if it's required anyway, then certainly the due process argument that you make is much less weighty. If we have to go through this anyway for detention, why not do it for distraint of property?",
  "Well, but just ­­ I have the same concern as Justice Scalia. I mean, that makes your case easier, but it seems to me that the defendant puts his mental capacity in issue and then testifies himself, but with no expert, the State can still call its own expert so far as the ­­ so far as the Federal constitution is concerned. There might be some Kansas rules about it.",
  "If I could just make ­­ it seems to me that it's not necessary to make our decision depend on whether or not another expert has been called. That makes your case easier. And sometimes, when we write opinions, we take the easiest route. But I take it, under your theory, even if the defendant had not called his own expert, we would still have the same issue before the Court, and you would take the position that a prosecution expert can testify. Now, whether or not he can use the previous statement, that's ­­ that's the second point.",
  "But ­­ but why doesn't it settle the matter as a ­­ as you understand the case that's being presented ­­ as a constitutional matter? Sure. Kansas may have some rules, maybe the judges say I'm not going to hear this, this ­­ this is a State rule, but insofar as the ­­ the Federal constitution is concerned, why doesn't that settle it?",
  "Well, we're going ­­ we're going right back ­­ the defense expert here peered into his mind. It's set out in the appendix. It's confusing because there's a Dr. Evans and also an Attorney Evans.",
  "But the ­­ the expert is Dr. Evans. He peers into the defendant's mind. Now, are ­­ is this case any different and any better for you because it happened in State court? Suppose everything here happened in the Federal court, would you have a constitutional objection?",
  "And that constitutional objection would be?",
  "So in your view ­­ in your view, the defendant can be interviewed by his own psychiatrist, but not by a prosecution psychiatrist?",
  "Can you give me the ­­ can you give me the black letter formulation that you are asking this Court to adopt? It violates the Fifth Amendment when?",
  "Well, that's something of an overstatement because he also had the psychiatrist who testified that, in his expert opinion, he did not have the requisite mental state, and he ­­ and he prefaced that by indicating how many people he had examined that had used meth and there was neurotoxicity, so this defense expert did testify to that.",
  "So I think you quite overstate when you say the fact the defendant testified.",
  "Except you would look and say, those clothes probably have something special underneath them. I mean, in ordinary parlance I think that would be a proper use of diction.",
  "But in ­­ in this case, it was known ­­ or should have been known that these were gamblers; they were in Nevada. That's where a lot of ­­ that's where their gambling takes place. They were residents of Nevada. So in that sense, they were like the plaintiff in ­­ in Calder. The injury was there, and the defendant arguably knew or should have known that that's where its major impact would be. I recognize your point that, when you take money away, then you're inconvenienced in any State where you happen to be, but there was an argument here ­­ it seems to me there is an argument here that this was gambling, and these people were from Nevada, and so you've ­­ this ­­ this curtails their right or ­­ or their option to conduct ­­ to conduct their activities in ­­ in Nevada.",
  "Let me ask this ­­ and it's probably clear in the briefs. Is ­­ is the gravamen of the complaint the seizure at the airport or the later false affidavit? Because, to the extent it's the later false affidavit, that cuts against you marginally.",
  "Do we know how much of the information ­­ the supplemental information that was prepared in Nevada and then was forwarded to Georgia, how much of that information was in the affidavit?",
  "Could this record or these complaints be read to support the conclusion that the injury was substantially altered by the false affidavit, based on the misuse of the information received from Nevada?",
  "Does it help your answer or ­­ or does it limit the theory of your case too much to say that, in this case, there is a controversy satisfying the declaratory judgment rules because the patentholder gave notice of potential ­­ or of infringement? Am I right about that?",
  "Now, could we ­­ or should we make the case turn on that, or can we say, with declaratory judgment, there has to be a dispute, we ­­ we know that a dispute is likely, a controversy, so the formality of a notice is not important.",
  "Well, it goes to me to ­­ a basic question of fairness. When I picked up this case, I thought, how is the patentholder supposed to know what all these new inventions are? What does it know about it? But then I answered my own question by saying, well, it gave notice of infringement. But ­­ that's why I've asked if the notice is essential to your position?",
  "I don't ­­ I don't understand. Suppose the licensee says, this isn't covered by the agreement at all, we're not going to pay you anything. And it starts to manufacture its products. That's ­­ that's the whole point. That’s outside the agreement, they are not going to pay you anything.",
  "Or am I missing something?",
  "Well, there would have been infringement if you had refused to pay the royalty, and ­­",
  "And if they had refused to pay the royalty and you were covered, then ­­ then there would have been infringement.",
  "All right. I understand.",
  "If you had been the President's counsel, would you have advised him that it was unconstitutional to sign this treaty as written?",
  "Is it ­­ is it one way to characterize your argument or is it too unfairly confining to your argument to say that what you're suggesting is something like a clear statement rule, that, if the treaty intends nation states to have their own constitutional structure superseded at a minimum, it has to say so, and then we will come to the question of whether or not they can do it?",
  "It also seems unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution. But let's leave that.",
  "But you did not give the line to the Chief Justice's question where there was a treaty that intruded on the Federal structure. You can have a treaty where the President is required to set aside any State law that, in his view, contravenes a national interest. That's a structure problem. You've ­­ you've given us no ­­ no principle the other way.",
  "Well, is it your precept, then, that a treaty cannot be inconsistent with our constitutional structure?",
  "Well, what would have been the ruling, do you think ­­ what would have been the correct ruling if you had filed your Federal action while the case was still ­­ the issue was still pending before the Iowa board? In other words, before the State judicial review process kicked in? Would the ­­ would your analysis of the case be the same or would we apply a different ­­",
  "Because it would be an ­­ because it would be Burford at that point or what?",
  "And you're asking for $10,000 for each one?",
  "You're asking for $10,000 for each one?",
  "Are there parens patriae actions where the State attorney general brings the action in what is really a suit on behalf of private parties? And, if so, do you call it private parens patriae?",
  "In other words, parens patriae has to have ­­ you have to ask for restitution?",
  "Well, that means that it could happen?",
  "Well, as a matter of efficiency ­­ take the Chief Justice's hypo, the hypothetical and back it up. The moment the class is certified, why can't the attorney general join it and say, now, our interest is a little different, but it's so much the same that we want to join it, and we want to join it as parens patriae. Would that prevent its removal?",
  "Suppose it's a given that we all concede that the complaint is both for private­named persons and for restitution. Both. What result?",
  "No, the rest of my hypothetical, part of the restitution goes to the State.",
  "Where's the language?",
  "I have 79.",
  "Why ­­ why was it that you so promptly answered Justice Kagan's question to the effect that this would be a violation? What ­­ why would there be a violation in the instance she put?",
  "The first question Justice Kagan asked you, the hypothetical about the prayer in this Court. You seemed readily to agree that that would be a First Amendment violation. Why?",
  "Well, is it ­­ is it simply history that makes ­­ there's no rational explanation? It's just a historical aberration?",
  "Well, what's ­­ what's the justification for the distinction?",
  "Well, if we had a ­­ if we had a series of cases, what ­­ what is a ­­ a utility rate­making board would come to the Supreme Court. We say, well, it's enough like a legislative that it's like Marsh. But I don't think the public would understand that.",
  "Well, the essence of the argument is we've always done it this way, which has some ­­ some force to it. But it seems to me that your argument begins and ends there.",
  "Of course, your ­­ your test is whether or not ­­ part of your test ­­ is whether or not it advances religion. If you ask a chaplain for the State assembly in Sacramento, California, who's going to go to the assembly to deliver a prayer, are you going to advance your religion today, would he say, oh, no?",
  "So ­­ so you ­­ you use the word \"advance\" only as modified by \"proselytize\"?",
  "Because that's ­­ that's not what your ­­ your brief says, \"does not proselytize or advance.\"",
  "But that's that the test you want us to adopt and ­­",
  "­­ I'm asking whether or not it is, in fact, honest and candid and fair to ask the minister or ­­ or the priest or the chaplain or the rabbi if, by appearing there, he or she seeks to advance their religion?",
  "If not, I'm not quite sure why they're there.",
  "And if I'm ­­ if I'm that official and I think a prayer was over the top for being proselytizing and particularly sectarian, I would say I rather not ­­ you not come back next week; I am going to look for somebody else?",
  "Well, so in other words, the government is now editing the content of prayers?",
  "Well, I just want to make sure what your position ­­ your position is that town councils like Greece can have prayers if they are non­provocative, modest, decent, quiet, non­proselytizing. That's your position?",
  "It just seems to me that enforcing that standard and the standard I suggested involves the State very heavily in the censorship and ­­ and the approval or disapproval of prayers.",
  "That may play, ultimately, in your position if we say that that's why there shouldn't be any prayer at all. But then you have the problem mentioned by Justice Scalia that we are misrepresenting who we really are.",
  "Should we write that in a concurring opinion?",
  "I mean, I'm serious about this. This ­­ this involves government very heavily in religion.",
  "In a way, it sounds quite elitist to say, well, now, we can do this in Washington and Sacramento and Austin, Texas, but you people up there in Greece can't do that.",
  "Is one of the limitations in the statute where it says, in sub (1), \"to provide information relating to fraud against shareholders\"?

  "The shareholders ­­ in other words, does \"shareholder\" apply just to the publicly registered company?",
  "You would think so.",
  "So \"fraud against shareholders\" just modifies the last clause or any provision of Federal law?",
  "Well, you say ­­ you say this is ­­ this is a mainstream application. We still have to give a rule. Do we write in the opinion, this is a mainstream application case and therefore it is so confined? That ­­ that doesn't make any sense.",
  "Well, that ­­ that was your second point. Your first point was just talk about the mainstream in this case and leave other cases. But I don't see how you can do that and interpret the statute. That's what I'm asking. Your statutory interpretation rule to keep this the mainstream is what?",
  "I understand that and I ­­ I think that's a plausible reading. I don't see how it's confined to so­called mainstream, which is what we were talking about.",
  "That was fraud under 1343?",
  "Well, was that what the fraud was in this ­­",
  "But the language did talk about Arthur Andersen and Enron.",
  "Do you agree that the jury could find the defendant guilty of the firearms charge under a proper instruction? In other words, was there sufficient evidence so that if a proper instruction were given, there could have been a conviction?",
  "Well, I guess we can get into later to whether or not if you know a firearm is being carried and if you then facilitate the commission of the underlying felony by driving the car, participating in the transaction, whether that's sufficient. But let me ask you this: Would the instruction that was given, which was at JA 196, would it be okay if Paragraph 1, \"The defendant knew his cohort used a firearm,\" I think there is a real problem with that, because it's retrospective. Would the instruction have been sufficient if the defendant knew his cohort would use or was carrying? Would that change it?",
  "Justice Scalia can protect ­­ his own question. But the question is: What ­­ what does the jury have to find? I know they can ­­ I know what they can infer, but the question from Justice Scalia is, you're the ­­ you drive ­­ you drive the car, you know firearms are there and might be used, is that sufficient? And that's his question.",
  "Well, that's ­­ that's a conclusion. The jury, it seems to me, could say you do facilitate it if in these hypotheticals you drive the car ­­",
  "­­ with knowledge that the gun might be used.",
  "Well, the submission is",
  "The ­­ the gun would never have been used if you didn't drive the ­­ or carried if you didn't drive the car.",
  "I am too.",
  "I just didn't ­­ you said the only evidence was that it was inside the gun?",
  "And what was the evidence? I thought there was evidence that he possessed cartridges.",
  "And was there any evidence that he had the gun?",
  "I mean, was the evidence that he had the gun and the evidence of the cartridges are exactly the same?",
  "But do we have cases that say that assisting flight immediately after the crime is not aiding and abetting the crime? The crime is over? So everybody says the crime's over. Let's ­­ let's walk home.",
  "No. I think it would help if you told us what the definition of the crime is. We'll talk about the jury instructions later. Justice Scalia is asking whether or not if you facilitate the drug crime knowing that a weapon is being carried, if that is sufficient for aiding and abetting as a legal matter? Forget the jury instructions.",
  "I just want to make clear, and we'll get back to the bank robbery hypothetical. Driving the car, knowing that a gun is being carried and might be used, is or is not sufficient facilitation to make you an aider and abetter in the drug ­­ in the gun aspect of the crime?",
  "But you are not carrying. Your ­­ your cohort is carrying the gun.",
  "You are driving the car, the cohort has the gun, the cohort is going to rob the bank. Are you or are you not aiding and abetting because you're facilitating it by driving the car, yes or no?",
  "But this instruction at J196 says that the defendant \"knew his cohort used a firearm.\" It really should say that \"knew his cohort would carry a firearm.\"",
  "Because as I ­­ when I read this, I thought, well, given these confusing facts, a jury might think that there's liability if he knew that a firearm was used, which is a very odd interpretation, but that's ­­ the instruction lends itself to that interpretation.",
  "But do you agree that, taken by itself, that one could be read that way?",
  "I said taken by itself.",
  "Yes.",
  "Look at his ­­ look at his instruction and think about the bank robbery hypothetical with the driver of the car. His number 2 is that they intentionally took some action to facilitate or encourage the use of the firearm. I think that would be an okay instruction in the bank robbery hypothetical.",
  "He drove the car. Principal object was to rob the bank, not to use the firearm, but he facilitated the use of a firearm. I can see that a judge could give that instruction.",
  "And ­­ and you agree that for aiding and abetting, you must ­­ the gun offense, you must have knowledge that the gun is being carried by the cohort.",
  "You agree with that.",
  "Would you agree that in order to show aiding and abetting ­­ and I'll just quote from a California case here ­­ that, \"The aider and abetter has to have knowledge of the criminal purpose of the perpetrator and the intent to facilitate it\"?",
  "Would you ­­ would you agree that the statement ­­ that the first part of the instruction that the district court gave, \"defendant knew his cohort used a firearm,\" is inaccurate? Is incomplete?",
  "Potentially misleading?",
  "Suppose her friend is a forensics professor at the law school.",
  "And she said, you know, I'm concerned there might be evidence of a crime here; I don't want any part of it, I want you to give me your expert opinion on that.",

  "What happens next? What happens next for ten hours, ten days? He was in custody for 500 plus days and for all that time, the co­tenant, the wife, cannot invite the police to look for a shotgun where the four­year­old knows that it is and she may not know how to handle the weapon? She can't get a policeman to assist her for 500 days? This is not Randolph. This is a vast extension of Randolph.",
  "But Justice Breyer's question was very carefully phrased to indicate, at least to me, that there was no probable cause. You're asking the property owner to invoke a legal form that is itself highly invasive. She doesn't want a warrant. She wants the police to come in for advice.",
  "He was in jail for 500­plus days, and you're saying that for all that time, the co­occupant has no complete control over the premises.",
  "Well, when you say the ­­ the police prohibit him from exercising that right, there was an arraignment before a magistrate. The judicial system ordered him ­­ ordered him confined.",
  "I think the property law cases that you cite, pages 24­25 of your brief, I had thought originally that this would be the principal focus of our decisions in these cases, but it's ­­ it's marginally in your favor. It's not really very strong. I mean, you have an 1839 North Carolina case and the CJS case. There's just not a lot of help in property law.",
  "So the cotenant has much less authority to allow people to enter if her other cotenant is ­­ is a criminal than if he's a law­abiding citizen? That's the result.",
  "That's ­­ that's the result of the way you allocate the rights and duties of the cotenant who allows the ­­ the person to enter.",
  "No, no. The law­abiding citizen says I'm going away for three days, don't let anybody in the house, but the cotenant can overcome that, but not in the case of the ­­ well, I'm interrupting your ­­ your rebuttal.",
  "I ­­ I think there's substantial force to that argument. But can we talk just about property for a minute, just in the abstract? Isn't it true that what you have might become property when you trade it? If you take a picture of a celebrity on a street, that­­ that's your right to do so. But you can't sell it. Maybe that's not quite the ­­ the right analogy. But here, what, as­­ as you point out, is fairly standard in labor relations, has been turned into property, arguably, by the parties. Could­­ Could the parties say that we'll pay you ­­ the employer say we'll pay you $100,000 to get out of the recognition agreement? That would be property in an economist sense. Now, it might be a violation of the Labor Act.",
  "But in the abstract, wouldn't that be property?",
  "And isn't the thing that's exchanged for the money also property?",
  "I'm just talking about common definition, a common agreement as to what property means.",

  "In other words, this kind of an agreement is very rare?",
  "It's hard to think that one really pays or lends or delivers, which is are statutory words, neutrality of speech.",
  "Well, then, let me just make clear where we are. Suppose we ­­ or at least I, were to conclude that the court of appeals was right, that it is for the Judicial Branch to decide whether there is an arbitration agreement and duty to arbitrate. Then I were to further conclude that, given Argentina's position, they have waived the judicial requirement and that this arbitration should proceed. I can't reach that second question because it wasn't raised.",

  "Suppose we read Estelle as saying that, on the issue of remorse, it is an open question whether or not the self­incrimination privilege is applicable. Suppose we read it that way.

  "But, again, as Justice Ginsburg questions, it seems to me indicates, there are two different axes here. One is the best interest of the child, and the other is an adequate deterrent so that parents don't abduct. But those axes don't cross very often, if at all.",
  "But that still ­­ but Article 13 still is different from what's in the best interest of the child.",

  "In many cases, this would be an example. The cost of experts to testify about the child's adoption or adaption or settlement in New York would be very substantial. The experts who had examined the child, the experts who knew about the school, the school's officials themselves, would all have to go to England to testify. Is that a factor that the courts consider, or is that not ­­ not relevant?",

  "And I'm ­­ I'm asking the justification for that under the First Amendment.",
  "In ­­ in an era where government is getting bigger and bigger, and this is becoming more and more of an important issue to more people.",
  "Well, you say it's a fair share, but that's the issue in the case if you're looking at the legitimacy of Abood.",
  "I mean, you say it's fair share. The objectors to Abood say that it isn't.",
  "Suppose the young person thinks that the State is squandering his heritage on unnecessary and excessive payments for benefits and wages. Is that not a political belief of the highest order? And ­­ you know, we talk about free riders, which is an epithetical phrase. Maybe the objecting employee would say that the union is a speech distorter; it is taking views that are not his and making them mandatory subject to bargaining and charging him for it.",
  "So your position is that the public employees must surrender a substantial amount of First Amendment rights to work for the government?",
  "Well, then ­­ then ­­ you said both are subject to equitable consideration. We're told by the Petitioner that the equitable rule of laches simply can't apply. I was going to ask: Estoppel applies; why isn't laches just a first cousin of estoppel? Estoppel is an affirmative misrepresentation. Why isn't laches here almost a misrepresentation? And I don't understand the difference between laches and estoppel in this respect. Estoppel was an equitable remedy that's been taken into the law.",
  "But suppose sitting on your rights amounted really to an affirmative representation. It seems to me very close, close enough so that I'm not sure that we should distinguish between laches and estoppel as being, so that the ­­ so that the former is unavailable at all.",
  "Can you tell us, in response to Justice Alito's second part of his question about the other cases ­­ you talked about the two Supreme Court cases. You said, if you read every Federal decision, since the beginning of time ­­",
  "Assume ­­ assume we have an interest, just assume we do, in not having too many suits simply to protect your rights in ­­ in cases where the copyright may not be worth much or may not be well­established. Which rule, yours or the Petitioner's, is more helpful in this regard?",
  "Could you finish answering my question?",
  "Correct me if ­­ if I'm wrong. I might be missing something. The tip in J.L. was not a ­­ did not assert that a crime was being committed, so there was something suspicious. There was no crime in possession of the gun. Or correct me if I'm wrong.",
  "But ­­ but here ­­ here, there was ­­ the report was a crime. Or is that not a correct distinction?",
  "Well ­­",
  "But ­­ but the tip, in and of itself, did not indicate that a crime was being committed, which is different from this case.",
  "No, I'm talking about an interpretation of what the tip said.",
  "No, a Terry stop.",
  "You might have had grounds for a Terry stop.",
  "Well, I ­­ I think there's a difference, but I think, for our purposes, we can assume that the cases are comparable in that respect ­­",
  "­­ but not comparable, perhaps, in others.",
  "You get an A for consistency. I'm ­­ I'm not sure about common sense.",
  "What is your position what you would do if you were on this Court, with those hypotheticals? What is your position that should happen in those two hypotheticals?",
  "What is your position as to what the Court should do in those cases?",
  "I understand it, but we're interested in a hypothetical.",
  "In this case, your ­­ your grade for consistency depends on this answer.",
  "Your grade for consistency depends on this answer.",
  "Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but my recollection of Hensley is, you're right, the police department 1 notifies police department 2. But a premise of the case, I had thought, was that police department 1 had reasonable suspicion.",
  "I understand that.",
  "Could you explain to me one more time why it's relevant that there were these details that it was a particular kind of crime, that it was silver, the license plate, that's this case. Suppose in another case, a car just ran me off the road, and it's the only ­­ the only car that's on Highway 1 between Fort Bragg and the state park.",
  "And incidentally ­­ it doesn't have much to do with the case ­­ is this a two ­­ a two­lane road?",
  "That's what I thought.",
  "Your position is that this is not a material misstatement; is that correct?",
  "Why isn't it material in light of the fact that it was a question that was on the government form that was promulgated, that was directed by regulations?",
  "In describing what happened here, you ­­ you ­­ you said that Abramski went in and then went to Pennsylvania and gave the gun to his uncle. That's not quite correct. He ­­ he transferred it to him for consideration. I had thought, and this was ­­ goes back to Justice Scalia's question ­­ question about if there's one buyer here or two. I had thought that it might be possible that you can ­­ to construct a case where Abramski tells his uncle, I'm going to buy the gun, and then I'm going to sell it to you, and I'm going to sell it to you in Pennsylvania at a gun dealer's store so we can fill out the necessary forms. Would the government then have objected to what happened here?",
  "I mean, we can ask the government ­­",
  "­­ as Justice Scalia indicates, but under ­­ as you understand their case.",
  "As to whether or not there was a sale, suppose the facts in this case, it was a Glock, I think ­­",
  "­­ was ­­ was delivered, and suddenly the ­­ Abramski finds that it's a valuable collector's item. There were only two or three of these made, had a special trigger or something, and it's now immensely valuable. Could the uncle insist that it be sold to him for the $700, or for the ­­ for the agreed price? The $400 thing?",
  "Well, if it isn't ­­ if it isn't, then there wasn't ­­ then there ­­ there was a subsequent sale.",
  "Well, I'm asking about that.",
  "Would you agree ­­ would you agree that the ­­",
  "­­ the losses here were the proximate result at least of the aggregate actions of all the offenders? Would you go that far?",
  "Would ­­ would you agree that it is the proximate result of the aggregate actions of all the offenders?",
  "Pardon me. A proximate harm, right?",
  "My question is ­­ my question is why isn't it ­­ and you were going to point to the statute ­­ why isn't it at least the result of the aggregate number ­­ aggregate offenders?",
  "But he is ­­ he is one of the offenders in the aggregate.",
  "So ­­ so Congress assumed that this defendant could be liable, in part, for other people's crimes?",
  "A single law or loss?",
  "And is that another way of saying as a result of this defendant's offense?",
  "Well, you're right back to the question Justice Kagan began, that if you have two offenders, that there's going to be recovery. If you have 1,002, there won't be.",
  "And ­­ and my question is along that exact same line. Let's assume, and it's the case, that we're bound by both the result and the reasoning of Massachusetts and EPA, and the ­­ the American Electric v. Connecticut case. Under your view, what regulatory force, what regulatory significance, do those cases have under, A, your approach and, B, the approach by the Chamber of Commerce in the blue brief? I ­­ I think that may be consistent with the subject the Chief Justice just opened.",
  "But your ­­ your answer is that they can be treated differently under different parts of the Act. Doesn't that contradict your earlier view that we can't change the statute?",
  "Are you reading subsection (3), the (A), (B) and (C), and you focus on (C), any other applicable ­­ are you reading those in the alternative? I read that they ­­ that all three have to be complied with.",
  "But then that doesn't help you, because you are right back to where you started. You have the tonnage per year requirement.",
  "And with the absurd result that follows.",
  "What was that case?",
  "Just to be clear, you're not saying ­­ or are you saying ­­ that if you're denied the authority you seek here, there can be no significant regulation of greenhouse gases under the Act? You are not saying that?",
  "And you were going to get to 7475(3),(a),(b),(c) on that point.",
  "I have to say in reading the brief for the States and reading your brief, I ­­ I couldn't find a single precedent that strongly supports your position. Brown & Williamson I think is distinguishable for the reasons set forth in the reply brief. And what are the cases you want me to cite if I write the opinion to sustain your position?",
  "Well, let me just make it clear. If ­­ if the loan is for $300,000, fraudulent loan ­­ fraudulently obtained loan, and the property is foreclosed upon, and it's worth at the time $200,000, is it your position that the property's been fully returned and that there is no liability for the difference?",
  "Okay.",
  "And one more ­­ one more question. Under Wisconsin law, when there's a foreclosure, is there some automatic valuation ordered by the court or is there an appraiser that automatically is ­­ is appointed or do we just decide value based on the bids at the ultimate sheriff's sale?",
  "Okay.",
  "But you say the sentencing judge has to call appraisers? I mean, valuation of property is the standard stuff of ­­ of civil proceedings in ­­ in condemnation and many other cases. You call ­­ each side calls appraisers. The appraisers give their ­­ their judgment and then either the jury or the judge decide. You want that to happen in every ­­ in every restitution case like this?",
  "Well, I'm not sure a sentencing court is well equipped to do it. A sentencing court has to call appraisers?",
  "Do you agree that if the real property is returned and that everybody agrees that on the day the property is returned, the value is less than the loan amount, that the victim is entitled to the difference between that value and the loan amount?",
  "Then we are under B and then we are talking about money and not the mortgaged property.",
  "Money is property. We're still talking about the value of the loan valued in terms of money and not of the real property, right? Otherwise, your concession that the victim is entitled to the difference can't work.",
  "The victim is entitled to the difference in the value of the property and the amount of money stolen based, on your view, on the value of the property at the time that it's returned, correct?",
  "Then we are under B, correct?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Do you agree that the victim, in this case the bank, may not hold on to the property for an unreasonable period of time?",
  "You were talking about economic coercion. Suppose it were reversed. Suppose that Octane had the patent and sued ICON. Would the analysis be precisely the same?",
  "I've been listening to your adjectives ­­ this is a search for adjectives, in part. I think you used the word meritless. What ­­ is there a difference between merit ­­ meritlessness and objectively baseless?",
  "Because if we remand to the district court, the district court's already said it's not objectively baseless, it's not brought in bad faith. I'm not quite sure what words we're going to give to the district court if you're to prevail.",
  "So would you say without substantial merit? I mean, if we're playing around with words again.",
  "It's a different statute. Could we borrow from ­­ you mentioned EAJA. I take it that's substantially justified?",
  "It's a different statute, It was passed later, all of ­­ all those problems.",
  "This is not your best argument.",
  "Well, baseless is at the end of the day ­­ I mean, you have a case that involves a straight stroke rail that at one end goes in an elliptical arc, and the district judge had to figure this out with all the experts. After he goes through all the underbrush, he finds there's nothing there. And it's hard to say that that's objectively baseless to a district judge who's spent weeks studying this thing. But at the end of the day, suppose he finds there's nothing there?",
  "Take ­­ take your time, take your time.",
  "If you talk about the condition of mental disability that's involved here, I want to go back to something you've said in response to Justice Scalia. The question was along the line of what does it mean to have a disorder under the DSM. Obviously, one thing it means is that the scholars can talk about it; that they can all focus on the same subject. Does it have any meaning other than that, that it ­­ it is an objective index, an objective characterization that certain people have a certain mental condition? Is ­­ is that what it means?",
  "Is ­­ is there ­­ is there any evidence that society in general gives substantial deference to the psychiatric profession in this respect? Are there any studies on that or is there anything we can look to to see that that's true on not true?",
  "We have later in the week an argument about economic theories. And it's a little different because in that case, the Court ­­ it's the Court's own jurisprudence and we have not said, as we have in Atkins, that it's up to the State. But do you think we defer to psychiatric ­­ psychologists and psychiatrists any more than we ­­ or any less than we do to economists?",
  "Well, let ­­ let me ask you this. Suppose that the American Psychiatric Association and ­­ and all other professional associations do use the SEM. Suppose that. It seems to me what the State is saying here in declining to use that, is that it declines to follow the standards that are set by the people that designed and administer and interpret the tests.",
  "But it seems to me that, to follow from Justice Kagan's question, and I think this is a very important question, that we've been talking about here about the ­­ the inaccuracy, to some extent, of IQ scores, and your rule prevents us from getting a better understanding of whether that IQ score is ­­ is accurate or not because you ­­ we cannot even reach the adaptive functioning prong. You prevent it at the outset. And incidentally, you don't prevent it if it's under 65 ­­ under 70, do you?",
  "But in very close cases, doesn't it illuminate whether or not the IQ test is exactly as reported or if it is subject to some decrease or increase depending on what the evidence of adaptive functioning shows.",
  "Well, I'll read ­­ I'll read Atkins again.",
  "But I thought Atkins did ­­ did refer to the adaptive functioning.",
  "But that was even under DSM­IV, correct?",
  "Please, I ­­",
  "Then I misunderstand the case. I thought the Florida court held, in effect, my words, that the IQ was a threshold in order to make this inquiry, and if you had 70 ­­ over 70, you could not make a showing. But please correct me if I'm wrong.",
  "So you do not get ­­ if you do not satisfy prong one, you do not get to prongs two or three, period. Right?",
  "But ­­ but, General ­­",
  "The ­­ the last ten people Florida has executed have spent an average of 24.9 years on death row. Do you think that that is consistent with the purposes of the death penalty, and is ­­ is it consistent with sound administration of the justice system?",
  "That wasn't my question.",
  "Is it consistent with the ­­ with the purposes that the death penalty is designed to serve, and is it consistent with an orderly administration of justice?",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Well ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "Well, let ­­ let ­­ let me ask ­­ ask this. Of course most of the delay is at the hands of the defendant. In this case it was 5 years before there was a hearing on the ­­ on the Atkins question. Has the attorney general of Florida suggested to the legislature any ­­ any measures, any provisions, any statutes, to expedite the consideration of these cases.",
  "Assuming ­­ assuming that at some point in this case, either now or on remand, it's appropriate and necessary for us to state ­­ set forth what the rule ought to be, what effect, if any, do you give to the fact that there was a passenger in the car, a passenger who apparently was not involved in any illegal activity?",
  "But it makes the police reaction more dangerous.",
  "Did Allen bring a suit?",
  "And was that settled out of court or something?",
  "Oh, it remains.",
  "Yes. I understand that. Although we're going beyond the necessities of the case, is the rule that the passenger can have a \"shock of the conscience\" test and it's not limited to the Fourth Amendment, even if the driver is? Is that the way it works?",
  "Is your point that if Johnson ­­ is your point that if Johnson remains on the book, there's no jurisdiction?",
  "What do you mean? He is going to the police station?",
  "Well, objective reasonableness is a ­­ is at least a mixed issue of law and fact, and it seems to me Justice Scalia is correct. You ­­ you have the burden to show that this was a clearly established standard, and you say that at a minimum, reasonable minds could differ on the issue of reasonableness.",
  "But I'm not clear how that works either. Suppose the police are very good shots, it doesn't hit the public, it just hits the assailant. Is it still unreasonable because it wasn't a public place? And does that mean that the fleeing felon is much better off if he goes to a public place?",
  "I ­­ I don't understand how ­­ how this bears on ­­ on the ­­ on the question of whether or not ­­ as to the reasonableness as to the driver.",
  "Finish your sentence. \"And that cannot\" ­­",
  "Would you address briefly the position taken by the law professors, I call it the midway position, that says there should be an event study. That might not take care of your first two arguments of the narrow construction of 10(b)(5), and the question of presumptions, but it does seem to me to be a substantial answer to your economic analysis to the ­­ to the challenge you make to the economic premises of the Basic decision.",
  "Am ­­ am I correct ­­ and this would be more of a question for your friend representing the Respondent. Am I correct that, even under the ­­ the Basic framework, at the merits stage there has to be something that looks very much like an event study. Am I correct about that?",
  "And so then the question would be since you're going to have to have it anyway, why not have it at the class certification stage.",
  "Can you tell me, based on your experience, compare the ­­ the cost, the extent of time, the difficulty of showing under Basic the efficient ­­ that there is an efficient market, and compare and contrast that with undertaking an event study. Is the latter much more costly, much more time­consuming?",
  "But why ­­ why couldn't that same showing be made under the law professors' theory of an event study at the certification stage?",
  "For each ­­ for each one of ­­ of ­­",
  "Oh, each day.",
  "But even if Basic did not rely on economic theory, and there is a dispute on that ­­ I think the opinion is not quite clear on that one way or the other ­­ if later economic theories show that the market doesn't react in the way Basic assumed it automatically did, then certainly Congress would not wish to foreclose the Court from considering that new evidence if it was a strong, clear and convincing, et cetera.",
  "But the Petitioners say that this has produced a whole new genre of investors that are quite different from the fellow that's sitting at home reading the Wall Street Journal.",
  "And your theory doesn't seem to take that into account.",
  "Well, you're saying that the events ­­ that the law professors' event study theory is flawed, then?",
  "Well, my question along the same lines is: If the misrepresentation is established, from that category of cases, are there many that are still not certified? Because that would be inconsistent with your whole theory that the market is almost always efficient.",
  "Can you get to part two of Justice Kagan's question, which is what is your view of the ­­ of the consequences if we adopt the law professors' view?",
  "It's true, I think, that the Respondents have to explain why their position doesn't commit us to a difficult case­by­case adjudication down the line, and yours is a more simple approach. On the other hand, it seems to me that you really rendered the words \"retirement funds\" superfluous.",
  "I mean, the words in the bankruptcy statute.",
  "So all we have is the statute on one hand and common sense on the other.",
  "Well, if we ­­ if we look ­­ if we look to what the States did, are there some statements, some recitation of purpose that does weigh in on the common sense side of the equation in your favor; in other words, the States were doing this for some ­­for some particular reason?",
  "Would you ­­ would you agree that it ­­ pursuant to the Petitioner's counsel's last comment, that it does affect the retirement decision of the original owner?",
  "In other words ­­ in other words, there's a benefit to ­­ this is an encouragement for the original owner to retire because he knows that this can be handed down.",
  "Yes, I agree with Justice Kagan's comment. And you argue against your own box­under­the­bed analogy by, as Justice Kagan indicates, saying that \"to the extent\" is ­­ indicates that retirement funds may be greater than what's in the clause. It seems to me that you should argue the other way around, as Justice Kagan is indicating. Or am I missing something?",
  "You were beginning by giving us a framework for your argument. Do I think of this as a statutory case? Of course, the First Amendment is on the stage at some point here, but I take it you can prevail just on the question of statutory interpretation, and if that is so, are there any statutory rules that work in your favor, that is to say, avoiding a constitutional question or how do we think about this case, primarily as a statutory case?",
  "But why ­­ why is that a problem? Let's assume that the cost of providing insurance is roughly equivalent to the $2,000 penalty. How ­­ how is the employer hurt? He can just raise the wages.",
  "Okay, the last is important. But just assume hypothetically that it's a wash, that the employer would be in about the same position if he paid the penalty and the employer ­­ pardon me, an employee went out and got the insurance and that the employee's wages were raised slightly and then it's ­­ and that it's a wash so far as the employer are concerned, other than the employer's religious objection, but just on the financial standpoint. Can we assume that as a hypothetical. Then what would your case be?",
  "Just before your time starts to go too fast, how would you suggest that we think about the position and the rights of the ­­ of the employees? And you can have hypotheticals about the employer makes them ­­ wants to make them wear burkas and so forth. That's not in this case. But in ­­ in a way, the employees are in a position where the government, through its healthcare plans, is ­­ is, under your view, is ­­ is allowing the employer to put the employee in a disadvantageous position. The employee may not agree with these religious ­­ religious beliefs of the employer. Does the religious beliefs just trump? Is that the way it works?",
  "Is it your position that part of the compelling interest here is that you have to protect the integrity ­­ the operational integrity of the whole Act?",
  "Does that mean the constitutionality of the whole Act has to be examined before we accept your view?",
  "You ­­ you have exempted a whole class of corporations and you've done so under your view not because of RFRA.",
  "Now, what ­­ what kind of constitutional structure do we have if the Congress can give an agency the power to grant or not grant a religious exemption based on what the agency determined? I recognize delegation of powers rules are somewhat moribund insofar as their enforcement in this Court. But when we have a First Amendment issue of ­­ of this consequence, shouldn't we indicate that it's for the Congress, not the agency to determine that this corporation gets the exemption on that one, and not even for RFRA purposes, for other purposes.",
  "But you gave this exemption, according to your brief, without reference to the policies of RFRA. What ­­ what were the policies that you were implementing?",
  "I still don't understand how HHS exercised its judgment to grant the exemption to nonreligious corporations if you say it was not compelled by RFRA.",
  "Then it must have been because the health care coverage was not that important.",
  "Under your view, a profit corporation could be forced ­­ in principle, there are some statutes on the books now which would prevent it, but ­­ could be forced in principle to pay for abortions.",
  "But your reasoning would permit that.",
  "I'm talking about a profit corporation. You say profit corporations just don't have any standing to vindicate the religious rights of their shareholders and owners.",
  "What if a law like that ­­",
  "Well, but you're getting away from the hypothetical. Say ­­ Justice Alito's hypothetical was that the impetus for this was humane treatment of animals. There was no animus to religion at all, which in the Church of Lukumi, there was an animus to the religion. So we're taking that out of the hypothetical.",
  "Could you get oblige us by answering Justice Scalia's question. Forget clearly established. What do you think the law is or ought to be? If the only motive for the officer's action, for the Secret Service action, is one based on viewpoint discrimination, but that nonetheless there was an objective reason that could have justified the action, what should the outcome be there as a matter of law? Forget clearly established.",
  "So you ­­ so you say that any time there is an objective basis for the Secret Service to act to move a protester, the fact that this wasn't the motive at all, but that it was viewpoint discrimination is irrelevant.",
  "Is that your position or is it not?",
  "Well, on ­­ on the merits of the case, if you were called to brief the Secret Service, what would you say in response to this question: Do we have any duties under the First Amendment when we are protecting the President with respect to crowds and ­­ and people that are close to him? Do we have any First Amendment duty?",
  "They’re asking about a law, they say we want to know what the law is. We're law enforcement officers. Will you please tell us what the law is.",
  "They said that's why we've invited you to lunch, so that you will tell us what the law is.",
  "Could I ­­",
  "­­ have an answer to this question, please?",
  "Would you say that under your view of the case, that there is a First Amendment interest that protesters have, but that it is virtually unenforceable in the context of crowd control?",
  "Because it seems to me that if this complaint doesn't survive, nothing will.",
  "And so, your answer to Justice Kagan is that it would be proper if you have only 15 minutes, a limited amount of time, to move the people with the ­­ with the adverse ­­ with the signs that criticize the President?",
  "So your answer to Justice Kagan is that there is no violation if they move just the Bush protesters. That's your answer.",
  "The question of mixed motive or improper motive, if we can get back to that for just a minute. Assume that the law ­­ and this is the Wren case ­­ is as follows. If there is improper motive for an arrest, but that there was an objective basis that would have made the arrest and that did make the arrest reasonable, there is no violation of the Constitution. Assume that's the law and forget clearly established, forget ­­ assume that's the law. It seems to me that for you to prevail, you have to say we should make a First Amendment exception because the First Amendment is so important. Or that there has to be, in another context, an amendment for racial profiling. So that the rule that I have just stated has to be qualified in some way. It seems to me you almost have to say that in order to prevail in this case.",
  "And just repeat, it is common ground between the parties that ­­",
  "Well, let me put it this way. If you describe that to a second­year college class in engineering and said here's ­­ here's my idea, now you go home and you program over this weekend, my guess is ­­ my guess is that that would be fairly easy to program.",
  "So the fact that the computer is involved, it ­­ it seems to me, is necessary to make it work. But the ­­ but the innovative aspect is certainly not in the creation of the program to make that work. All you're talking about is ­­ if I can use the word ­­ an \"idea.\"",
  "Or ­­ or a method or a process.",
  "But my ­­ my initial question, and I think I can work this into King Tut, is ­­",
  "­­ is ­­ is whether or not you could have patented that system, idea, process, method, without attaching a computer program.",
  "Suppose I thought ­­ and, again, it's just a thought because I don't have the arrangements that exist and that can only be resolved on a ­­ on a real­time basis. Your abacus is great if you happen to be waiting for the pyramids to be finished or waiting for the gold to move in and out, but it doesn't help with you an abacus if you're dealing with literally thousands of transactions simultaneously going on in different countries at different points in time.",
  "But that's just an idea, hey, let's use a computer.",
  "If we say that ­­ If we say that there's no software patentability and agree with the Attorney General, do you lose in this case?",
  "Is there any common ground between you and the government ­­ maybe a better question to ask the government ­­ a common ground between you and the government on something in the software area that's patentable, other than making the computer itself work? You understand the government to say no software patents.",
  "Would you give me ­­ again, you already did it once ­­ an example of a business process patent ­­ of a business process idea and invention that is patentable.",
  "Well, I ­­ I ­­ in my language, I've called that mechanical rather than process. Can you give me an example of process?",
  "But that's how to make a ­­ that's how to make a machine work better.",
  "I'm asking you: Is there any business process, any business activity that is susceptible to a patent, a pure patent, innovations that deserve patents?",
  "Can you give me an example? computer must be essential to that operation and represent an advancement in computer science or other technology. And we know that's not met here, Justice Sotomayor, because ­­",
  "Is there an example that you can give us of a ­­ what we can call a business process that is patentable, a process that doesn't involve improving the workings of a computer?",
  "Why ­­ why is that? Why would Congress have wanted to make that difference?",
  "I agree with you that the disparity in ­­ in punishment is quite substantial.",
  "It does ­­ it does seem to me that this case can be distinguished from the example you gave in your yellow brief of the person that sells a magazine subscription and he gets the check and he never intends to deliver the magazines. In that case, the bank will ­­ will honor the check, I assume.",
  "And that's quite different than this case.",
  "Well, you can do so, I suppose, through the government's proposed fallback position.",
  "­­ at page 40 of its brief which talks about a risk of loss.",
  "But in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, the bank didn't have to refund the money. And we could sit around here all day with examples, but suppose you have a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee and he inflates the cost. This would be ­­ to the owner. This would be a violation of the statute. This is a sweeping interpretation you're offering us.",
  "And ­­ and you've been slipping back into the hypotheticals where the bank is going to bear the loss. But your position also covers instances where the bank does not bear any loss, the fraudulent contractor that ­­ Justice Kagan's hypothetical about the phony painting, the bank is not going to give that money back.",
  "So you have federalized every fraudulent transaction in the economy whenever a check is involved.",
  "Well, I mean, I can think about it tonight, but I'd like an example of a check where the money doesn't come from a bank.",
  "And is it ­­ is it true that there's a 2­year mandatory minimum?",
  "Under this statute, is there ­­ is there a mandatory minimum?",
  "I ­­ I agree that that interpretation substantially narrows the statute because the altered check, the bank is going to be certainly at risk of loss. If ­­ if we were to agree with that suggestion and were inclined to read the statute that way, is there a case that you can cite to us that says we have a duty to save poorly drawn statutes by a sensible amendment?",
  "I mean, what ­­ what case do you ­­ what case do you want me to cite if I adopt your alternate ­­ your fallback position?",
  "Does the rule of lenity provide a precedent for us to adopt the narrowing interpretation, your fallback position?",
  "Well, I think it does a lot of work because it ­­ it takes out of the equation schemes to defraud where the bank is not going to be liable.",
  "You ­­ you want us to say that we have sort of a coach class trustee. We're all traveling in coach class when we have an ESOP. Once ­­ once we go down that road, how ­­ how do we define what the duties of the trustee are?",
  "Is there anything in the trust law or the common law that allows us to define benefits that way?",
  "It's just background information for this point you're discussing. Can ­­ can you tell me, is it a very common practice for the directors and officers of the company themselves to be the trustees? I had just assumed that that didn't happen much anymore. Can you just tell me, because a lot of these problems would be taken care of, insider information and so forth, if there was an outside trustee. And I assume ­­ tell me if I'm wrong ­­ that the reason for the trust ­­ for the company themselves to do it is because it saves money. It's ­­ it's cheaper than hiring an outside investment. Maybe I'm wrong about that. But can you ­­",
  "Can you just tell us what the ­­ what the landscape is?",
  "Well, how do you fine ­­ define the standard or the duty that's responsive to Justice Alito's concern? And I had the same problem. Let's assume that trustees in a non­ESOPs plan have a duty to maximize returns and provide stable investments. Is it somehow different when it's an ESOP?",
  "And if so, what is the duty?",
  "How do you define it?",
  "Well, if I'm the trustee, I don't know what my duty is based on your answer. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.",
  "Suppose you were a legislature or a congressman. You are absolutely committed to the idea that it's important and salutary to have employees own stock in the company for which they work. How would you write the statute?",
  "Well, once you say the trustee doesn't have the duty to diversify, it seems to me you are living in something of a different world.",
  "I just don't see what the trustee is supposed to do. You have the company stock. By comparing it with other stocks, there will be many investments that are just as good or better. When does he have to make the investment, in other words, just as good or better? I don't understand. I don't understand what ­­ how we're going to implement what Congress wanted to implement.",
  "But your ­­ your argument, at least according to the Petitioners's brief, and I think they're correct, you go away from the purity standard. You have your own standard whether or not it's materially overvalued in this instance. Or are you saying ­­",
  "But ­­ but then ­­ but then you are creating a special standard which is just what you're accusing the Petitioners of doing.",
  "The Chief Justice indicated I can ask just one question. Is this a case in which we must decide what the fiduciary standard is quite without regard to inside information? Is inside information just an added issue in the case or is it the key issue in the case?",
  "And so do you concede that under the Lanham Act, plaintiff could not challenge aspects of the a food label that the FDA said is required?",
  "I know that's not this case.",
  "I want you to answer the question, though.",
  "Do you agree that if you brought this suit under state law, it would be preempted?",
  "Do I understand your position to be that then if the label is specifically authorized, then the Lanham Act is precluded, but if the FDCA has just simply failed to forbid it then it's not? Is that your distinction you draw.",
  "Because if it is, I think it's very hard to work with.",
  "Is it part of Coke's narrow position that national uniformity consists in labels that cheat the consumers like this one did?",
  "I think it's important for us to know how the statutes work. And if the statute works in the way you say it does and that Coca­Cola stands behind this label as being fair to consumers, then I think you have a very difficult case to make. I think it's relevant for us to ask whether people are cheated in buying this product. Because Coca­Cola's position is to say even if they are, there's nothing we can do about it. Do you still have this ­­ do you still have this label?",
  "But you say that even ­­ I ­­ I take it I'm characterizing your position right. You say that even if there's a violation of the FDA regulations, they still couldn't sue under the Lanham Act because that's for the FDA.",
  "I thought that was ­­ I thought that was at Page 39 in your brief in a footnote.",
  "Well, the Lanham ­­ the Lanham Act applies nationally.",
  "So you're ­­ you used a state preemption and then say we should apply the same principles to two federal statutes ­­",
  "­­ but that's a quite different point.",
  "You want us to ­­ you want us to write an opinion that said that Congress enacted a statutory scheme because it intended that no matter how misleading or how deceptive a label it is, if it passes the FDA, it cannot ­­ it ­­ there can be no liability. That's what you want us to say?",
  "Don't make me feel bad because I thought that this was pomegranate juice.",
  "But the point is that it is doubtful that FDA has sufficient resources to police food and beverage labeling. I think that was the thrust of Justice Ginsburg's question. I had the same concern. And this is relevant because we want to see what the likely intention of Congress was with reference to these two statutes.",
  "Where ­­ where is that statement contained?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Any authority that the FDA interpretation gets deference is presumed to be correct, or presumed to be not misleading? Has there ever been any scholarship or commentary or cases saying that?",
  "We're waiting. What about property in another country? We're waiting.",
  "But the questions from the Court so far have narrowed the issue to property on which there could be execution in a foreign ­­ if it were in a foreign nation, and you said, Well, military and consulate. No, no. We're talking about property that if here would be subject to execution. What's wrong with asking the judgment debtor in this Court, in this case, whether or not there are such assets, without reference to military and government officials, et cetera, property that's used in commercial transactions on which there can be execution in the United States?",
  "No, discovery is about assets that can be executed on, but they are in other countries. And you started saying, Oh, but the military and so forth. That's not ­­ that's not this case.",
  "Well, it's this case on the or­ ­­ but it's not ­­ it's not what the Court has been suggesting.",
  "Just one question. I thought that I would hear a lot about waiver in this case. Does the waiver in the bonds not affect this case or its outcome?",
  "No, no, no. But assume the validity of the question. Does it ­­ why is it that your position applies to military assets if that is ­­ that is beyond the scope of the Court's power here, but on the assumption of Justice Scalia's question it's within, and of your hypothetical, that it's subject to execution in France?",
  "Well, in making the rule, we're asking whether or not our rule should take account of this concern. And you say, well, it's up to the district court. We're going to tell the district court what to do. So what do we say on this point?",
  "Does the waiver extend to military property?",
  "Well, then the waiver just restates the immunity that's provided in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.",
  "How does it go beyond that?",
  "But not as to military property. So how do I know how far the waiver extends?",
  "I'm asking whether or not the waiver extends to Argentine military property.",
  "Does it waive immunity as to a consular residence or an embassy building?",
  "And I take it that's ­­ that's enforced by subpoenas. If the speaker doesn't want to appear before the Commission, he can be served with a subpoena, which is judicially enforceable.",
  "Now, the State can characterize its own position, but do you understand the State to say that well, the existence of the Commission means that frivolous claims can be washed out, that they can actually get some protection by an advance ruling. Is that the State's position?",
  "But I mean, I thought ­­ I thought their position was that this would ­­ would sharpen the controversy and make it more concrete or something like that.",
  "Your best cases you think are Steffel and Thompson and Babbitt? Are there others that are more ­­",
  "Any ­­ any breakdown of whether those were brought by candidates or just interested citizens?",
  "But your very argument, Mr. Murphy, to the effect that, well, probable cause is a very low standard, seems to me to work against you. It means that more complaints are more likely.",
  "Well, but this is a point brought up by Justice Scalia's question as well. Don't you think there's a serious First Amendment concern with a state law that requires you to come before a commission to justify what you are going to say and which gives the commission discovery power to find out who's involved in your association, what research you've made, et cetera?",
  "There's a curious inversion here. Usually we're concerned about citizen suits, too many people can challenge ­­ challenge the law. Here we're concerned that many, many citizens can bring the challenge against the candidate. So it's somewhat reversed. In other words, you have tens of thousands of private attorney generals waiting to pounce and get these people before the commission and have to follow discovery orders.",
  "Yeah. Why wasn't that ­­",
  "I had the same question. Just assume that CableVision is our precedent. I know that it isn't, but let's just assume that it is. How would you distinguish the CableVision from your case and how is it applicable here? Assume that it's binding precedent. Just that's a hypothetical.",
  "How do you want us to deal with CableVision ­­ the CableVision case in the Second Circuit? Again assume it's a binding precedent. Just assume that.",
  "Suppose ­­ suppose Aereo offered a service so that the viewer at home could press three different buttons, but it takes only 45 seconds, and he could get the broadcast without advertising? And Aereo would have some way to screen out the advertising so you could watch the entire baseball game or football game without the ad ­­ without the ads.",
  "Would Aereo be a performer then?",
  "No, the consumer makes the choice. You can have it with the ads or without the ads. Push button one or button two.",
  "I don't understand why he is the performer in one case and not in the other case.",
  "Well, let ­­ let's assume that it is inappropriate for the IRS to avoid taxpayer ­­ tax court limitations on discovery. Let's assume that a subpoena cannot do that. The Supinski declaration, it seems to me, is quite sufficient to make that showing.",
  "But my supposition was that assume that you cannot avoid taxpayer ­­ or tax court discovery limits. If ­­ if that is so, it seems to me the Supinski affidavit is quite sufficient.",
  "Just so ­­ just so I ­­ I know what your position is in this case and your answer to the Chief Justice, is it your contention that on this showing, that on these affidavits, a district court may not order a hearing?",
  "All right. So you say that the district court ­­ that there is a sufficient showing here so that a district court, in the exercise of its discretion, could order a further hearing.",
  "I just want to make sure I understand. The district court has in front of it a request to enforce a subpoena. The district court has no authority at all, either on its own motion or by request from the taxpayer, to limit that scope, the scope of discovery? Millions of documents, he just has to sign it? Is that what I'm hearing?",
  "You are in the litigation, in that litigation in the district court. Once you are before the district court, you can make an objection as to excessive scope.",
  "It seems to me that if those are the questions you're going to ask, that almost every taxpayer's lawyer could ask those questions in almost every subpoena case. I'm ­­ I'm now concerned, I thought that there was agreement. I now think there's much more to the government's position than I had thought with reference to harassment. I think you can ask that in any tax case I've ever heard of.",
  "Yes. It didn't turn on the label in part because ­­ I was looking at the opinion ­­ it talks about a statute of limitations. So that ­­ that helps the other side, although the repose period helps you.",
  "Well, I think there's ­­ there's merit to your argument. But the point is that there is no cause of action if there's a repose period and ­­ and that suit is commenced later. And the study commission did recognize this distinction between limitations and repose. I agree with Justice Scalia. I didn't have Justice Ginsburg’s law professor, but I ­­ this was new for me.",
  "Other than it was mentioned in Lampf, but in a confusing way.",
  "But it ­­ but it's an important difference because in the States that have repose statutes there can be no tolling. I mean that's huge; a minor, an incompetent person can't sue.",
  "I'm saying that repose statutes, when they exist, impose substantial hardships on people that the State otherwise protects, minors and incompetents. They are out of luck.",
  "That's the whole point. Statutes of repose do not.",
  "Well, I think ­­ no, I think we all concede that what we're talking about here is a statute of limitation. We're not saying it's also a statute of ­­ everyone can see that there is a statute of limitations here. The Federal law is a statute of limitation and so it protects minors. But the question is whether or not this other statute of repose supersedes it. So you can't look­­ you can't quote us to the ­­ to the minors part of the statute and say that it isn't ­­ because that doesn't address the point. You still have the general equitable point that, that the position of the Petitioner might frustrate Congress's intent.",
  "Is it waived if it's not pled?",
  "Is the statute of repose waived if it's not raised as a defense?",
  "Do you want us to write an opinion that we can't trust State legislatures?",
  "Would this ­­ would this help? Do you agree that the standard at the PTO, and let's say that it's whether or not ­­ the claim is definite if a person skilled in the art would be reasonably certain of its scope. Is the standard used by the PTO the same standard that the CA Fed ought to use?",
  "All right. How does ­­ that's a sensible answer, I think. Now, how does the presumption of validity bear on ­­ on the application of the ­­ of that same standard in the court of appeals?",
  "Doesn't that imply some deference on findings of fact?",
  "Does it imply ­­ what sort of deference does it accord to the PTO?",
  "That is, the presumption of validity, does that accord some deference to the PTO? And how would that apply or not apply here?",
  "So there's no deference to the PTO as to that legal interpretation.",
  "You would agree, I take it, that if, was it, \"insolubly ambiguous\" were the standard that the court used, that we should reverse?",
  "Are there cases where there are two reasonable constructions, but both would be patentable?",
  "Would that satisfy the specificity requirement of the statute?",
  "How can that be if it's the same test?",
  "And that's the same test at both levels.",
  "Yes. What's an example of a subpoena that requires the employee to testify, but that he's not testifying on public matters?",
  "But my hypothetical is there is a subpoena, you are required to testify.",
  "And then you've ­­ you indicate that there are some matters on which the employee is not ­­ not protected.",
  "What is an example of that?",
  "I ­­ I still can't get the hypothetical. What ­­ what am I ­­",
  "I ­­ I just can't imagine a case that's not ­­ not a matter of public interest. Now, I can assume that if ­­ if the employee indicates that he was dishonest or if he indicates that he's clearly incompetent, some of the hypotheticals given in the early argument, I understand that. But so far as the subject matter, it's the subject matter is of public concern. Necessarily, if it's a subpoena, is it not, or am I wrong?",
  "But that was Justice Kagan's qualification. That's the Pickering balance.",
  "Just ­­ just to test the principle for why the police can search and seize some ­­ some objects. Consider a gun. The arrestee has a gun on his person and the police take the gun. Is part of the reason for that seizure to obtain evidence of the crime or is it just for the safety of the officer and the safety of the community?",
  "What about gathering evidence in order to make the case? For instance, with the gun, could they take fingerprints? The ­­ the gun is in the police station where the arrestee is being booked. A, could they take fingerprints? B, could they copy the serial number? C, could they see how many shells were left in the chamber? They obviously have to empty it for safety purposes. All for the purpose of building the case, of ­­ of obtaining evidence?",
  "So ­­ so if ­­ if the proposition then, if the principle then is that some objects that are obtained from the arrestee can be examined in order to build the State's case, is that at least a beginning premise that we can accept in your case, although, obviously, there are problems of the extent and intrusiveness of the search that are ­­ are in your case, but not in the gun hypothetical.",
  "I think you're right that Gant is probably the best statement in support of the principle that I've ­­ I've suggested, and then you might say, well, that's limited to automobiles ­­",
  "­­ and then we're back where we started.",
  "Well, but the ­­ but in the wallet ­­ we'll just stick with Justice Alito's hypothetical ­­ they find a business card or something which shows a car rental service. Can they turn the card over and read it? They're not looking for a pin or an explosive. They're trying to read what's on the card. Can they do that?",
  "No, they turn ­­ they turn the card over.",
  "Do you think you could have obtained a warrant ­­ or that the police could have obtained a warrant in this case?",
  "All right.",
  "Well, then the evidence that's seizable under the warrant is ­­ is reasonable, and Justice Alito points out the fact that some of this evidence is ­­ is reasonable. If there's a ­­ there's a limitation with reference to the way the police behaved, as Justice Alito points out, it's limited just to this evidence.",
  "Well, but it ­­ it just goes to the fact that this ­­ that this is searchable under Fourth Amendment standards.",
  "There ­­ there is not much authority that I could find, if the lawyer is arrested and ­­ and they want to read his whole briefcase or you want to read a year's diary. And you cite ­­ I think it's page 7 of your brief ­­ the Learned Hand 1916 case. Is that about the best discussion you ­­ you can find? I didn't find anything much different.",
  "Right.",
  "Because it's important if we're going to try to formulate some standard which limits the extent of the search, and that's one of ­­ that's one of the problems in this case. If ­­ if say we rule for the government in its case, maybe it's not quite fair to ask you, but if we rule for the government in its case in Wurie, for the Federal case ­­",
  "­­ and there's no ­­ it's not an exigent circumstances, is there some standard where we could draw the line which would still result in a judgment in ­­ in your favor? Maybe that's not quite a fair question. You're not ­­ you're not answering ­­ you're not arguing the ­­ the government's case.",
  "Well, including the criminals who are more dangerous, more sophisticated, more ­­ more elusive with cell phones. That's the ­­ that's the other side of this.",
  "Are you saying we're just resting on the discretion of the officer? Because if if that's so, then we'll get a warrant.",
  "Well, let's leave ­­ let's leave exigent circumstances out of it. That ­­ that's an easy case. You're not arguing for exigent circumstances here.",
  "It seems to me that in order to try to give some answer to Justice Kagan's concerns that maybe the distinction ought to be between serious and nonserious offenses ­­ offenses. I don't think that exists in our jurisprudence. Correct me if I'm wrong.",
  "Well, but that's not ­­ that's not quite accurate. What would you do under the Robinson rule with an attorney's briefcase?",
  "And ­­ and doesn't that present the exact problem that every cell phone has?",
  "So I don't think that quite works for you.",
  "Well, the tax return that's on ­­ some ­­ some cell phones have tax returns, so you have the tax return of the jaywalker, looking for a crime.",
  "I don't think it's odd to say that we're living in a ­­ in a new world. Justice Kagan's questions point out the fact that someone arrested for a minor crime has their whole existence exposed on this little device. From your argument, you want us just to adopt a categorical rule, it's in the custody of the police, they can search it. Do you have ­­ do you have any limiting principles that we should considerate at all as a fallback position?",
  "Well, that ­­ that was for an expired license.",
  "­­ or is it the guns that were under the hood in the other case?",
  "The crime of arrest was the expired license.",
  "That's correct, after the stop, yes.",
  "No, but what is your position? What is the rule you want us to adopt in response to the Chief Justice's question?",
  "Can ­­ can ­­ can the police search the person's wallet and find an ­­ an index card with a number, my house? Can he do that ­­",
  "­­ and use the information obtained?",
  "Examine the contents of the wallet but not read it? I ­­ I don't understand the issue.",
  "Is ­­ may the police or may not the police examine a wallet, find the number that says my house, and act on that information to investigate the crime? Yes or no?",
  "Well, it seems to me that it's fairly clear that it's part of the contents that are seized, that are on ­­ in the possession of the arrestee, and that the police can act on it.",
  "The ­­ the question is whether it's an unreasonable search, and the warrant clause follows much later. The question is: Is this an unreasonable search?",
  "That's what the Constitution provides.",
  "Well, it's a search that's reasonable. That's not necessarily an exception.",
  "Well, should the rule be different for a method patent than a device patent?",
  "That's because the statute isn't different, I assume.",
  "Well, under your submission in a process patent, if the consumer adds the final step, vast numbers of consumers, and let's assume they have noticed ­­ they've been notified that they can't do this, then there's liability.",
  "Yet, until we issue the case in your favor.",
  "Well, if you don't prevail on your indirect infringement claim, can you relitigate the direct infringement case in the ­­ before the En Banc Court, or ­­",
  "Just as a matter of background, suppose a hypothetical case ­­ no foreign sovereign. It was a private corporation in Austria. Would there then be jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause in your view? You don't have to prevail on ­­ on that issue, but as a background issue, what ­­ do you have a position?",
  "And Daimler is your best case for that proposition?",
  "Suppose we disagree with that ­­",
  "Suppose we disagree with that answer? Do you lose the case?",
  "Suppose we disagree with the answer that you gave to Justice Kagan. Suppose we disagree that that suit has to be in Austria. Can you still prevail on the facts of this case? The hypothetical was the ticket is not honored. Suppose we disagree with your answer. Can you still prevail on the facts that it ­­ that it did, in fact, occur in this case?",
  "On what ­­",
  "Getting back to our earlier discussion, questions from me and from Justice Kagan, it seemed to me you have to say the due process analysis is insufficient under this statute because ­­ then fill in the blank. And Justice Scalia was asking you the same question.",
  "One ­­ one answer might be because otherwise there would be no necessity for a statute. Due process applies anyway. But the counterargument is, well, there has to be because the statute makes the distinction between sovereign and commercial and so it has a real purpose.",
  "But, of course, my question was suppose that the due process analysis is sufficient to sustain jurisdiction. Then what? Then does based­on still have a separate meaning as a separate requirement that has to be met and has not been met here? And if so, why?",
  "Well, except it did so in the context of distinguishing between commercial activity and sovereign activity.",
  "If we want to give based­upon a separate substantive effect in this statute and so that it means something more substantial than mere due ­­ than what would suffice for due process, what ­­ what body of law, case law do we look to?",
  "If I want to find out about based­on, what kind of cases am I supposed to read?",
  "In your hypothetical.",
  "That ­­ that was an admiralty case, though.",
  "Under your ­­ under your view ­­ let me understand the theory of the case. Let's say that you prevail, that a guarantor is an applicant and that there is a violation of the duty to the guarantor and that there are five guarantors. Can each of the five guarantors bring a separate suit for punitive damages? And also ­­ this is also part of my question ­­ can the loan be declared unenforceable?",
  "But it doesn't say ­­ okay. So you're ­­",
  "To have gotten too far, and so your whole idea here is say she's an applicant, too.",
  "On that point ­­",
  "­­ are there places in the ­­ in this statute where guarantor and applicant is a distinction that has to be made? In other words, under your view, does applicant include guarantor in every part of the statute?",
  "I thought that the government answered that question differently. I ­­ I thought their position was that if they prevail, their definition of the word \"applicant\" to include guarantor apply ­­ A, applies across the board 50 times, and B, makes the Act perfectly workable. Did ­­ did ­­",
  "You may disagree ­­",
  "Maybe I misunderstood their answer.",
  "And can you give me an example of where it would be really contrary to a sensible interpretation of the Act to use the term \"guarantor\" and ­­",
  "­­ \"applicant\" as synonymous, other than for what we're talking about here?",
  "Well, we have stated that a person may be liable for conspiracy even though he was incapable of committing the substantive offense. Does that carry the day for the government's argument here, or is that distinguishable at principle?",
  "And why?",
  "But he might not even be capable of it, must not even be capable of it, as I understand what we've said.",
  "Was Majestic a separate corporation or was it just the proprietorship­owned?",
  "Did this government argue this proposition as its theory of the case in the trial court or here?",
  "Do ­­ do you agree that under your approach, every private individual who seeks to bribe a State official is liable for conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act extortion?",
  "Well, suppose he arranges to meet on the park bench at 2:00 o'clock, and has a follow­up call to the official to please be there. Is that ­­ does that suffice?",
  "Would ­­ would?",
  "But the other reason your hypothetical doesn't work too well is we know that he's not going to pull the gun because he's his friend, but in this case the money is going to be given. So it doesn't work.",
  "Is Majestic a sole proprietorship?",
  "But did you challenge the instructions in the district court as well?",
  "I'm still not sure that I understood your answer to Justice Breyer's question. His question was, this Court purported, and did, give an interpretation of the intent the two parties had when they entered into a contract. And that is a matter of State law.",
  "I ­­ I understand the problem of preemption. I understand the problem that preemption is ­­ that a judicial decision is retroactive. This was not the State law. But the ­­ let's assume that the trial court in the California ­­ pardon me ­­ that the California appellate court said the intent of the parties was to interpret the law to mean A. And ­­ and \"A\" meant this superseded or preempted State law. How can we reverse that determination if it's a matter of State laws interpreting a contract made by two people? I ­­ I ­­ that was the question and I'm ­­ I'm not quite sure what your answer is.",
  "That's exactly what Volt says, what Mr. Landau quoted, is \"Due regard must be given to the Federal\" ­­ in interpreting a contract. We're talking about interpreting the intent of the parties ­­ \"Due regard must be given to the Federal policy favoring arbitration and ambiguities\" ­­ we could ask whether or not this clause is ­­ this statute is ambiguous ­­ \"and so the scope of the arbitration agreement must be resolved in favor of arbitration.\"",
  "Now, if this was a State law contract looking at State law principles, but there is a Federal rule that must be followed in ­­ in making that interpretation, and that is a matter for us to review.",
  "But you have to agree with Justice Breyer ­­ or do you not ­­ that California interpreted this contract as saying if there is an invalid State law that prohibits arbitration, then that's binding on us.",
  "That's what you're saying.",
  "Well, you say that's not the Volt principle. Why isn't it the Volt principle? Ambiguities. I mean, this is even more than an ambiguity. Even ambiguities have to be interpreted ­­ resolved in favor of arbitration. And this is more than an ambiguity.",
  "But would ­­",
  "Was ­­ was any evidence introduced with respect to one of the defendants that could not have been introduced against the other had there been severance?",
  "Can you tell me if you're aware, in other States or perhaps even in Kansas in other trials, is it a common practice to sever when there ­­ for the penalty phase when there are multiple defendants?",
  "This is just for penalty phase?",
  "It seems it would be very difficult for the trial judge to decide which should go first.",
  "Yes.",
  "But the minute ­­ but the minute you defend the idea of two different juries, then you sacrifice the desirability and the possibility of consistency.",
  "If you prevail here on your position, is it necessary for us to remand to the Kansas Supreme Court to determine ­­ for them to determine whether State law would require a different result on this issue? I know there are some other issues in the case, but on this issue or ­­",
  "­­ or are we permitted simply to reverse outright?",
  "Certainly remand on some on other issues, I understand.",
  "Right. And it can't ­­ and it can't, by doing so, immunize itself from ­­ from review in this Court. And that's Michigan v. Long, which ­­ which ­­ which I don't know if were cited in the brief, but Michigan v. Long, to Justice Alito's point, made it very clear that a ­­ a State court can't hide behind a ­­ a Federal law and ­­ and ­­ and be immune because there might be a State law to predicate. We have to see what they wrote. And this ­­ I assume that Kansas would pride itself on ­­ on being cited in other jurisdictions. And if it's wrong and it uses a Federal calculus that's incorrect, it's ­­ it's this Court's duty to reverse.",
  "I suppose ­­ I suppose that it is true that if you're a juror and you're considering whether or not to grant mercy, that's not something that's easily subject to a burden­of­proof analysis one way or the other. If a juror thinks I have sympathy for this person or I want to grant mercy, that ­­ that's not really the ­­ the kind of fact like you're ­­ you're 18 or you're 21 or your father did or didn't abandon you that can be proven in ­­ with a burden of proof of any sort.",
  "I'm reading that from Gleason, and that's also in Carr?",
  "Well, I was just going to add, are you asking us to dismiss the case because there's an adequate and independent State ground?",
  "But if ­­ if ­­ if this Court determines that this instruction is not confusing as a matter of Eighth Amendment law, that surely has a significance ­­ I would think it would have a significance on any remand proceedings that might take place. And plus ­­ and it has additional significance for the other jurisdictions that use this ­­ and other States that use this instruction. So surely we have something significant and necessary to decide under the Eighth Amendment.",
  "Which ­­ which case? In which case, Gleason?",
  "You put it in the red brief. It's also in the petition for writ of certiorari appendix, the white appendix. Gleason 133, page 133 of the white.",
  "We're asking under the Eighth Amendment ­­ or at least that's my interest ­­ under the Eighth Amendment, what is required in response to Justice Alito's question? I didn't mean to interrupt.",
  "What is the ­­ I know it's your rebuttal. What's the catch­all instruction you rely on?",
  "Of 7. Of 7. Thank you.",
  "If a State says, we acknowledge that we are holding a prisoner in contravention of Federal law but we choose to do nothing about it, then the answer is Federal habeas corpus; there is not a second answer that the State can be required under the Supremacy Clause, under its own procedures, to enforce the Federal law? And if ­­ if I'm ­­ and if I were to take ­­ to argue that second position, I'm not quite sure what case I would have to support me. It wouldn't ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "In effect, are you ­­ we saying that the Supremacy Clause binds the States only in direct criminal proceedings?",
  "I mean, is that another way of phrasing your argument?",
  "But the question is: What's a Federal claim?",
  "Why didn't you cite Standard Oil v. Johnson in your response to the questions from Justice Scalia and Justice Alito?",
  "Do I have ­­",
  "­­ the name of the case right? Yes, Standard Oil v. Johnson.",
  "Pardon me. Did you misspeak? When ­­ when Federal law is adopted as State law, the Federal courts can review it. Isn't that what you meant to say? Or ­­ or ­­ I mean, you're very ­­ you're very careful, and you don't make mistakes, but I ­­",
  "You ­­ you said ­­",
  "­­ when ­­ when State law adopts Federal law as Federal law, then there's review. Okay.",
  "But you don't have a distorted new trial if you just grant a parole hearing.",
  "Just so I ­­ I understand it: So you're saying that it ­­ it is possible, but under Florida law the jury would not find the existence of an aggravated ­­ aggravating factor but ­­ and would ­­ and then there are different ways that this would come out ­­ the hypothetical was a hung jury ­­ but the judge could then proceed to find an aggravating factor and impose the death penalty. Now, you say, now, this hasn't happened. He'd probably be reversed. But theoretically this could happen.",
  "Suppose then in your earlier hypothetical, the judge ­­ the jury finds an aggravator occurred in the course of the robbery, and, therefore, there is death eligibility. Then it goes to the judge. And the judge says, there is simply no evidence to support that aggravating factor, but I find another aggravating factor. Under your view, the judge could go ahead and impose the death penalty?",
  "But this is my hypothetical.",
  "I mean, a death case, which is not funny.",
  "And what would happen?",
  "Yes.",
  "Is that a ­­ post Ring? What's the date of that?",
  "If there were a student in Economics I, it seems to me that he would conclude and his professor would conclude that wholesale affects retail, retail affects wholesale, they're interlinked, which means you win the case, except that the statute makes the distinction. We have to make a distinction. Can you tell us what the distinction is that marks the end of the Federal power and the beginning of local power?",
  "Is it fair to say that FERC is luring retail customers into the wholesale market? And if that ­­",
  "And if that ­­ and if ­­ if ­­ well, if that were true, would that not be a ­­ a ­­ a serious problem for the government?",
  "I don't mean to jumped forward too ­­ too quickly to, really, the second question, did FERC comply with its obligation to explain the ­­ the reason for its change, but it ­­ it does seem to me that ­­ that they come close together. FERC's argument is essentially circular. It ­­ it says, well, the market forces will ­­ will work this out, but we define the market. That seems to me circular.",
  "I mean, there are two parts to this argument: One is jurisdiction; the other is whether ­­",
  "It may not be ­­",
  "It may not be the intention, but it's the mechanism.",
  "So you say, oh, well, we didn't mean this, but we're doing it.",
  "And at some point of ­­ I want you just to assume that there is jurisdiction, but to discuss your point that section ­­ that Rule 745, particularly, was arbitrary and capricious, I assume, because adequate reasons or no reasons were given. Or maybe there's some other point. But at some point before your time runs out.",
  "No, of course.",
  "Is one way to think about that is that the ­­ FERC's argument is circular. It says, well, the market will take care of this, but we define the market.",
  "But I ­­ I take it you're asking us not to make the judgment as to which was right and which was wrong, but that ­­ but that FERC did not address it by giving specific­enough reasons.",
  "It ­­ it seems that you want us to write an ­­ an opinion saying that a settlement offer is equivalent to a judgment. And we've had cases, like the Kokkonen case, in which there was a settlement approved by the court, case dismissed, then the settlement was not performed. They went to court seeking an injunction. The court said, no, no. You have a contract. You have to file again. You have to go into a different court. You have to start all over again. A settlement offer and a settlement contract and a settlement agreement are different from a judgment, and you do not have a judgment.",
  "But you didn't pursue that. You didn't apply under the rules for a judgment.",
  "And ­­ and ­­ and if you want us to write an opinion and say, oh, well, a settlement offer is the same as a judgment, that just doesn't accord with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or with our cases like the Kokkonen case.",
  "Suppose one day after the offer the defendant defaulted. Would a case that's now ­­ was once moot now become non­moot?",
  "It happened in Kokkonen. We had a case on it here in the Court.",
  "Can the offer of complete relief from a solvent defendant where it looks like the relief will be forthcoming, if ­­ if you lose this case and so the case is not moot, could still be considered as a factor in the court's decision whether or not to certify the class?",
  "In other words, the class certification goes along without reference to whether the lead plaintiff has any injury any longer?",
  "That's why I asked if the trial judge could, in his discretion, consider that as a factor in certifying or not certifying ­­",
  "You're saying the defendant has ­­ has an interest ­­ pardon me ­­ that the plaintiff has an interest in the judgment ­­",
  "­­ quite separate from obtaining all the relief that he requests.",
  "Again ­­ again, why ­­ well, let ­­ let's assume the case in which they asked for $10,000 and $10,000 is deposited in a bank with irrevocable instructions to pay it.",

  "Other ­­ other than the ­­ the ­­ the stigma of a judgment.",
  "But I thought that's what ­­",
  "­­ Mr. Garre was arguing. He said he'd need a judgment.",
  "I suppose ­­ I suppose the argument underlying some of the questions you've been asked assumes this: If neighbors are making false comments, talking about someone, this is not actionable enough unless it's defamation. On the Internet with ­­ in this cyber age that we have where all this information is out, there's ­­ there's ­­ has to be some real injury. Is it different because this is a credit agency that is regulated? Does a credit agency have less latitude when it is defending on the ground of no concrete injury than other entities?",
  "But does the statute apply just to crediting? That's what ­­ that's what I was asking.",
  "Are you ­­ are you saying ­­",
  "Are you saying in this case that Congress could have drafted a statute that would allow this individual to bring suit?",
  "I ­­ your ­­ your number two ­­ I mean, we can ­­ it sounds to me quite circular. You say ­­ you say he ­­ he has a personal stake because he has a ­­ because Congress said he has a personal stake. Is ­­ do I understand your argument?",

  "Is there an argument that the petition for certiorari could go to the trial court?

On the other hand, as Justice Scalia said, they haven't really directed their attention to the issues before us. I ­­ I ­­ I'm not sure to me that it's an option to ­­ to go to the superior ­­ to the Georgia trial court.",
  "Or ­­ or is that incorrect?",
  "Well, but is it question of Federal or State law as to whether or not the Petitioner has shown a change in facts sufficient to overcome the res judicata bar? The one ­­ the page 192 language that Justice Alito quoted, is that ­­ is that a State law question or ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "Well, if it's a State law question and they resolved it against you, what do you have to ­­ then what do you have to argue?",
  "I think you have to say it's a Federal question.",
  "And we really want you to get to the merits, but why is that ­­ in conjunction with ­­",
  "­­ with Justice Scalia's question, why is that an issue of Federal law?",
  "Well, in ­­ in response to Justice Sotomayor's question ­­",
  "­­ if the prosecutor argues a laundry list of reasons for striking the black juror and some of those are reasonable and some are implausible, how should the Court approach the Batson analysis?",
  "And in your view, cert should have been granted to the Georgia Supreme Court?",
  "All right.",
  "Do you think this would be an appropriate case for us to exercise our discretion to certify the question to the Supreme Court?",
  "But he's simply wrong. He puts down, if it comes ­­ if it comes down to having to pick one of the black jurors ­­ was it Ms. Garrett? ­­ might be okay.",
  "So it ­­ it ­­ it ­­ well, but that seems to me to undercut the argument, well, they're just feeling their way and so forth. They've ­­ they've made a mistake ­­ they've made a mistake of ­­ in Batson. Sure it was new; but they're wrong.",
  "Well, but that may be discretionary as mandatory. That ­­ that does avoid the question somewhat when you say, oh well, there's another section. Don't worry. That's your answer. But that doesn't seem to me a complete answer to the statutory question that Justice Alito's question poses. You're making the statute a nullity as to the States.",
  "I ­­ I don't ­­ why ­­ why is it in this case ­­ it ­­ it does seem to me that Congress, eight years later, when it wrote the ­­ the second statute, used the ­­ the ­­ the same style and that this very much favors the government. But then you say that that's inapplicable, because?",
  "Yes.",
  "I don't understand how that answers the redundancy question. There's redundancy in both interpretations, but much more in yours than in the government's.",
  "I'm not sure how your answer was responsive to Justice Alito's redundancy question.",
  "But a ward ­­ a ward could also be a 40­year­old person who is incompetent.",
  "Could you talk about the rule of lenity? Does the rule of lenity apply with the same force when the question is the substantive definition of a crime as distinct from the penalty that's attached?",
  "It seems to me there's an argument that it should apply equally, but have we talked about that?",
  "That ­­ that makes a great deal of sense. It ­­ other than that rule of lenity to the extent it's based on notice, it seems to have somewhat more force when it applies to the substantive definition of the offense as opposed to the punishment. But I ­­ you could argue it either ­­ either way. But have we ­­ have we talked about any distinction?",
  "This Court's precedents?",
  "I understand the Chief Justice.",
  "By the ­­ by the ­­ by the single­judge court?",
  "I have ­­ I have some problems with that. Suppose the ­­ the case has been on the books from this Court for 15, 20 years, has all sorts of academic commentary; certain circuits have questioned whether the reasoning is still valid. A single­judge court can dismiss in that case?",
  "And I'm surprised ­­ you think they do need to take that position?",
  "I ­­ I take it Goosby is not parallel to Rule 11. Rule 11 is a class of cases which are more frivolous even than what Goosby would have ­­",
  "Oh, really?",
  "Could the Respondents argue that, in the light of Iqbal and Twombly, Goosby should be reconsidered, and the Federal court should have some ­­ district court, single judge should have some more authority? Or does that work the other way, do you think?",
  "Does ­­ does the waiver argument, the argument that this can be waived by the consent of all parties, does that rest on decisions of this Court?",
  "Has the waiver rule been adopted by some of the circuits?",
  "Vieth?",
  "I didn't understand. If you're not going to go that far, you want to brief what question before the district?",
  "So you'd want to brief it under Goosby or something?",
  "Oh, I see.",
  "Does it happen often that a single judge will say there are three issues here; one would definitely involve a three­judge court, but the previous are ones that I can reach, and so I will reach those first. Does that happen very often?",

  "Just as a background matter, when we left, as I understand, Great ­­ Great­West, we left ­­ left the issue open. If the beneficiary receives a check that by mistake is three times more than it should be, but he may think it's a bonus, he may not understand; he spends it all. Is there an ­­ or is there a legal action that the Plan can take to recover that money?",
  "For future payments.",
  "Suppose that weren't available.",
  "In law.",
  "Right.",
  "And ­­ and ­­ and because State law, legal remedies are preempted by ERISA?",
  "Is that a position that's generally accepted, or is this an arguable point?",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "I ­­ I thought Great­Western had left that open.",
  "I'm just asking, is there a rule in the courts of appeals, or in the ­­ in the legal system generally, or ­­ or are they divided on this, or just nothing written on it?",
  "Do they, heavily?",
  "But they say they do, anyway?",
  "So you took your position because of Great­West?",

  "I just want to be clear: I understand your position and your answer. Fund has ­­ has a claim for reimbursement from the accident proceeds. Accident proceeds put into the bank account of the Plan beneficiary, the injured, the person who was injured in the accident. He also has another creditor. You're ­­ you stand evenly with that creditor?",
  "Was that your answer?",
  "Well, it's ­­ it's your example. The case is settled at 10:00 in the morning. At 10:30 in the morning, it's in the bank account.",
  "Nothing has been spent, but there's a creditor. And the creditor's claim is equal to the Plan's claim, and there's only enough money for one. What happens?",
  "I thought you would have priority.",
  "It's traceable. It's in the bank account.",
  "Well, but you didn't ­­",
  "­­ the statistical mechanism of your own, you didn't have a Daubert objection to the testimony, and you suggest in your brief that uninjured plaintiffs are included in aggregate damages, but you were the one that objected to a bifurcated trial. And so far as uninjured plaintiffs recovering, that has to be determined on remand anyway. I ­­ I just don't understand your arguments.",
  "Yeah, but once you lose that, you have also other defenses: Your own expert, a Daubert objection, et cetera.",
  "But you've changed your theory. Question 2, as you presented in the petition for certiorari, whether the class may be certified if it had members who were not injured. Then you changed that. Page 49 of your brief, you say that the plaintiff must demonstrate a mechanism to show that. So now you're talking about ­­ about the mechanism. So the ­­ so the case has been argued on different theories at ­­ at many points, and it seems to me Justice Kagan is precisely right. You said, well, I want to start first with class action. She said, no, no. The point is we start with Mt. Clemens. That's the substantive law for FSLA.",
  "But the briefs are like two ships passing in the night on this point. The Respondent is going to say this is for remand, or am I wrong about that?",
  "Aren't there further proceedings?",
  "Aren't there further proceedings in this case?",
  "But that has to be determined in the trial court.",
  "But that has to be determined in the trial court.",
  "Is it an argument that if the employer wants to be quite conscientious about complying with FLSA, the employer has to take some averages. It has to say, we're going to give X minutes for donning and doffing on this line, X minutes ­­ and the second part of that question is, how much of this case turns on the fact that the employer did not keep adequate records?",
  "Can the employer be charged with not keeping adequate records by not following every single person every part of that person's day? You spend four hours on this line, four hours on that line. You have to ­­ you have to put on a certain kind of doffing. Can the employer really keep records for every single employee?",
  "It seems ­­ it seems to me that you might concede that if this were simply a class action under 23, that these problems might be a barrier to certification, but that under Mt. Clemens you have a special rule; is that ­­",
  "Is that correct? Do you ­­ do you concede that there is a strong possibility you might not be ­­ have this class certified under section ­­ under Rule 23, absent Mt. Clemens?",
  "Let me ask you this: If the Court is writing an opinion of reaching the result you want, what is the standard we put? Representative evidence? Average evidence of injury is sufficient if? What ­­ what do we write?",
  "That's ­­ that's a little bit too specific for the broad standard that I'm looking for. An average is possible if what, there's no other way to do it? If it's an FSLA case and has a special policy? Neither of those seem quite satisfactory to me.",
  "Do you concede that if this were a Rule 23 action and the FSLA were not involved that it would be a much closer, much more difficult case?",
  "Basic activity is ­­",
  "Well, but I ­­ I thought the Chief Justice's question was slightly different. I don't know if you were privileged to hear the exciting argument yesterday on tainted assets.",
  "But, you know, there are degree ­­ there are degrees of taint. Can you ­­ can you follow ­­ can you follow the assets? So just to say \"tainted\" or \"untainted,\" it's a ­­ it's a more difficult question than that.",
  "So the law ­­ you want this Court to say spend the bank robbery money first.",
  "That's ­­ that's your position?",
  "Is it your position the government could prevent payment for the tuition but not for the counsel?",
  "So the answer is you can ­­ the government can stop the tuition payment but not the payment to counsel?",
  "Yeah, but your ­­ your earlier argument was you have a constitutional right to establish that it isn't drug money. That was your whole answer to Justice Scalia.",
  "I'm talking about the rule that you're proposing.",
  "But in ­­ in this case, there was a finding of probable cause.",
  "So you want us to make a distinction between probable cause and a judgment?",
  "But what is it that confines your ­­ your rationale to a specific area? It seems to me that if the government prevails in this case, every State in the union, every locality could say that in the event of assault and battery, malicious ­­ malicious mischief, drunk ­­ an accident caused by drunk driving, any crime involving a bodily injury, that the government is entitled to restrain disposition of assets that might be used for medical care, for pain and suffering. And this would, in effect, prevent the private bar from ­­ from practicing law unless it did so on a contingent basis.",
  "Well, but you're talking about probable cause. But ­­ but there's ­­",
  "The government can often show probable cause, and that's usually the basis for the indictment.",
  "And ­­ but just ­­ just to be clear, so that I understood your earlier answer, the consequence, the necessary consequence of your position is that any State in the union can provide for forfeiture or a freeze ­­ a freeze of assets pending trial in any assault and battery case, spousal abuse case, criminal negligence, date rape cases in order to make the victim whole, to pay for medical costs, to pay for pain and suffering, and can freeze those assets even if the consequences of that is that in most of those cases most people cannot afford counsel.",
  "That's the consequence of your argument?",
  "But that's not this case. What you ­­ you ­­ what you have hypothesized is an erroneous instruction that ­­ or ­­ or a ­­ a ­­ a failure to find what was necessary. There's no failure to find what was necessary here, so your hypo doesn't work.",
  "I can see that your argument might work in some cases if the jury was confused, if ­­ if this meant that it took their attention away from a critical element. But I ­­ I don't see that that's a possibility here, even assuming that Justice Alito's comments, which I think have considerable merit, are inapplicable, but you ­­ that they're quite different.",
  "I understand ­­ I understand your argument about, in effect, that this was harmless error but ­­ something at page 20 of your brief. You would like us to write in an opinion ­­ on the very first line of page 20 ­­ even if courts should generally look to jury instructions when assessing the sufficiency of the evidence which they should not ­­ you want us to write that in an opinion? It seems to me that would surprise many, many lawyers.",
  "First thing ­­",
  "­­ we look at ­­",
  "­­ when we ­­ the first thing we look at in a sufficiency question is, well, what are the instructions? So you want to say, oh, well, don't look at instructions?",
  "But ­­ but you ­­ but you say that we shouldn't look to jury instructions when assessing the deficiency of the evidence. I ­­ I ­­ I think that's an astounding proposition.",
  "Well, it's ­­ it's, frankly, a style point rather than a substantive point. But it ­­ it ­­ it does seem to me that we should not put that in the opinion.",
  "But for a constructive discharge claim to succeed you have to point to a discriminatory or an unlawful act.",
  "And so we have to find this anyway.",
  "No. He says ­­ I ­­ I interpreted the Chief Justice's question, maybe wrongly, suppose he says in his own mind I can't take it anymore, three months from now I'm going to resign.",
  "When he resigns?",
  "When he resigns?",
  "No, no. The date that he says it to himself or the date that he does resign?",
  "But Ricks ­­",
  "Ricks alleged only discrimination, not discriminatory ­­ not constructive discharge.",
  "That's why I have a problem with Ricks.",
  "I mean, I don't think Ricks reads directly on what you're saying. You ­­ you want to have an extension.",
  "But again, as Justice Scalia points out, there's a difference between the employee taking the action and the ­­ and the employer taking the action ­­",
  "­­ and that distinguishes Ricks.",
  "But then are you saying that constructive discharge will ­­ will lead to a cause of action only when it is so close to the precipitating event that they are almost contemporaneous?",
  "When, under your view, when is there a constructive discharge that itself leads to triggering the statute of limitations?",
  "They're almost contemporaneous.",
  "Well, is the Court obligated to do a search of all Federal laws and regulations to know if this complaint might have a Federal cause of action?",
  "Let ­­ let me ask you: This ­­ this ­­ this ­­ let's assume, as Justice Alito assumed, that New Jersey is the same as the Federal system, notice pleading. Can you just tell me as a matter of practice, do most complaints set forth the Federal statute under which ­­ not 1331 but the specific Federal statute that creates the duty, or do they just allege the duty?",
  "Let's say just under notice pleading under Federal standards.",
  "So in your ­­ in your view, you have to ­­ if ­­ if ­­ if this Court finds that the section here, Section 27, is the same as \"arising under,\" you lose?",
  "But what's the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question?",
  "I don't understand. Necessary for what?",
  "You said that it would be only a suit if it were ­­ Federal suit if it were necessary.",
  "And you would say that's a duty created under this chapter.",
  "But why isn't it created under State law as well?",
  "If ­­ if ­­ if your answer is correct, why do they need to use the term \"exclusive\"? Why don't they just ­­ just ­­ just ­­",
  "­­ there is jurisdiction in Federal court. That ­­ why ­­ that doesn't explain the ­­ the use of the word \"exclusive.\"",
  "And it hasn't been argued by Liberty, and we can ask them about that, that this is burdensome, that it might be different from State to State and so forth, and it may be that this sounds more in conflict preemption than statutory preemption. But can you just answer a few questions? Does this apply to people that are not residents in Vermont but that have been treated in Vermont? And does it also apply to people that are outside of ­­ that are Vermonters but are treated outside Vermont? I mean, what ­­ who is the universe to whom these ­­ this applies? And it seems to me that that would be difficult for plans to ­­ to figure out.",
  "Suppose States had different reporting requirements and the plan showed ­­ they haven't ­­ I don't think showed, but suppose they showed that this was burdensome. Does that affect the analysis of the preemption question?",
  "I ­­ I know your time is running up, but consider two cases. Case one: Vermont is the only State that requires this. Case two: 50 states requirement ­­ require this and it's all different and it's burdensome. Same preemption analysis?",
  "And same result?",

  "My question is: What are the limits?",
  "My ­­ my hypothetical is that the Congress gives Indian powers ­­ Indian tribes complete powers, both civil and criminal, over all persons on tribal Reservations. No Federal review, nothing.",
  "Then why ­­ why doesn't ­­ why don't you make that argument here? How ­­ how can they ­­ how can they allow a tort suit?",

  "Just so you know, it seemed to me a reading of the first Montana exception, which is what we're talking about here, talking about taxation, licensing, then it talks about consensual relationships and we have this whole question: Is it explicit or is it implied? And then it talks about commercial dealing contracts, leases, or other arrangements. That doesn't sound like torts to me. And it seems to me that since there's a Reservation in mind, you might you want to address it.",

  "So we have said that even ­­ you read our cases saying even minor deviations are not permitted if they are statutorily required?",
  "And that's what Judge Wake said in his dissent.",
  "But Justice Alito can protect his own question, but he's asking you whether or not a deviation is permissible for protecting communities of interest, protecting municipal lines, whether some slight deviation is permissible.",
  "Well, aren't you saying that it's permissible to use, as one factor, an illegal standard if there are some other factors that are also in play? That it's permissible to use an illegal standard, in part?",
  "Is that what you want us to write in this opinion?",
  "Well, that's one of the issues in the case. We'll talk about that later, about partisanship. If you ­­ if you want to say it doesn't make any difference because partisanship is ­­ is a valid consideration, fine. That's your point. But my question is, it sounds to me, in response to your answer to Justice Alito, that you're saying that it is all right to use an illegal standard, in part, to reduce equal ­­ equal representation.",
  "Can I put in my notes that you're arguing that partisanship is a valid consideration in redistricting? Is that what you want me to say?",
  "Well, if the voter population is a permissible basis under the Constitution, I assume that's because there is ­­ is an ethical, a good government, a liberty interest in protecting these voters. That's a valid interest, correct?",
  "Well, if in a case like this where there is a 45 percent deviation, something of that order, then why isn't Texas required at that point to recognize that these interests that are legitimate under the Constitution, which are voter based, should not be accommodated, and so that you should at least give some consideration to this disparity that you have among voters?",
  "But why is one option exclusive of the other? Why can't you have both? You have population equality and voter equality, both, especially when you have indicated that a voter­based apportionment is ­­ is valid and serves important purposes.

  "In the Fifth Circuit. It does seem to me, as Justice Alito's question, and frankly some of the other questions have indicated, that the litigants, and frankly this Court, have been denied the advantage and the perspective that would be gained if there would be additional fact­finding under the instructions that Fisher sought to give. And that just ­­ we're just arguing the same case.",
  "It's as if nothing had happened.",
  "And I ­­ it seems to me that Justice Alito's question indicates that this is the kind of thing that we should know but we don't know.",
  "But they weren't given the chance to add additional evidence in order to meet that standard.",
  "But they could answer some of the questions as ­­ like the ones Justice Alito added. And I think it's a very important point.",
  "Is there any evidence that the holistic review being used by UT operates as a quota?",
  "But ­­ maybe I misapprehended either the question or the answer. But you're the one that says race can be relevant. And then in answer to Justice Alito's question, you say, oh, that's stereotyping. It seems to me that you're inconsistent.",
  "I ­­ I was going to ask: What evidence would you have put in if you had been successful in your motion to remand? And preliminary to that, I assume that district court would have had authority to remand to ­­ to allow the summary judgment record to be expanded or reopened?",
  "I understand ­­",
  "I understand. But ­­ but I ­­ I ­­ but ­­ but why did you want a remand? Because you wanted to expand the summary judgment record? And if so, what additional evidence would you have put in?",
  "But you ­­ but you asked for the remand ­­",
  "­­ and my question was: What evidence did you propose to put in if your motion had been granted?",
  "And if you did not have ­­",
  "If ­­ if you did not have the top 10 percent plan, but you did have the program that you're advocating for here, the holistic review, would you have a better or worse chance of achieving the diversity you seek?",
  "Well, all of the colloquy so far indicates to me that, if you had a remand, you would not have put in much different or much more evidence than we have in the record right now. Is that ­­",
  "­­ is that correct?",
  "But why can't we make those inferences from the record? I mean, if ­­ if you had a trial, you'd have credibility. You'd have experts and so forth ­­",
  "What you're saying, we ­­ we have a ­­ a remand only if we lose. I mean, that's what you're saying.",
  "And they ­­ they can do that with evidence that ­­ and ­­ and of events that occurred after the suit was brought?",
  "I ­­ I'm not quite sure how that works.",
  "If ­­ if you were to prevail, what would happen with private employers in a State which said that there should be an ­­ a union shop?",
  "What ­­",
  "And ­­ and because?",
  "I think that's correct as a basic distinction. It is true, though, assuming that you have a State statute which allows an agency shop or a ­­ a closed shop, that that is State participation in the very kind of coerced membership and coerced speech that you're objecting to.",
  "Well, even ­­ even with ­­",
  "­­ even ­­ aren't charges ­­ suppose the union has an article or a public relations campaign to protest merit pay. I take it that's a chargeable expense.",
  "So ­­ so collective bargaining in ­­ in this instance subsumes ­­ includes this wide­ranging effort on the part of the union to have a public relations campaign in favor of principles that some of its members ­­ that some teachers strongly object to.",
  "Well, Mr. Carvin, let's ­­ let's ­­ let's assume that stare decisis is an important consideration for the Court. Let's assume that.",
  "What about the answer to Justice Kagan's questions about the many contracts, perhaps thousands of contracts? Would they suddenly be endangered? Would they all be void? Could you address that?",
  "Any jeopardy, if not ­­",
  "Mr. Carvin ­­ Mr. ­­ Mr. Carvin, I see ­­ I see your ­­ I ­­ I ­­ I see your ­­ your time is running. Could you address briefly the opt­in/opt­out requirement, an issue which, I take it, is in the case, regardless of ­­ of ­­ of the ­­ the way we rule on the issue we've been discussing?",
  "But it's ­­ it's almost axiomatic. When you are dealing with a governmental agency, many critical points are matters of public concern. And is it not true that many teachers are ­­ strongly, strongly disagree with the union position on teacher tenure, on merit pay, on merit promotion, on classroom size? And you ­­ the term is free rider. The union basically is making these teachers compelled riders for issues on which they strongly disagree. Many teachers think that they are devoted to the future of America, to the future of our young people, and that the union is equally devoted to that but that the union is absolutely wrong in some of its positions. And agency fees require, as I understand it ­­ correct me if I'm wrong ­­ agency fees require that employees and teachers who disagree with those positions must nevertheless subsidize the union on those very points.",
  "Do union ­­ do unions have public relations programs of ­­ or newspaper articles, media programs to talk about things like merit pay, protecting underperforming teachers and so forth? Do the unions actually make those arguments, and aren't those chargeable expenses?",
  "Some of the ones I've mentioned are chargeable?",
  "You have a compelling interest.",
  "It's odd to say that if X is required to pay $500 for someone to espouse a belief that he doesn't share, that he is now free to go out and ­­ and argue against it. That means he has to spend another $500 so that it balances out? That makes no sense.",
  "The whole idea of Southworth was a public forum. Are you saying that the whole purpose of agency fees is to have an open public forum?",
  "Well, I suppose, if that's so convincing, the union can convince teachers to join the union.",
  "But ­­ but ­­ but philosophically, if you use Pickering in this case, you're committing error of composition. You're comparing a whole group of persons who have their views coerced or compelled against one person that ­­ that ­­ Pickering is just inapplicable on that ­­ on that ground.",
  "I ­­ I suppose ­­",
  "Mr. Fredericks, we ­­ I suppose, Mr. Fredericks, we could assume that a State is always benefitted and ­­ and is more efficient if it can suppress speech.",
  "That was in the workplace. It doesn't apply to merit pay. It didn't apply to the protection of underperforming teachers. It ­­ it didn't ­­ it didn't apply to classroom size. It didn't apply to educational objectives.",
  "You're again talking about a whole class of persons whose speech has been silenced, not just one person.",
  "Big difference.",
  "But I thought it was clearly established ­­ I thought you agreed ­­ page 14, I think, of your reply brief ­­ that it is clearly established that it would be a violation of ­­ of Taylor and ­­ and Turner if the factfinder bases its verdict on evidence not in the record.",
  "Well, but to begin with, we have a ­­ a general statement: The evidence must be based ­­ pardon me ­­ the verdict must be based on the evidence in the record. Correct?",
  "All right. And we agree with that.",
  "Then I don't see how ­­ I don't understand your answer to Justice Kagan.",
  "And ­­ and so it's not clear that there was a Guidelines violation here. The Guidelines were incorrectly calculated, but it's not clear that at the end of the day there was a violation. I mean, is that really your response to Justice Ginsburg, or am I oversimplifying?",
  "Well, there was a miscalculation. I'm not sure if there was a misapplication. That's ­­ I ­­ I suppose that's the issue in the case. Or ­­ or is this ­­",
  "­­ is this quibble wrong?",
  "Under Justice Alito's questioning, he asked if ­­ isn't it true that you have the burden of persuasion at the outset to show that there was a miscalculation? Once you meet that, his question was does the government then ­­ I believe his question was ­­ does the government then have the burden of persuasion to show no error. He was careful not to use the word \"presumption,\" or at least he did not use the word \"presumption.\" Is that the proper way to think of this case in your view? Another way of asking the question is ­­ continues with what Justice Alito was inquiring: Do we need to use the word \"presumption\" here?",
  "Well, in that case would you still send it back to the district judge to ask him in the case you just put?",
  "We're trying to ­­ let's assume that we're going to give you some relief ­­ that was far from clear, but let's assume that. We're trying to find out what the rule ought to be, what the standard ought to be. In the case you just explained to us, in your view, should that case go back to the district court?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, that's because you're using ­­",
  "­­ that's because you're using the term \"presumption.\" You don't have to use the term \"presumption.\" You can say that this defendant has met his burden of persuasion. We make the assumption here, we ­­ a few of us have practiced under the Guidelines ­­ maybe none of us ­­ that the Guidelines are the beginning point in almost every sentence. That's the beginning point, not the ending point, but the beginning point. And the question is: Once this is shown, like, at a minimum, can't you just ask the district judge? Now, if you want to say that there is sentencing miscalculations in 20 percent of the cases, that they happen all the time, that this is going to burden the courts, I suppose you can make that argument. But many circuits, or some circuits at least, have the rule; they just remand it, ask the district judge.",
  "In regard to ­­ are you telling us that even if there's a significant risk that this sentence was too high, in this case there can be no relief?",
  "Is that the government's position?",
  "To the extent that our decision is influenced by our considerations of what kind of a burden, say the Petitioner's proposed rule would put on the resources of the Court, is there anything we can look to or can you or your co­counsel or your colleague for the Petitioner tell us how often Sentencing Guidelines occur in 20 percent of the cases, 5 percent of the cases? And when they do, is it that disruptive to ask the district court, what would you do? Remand.",
  "Well, suppose there were three unrelated cases.",
  "Suppose there were three unrelated cases. Would the statute pass?",
  "Yes, it specifies them by number and so forth.",
  "I ­­ I inadvertently interrupted Justice Ginsburg, but in the ­­ in the 19 cases here, you don't find that principle?",
  "What about the Robertson case? Is ­­ isn't that the case involving the timber?",
  "Well, as Justice Alito indicated, actually it named cases by ­­ didn't it reference the case by number?",
  "Because it violates what ­­ what principle? At ­­ at ­­ at the end of the day, I suppose maybe bill of attainder if there's a real intent to punish. Maybe equal protection might work. But I take it you're relying on separation of powers?",
  "Well, perhaps ­­ perhaps they are when the assets are held by a country as to which we have very delicate relations with matters particularly involving dangerous acts allegedly perpetrated by that country.",
  "Any suggestion ­­",
  "Well, your ­­ your answers seem to be that if the President does something, that he has more power, more authority than when the President acting with Congress does something. I would think it would be just the opposite.",
  "I assume that the President signed this legislation. This wasn't a veto override.",
  "Well, suppose ­­ suppose the ­­ the executive and the President determines that if you have this legislation, then a settlement will be easier down the road. We're going to flex our muscles; we're going to bring these people to the bargaining table. You can't do that?",
  "Well ­­ well, suppose ­­ suppose it were one case. Suppose there were two pending cases ­­ a private person, private Jones v.

  "No. No, you're ­­ you're ­­ you're correct that there was a substantial discussion about cases that had not been reduced to final judgment.

  "Or delimiting.",
  "When you say it's closer to the line, what line? That's what we're trying to ask.",
  "But your ­­ your answer was there's a difference between amending the law and directing a result in the same case. That seems to me different from what Mr. Olson was arguing.",
  "What ­­ what is the principle that would prohibit directing the result in a specific case? A separation of powers principle?",
  "So we are ­­ so ­­ so if we interpret this matter before us as directing a result in a particular case, the Petitioners prevail?",
  "I'm ­­ I'm not ­­ I'm ­­ you're quite articulate. I'm not sure I follow.",

  "They can vote, but they can't take part in campaigns? Like the Hatch Act?",
  "Can the government insist on neutrality?",
  "And what's your best case for that proposition?",
  "So are you saying there's a right to be secure from government oversight of your beliefs?",
  "Is ­­ is that because you're concerned with a chill, or is there some other right that is ­­ is somehow affected that's a First Amendment right of the individual? You turn around and you say the government cannot act for an unconstitutional purpose, but we usually ask how is the defendant hurt? What is his right? That's still a little unclear to me.",

  "Well, why is the ­­ so you're ­­ you're just saying that the Park Service lacks authority to promulgate this regulation quite without regard to this statute, which doesn't help me very much.",
  "But that's not true as to navigable waters. The Federal government can regulate navigable waters.",
  "­­ within such unit?",
  "But is that true even if it's a ­­ the regulation is nation ­­ applicable nationwide?",

  "All right.",
  "All right. So we're not talking about allotments open to the general population?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Well ­­ well ­­ well, please correct me if I'm wrong from the record. My ­­ my understanding was in the west portion, the Tribe had done ­­ had exercised no jurisdiction until the Beverage Control Ordinance recently, but on the east portion, that they had. But then you say, well, we can't tell the difference in east and west.",
  "And I mean, is ­­ is that reading of the record mistaken?",
  "What ­­ what ­­ but does the fact that nothing, if ­­ if the record is correct ­­ let's assume the record shows that the Tribe exercised no jurisdiction over the western portion until this alcoholic Beverage Control Ordinance. Is that relevant to the case at all?",
  "Is it relevant?",
  "Why is it ­­ why is it relevant? To what point?",
  "You ­­ you ­­ Justice Ginsburg asked you a question, you said, as a practical matter. I thought ­­ maybe I misinterpreted her question here ­­ as a legal matter. As a legal matter, if you prevail, can the Tribe cast any doubt on the authority and the jurisdiction of the existing municipality?",
  "So on Indian Reservation lands, I take it Tribal police have jurisdiction over non­Indians as to minor offenses?",
  "Well, you ­­ you have the example of a scuffle. Suppose an Indian and a non­Indian are in a scuffle. If ­­ if there's a ­­ a minor criminal statute making this a minor offense, does the Tribe have jurisdiction over the non­Indian?",
  "And that's true with reference to all Indian tribes? Can you cite me any proposition for that?",
  "But our ­­ our questions have been, suppose that you prevail, what can the State do? And we say, oh, it's a practical matter. Don't worry. They won't do ­­ the Tribe won't do anything. The Tribe won't do anything. What could the Tribe do?",
  "Yes, to regulate nonTribal members.",
  "Do you think that something else includes a subjective component, whether there was a purpose to see if there was a warrant?",
  "Is it that ­­ it's true that that would be a step maybe beyond our ­­ our ­­ our cases. On the ­­ on the other hand, if the inquiry is one of flagrancy, then maybe that's necessary. And it may be particularly necessary here because under the line of questioning that Justice Kagan just concluded with you, it would seem odd for this Court to say the higher crime ­­ the more it's a high­crime area, the less basis you have to stop. That's very odd.",
  "So it seems to me that the subjective­purpose component might serve an important purpose here, so that a police officer can't just say, I'm going to see if there's a warrant for this fellow. I'm ­­ that's the reason I'm going to stop. That seems to me quite ­­ quite wrong.",
  "So that was my point about the importance or the likely importance of purpose in this analysis.",
  "Could ­­ could you ­­ is it permissible to do a warrant check as part of a lawful Terry stop?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, in ­­ in ­­ in this case, the State, as I understand it ­­ please correct me if I'm wrong ­­ has conceded that the stop was unlawful. It has not conceded that it was flagrantly unlawful; isn't ­­ isn't that correct?",
  "So we take the case as one in which there was no ­­ there was no flagrant conduct?",
  "Could you ­­",
  "Go ahead.",
  "But you still have to say that it's flagrant.",
  "You're asking us to say that, as a matter of law, you want us to hold that the purpose of this stop was to run the warrants check? I thought the purpose of the stop was to find out what was going ­­ what was going on in the house.",
  "The record just doesn't support the first proposition that I made.",
  "What was the amount of this contract?",
  "And I suppose there is some system for the government to check to see whether or not this person really has been offering this good, has ­­ has a track record, because that goes with the fair and reasonable price?",
  "How do ­­ how do we know how to evaluate your answer or the government's position if the government comes and says, oh, this is just unworkable, it's going to be difficult if we've never been involved in government contracting? Are there findings? Are there ­­ are there writings in law reviews or what ­­ what do we look to, to determine the empirical basis for your argument, or the lack of empirical basis for your argument?",
  "Based on what we think is going to happen?",
  "I thought your answer would be a hundred percent.",
  "What is your answer to Justice Breyer? A hundred percent provided the statutory requirements are satisfied?",
  "And we know how many businesses there are because they registered under a special procedure.",

  "Correct.",
  "What ­­ what factors does the secretary look to when the secretary sets goals? Because I'm going back to the argument about for purposes of meeting the goals.",
  "What ­­ what ­­ what standards does the Congress impose on the secretary when the secretary sets the goals?",
  "What does he ­­",
  "What does he consider in deciding whether to go 5, 10, 15? The risk of litigation? The higher the goal is? Or ­­",
  "Well, if the discretion is that broad, then it seems to me that maybe the Federal circuit was wrong, that these goals are simply aspirational. But that doesn't have any real effect on the operation of the statute.",
  "Who ­­",

  "Yes. Is it 5 percent, or ­­",
  "I see.",
  "What response do you have to judge ­­ Justice Ginsburg's question that really you're making us a court of first impression here? Shouldn't we send this back?",
  "The enhanced damages that we're discussing really is almost entirely punitive if the octane standard for attorneys' fees remains in effect. In other words, an octane standard is ­­ gives a judge much more latitude to impose ­­ to award attorneys' fees when there's been unnecessary resistance. So all we're talking about is punitive damages.",
  "And you ­­ and you want to just basically dismantle the willfulness structure that the court of appeals has established; is that correct?",
  "Is there any way to allow some consideration for a subjective intent to infringe in an egregious case, as an additional element for ­­ as an additional way to define willfulness without completely wrecking the Seagate standard?",
  "Well, then you could make the same argument if it was conceded that these drugs were an interstate. You say, oh, well, you still have to show an effect. Is that what you're saying?",
  "Based on your answer to Justice Kagan, doesn't make any difference whether it's local or interstate.",
  "There is still a failure of proof somehow.",
  "That's ­­ that's very hard ­­ that's very hard to comprehend.",
  "Do you ­­ do you think robbery of an item in interstate commerce has an effect on that commerce?",
  "Of goods in interstate commerce have an effect on interstate commerce? Or does the government in every case have to show that there is an effect.",
  "The government in every case in your submission has to show that if there's a robbery of goods in interstate commerce, that it has to put on an economic expert to show that there's an effect on interstate commerce when there's been a robbery. That's your position?",
  "All right. Well, then how do you explain your answer that \"effect\" is the key word here?",
  "You just concluded that it isn't.",
  "I don't ­­ I don't understand where we're going here. It seemed to me a few minutes ago you said, oh, there's no evidence that he was a drug dealer. But that's not the question presented. Your question presented assumes that he's a drug dealer, so don't argue that.",
  "So we know that there's a drug dealer here. We take the case on that basis.",
  "All right. So we're talking about the interstate and local. So it seems to me that you've ­­ you just have not raised the point that there was no evidence that he was a drug dealer.",
  "It's not in your petition.",
  "So what's ­­ what's the instruction that the Court should give to the jury with respect to this jurisdictional element? \"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard evidence that there was a robbery of a drug dealer. I ­­ you are instructed as a matter of law\" ­­",
  "­­ \"that the marijuana trade is a subject over which the Congress has jurisdiction and this statute controls\"? That's not a very good interpretation.",
  "And there's ­­ there's nothing for the jury to find on this point?",
  "Well, it ­­ it seems to me that this instruction is much more defendant­friendly than the one you indicated that is a minimum. In other words ­­",
  "­­ I read this ­­ if ­­ if I'm the juror, I read these instructions as saying that I have to find that this affects interstate commerce.",
  "Let's say ­­",
  "Let's ­­ let's say that this Court had a decision that home­grown marijuana has an affect on interstate commerce. Let's say that that's ­­ then there's a trial. What instruction ­­ can ­­ can any evidence be introduced?",
  "Contest commerce part ­­ part of the indictment?",
  "Let's ­­ let's assume ­­ let's assume the Court has decided that ­­",
  "­­ and then there's a trial. Is ­­ is the defendant entitled to introduce any evidence on that point?",
  "So ­­",
  "So does the jury have any discretion to ­­ to return a verdict of not guilty if it finds that there was a robbery of a drug dealer ­­ of ­­ of ­­ of drugs that have been home grown?",
  "What ­­",
  "Actually ­­ actually, I think got 21, my chambers was telling me. You might check that. Which is, to me, one ­­ one year too many, but whatever.",
  "Going ­­ going back to this case, the example that you gave with reference to the maritime jurisdiction, what you tell the jury is, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you find that the incidents that have been considered in this court occurred on the high seas, then the jurisdictional element is satisfied.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Okay. Then in this case, it suffices, in your view, if you say if you find there was a robbery of a drug dealer, then the jurisdictional element is satisfied?",
  "And the only defense evidence that could be introduced in the case is that the ­­ that the drugs were not involved? The defense could show that drugs were not involved.",
  "But that's about all they can do with reference to the jurisdictional element?",
  "What is your understanding of what the defendant wanted to ­­ the evidence the defendant wanted to introduce?",
  "Was there any challenge to the status of these victims as dealers?",
  "I understand that.",
  "It was an attempt against persons who were in the drug trade?",
  "That isn't this case. This case is a robbery of a drug dealer, correct?",
  "But if that hadn't happened, prices would have been higher. So it was to suppress prices.",
  "But you used the auction dynamic, the auction mechanism to go outside of the ­­ of that dynamic.",
  "That ­­ that's ­­ I ­­",
  "I'm ­­ I'm sure that that's one of the issues in the case.",
  "Would it be correct or incorrect to say that under Maryland law, you entered ­­ you entered the auction, and as a result, you altered the consequences of that auction in a way that was inconsistent with FERC's policy. Is that a fair or an unfair statement?",
  "So you're saying that FERC ­­ FERC doesn't understand its own order?",
  "How do you define the field that's preempted?",
  "Are they ­­ are they setting rates by having ended the auction?",
  "In a sense, I guess all of the bidders in the conventional auction in effect set their rates by their bid.",
  "So why is this ­­ why is this different?",
  "What is it that indicates that the Federal statute tracks the common law? The Federal statute gives its own definition.",
  "Well, what's the common law term?",
  "Excuse me. Let me get the statute. The statute talks about \"use.\"",
  "But Congress doesn't ­­ the ­­ the statute doesn't talk ­­ say ­­ say the word \"battery.\" It doesn't use it.",
  "It defines it in ­­ in this special way.",
  "Justice Ginsburg's example of operating an automobile: A husband is arguing with his wife and speeds through a stop sign and the wife is injured. What results under the statute?",
  "Well, the ­­ the main statute says \"recklessly causes bodily injury.\"",
  "I'm not talking about overbreadth. I'm talking about interpretation of the statute. The statute includes a misdemeanor, so that disposes of that part of your answer. The statute covers a misdemeanor.",
  "It's narrow, but it seems to qualify under the statute. I don't quite understand your answer. You said, oh, well, it's narrow. But it's still a violation under the meaning of the statute.",
  "So you're saying that the example is covered by the statute.",
  "Do we have precedent from this Court saying it's okay, we can trust the prosecutors to do the right thing? Can you cite me a case that says that?",
  "I ­­ I suppose one answer is ­­ just a partial answer to Justice Thomas's question is SORNA, a violation of sexual offenders have to register before they can travel in interstate commerce. But that's not a prevention from traveling at all. It's just a ­­ it's a restriction.",
  "Well, what ­­ what is the rule, then, that you're formulating, so that we can answer Justice Alito's questions and similar questions? Recusal is required when, and fill in the blank.",
  "Under that answer, then, why doesn't the Brady violation problem drop out of the case? And that's not an argument for ­­ for ­­ an extra argument for recusal.",
  "Well, he didn't know about the Brady violation. The Brady violation basically occurred in ­­ in the course of trial.",
  "I mean after they sought the death penalty.",
  "Well, then, that doesn't follow with the rule that you gave me at the outset. You should recuse yourself when, and now ­­ now you're adding ­­ if there's a question that involves a substantial integrity ­­ a substantial question involving the integrity of the office? So that's an added ­­",
  "That's an added factor in your analysis?",
  "I ­­ I still don't see how the Brady violation fits into the formula you want us to adopt, unless you're amending it to say anything that involves the integrity of the office while you were the head of the office.",
  "Well, the number of amicus briefs filed by former prosecutors and attorneys belies and refutes that ­­ that suggestion, it seems to me. And Section 455 of 28 U.S.C., where we have rather mechanical recusal standards, also refutes that.",
  "No, but you were arguing, well, this is going to be unworkable. And we know, both from the briefs and the statutes, that far more rigid recusal standards are in place and are quite workable.",
  "Well, but here, of course, the essence of the Brady violation has alleged ­­ as alleged, is that the evidence was concealed for years; they didn't know about it.",
  "He didn't know about it because subordinates in his ­­ his office, under his supervision, concealed the facts.",
  "So the fact that he spent 30 years in solitary confinement actually helps the State?",
  "So I ­­ I suppose, for purposes of phrasing the question, to reach questions here, we ­­ we will assume that there is bias; we assume he should have recused. But then is it your submission that there is harmless error because it was a multimember panel?",
  "Is that a fair statement or not?",
  "The ­­",
  "Suppose you have a very brilliant trial judge, and the power of his reasoning is ­­ it's persuasive and ­­ and forceful but he's biased, end of case. You have ­­ he has to be recused.",
  "But if ­­ if we say that, then we say that being a judge on a 15­judge court doesn't really make much difference. You ­­ you don't have a duty, and you don't have an obligation. You can't persuade your colleagues. It's very hard for us to write that kind of decision.",
  "Would you have to show under State law not only the veil­piercing ­­ that there's veil piercing, but that there is fraud under State law?",
  "We're not limited ­­",
  "We're not limited to fraudulent conveyances here. You want to read the statute and say something like for money obtained from the innocent party in the first instance by. And that ­­ that ­­ but fraud can continue through ­­ through a whole chain.",
  "And ­­ and if it continues through the whole chain, the person on the end of the chain may have never had any relation with the innocent party at all.",
  "Come on and answer ­­",
  "Are you ­­ it's mentioned in one ­­ one of the briefs ­­ I don't have the reference to it ­­",
  "­­ at hand. What would happen if he decides he's ­­ and this is all just within the United States, no foreign travel ­­ he decides that he wants to move to the West Coast, so he checks out of Kansas. But he's not sure where he wants to live, so he drives to Washington, Oregon, California, takes two weeks. What would the requirement for registration be there?",
  "But the arrival jurisdiction is not your residence yet. He doesn't know what it's going to be. He's just there two days. And he's going to go two days, and he's going to look around.",
  "Yes.",
  "What bearing on your argument does the last sentence at the bottom of 11(a), the last sentence of C have? That jurisdiction, in other words, the jurisdiction where he registered, shall immediately provide that information to all other jurisdictions in which the defendant is required to register. Here, there were none.",
  "My question was, does ­­ does this have significant relevance to your argument here?",
  "Yes.",
  "Is it your position that he was required to notify Kansas both that he was terminating his residence and that he was moving to the Philippines, or just that he was terminating his residence?",
  "But he was not required to?",
  "I ­­ I think your answer was clear, but I didn't understand it. Would it ­­ in your view ­­",
  "­­ would it have been compliant with SORNA simply to say I am leaving Kansas, period?",
  "But the ­­ the Philippines is not a jurisdiction under the statute.",
  "Current where?",
  "But you could have amended ­­ you could have asked for supplemental briefing. I mean, the new action is filed six days after the Supreme Court issues its decision in this case. You could have asked for supplemental briefing?",
  "And what's this key new evidence?",
  "Well, certainly in the Federal system, and I assume in many States as well, regulations sometimes take years to promulgate. I don't know of any rule that says we have to wait for regular ­­ regulations to be promulgated unless it's something unanticipated. And the key objections you're making were clear in the statute, anyway.",
  "The ­­ the State, I think, is going to talk about the capacity of the remaining clinics. Would it be A, proper, and B, helpful, for this Court to remand for further findings on clinic capacity?",
  "There ­­ there have been some changes, like a ­­ a major clinic ­­ I don't quite know the adjective they use for it ­­ in San Antonio. But there ­­ suppose there were evidence that there was a ­­ a capacity and a ­­ and a capability to ­­ to build these kinds of clinics, would that be of importance? And then it would show that this law has an effect, and a beneficial effect so far as the legislature is concerned.",
  "About 20 percent.",
  "Do you think the district court would have had discretion ­­ the district court having substantial equitable powers that appellate courts don't ­­ to say we're going to stay this requirement for two­and­a­half, three years, to see if the capacity problem can be cured. Could a ­­ could a district judge could that?",
  "I mean, district judges often think they can do anything.",
  "Before you get ­­ is it ­­ is the underlying premise of ­­ of your argument, Mr. Keller, and of the State's position, that the thrust, the impetus, the effect of this law is to increase surgical abortions as distinct from medical abortions, and that that is within the State's authority to do? Because my reading indicated that medical abortions are up nationwide but down significantly in Texas.",
  "But I thought an underlying theme, or at least an underlying factual demonstration, is that this law has really increased the number of surgical procedures as opposed to medical procedures, and that this may not be medically wise.",
  "You might say that this is within the authority of the State to do, but ­­",
  "And I want to know what your position is on that.",
  "Before ­­ before the Act?",
  "But doesn't that show that the undue­burden test is weighed against what the State's interest is?",
  "I mean, are they ­­ are they ­­ are these two completely discrete analytical categories, undue burden, and we don't look at the State's interest?",
  "Sonia is off.",
  "Politics motivates the change in district. That is our objective. That is what we seek to do, to preserve incumbency or whatever.",
  "May we then use race to move people from one district to another, simply because that's the easiest way to do it? We know that this is a ­­ a race that votes strongly for a particular party, so we can use race for this ultimate neutral purpose?",
  "The ­­ the district ­­ I understood your argument to be that, so ­­",
  "So perhaps you can correct me.",
  "Justice Kagan can ask her own question, but he suffered injury­in­fact to what?",

  "But would they have a legally ­­",

  "If the State had a plan designed to protect incumbency and it did not do that, could a ­­ a voter object to the fact that the incumbency rationale was not followed?",
  "Can voters assert an interest in preserving incumbency?",
  "So then ­­ so then you have an ­­ an acknowledged interest on the part of this legislature, but ­­ that the ­­ the fact that the plan fails to accomplish that, no one ­­ nobody can object?",
  "Under your view, could the legislature as a whole intervene?",
  "So a legislature who passes the law has greater standing than the individual who is affected by the law?",
  "It sounds to me like it's incumbency, which is the very thing you say that this one individual cannot protect. Why can a legislature ­­ a whole legislature say it, but not one legislature. I don't understand it.",
  "Well, why isn't it the question where you could have drawn the map another way? Are ­­ are you saying that you can draw a map only by using race, then you can't draw the map? Is that your position? I can see where you could take that position, but is that what you're saying?",
  "Is that ­­ is that true when the legislature specifically has adopted incumbency protection as a matter of State law or a matter of State policy?",
  "Either civilly or criminally?",
  "But if ­­ if ­­",
  "If you prevail, and there is a case with mostly foreign conduct and foreign injuries, and if personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens are satisfied, then these actions could be brought under RICO in foreign courts, correct?",
  "In foreign courts.",
  "Why not?",
  "Well, you're saying it applies extraterritorially.",
  "Is ­­ is that another way of saying that the judgment bar applies just to judgments of the merits, or is that somewhat different from your argument?",
  "Isn't that the same as the argument you just made? Because I'm curious to know, if ­­ if we think Smith was an interpretation of ­­ of 2680, and you had to get around Smith and it's awkward to do it, what's your second argument? Is that the argument you're now making to Justice Breyer, or is it different from saying that what we're talking about is judgment on the merits?",
  "You ­­ you ­­ you began, Mr. Clement, by saying that the government mischaracterizes your position, and I was just not quite sure where that argument was taking us. You're getting more into the specifics of it now, but could you just begin again there, and ­­",
  "­­ again, what we are talking about?",
  "Is the ­­ is the essence of your argument that ­­ and your objection is that the contraceptive coverage is ­­ is being done through the health insurance that you contract with?",
  "Do we accept the ­­ your clients' view on complicity, or do we have a polygraph analysis and see how far the causation go? Do we just accept your view on complicity and then just see whether or not the accomodation is possible on this and that's the least restrictive?",
  "The same with a university?",
  "The same with a university?",
  "Well, but then you're answering really to the affirmative in ­­ to Justice Ginsburg's question. Once you give it to a ­­ a church, you have to give it to any other religious organization. That's ­­ that's your position.",
  "It's going to be very difficult for this Court to write an opinion which says that once you have a church organization, you have to treat a religious university the same. I just find that very difficult to write.",
  "Paid for by the government?",
  "And is it fair for me to infer from the way you open your remarks that you concede that there is a substantial burden here? And the question then is what is a permissible accommodation? What's the least restrictive alternative? Do you concede that there's a substantial burden?",
  "Well, do ­­ do you question their belief that they're complicit in the moral wrong?",
  "Well, then ­­ then it seems to me that that's a substantial burden. And then ­­ and the next question is whether there is an accommodation and whether that's the least restrictive.",
  "But you're saying, don't worry, religions, you're not complicit. That's what you're saying?",
  "It seems to me then the analysis has to be whether or not there are less restrictive alternatives and if ­­ is this the least restrictive alternative?",
  "That just underscores that the church plans here, religious organization plans here, are, in effect, subsidizing the conduct that they deemed immoral.",
  "If it's so easy to provide, if it's so free, why can't they just get it through another plan?",
  "That's why it's necessary to hijack the plans.",
  "But you can make that same answer if it's just a standard assignee for collection of -- of a debt for single person.",
  "No, no. It's a full assignment, where everybody agrees that there's standing.",
  "You can make the same argument: Oh, he might not have all the information.",
  "Well, I don't like to be the broken record. I'm just not getting -- I don't see why that isn't the responsibility of the plaintiff. The district court said, now, you've brought these claims. The defendants need this information. You go get that. That's your responsibility.",
  "Can you tell me is this 1,400 causes of action or is it one?",
  "How does that come about? Suppose a lot of people owe the bank -- a lot of farmers owe the bank money, can there be assignment in this one cause of action?",
  "And how does the law express the metaphysical process in which 1,400 causes of action become one cause of action?",
  "Well, there is not a representative cause of action. What is the magic point at which it becomes one cause of action?",
  "I'm still missing something here. Can you give me an example of where this has happened in other cases that this Court has heard that are commonly heard?",
  "I interrupted you and I talked over you. Every Rule 23 cause of action and what else?",
  "Well, associational standing, Sierra Club v. Morton, they are interested in an ongoing injury in which there is a common -- in which there is a common injury. These are liquidated amounts.",
  "Those are usually ongoing injuries as to which there's a common interest in stopping the injury. Here you're aggregating liquidated amounts.",
  "I might understand it if was some sort of injunction actions -- in the future please pay what you're supposed to pay.",
  "But that's allowed because the requisites for class actions have been met and that's authorized by the rule. That's not true here.",
  "There are a lot of better procedures that are in the rules but it is not in the rule.",
  "Do you agree that this could not have been brought as a class action?",
  "Why didn't you bring it as a class action?",
  "Then why didn't you bring it as a class action? We can all go home.",
  "But why do we have Rule 23 that requires certification of a class action? If you can say, well, I don't need Rule 23, I'm going to take 1400 claims and make them one any way.",
  "And are problems --",
  "Are the requirements of typicality and -- the same type of injury designed in part to preserve the rights of the defendant?"
