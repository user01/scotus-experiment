  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by trying to answer Justice Breyer's question as to why TELRIC was a sensible policy choice by the FCC, and in so doing, I hope also to be able to address Justice Kennedy's concern about whether TELRIC underestimates the cost that a company will face going forward. And then if I -- if I can, I'd like to turn to Justice Scalia's question about whether TELRIC offers a fair opportunity to recover embedded costs. Paragraph 679 of the local competition order is where the FCC spells out in detail what its rationales were. And what the FCC said in paragraph 679 is that it wanted to adopt TELRIC to send -- to send the right signals to new entrants about when to buy and when to build and to prevent anti-competitive behavior by the incumbent with respect to the pricing of network elements. And that's critical from our perspective. As a retail matter, the incumbents have every right, under the State law and Federal antitrust laws, to price their retail offerings in these new competitive markets at their long-run incremental costs. That's what the State laws say. That's what the antitrust laws say. And therefore, if they could charge us the historical costs for these key inputs -- the historical costs for key inputs, when they can charge retail based on their long- run incremental costs, we could never compete using --",
  "Yes, thank you. And -- and that's just not right. And their own experts, Professor Kahn, in particular -- and this is at page 155 of the joint appendix -- concedes that that's not right, that if you set the depreciation and cost of capital appropriately to reflect the risks of -- existing in the TELRIC world, then TELRIC will provide the full compensation. Now, Professor Kahn concedes that. I believe Mr. Barr acknowledged that at the beginning of his argument. It all comes down to what those depreciation rates and costs of capital are. And what the FCC said very clearly is that the States set depreciation rates. That's in paragraph 29. The regulation itself says that they must be economic depreciation. That means they must account for the full loss in value as a result of technological change. And in paragraph 702 of the order, the FCC said we expect States to set depreciation rates that take this into account, that take this risk into account.",
  "But if depreciation and cost of capital are set right, it won't do that, Justice Breyer, and I believe that is what Professor Kahn conceded, their expert. And that is why, Justice Kennedy, the rate going forward, the TELRIC rate going forward, will not necessarily be lower than the cost that the incumbents incurred going forward, because a rate, after all, is a product of three things: the cost structure, the depreciation rate -- in other words, how few years you recover it -- and the cost of capital -- in other words, what the risk adjustment is. So, it could well be that the rates would be the same or higher depending on how depreciation and cost of capital are set.",
  "It -- the -- the -- separate two questions out. I think there's two -- two points to be made in there, Justice Scalia. With respect to what -- what the cost of capital ought to be set at, under the regs and under the FCC's order, is to reflect the risks of operating in the system.",
  "So, I think it does do what Mr. Barr claims it doesn't do. I think it very clearly does do that. Now, with respect to their sunk or embedded costs, I think it's a different question because the issue here is whether the TELRIC in operation will produce rates and returns, then in operation don't cover the -- the undepreciated costs still on their books. And the FCC made a specific finding -- that ultimately, Justice Scalia, is a much more empirical than a methodological question. It is possible, as a matter of logic and methodology, for TELRIC to do so, depending on how the inputs are set. And therefore, it is an empirical question whether it will, in fact, do so. The FCC in the notice of proposed rulemaking in this case specifically asked the incumbents for evidence as to what that gap would be. The incumbents produced nothing. Nothing. The FCC made a finding in paragraph 707 of the order that there was no evidence in the record to support the proposition that the adoption of TELRIC would result in significant stranded costs. But the FCC did more than that. It extended an invitation to the incumbents to come back with proof that there would, indeed, be significant stranded costs. That invitation has been outstanding for 5 years now. The incumbents have come back with nothing. But that's not all. The way this statute operates is the FCC produced a methodology, which is then applied in the States, in the States according to these rules, setting depreciation rates, setting costs of capital. Every State in the Union has had a proceeding of that kind. This statute in section 252(b)(6) makes those proceedings reviewable in Federal district court. Therefore, in every State in the Union, the incumbents have had the opportunity to demonstrate that in application TELRIC will produce rates that don't recover significant amounts of stranded cost. They have not succeeded anywhere in the country. Indeed, in the vast majority of States, they haven't even tried. And the reason is because there isn't a big gap.",
  "No, I think it's right. That is his argument. But it's not what paragraph 702 says and it's not what happened in operation. The States have set depreciation rates that are downward departures. California, for example, cut the switching depreciation rates in half. So, it's just not the case that that's what's happened out there in the real world. And there are dozens of -- there have been dozens of opportunities for this case to be proven on the basis of a real rate in Federal district court. And there -- as I said, in the few cases where it has even been attempted, it has been rejected, and most of the time it hasn't even been tried. And if -- let me try to get back, if I could, to that 340/180 comparison that's in the briefs and we've had some discussion about. Here's why TELRIC doesn't produce the kinds of results that -- that example suggests. It's because the 340 is way, way too high. The 340 is everything in the entire network and the entire corporate superstructure that goes with it. And that is not all devoted to the production of local telephone service. It's -- there are -- tens of billions of dollars of that are devoted to creating capacity for long distance service. Billions and billions of dollars additionally are devoted to capacity for video service, for CENTREX service, for other services that wouldn't be reflected in TELRIC rates. There are just -- you'd have this huge allocation problem if you take this. And this I think shows why TELRIC is the practical answer here as well as the fair one. You would have a massive allocation problem if you took that 340 because, first of all, you'd have to figure out how many tens and tens of billions of dollars got taken out for all these services that have nothing to do with providing local telephone service. Then of the $45 billion in that 342 that's devoted to corporate overhead, you would need to figure out how much of that is appropriately devoted to -- to the local telephone service.",
  "Well, no, but there's a --",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.",
  "But -- but, Justice Scalia, a significant amount of that goes to retail which can't be allocated here. And then when you get done with all that, then you've got to take out the billions of dollars in phantom assets that the FCC's most recent audit of their books identified. And then when you get done with that, then you've got to decide how much of that was actually prudently incurred. And when you get done with that very long process, that number is going to come way, way down. Now, on the other side, the 180 is too low. And the FCC specifically said it was too low and warned against using it for exactly the comparison that Mr. Barr used it for because it's designed to calculate universal service subsidies at the very most basic low level. So, that comparison just doesn't hold up. And so, the undepreciated part of the comparison, Justice Breyer, doesn't hold up either because the number is not going to be -- the undepreciated number of everything is $140 billion-$150 billion. But the undepreciated part of what they entitled to recovery under TELRIC is going to be a much smaller number than that number because you'd have to take out everything I just described. So, it just doesn't wash. There may be some difference with respect to some of the elements. Switching costs have come down. Of course, loop costs have not come down, and the loop costs are 48 percent, according to the FCC in this order, of the overall cost of providing service. And those have been stable over time. So, the fact is you just don't have a huge problem. You don't have a big gap. And that's why, Justice Scalia, when you adopt one methodology, when you adopt this methodology here, given the fact that it is an empirical matter, there's no reason to think there's a huge gap. There's no reason to think that the outcome will necessarily preclude them the opportunity of earning a fair return. And that's why I think this case is an easier one than Duquesne because at least in Duquesne, you knew how much wasn't going to be recovered as a result of the switch in methodology. Here, you don't know how much isn't going to be recovered, but what you do know, based on the facts that I've just conveyed to the Court, is that it's not going to be a very big number, even if you assume that all elements are leased. And of course, as Justice Ginsburg's question pointed out, only 3 percent -- it's not 6 percent. The FCC's most recent figures are 3 percent -- 3 percent -- of the local network is being leased. Which leads me to a practical point here, that if the world were the way the incumbents were describing it, it would be a very different place in fact than it is. We would be making all the money. They would be in trouble. The reality is --",
  "-- they are making all the money and we are in trouble. And the reason for that -- and -- and, indeed, they would be derelict in their responsibilities to their shareholders if they weren't taking advantage of this gigantic regulatory arbitrage opportunity to go into each other's local markets and take away all the customers. But they're not doing that. The reason they're not doing that is because the opportunity doesn't exist. This -- the thing that's a fantasy, the thing that's hypothetical in this case is the claims they are making about what this system is and the way it works. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The record is clear that the FCC revoked NextWave's licenses solely because NextWave deferred a payment to the FCC while reorganizing in bankruptcy. Two and a half years ago the FCC blocked NextWave's bankruptcy reorganization, and it did so by announcing that NextWave's licenses had automatically canceled because NextWave had deferred a loan payment to the FCC in 1998.",
  "Well, because NextWave --",
  "It did not make it, yes. It did not make it.",
  "It did not make it --",
  "-- in 1998.",
  "Well, we were reorganizing in bankruptcy --",
  "-- and we did not pay because we were reorganizing, that's right. Now, throughout the proceedings in this case the FCC has never identified a ground, other than that single nonpayment, that would support revocation of the licenses, and that's because there isn't one. What the FCC has done instead, and what it's done here this morning, is to instead suggest that section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code ought not apply because the FCC had a regulatory or public interest purpose for making a nonpayment an automatic sole trigger for revocation of a license, but in passing the Bankruptcy Code, Congress already weighed the public interests, and section 525 of the code is a clear expression of Congress's judgment about where the public interest lies.",
  "I think the record utterly and completely refutes that proposition, and it does so in the following ways. The regulation that they cite, which is 1.2110 of their rules, and it's at page 495 of the appendix to the petition, says that the licenses cancel automatically upon nonpayment. The face of the license says that the licenses cancel automatically upon nonpayment and for no other reason. The announcement of the license cancellation in this case in January 2000 said that the licenses canceled automatically for nonpayment and no other reason.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in the restructuring orders they did do that, but that doesn't make the revocation any less automatic. All it did was move the date back in a legislative, quasi-legislative rulemaking, move the date from when it would initially have occurred to a later time. When --",
  "Well, yes, Justice Ginsburg, but the date was suspended by the FCC well in advance. The payment date was suspended well in advance of its occurrence, so a payment date never came and went without NextWave or any other licensee failing to make a payment. All that happened here was that in advance of the payment date, the FCC moved the payment date, but when it did so, it reaffirmed --",
  "That's exactly right, Justice Scalia. This was suspended in advance of the due date for the first payment.",
  "That is right, Justice O'Connor.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, it does, and it's already been taken care of, in fact. The question under the avoidance provisions of the Bankruptcy Code is when the debtor's obligation becomes due, and the issue here was whether the obligation became due on the date of the auction or, instead, later, at the time the licenses were awarded. Now, that is a matter entirely within the control of the FCC. All they have to do is make clear in their regulations when the obligation attaches. The reason that there was a problem here was that the regulations suggested that the obligation attached later and, therefore, if the value of the asset declined from the time of the initial auction to the time of the license award, section 544 would apply. But the FCC has changed its regulations, and at this point it is unambiguous that the obligation attaches at the time of the auction -- and therefore 544 can't operate.",
  "-- and it did. It's just a nonissue. It's just -- that issue is just a nonissue, and in any event it isn't -- the question really here is whether the FCC, when it effectively acts as a lender, is going to be treated any differently than a private company when it acts as a lender.",
  "My response is the following, Justice Breyer. First, the text of 525 is unambiguous. It applies to someone who is or was a debtor, and it applies to debts that are dischargeable, as well as those that have been discharged and, therefore, it is clear on the face of the statute that it applies and protects companies while they are reorganizing and before the debts are discharged, so I think on the face of the statute that's -- it's not correct. It's not the right reading of the statute. And in terms of what it does in operation, it's this. Now, if -- if this had been a situation where the FCC had demanded cash on the barrelhead up front, and NextWave had gone and bid and gone out and borrowed that money from a bank, and had to pay the bank over time, and then filed for bankruptcy, there would be no question that that, that the debt to the bank could be reorganized and disposed of in the normal manner in bankruptcy.",
  "Well --",
  "That's a --",
  "Well, I think if we -- well, I think that that point is exactly right, Justice Scalia, that the Government's regulatory purpose argument, if accepted, would give them the authority to revoke licenses not only when the payment was not made to the Government, but not made to private parties.",
  "Well --",
  "No, it --",
  "Two points. First, the Government can collect its interest as a secured creditor in exactly the same way a private lender could through the bankruptcy system. It has enormous protections through the bankruptcy system as a secured creditor. It gets, it's 100 percent entitled under the Bankruptcy Code to the full value of the licenses, and it has numerous other protections under the code. It can make an election under --",
  "You can't -- the FCC, like a private lender, can't foreclose on the lien. It has to -- its debt has to be processed through the bankruptcy system.",
  "Right. They can't -- under the Bankruptcy Code they can't take back the license. They can get their secured claim paid to the same extent that a private lender could, but they can't --",
  "Yes, they can, and -- but just as --",
  "The transfer would, to somebody else would need approval from the FCC, but the key point here is that section 525 --",
  "Yes, it is different from a cancellation, and the key point here I think, Justice Breyer, in answer to your question ultimately, is that 525 is in the Bankruptcy Code to protect the right to reorganize. What it says is that those who hold Government licenses cannot be denied the ability to invoke the bankruptcy process and reorganize solely because they do what the Bankruptcy Code allows them to do. Without this protection, licensing agencies would have the ability to force insolvent debtors to liquidate, because it would have the power to revoke their permission to do business solely because they hadn't paid a debt, or solely because even they were in bankruptcy, and that would --",
  "Yes, it can. It can give it as a -- it can -- the answer to that is yes. There are some restrictions on it, but the answer to that is yes, it can. If I could, I'd like to get back to the question of whether this was, in fact, an automatic revocation, and the reconsideration order, which is the order under review here, is the order in which the FCC says principally that it departed from the automatic character of the revocation, but that reconsideration order says no fewer than 14 times by my count that the revocation was automatic, and there's one statement in that in particular which I think should put to rest as a factual matter the question of whether this was anything other than an automatic cancellation, and that's at page 74a of the appendix to the petition, and it's right at the bottom of the page, before the footnote. And the FCC says in the reconsideration order, thus, the only way that NextWave could have avoided the loss of its licenses, even under the rule interpretation it urges, was to avoid a default by making full and timely payment on or before the payment due date. If the only way that NextWave could have avoided default was by making the payment, then there is nothing else that could have been shown, and nothing else that could have happened in the reconsideration process or any waiver process, that would have provided an additional ground for revocation. And if I could also point the court to a statement on the prior page, page 73a: For all these reasons we reject NextWave's interpretation of our default and cancellation rules and reaffirm that the failure to make full payment in a timely manner, following exhaustion of all applicable grace periods, constitutes a default and results in the automatic cancellation of the license without further commission action. Their theory is that this happens by operation of law on the day after nonpayment. It is as automatic as anything can be, and nothing about the reconsideration process, and nothing about their waiver authority changes that one iota.",
  "Well, but they said in the reconsideration order that they were not going to do that, ever, because it was an automatic cancellation. They also said in the restructuring orders, Justice Ginsburg, that you referred to earlier, in each of the restructuring orders they said they would not grant a waiver of the payment deadline under any circumstances, and then when individual licensees sought waivers, the FCC rejected the waiver requests, and it cited back to those provisions in the restructuring order saying, we told you this was an automatic rule, and we reject your request, and it did so even in instances, in two cases where the licensees were providing service. And so there's just no question that this was an automatic cancellation rule and therefore precisely at the core of what section 525 forbids the FCC or any other licensing agencies from doing. If I may, I want to turn to the question of whether there is any conflict between the FCC's exercise of its authority under section 309(j) and the Bankruptcy Code. The answer is, as a statutory matter there is no conflict, because the FCC was not required to have an installment payment plan, and even if it were required to have one there wouldn't be a conflict because Congress didn't say that the FCC had to make license revocation automatic upon nonpayment. So the FCC's argument really is an implied repeal argument here, that 309(j) implicitly repeals 525 in some applications, but --",
  "Yes, and the authority is exactly contrary to the position that the FCC deserves deference. The FCC deserves deference only with respect to interpretation of its own statute, not with respect to the Bankruptcy Code. So the answer is clearly that they don't get any deference, and -- but there isn't any conflict. All there is is the FCC -- there isn't any statutory conflict. All there is, the only conflict arises from the FCC's desire to make this an automatic cancellation rule, and the conflict is between an FCC policy choice and a directive from Congress. When the conflict is at that level, there's no doubt about what the answer is, which is that the directive from Congress prevails.",
  "No.",
  "No, because what 525 forbids are the grounds on which the license is revoked, so if the license is revoked solely because of nonpayment of dischargeable debt, then whether there's a rule or not --",
  "I think that would violate 525, but for a different reason.",
  "And it's this. 525 doesn't merely forbid revocation for nonpayment. It forbids discrimination, and it forbids imposing conditions solely because of nonpayment, solely because of being in bankruptcy, so --",
  "I think it does have several functions. For example, Your Honor, the FCC has a build- out rule for these licenses, says you have to build them out within 5 years, and to serve, a requirement that we were in compliance with, by the way. But if we hadn't been in compliance with them and the FCC had moved to revoke the licenses because we weren't in compliance with the build-out rule, and we had said, well, the reason we are not in compliance with the build-out rule is that we're in bankruptcy and we can't pay the vendors to build it out, that would be a situation in which the FCC could enforce its rule, even though at some level it is because we were in bankruptcy. It's just not \"solely\" because. It's because we violated a neutral rule that was not focused solely on nonpayment. And I think there would be other circumstances in which the fact of nonpayment could be a consideration in a broader or a different -- in a broader or different set of circumstances. But when you have what you have here, is where it is the only consideration, the only factor, the determinative consideration, that is the paradigm case of violation of 525. What the FCC has done, it's --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under the clearly established law of Strickland v. Washington, a lawyer's decision about how to defend a client facing a death sentence must be supported either by a thorough investigation or by a reasonable professional judgment supporting limitation on investigation. In this case, the Maryland Court of Appeals and the Fourth Circuit applied that rule in an objectively unreasonable manner. Kevin Wiggins' lawyers did not fulfill what this Court described in Williams against Taylor as their obligation under Strickland to investigate thoroughly their client's background, and no reasonable professional judgment in fact supports or could support their failure to do so.",
  "I do not think it's exactly identical to this case, Your Honor, but we think it clearly informs this case both by explaining what an -- what an objectively unreasonable application of Strickland amounts to and in emphasizing the critical importance of investigating a -- a -- your client's background as -- as a prerequisite to making informed, reasonable choices about how best to defend your client.",
  "Yes, it was Justice Scalia, but --",
  "I disagree with that, Justice Scalia, for the following reason. Williams, like this case, was an AEDPA case and all Williams could do was decide whether Strickland had been unreasonably applied. Williams was -- because Williams was an AEDPA case, was a 2254(d)(1) case, Williams could break no new ground by definition, and therefore, the -- the fact that Williams concluded what it did about Strickland's requirement, means that that is what Strickland requires. And that -- and -- and so we don't think it -- we're going beyond AEDPA in the least.",
  "Oh, no, no. I disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice. We think it's right on page 690 and 691 of -- of Strickland, and here's the principle that we think -- Strickland specifically says, as we read it, that a lawyer's judgment about how to defend a client has either got to be based on complete investigation or, if it's based on less than complete investigation, it's reasonable only to the extent that reasonable professional judgment supports the limitation on investigation. That's the rule.",
  "Yes, but there's a fundamental difference between this case and Bell v. Cone, Mr. Chief Justice, and it's this. Bell v. Cone was not a case about the failure to investigate. That was purely a case about counsel's decisions about what information to present to the sentencer after having done what was indisputably a thorough investigation. And the reason that's critical is because as -- as we read Strickland, the whole point of the deference given to counsel's choices about what to present is premised on the adequacy of the investigation that precedes them. That is what the source of the deferential stance towards presentation is. It's the adequacy of investigation.",
  "This case is about both, but it's principally about --",
  "I disagree with that, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, here's how. There -- there are two absolutely compelling reasons, but before I get to them, I think it's important to look at the very next thing that the lawyer says in that colloquy. And the very next thing the lawyer says is, well, yes, at least I knew what was reported in other people's reports. And that is what led the Maryland Court of Appeals to the conclusion it reached, which was that the social service records and the pre-sentence records, other people's reports, contained that information, and we have shown by clear and convincing evidence that they do not. But there are two additional points that are critical here, and the first one is this. The trier of fact, the actual judge who heard that testimony --",
  "Justice Scalia, that is not how the --",
  "-- Maryland Court of Appeals read it. It is not how the Fourth Circuit read it.",
  "But -- but, Justice Scalia, what matters here for AEDPA purposes under (d)(2) is whether the court of appeals based its determination on an unreasonable factual finding, and there are two -- there are two critical indicia here that it did. The first one -- the first one is this. Well, there are three. First, the records don't contain the information. Second, the trier of fact, the judge who heard this testimony, concluded -- and this is at page 605 and 606 of the joint appendix -- that Mr. Schlaich, the lawyer who gave that testimony, did not know what was in the social -- what was in the social history subsequently prepared.",
  "In the State habeas proceeding, Your Honor. His -- at the conclusion of his testimony and during closing argument by the -- by the government in that State habeas proceeding, the -- the trier of fact who heard the testimony, could assess demeanor, could assess credibility, heard all the other evidence, saw all the other evidence, concluded that he didn't know and found it was error. And then -- and the next point that we think conclusively demonstrates that -- that the lawyers did not know is this. Remember that -- that at the close of the sentencing proceeding, not the post-conviction proceeding, Mr. Chief Justice, but the actual sentencing proceeding, counsel for Wiggins made a proffer of what mitigating evidence they would have submitted to the sentencing jury had their motion to bifurcate been granted. That proffer doesn't mention any of the mitigating evidence that -- that we have shown in the social history -- doesn't mention the terrible abuse of the first 6 years of his life. It doesn't mention the horrible burning incident. It doesn't mention the sexual abuse. It doesn't mention the homelessness. There's no conceivable reason why counsel would have withheld all of that information from its proffer at the conclusion of the sentencing phase of the proceeding if counsel knew that and could --",
  "Well, I think there was --",
  "Pre-sentence.",
  "The -- there is a document which the State has lodged which indicates that there were transcripts of interviews with family members. Those aren't in the record, but I think the same exact analysis, the same exact inference has to be drawn. If those had included the kind of terrible descriptions of -- of abuse, it would have shown up in the psychologist's report because, after all, what that document shows is the psychologist got those interviews and it would have shown up in the proffer because that is the most --",
  "No. That's separate --",
  "That's a separate --",
  "They are --",
  "They are not there.",
  "Justice Breyer, let me -- let me --",
  "Let me address --",
  "Let me address that directly because I think this goes the essence of why the Maryland Court of Appeals judgment was an unreasonable application of -- of the Strickland rule, and it's this. The proffer occurred in the following context. Counsel for Wiggins made a motion to bifurcate the sentencing proceeding so that they could first retry the factual case of eligibility, and then if they lost, they could then put on the full-blown mitigation case.",
  "Right. Bifurcation would have first involved the principalship, and then had principalship been established to the jury's satisfaction, they would have moved to the issue of mitigation. And the -- and the trial judge denied that motion. Now, he denied that motion -- this is critical -- on the first day of the sentencing hearing. So up to the first day of the sentencing hearing, Kevin Wiggins' lawyer's strategy was obviously to prepare both a principalship case and a mitigation case because they made a motion that was designed to allow them to do precisely that. So there is no conceivable justification for them to have failed to do everything a reasonable lawyer would have done to develop a mitigation case. And they -- and what the proffer shows -- I'm afraid the proffer cannot, Justice Breyer, be explained on the basis that Your Honor described for this reason. The point of the proffer -- the point of the proffer was to show the judge and to create a record on appeal of what they would have shown had the bifurcation been granted and they could have tried their mitigation case. This proffer was their mitigation case.",
  "Well, I think what's critical in that regard is what the Maryland Court of Appeals found because what AEDPA requires deference to is factual findings made by a State court. And what the -- and the factual finding that the Maryland Court of Appeals found -- made is on page 121 of the appendix to the petition in the -- in the second paragraph there. It -- it says, counsel was indeed aware of Wiggins' unfortunate background. They had available to them not only the pre-sentence investigation, but detailed social service records documenting sexual abuse and physical abuse. That is the sum and substance, the total, of what the Maryland Court of Appeals said in terms of the facts here. It's the sole factual finding. That factual finding --",
  "It said --",
  "They -- the factual -- the only factual finding they made -- the only -- the only -- the only thing that supports and explicates the general statement at the outset of that paragraph that they were aware of his unfortunate childhood is the specific factual finding that the social service records documented sexual abuse and documented physical abuse. We've shown by clear and convincing evidence that that finding is wrong. And then under (d)(2) in AEDPA the question is whether the Maryland Court of Appeals' judgment was -- was based on an -- an unreasonable factual determination. And we've shown that the only thing that they found --",
  "But --",
  "Justice Scalia, I disagree. I do not think that is a reasonable reading of what the trial judge held. What the trial --",
  "The trial --",
  "The trial judge said that he was concluding that it was error not to investigate. If they knew the information, it wouldn't have been error not to investigate and --",
  "With all due respect, Justice Scalia --",
  "With all due respect --",
  "With all due respect, Your Honor, the very sentence that you pointed to said, based on the evidence that I have seen, I'm concluding it was error for them not to investigate it. If they knew the information, he never would have reached that conclusion.",
  "And that's completely supported by the proffer.",
  "Excuse me.",
  "I think that's implicit, Justice Scalia, in his conclusion that it was error not to investigate, and I think it's completely confirmed by the proffer which didn't include any of this information and for which there would have been absolutely no explanation for its exclusion. Absolutely none whatsoever. So I think with respect to the -- to the factual finding that the Maryland Court of Appeals made, that the social services records documented abuse and provided the source of his knowledge, that's clearly erroneous.",
  "Well, I think, Your Honor, I'm going to answer Your Honor's question directly, but I -- I need a minute to do it.",
  "The question under Strickland, it seems to us, is that once you've concluded that there was a failure to investigate adequately, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different as a result of that failure. And in this case, it seems to me, that means that what we -- and Strickland also stresses that that is an objective test. That is not based on the idiosyncracies of the individual decision makers. It's an objective analysis. And so the question here is whether had this information been investigated, if it was in the hands of competent counsel, is there a reasonable probability that competent counsel would have used it and introduced it, and then is there a reasonable probability that it would have affected the sentencing jury's outcome. And the second half of that analysis, it seems to us, is answered a fortiori by Williams against Taylor. The first half of that analysis seems to us clearly to support relief here because, as I take Your Honor's question, it's a question of, well, there might be a justification for not submitting this evidence to the jury. Yes, there might. We think in a case like this one, it would be an unreasonable choice not to do so because this evidence has so little of what this Court has described in other cases like Burger and Darden as a sharp double edge, and it is so powerfully mitigating that we don't think it would have that effect. But we -- we respectfully suggest that's not the relevant question. Once you've established deficient performance with respect to investigation, then we shift to the prejudice inquiry, and it's an objective analysis. And so long as there is a reasonable probability that competent counsel would have used this information in combination with the case that they made, then -- and there's a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been affected, which I think Williams v. Taylor establishes for us, then we have shown what we need to show to be entitled to relief.",
  "Well, I think, if I may just draw from Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion with respect to that. If there's an obvious failure on the part of the State court to consider the totality of the record, that's an unreasonable application with respect to prejudice. And with -- in Williams, of course, as Your Honor's dissenting opinion pointed out, there was a much more severe case of aggravating information than here. Williams had a terrible, long record of violence. Wiggins has none. And the mitigating evidence here is even stronger than the mitigating evidence that existed in the Williams case. And so we think it follows directly from Williams that -- that if you look at whether there's a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different here on the basis of submitting this evidence, that we think that's a very clear and easy case under the standards that Williams sets.",
  "The -- factually, Justice Kennedy, it's the latter. The -- he ruled on the bifurcation motion at the outset of the -- of the trial.",
  "At the time it was, and the reason it was, Mr. Chief Justice, is because sometime shortly before this case was tried in Baltimore County, another Baltimore County judge had allowed such a motion. And we think that fact reinforces the utterly unreasonable character of the failure to investigate here. These lawyers had a -- had -- had to think there was a reasonable prospect they were going to be able to put on a mitigation case, but we know that all they had to put on that mitigation case was the psychologist's testing. And after all, that -- all that psychologist did was test.",
  "Yes, but that -- the point of bifurcation was to do principalship first, and if they prevailed on principalship, they wouldn't go to the second phase. And only if they didn't prevail on principalship would they go to the second phase where they wouldn't have any of the tactical cross currents they were worried about because principalship was already established and they could go whole hog and make the fullest mitigation case possible. And the fact that they were -- that they were endeavoring to follow that strategy until the first day of the sentencing hearing, October 11th, 1989, shows that they didn't -- that all they had as of October 11, 1989, was the psychologist's report -- shows that they did not investigate at the level that Strickland requires.",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor.",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor.",
  "They were -- the -- the -- there are two things that are important about the psychologist's report: one, what it does contain; the other, what it doesn't contain. The psychologist was commissioned in this case to do testing of Mr. Wiggins, intelligence testing and then psychological profiling, MMPI-type testing. The evidence is undisputed about that. That's what the psychologist did. The thing that's significant about what was discovered was the fact that Mr. Wiggins was of borderline intelligence, which seems to us quite relevant and entirely consistent -- it would have been entirely consistent, even absent bifurcation, to use that evidence, in addition to an effort to disprove principalship, because the borderline intelligence would easily and strongly have supported the conclusion that Mr. Wiggins was an accomplice and not a principal. But the thing it doesn't show is any of the history of abuse, and that's because the psychologist wasn't commissioned to do that. They didn't do what they needed to do here, which was to do the social history. The evidence is clear that it was routine practice in these public defenders' office to do the social history. They admitted that. The evidence is clear -- and the -- and the public defenders admitted it -- that funds were available for that purpose. They just didn't do it. They just dropped the ball on this. They didn't do what all the lawyers in their office did routinely, and they didn't do what the State post-conviction trial judge said he had never seen not done, which is prepare this social history and --",
  "There is not. There is not, but it wouldn't be a surprise, Justice Souter, that even if an interview like that occurred, that the defendant would not have revealed it, that -- it's very difficult to get this kind of history of horrible personal abuse out of a defendant. It very often requires a professional to do it. That is why -- that's the very reason why the social workers are brought in to do the kinds of social histories as a -- as a routine matter. And it wasn't done here. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve my remaining time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to clarify the -- the facts surrounding the proffer because it's very important to understand how this unfolded. Counsel for Wiggins made a motion. That motion was argued on October 11th, 1989 and denied at that time, the first day of the sentencing hearing. But the proffer was not made at that time. What -- what counsel for my friend, the United States, described was what Mr. Schlaich he would proffer if he had to proffer. He made the actual proffer at the end of the sentencing proceeding, and it can be found at pages, I think, 349 to 51 of the -- 348 to 51 of the joint appendix. And there's a lengthy proffer there of what he would have shown had he been able to put on his mitigation case in the -- in the method he wanted to. So --",
  "He's making a record for --",
  "He's making a record for appeal, Justice Kennedy. Here's the -- here's what we would have suffered because we wouldn't have been -- we weren't able to put on all of this mitigating evidence, and here it is. And so the sum total of his mitigation case is right there on the pages. He's described what it is and it contains nothing about the horrible abuse that this boy suffered. Nothing. Now, with respect to the question of whose responsibility it was, I think it is correct to focus on the -- the colloquy on page 485 of the -- of the joint appendix, but the question asked Mr. Schlaich there, as Justice Stevens' question suggested, was, well, he first says, well, it was Ms. Nethercott's job to develop mitigation. And then the question put to him is what guidance did you give her, obviously, about how to develop the mitigation case. And he says, well, what we decided to do was retry the factual case. That's the -- that's what he says he gave as guidance with respect to developing the mitigation case. So it's -- it's completely clear that this was neglect. They just dropped the ball. Now, with respect to what they actually did at the sentencing proceeding, picking up on Justice O'Connor's questions, I think this is critical as well. Remember, Strickland says no hindsight, but that's an argument that works against the government in this case because what these lawyers actually did was, in opening statement, invite the jury specifically to consider not only the facts of the crime but, quote, who this person is, said they would hear he had a difficult life. And then they didn't deliver on that promise. But not only that, Dr. Johnson, the -- the criminologist, got up and testified, well, yes, violent people do tend to adjust well in prison. Well, that's not focusing on principalship. That, once again, is inviting the jury beyond principalship into the mitigation inquiry and giving them some reason to -- to mitigate, but of course, omitting all of the extraordinarily powerful reasons to mitigate that the social history shows. And then third, there was as a matter of law in Maryland a pre-sentence report that had to go to the jury. And there was nothing that Wiggins' lawyers could do to stop that. And that pre-sentence report gave a highly misleading and negative portrayal of Wiggins' background. And the -- what -- effect of what these lawyers did was to leave that unrebutted, further damaging Wiggins' prospects, further ensuring that he was going to get a death sentence. Now, if I could conclude by just reminding this Court that very recently in the Miller-El case, this Court said even in the context of Federal habeas, the deferential review of Federal habeas, there's a difference between deference and abdication. And what my friends on the other side are asking for here is the latter. They are asking for abdication. They are asking this Court to uphold a judgment even though the only factual finding the Maryland Court of Appeals made was wrong by clear and convincing evidence, and even though that proffer demonstrates that Wiggins' lawyers did not do the work necessary and did not know the powerful mitigation case that could have been made to save this man's life. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'll address the standing question first and explain why consumers in Trinko's position have standing and why General Olson is correct that Illinois Brick is not a problem. Then I'll show why it would be unwise and unwarranted to adopt the discrimination test that my friends on the other side advocate as a matter of section 2 law and why the 1996 act is crucially relevant and why the antitrust laws in that act should be enforced in tandem, as Congress indicated. Now --",
  "I think Trinko could have brought a suit like that. Of course, AT&T would have then said it was Verizon's fault, which it was, and there would be --",
  "Well, that -- that's correct, but in this situation, there -- there might well be filed rate doctrine problems with a suit like that. There would be all kinds of a problems with a suit like that. And in any event, because Trinko has -- has an is a proper plaintiff under section 4 of the Clayton Act, is entitled to invoke the Sherman Act, the fact that they had -- it has other remedies seems to me beside -- beside the crucial point. Now, under Reiter against Sonotone, this Court held that consumers have standing under section 4 of the Sherman Act -- under section 4 of the Clayton Act to sue when they are injured by anti-competitive conduct that raises prices or lowers quality in the market where they purchase. That is what Mr. Trinko is alleging. Illinois Brick is not a reason to cut off that standing here, as General Olson indicated, for the following reason. Illinois Brick applies when Hanover Shoe applies, and Hanover Shoe does not apply here. Illinois Brick is just the flip side of Hanover Shoe. Hanover Shoe says that in a case of a price- fixing overcharge -- the same as in UtiliCorp -- price- fixing overcharge -- when a middle man pays too much, the middle man is entitled to sue under the Sherman Act for the entire amount of the price-fixing overcharge, and the -- and the defendant can't assert a pass-through defense. And -- and the reason for that is to ensure full and effective use and enforcement of the Sherman Act's damages remedy. Now, in that situation, what Illinois Brick holds is that, well, once the -- once the middle man has sued for the full value of the overcharge, then the people subsequently down the chain can't bring antitrust claims themselves because that would create a problem of duplicative recovery. But the -- but the reason that you don't have --",
  "That -- well, that's correct, but there were -- because he could sue and there will be problems of duplicative recovery. But that -- it only applies, Justice Scalia, in situations where the measure of damages that the middle man would have is the overcharge damages. And here, of course, AT&T is a competitor of Verizon. AT&T would bring a monopolization claim, and it's been clear since the Southern Photo case in 1927 that AT&T's measure of damages would be its lost profits, not an overcharge, but its lost profits. And --",
  "Correct. In fact, it would disserve the very policies of Hanover Shoe here because it would result in the -- the monopolist not being responsible for the full value of the antitrust injury it inflicts. So there's no Illinois Brick problem here. And I think that's why my friends on the other side in Verizon relied so much on Associated General Counsel -- Associated General Contractors rather than Illinois Brick. But, of course, all that case states, as -- as this Court made clear in Holmes, is a rule of proximate cause. And remember the facts in Associated General Contractors. The allegation was that a landowner pressured a contractor to hire non-union subcontractors, and as a result the union subcontractors had less business, and as a result, they had fewer employees, and as a result, the union had fewer dues to collect. And the Court quite properly held that proximate causation can't possibly extend that far.",
  "The means by which Verizon was trying to monopolize the market, as the complaint alleges -- and I think this is clear from paragraphs 1 and 2 and 54 of the amended complaint -- was that it was -- Verizon was using its control of the local loop that competitors needed to lease to get service going to degrade the service that its competitors, including AT&T, were able to provide to customers. That was the means by which the -- the antitrust scheme was effectuated, and as a result --",
  "Correct.",
  "I think -- you know, remember --",
  "Well, I -- I understand it, Your Honor, but the -- but the complaint -- one of the difficulties of this case, of course, is that we're here on a complaint and the test under rule 8 is a notice pleading test, and it can -- and the complaint can only be dismissed if there is no conceivable set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations in the complaint that would support relief. And --",
  "Yes, Your Honor, and I think the -- I think paragraph 2 of the amended complaint says that Bell Atlantic deterred and will continue to deter potential customers from switching to another company for local phone service or cause customers that switch back to Bell Atlantic in frustration for the poor services rendered by their local phone service provider. There are other places in the complaint where it's specifically alleged that the quality of service that AT&T customers get and other competitors' customers get is degraded in comparison to --",
  "Well, I think it's the right answer to let them recover, and -- and it's not speculative. They -- their -- the -- this conduct directly raises the cost of -- and degrades the service that consumers in the market receive. And they are entitled under Reiter against Sonotone to sue for the damages that those occur. And it -- you know, Illinois Brick -- I'm not here to defend the wisdom of Illinois Brick in the context in which it exists, Justice Breyer, but it has been narrowly confined to that context. And -- and if you don't have an overcharge case, you don't have Hanover Shoe. If you don't have Hanover Shoe, you don't have Illinois Brick.",
  "Well, under --",
  "First, paragraph 2, which is at page --",
  "Yes, but what it says, Justice Breyer, is that they degraded service. Well, the -- the degraded service has to occur not only during the -- the process of switching over, but after the switching over, and of course, under Swierkiewicz and under Leatherman, the test here is whether there's any set of facts that could be proved consistent with these notice pleading allegations that would support a cause of action. And I think Your Honor's question proves that there is, the first set of facts that Your Honor described. So --",
  "But I think those complaints are fairly construed to -- to include denial --",
  "I think it's true about paragraph 52. I think it's true about paragraph 54. I think that that is the essence of the complaint here. And of course, that makes sense because these are exactly the kinds of allegations -- this is -- this is the way monopolization occurs. This is the way maintaining monopoly power occurs in this -- in this arena. There's a long and unfortunate history that goes back to MCI against AT&T and continuing --",
  "-- to this present day.",
  "Well, what it -- what it says --",
  "I -- I don't --",
  "Well, I think you do.",
  "I think -- well, I think you do have an obligation under the antitrust laws, and I'll try to get to that as fast as I can.",
  "But --",
  "No, because this says --",
  "I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. It's at page 46 of the joint appendix, paragraph 54 of the amended complaint. What it alleges is that AT&T and other competitors weren't able to provide service at the -- at the level of quality -- provide service at the level of quality that -- that Verizon could. It doesn't only say that they weren't able to provide service at all. It says both of those things. And so I think the allegation is there in 54, and I think the -- and it's described in the -- the overview, 1 and 2. And paragraphs 1 and 2 of the amended complaint explains how it works. And I'd like to -- if I could, go to -- to the core antitrust issue here. I think it is common ground with my friends on the other side that a monopolist's right to refuse to deal with competitors is not an unqualified right. They acknowledge one qualification. That's where the monopolist discriminates. They argue that's the only time a section 2 duty ought to be imposed because that -- in that situation you can be confident that it's anti-competitive conduct, and you won't have problems with dampening incentives and you won't have administrability problems because you can refer back to the prior course of dealing. But where they're wrong is in suggesting that that's the only time that you can find liability under section 2 for monopolist refusal to cooperate with its rivals. It is equally true in this case, in this situation where, as Justice Kennedy, your question earlier indicated, there is a regulatory regime in place that requires competitive access on the part of the monopolist in order to bring competition into the market. And what you have -- and -- and I think these allegations are consistent that -- what I am about to say is consistent with the allegations in the complaint, and what you have is a course of conduct on the part of the monopolist that is intended to subvert the competitive entry that those regulations require.",
  "I wouldn't put it quite that way, Your Honor, but I -- and I will answer Your -- Your Honor's question directly. The -- the test, under the Sherman Act, for exclusionary conduct applies in the same way that -- it's the exact same test whether the '96 act is there or not. The test is whether the conduct impairs rivals' opportunities to compete in the market and whether the -- the conduct does or does not further -- by the monopolist further competition on the merits. That test would apply to a different factual scenario after the 1996 act was passed than before. And it's clear that that must be the case. For example, Your Honor, one thing that the 1996 act did -- this is section 253 of the act, which I think is at page 90 of the appendix to the petition -- it eliminated, preempted State monopoly franchises. Now, prior to passage of the 1996 act, if -- if Trinko went to sue -- bring a section 2 claim against a local telephone provider in a State where -- where there was a monopoly franchise law, Trinko would be out of court on the State action doctrine. There would be an ironclad defense. Well, section 253 of the act preempted the defense. So obviously in that situation, there is an antitrust claim that wasn't there before, and so it can't be the case that what -- that -- that the passage of the 1996 act has no relevance whatsoever to the application of section 2 of the Sherman Act. And indeed, we think it would impermissibly -- it would violate the savings clause and impermissibly modify the applicability of the antitrust laws to conclude that the 1996 act is the sole remedy here for a person in Trinko's position.",
  "I don't think so.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Souter, because the -- the statute says that nothing shall modify the -- modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws.",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't think so. I think it -- the exact same test applies before the act was enacted and after, so it doesn't -- it doesn't modify the substantive antitrust rule one iota. What it changes is the facts to which the rule applies. Now, in this case it would not be true --",
  "Well, yes, in the following sense, Justice Souter. But I don't think it constitutes a modification of the applicability of the antitrust laws. It might change the result under the antitrust laws, but not modify the applicability because the general rule under the antitrust laws is that one takes the regulatory context into account, and the fact that conduct violates extrinsic norms, and in particular, when it violates, as it did in MCI v. AT&T and in the Litton Systems case and the court -- cases in the court of appeals, when it violates extrinsic norms that are designed to promote competition, that counts against the --",
  "No. That's --",
  "They -- I --",
  "I don't think that -- I don't think that's quite right, Justice Kennedy, and let me try to explain why. The test is whether the monopolist's conduct prevents competition, obstructs competition, whether it does so on a basis other than competition on the merits, and whether it is -- there's otherwise a legitimate business justification. That's the general rule, as the United States acknowledges at page 14 of its complaint. That's the rule that was applied in Aspen, the rule that was applied in Kodak. That's the rule. That rule applies here. When one answers the first part of that test that -- which is does the monopolist's conduct obstruct competition, the -- the -- it's not the case that any violation of the 1996 act would obstruct competition. What has to be shown there is that the monopolist's conduct is sufficiently grave, sufficiently serious, sufficiently sustained that it -- that it amounts to an overall pattern that obstructs competition. So it's not the case that there is a -- that -- that there's a -- an automatic transference of a -- of a duty under the 1996 act into an antitrust duty. But where the -- where the 1996 act becomes relevant is when you get to the next stage of the inquiry. And I think -- and it's just what Your Honor said earlier. At that stage in the inquiry, it is -- the monopolist does not have open to it the argument that this is pro- competitive behavior and that I have a legitimate business justification for it because in that circumstance, it is unlawful to do it. And so it can't be a legitimate business justification to say I don't want to do something that the law compels me to do because I'll be better off as a competitive matter if I don't do it. So it does enter the analysis. It's not irrelevant by any means. But it doesn't transform or change in any way the antitrust standard. But it -- it does have this -- this additional effect --",
  "Well, I think -- I think it does say that this is conduct that it -- that it -- I think you can no longer say that it is -- that it is consistent with competition on the merits for a monopolist to refuse to cooperate when a law designed to promote competition insists on the cooperation. So I think in that way, I agree with Your Honor, that's what's happening here. And then the other thing that's critical is that --",
  "I -- I disagree with that, Your Honor, and the reason why is this. Because I think that question -- if I may say so, I think it picks up on what I believe to be a false choice that my friends on the other side are presenting, and that's a choice between, on the one hand, a -- a duty to deal relegated solely to the circumstance of discrimination and, on the other hand, a wholly unqualified duty to deal that -- that might raise a lot of the problems that Your Honor has identified. But there's a middle ground here, and it's the middle ground that I -- that I submit to Your Honor that -- that Professor Areeda identified in a 1989 article and that makes a world of sense. And that is, when there is a regulatory regime in place that supplies the background norms, then the juries don't answer those questions. The juries decide something very different. What the juries will decide in that set of circumstances is whether the regulatory requirements have been violated or not, and they'll also -- and -- and remember, many of these regulatory requirements are contractual terms.",
  "I don't -- I don't think that's right, Your Honor. I -- I think it is -- it's an obvious defense in a case like this for -- for an incumbent to say, well, I'm -- I'm in compliance with the law and I'm in compliance with my contractual obligations. I think it's also a defense for an incumbent, as it was in the MCI v. --",
  "Yes. I -- I think the answer is if it can't be resolved on summary judgment -- of course, Matsushita says that summary judgment has a particularly important role to play in antitrust cases, but if it can't, then -- then it will go to the jury. But that's really not any different --",
  "No, I don't think you do because the way this is going to -- what we're talking about here, Your Honor, is -- is something very different. There might be a contractual provision, for example, that says you've got to cut over the loops from your own switching system to our switching system within an average of 6 days. Now, if a plaintiff were able to come into court and show, well, you know, the contract says 6 days, but actually it's taken them 6 months and as a result, we're being disabled, that's not anything different than what -- what an antitrust court and what an antitrust jury is asked to decide in any case. These antitrust cases are complex. There's no getting around that. They -- but -- but they go to a jury if there's a dispute of fact. There's no getting around that either. And this is no different from any other one in those respects.",
  "Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor. I -- I think there would be -- I think there would be claims of both kinds possible certainly under the antitrust laws.",
  "But the --",
  "That's also governed by the same set of regulatory norms, and it takes away -- it --",
  "I -- well, I think there might be some circumstances, Your Honor, in which it will be a harder case to make, and that might be a case where a judge could appropriately say, it's too complicated, it can't go to the jury, or might appropriately say, this is a matter for primary jurisdiction. But it is not a black and white situation in which the -- the right answer here is to cut off an antitrust remedy that Congress clearly envisioned when it enacted that savings clause. Congress enacted the savings clause to make clear that antitrust was to operate in conjunction with the regulatory regimes here, and with all due respect --",
  "I think that it is a concern, but it is not a concern that defeats standing for the reasons I gave earlier, and it is a concern that can be overcome through the normal processes of discovery under the Federal rules. And -- and with respect to the -- to the substantive antitrust claim that's before the Court -- and in fact, the existence of the regulatory regime solves the problems. It sets the benchmarks. It functions as a benchmark in just the same way that a prior course of dealing would function as a benchmark in a discrimination case, and --",
  "Well, I -- I think the answer is, Your Honor, because in -- in the absence of an effort by a -- an entity, a competitor, to use the mechanisms that the act put in place, then that -- in that situation, the entity doesn't have an antitrust claim where they could show exclusionary conduct based on subversion on the regulatory requirements and lack of a legitimate business justification based on refusal to abide by the regulatory requirements because they haven't invoked the regulatory requirements.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's right, but that's a far -- but -- but I think that's a far different situation from the one that Judge Wood described. And I think it's important, critically important, here to understand where the regulators are on that very question. The regulators don't think there's interference if there's mutual enforcement. It's notable that the Federal Communications Commission is not on the brief for the United States and the Federal Trade Commission today and that's because their position, which is articulated in orders which we cite in the footnote page 38 of our brief, is that the duties that they impose, the -- the access duties and specific obligations, ought to be enforced under the antitrust laws as well as under the -- as well as under the Telecommunications Act and that -- and that -- you know, the lessons of history are behind that and the lessons of common sense are behind that. The fact is that the regulatory regime that the FCC tried to put in place to bring long distance competition and to bring telephone equipment competition was insufficient, standing on its own with all of those regulatory mechanisms, to make that competition occur. That competition occurred only when vigorous antitrust enforcement was brought to bear in part to enforce those very regulatory requirements. And that makes a great deal of common sense, of course, because the incumbents in this situation have every incentive in the world for this system not to work because they want to retain as many customers as they can and they want to make as much money as they can, and they have ample ability to do it. There's a thousand ways in which they could subvert this -- this regulatory regime by -- with -- with using low-level, low-intensity obstructionist conduct that history has shown is beyond the power of the regulators to -- to capture and prevent. And that is why antitrust law needs to apply here. It's why the FCC says it should apply. It's why the 15 States who have submitted a brief in support of our position on this said it should apply because that's the only way, operating in tandem, that we're going to get to the competition that Congress tried to bring about. And I submit to this Court that is exactly why the savings clause is in the 1996 act. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The very essence of age discrimination is the disparate treatment of older workers based on the false assumption that productivity and competence decline with old age. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act protects workers 40 and older from that kind of disparate treatment. It should not be stretched to cover claims by workers 40 and older that they have been treated disparately on the basis of their comparative youth.",
  "They - they are, Justice O'Connor. That interpretation deserves no deference for three reasons, which I'd like to summarize and then first elaborate on. The first is that, under Chevron, the question - the question of deference is not dependent on whether there's a definitional ambiguity in the - in the specific operative language, in this case of Section 623(a), but on what the - what that language means as read in the context of the Act. And Chevron says, using all of the traditional tools of statutory construction, and applying that test we submit, as - as I hope to elaborate this morning, one cannot come to the conclusion that there - there - that this statute can be fairly read to authorize the kinds of youth discrimination claims that are at issue here. The second reason, however, is that even if there were - even if there were ambiguity in general, which we submit there is not, under the holding, the express holding in Mead, the - the EEOC's regulation here is not entitled to Chevron deference, and the reason for it is this, and this is at page 227 of the Mead opinion in 533 U.S. The very sentence that states the holding in Mead says, a regulation is entitled to Chevron deference if it is - if it is promulgated in the - if the agency has been given by Congress the authority to promulgate rules with the force of law, and we acknowledge that is true here. But the second half of the test - this is in the statement of the holding in Mead - is that the rule has to be promulgated in an exercise of that authority, and the regulation that the EEOC is here defending today was not a - a rule that was given the force of law by the agency. In fact, the agency made - the Department of Labor, when it initially promulgated this regulation, made a deliberate decision not to promulgate it as a rule with the force of law, but instead to promulgate it solely as guidance to the public about its - about its enforcement authority and it was -",
  "Because that is what the Department of Labor said in the Federal Register when it promulgated this.",
  "It said, we are promulgating this as a matter of enforcement guidelines for the - guidance - so the public knows how we intend to enforce the - the - the statute. It did not promulgate a rule of law. And then when it was re-promulgated by the EEOC in 1981 - and again, the cites for this are on page 17 of our reply brief - when it was re-promulgated by the EEOC in 1981, the EEOC made a deliberate choice, which it explained in the Federal Register, not to have this be a substantive rule with the force of law, and in fact it did not comply with, and stated it was not going to comply with, the 30- day notice period that is required for substantive rules of law so that -",
  "If - well, it would get Skidmore deference, Justice Kennedy, and I think Christensen specifically says that, that it gets Skidmore deference if it's an enforcement guideline and not - and not a - a rule of law - substantive rule of law. But here, Skidmore - applying Skidmore, no deference is due to this regulation principally because it is a regulation that the - that has not been enforced in anything like a consistent manner. To the contrary -",
  "The - the holding in Mead, Justice Scalia -",
  "The - the holding in - the sentence that's in Mead that says -",
  "The question under Mead is whether it was a regulation that was promulgated that - that has the force of law, and they -",
  "Not necessarily. But here they made a deliberate decision that it wasn't going to have the force of law and they, for example, in 1981 -",
  "Right, right, Justice Scalia. But they did not comply with the 30-day notice period, which is required -",
  "But for rules with the force of law you do.",
  "The question here is whether the agency intended this to be a rule of law or - or guidance of its own enforcement authority, and it - and it clearly intended the latter and it has acted in a manner consistent with the fact that it's the latter and not the former, because it routinely refuses to enforce the principle that the Government is here advocating today. Indeed, in every single instance in which this issue has come before the Department of Labor and the Equal Opportunity - and the EEOC - since the mid-1970's, in every single instance the - the Department of Labor or the EEOC has blessed a - an employment practice that provides comparatively older workers with a benefit not available to workers - to all workers 40 and older so -",

  "It was binding on the parties, Justice Souter, but, of course, even if - if the Court were to conclude that under Mead you get Chevron deference, and I don't think you can for that reason, you still have the problem, in our view, which is the more fundamental problem, which I'd like to address, which is that -",
  "Yes -",
  "But I think the fundamental point for us under Mead, and then I'd like to move back to the main - the Chevron analysis, if I could, but the fundamental point for us under Mead, Justice Breyer, is that the agency made a deliberate decision here not to have this rule be one that was a binding rule -",
  "I don't see how the agency could, Justice Scalia, think that this had the force of law, because they didn't follow it themselves in the manifold in this decision of which the issue -",
  "That's - that's all correct and we - I think that does summarize our point more strongly.",
  "Going - I agree with that, Justice Souter - but going back to the main question of whether you even get to ambiguity under Chevron, we submit that the answer to that question is no, because Section 623(a) is not to be read in isolation. The fundamental principle of statutory construction is that it needs to be read in context, and the relative contextual indicators here, we submit, foreclose the argument that Congress intended in the ADEA to authorize the kind of youth discrimination claims that are at issue here.",
  "I respectfully disagree with that, Justice Ginsburg, and - and - I'm - I'm looking now at page 3a of the statutory appendix to the Government's brief where the - where provision is located. (B)(i) is in the statute, as the preamble to the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act states, to - to provide employers with an affirmative defense to a charge that they have discriminated against comparatively older workers by providing them benefits at a lower level than comparatively younger workers. And what - what (B)(i) says, which I take it is the provision Your Honor is referring to, is that, in that situation, even though the comparatively older worker is being disfavored, the comparatively older worker has an affirmative defense, if the older worker can - if the employer can show that the - that it spent as least as much on the benefit for the older worker as it did for the younger worker, even if the benefit is less, and so that -",
  "We - we -",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor. We can shoehorn ourselves into that provision.",
  "It is - it is still pending in the court below. That's correct, Your Honor.",
  "We do think so, Your Honor. Of course, the respondents won't agree with that, I'm quite sure, and I - and I don't think that that's going to solve the many problems that the Sixth Circuit's decision gave rise to here. For example -",
  "Yeah - let - if I - I think it gives some protection, not complete protection, but I think there are a whole range of other negative consequences, Your Honor, that I'd like to address, if I could, and then - and I will certainly directly address the safe harbor provision. First, there are a number of employment practices out there where the nation's major employers have engaged in efforts to retain older segments of the workforce and to bring back elderly citizens back into the workforce by doing such things as providing for workers over a certain threshold age, very often 55, the ability to work part-time rather than full-time, to have flex- time schedules, to have - to have jobs that don't involve travel. They've changed the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment for people over a certain age to keep them in the workforce. The safe harbor here applies only to benefits, Justice Kennedy, and therefore, would not protect that kind of behavior, and although the United States talks about the safe harbor with respect to benefits, I would point out the brief of the United States is notably silent on the question of whether the interpretation being advocated here would make illegal that kind of conduct. And we submit it would because it clearly prefers the comparatively older to the comparatively younger with respect to terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, so -",
  "Yeah.",
  "Yes, yes, they have. There are DOL and EEOC letters which approve those practices, but it's hard to see how one could possibly approve those practices consistent with an interpretation of Section 623(a) that imposed a rigid rule of equality for everyone 40 and over.",
  "Yes -",
  "We have, Justice O'Connor, and this is actually the second category of adverse effect, it seems to me, that you have if the - if this decision stands and if the rule of law is what the - what the Government advocates. Many of those provisions, which are detailed quite effectively in the ERISA Committee brief, provide for - for things such as employees with - employee stock option plans, ESOP plans, are allowed, once they become 55 years old, to diversify their stock holdings. Employees, when they retire at 59-1/2 can withdraw money from their retirement plans without facing the tax penalty. There are a host of provisions like that. One point to be made is that it seems to me irreconcilable with the existence of those provisions to interpret 623(a) this way, but the other point my - my friends the respondents say, yeah, but you don't have to worry about that because the rule that the later-enacted statute governs over the former-enacted statute will take care of it. I'm afraid that's not so for the following reason. All of the examples I just gave, and many others in the - in the ERISA Committee brief, were statutes that Congress enacted before 1990, and I submit that 1990 is the relevant date for the later-enacted statute, because it has - has - that's the - the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act was passed after Betts and it was passed in 1990, and it was that statute that made the ADEA applicable for the first time to fringe benefits of the kind that those regulations govern. So you have a serious problem, at a very minimum, with respect to all of those regulations, it seems to me -",
  "Well, I say -",
  "I have a lot to say about it, Justice Scalia. The first thing is this: The critique that the Government levels at us with respect to that provision is equally applicable to their interpretation. What they say is that, you know, if it were lawful under the statute to grant a preference for old age - it doesn't make any sense to say that's it not lawful to advertise for old age - of course, what - if - if age means chronological age here, then you wouldn't be able to state a preference for chronological age in an advertisement, even though it would be perfectly lawful substantively to have a policy that said you're going to open positions to only people 40 or older. So I don't think they get any mileage out of that - out of that, because I think they've got the same kind of linguistic difficulty that we have here with respect to it. And I think what that shows, Justice Scalia, is -",
  "Well, I think you could read it as meaning old age, but I think the truth of the matter is that the word age is something of a chameleon. It's a word that is very sensitive to context and it's going to have somewhat different connotations throughout this statute, and I think it's quite clear that it does. It's a different connotation, for example, in Section B of the statement of findings and purposes, where it's quite clear that Congress is not talking about chronological age. It has a different connotation in the seniority provision, which you can find at page 3a of the Government's statutory appendix, which talks about involuntary retirement, down near the bottom of the page, that an employer's plan cannot require the involuntary retirement of any individual specified by subsection 631 of this title because of the age of such individual. Now, in a sense, that means chronological age, but not in the sense that my friends on the other side say about 623(a), because what it means really is once you've become old enough that you've bumped up against the age limit, and there are other provisions in 623 in which age functions in exactly that way. I just don't think - I think this really is a case like Robinson against Shell Oil, where the word employee takes on different connotations in different sections, like - like Scheidler, where the word enterprise in the various subsections of RICO takes on different connotations depending on exactly how it's being used. I think the word age here takes on different connotations in different sections in the statute.",
  "Well, I think - I -",
  "I think - we've thought about it in this sense, Justice Breyer, and I think it dovetails what I - what I think is our key contextual point, which is that statute only protects people 40 and older, and if what Congress was concerned about was a rule that precluded arbitrary discrimination in favor of the comparatively old as well as the comparatively young, it's an exceedingly strange thing to do to draw a line at age 40, because, of course, people under 40 are much more likely to be subject to discrimination on the ground that they're comparatively too young than are people over 40.",
  "Not anymore, Your Honor.",
  "But in any -",
  "I - I think - I think that's the - the best statement of the argument on the other side and I think it's the Government's effort to defend the line on that basis, but I don't think it works, because the reason that people 40 and over have a problem once they suffer an adverse employment action - and the Government itself acknowledges this in its argument - is because they are then subject to discrimination on the ground that they perceive - they are perceived as being too old. That's the problem, and that's the only problem the Government has been able to identify that people 40 and over suffer is that kind of -",
  "Yes, Justice Souter. I think that's true, but - but 623(a) isn't an all-purpose prohibition of arbitrary employment decisions respecting people 40 and over, and after all, that same kind of critique could be made of - if an employee is fired because they're not fit enough or they have the wrong color hair or -",
  "It - it does. That's the only thing in the voluminous history of this - of this enactment and all of its amendments that provides any support for the Government's view here in response, but it - and it - but it does provide some support for that, I agree. But I really think -",
  "I think - I think, Justice Kennedy, that it's - it's important to go back to the source for this statute to understand what Congress was trying to do, the circumstances of enactment of this statute. After all, Congress could have, either in 1964, when it passed Title VII, or in 1967, when it enacted this statute, simply have put the word age into Title VII and had it operate in exactly the same manner Title VII does. But it made a deliberate choice not to do that. The reason it did, I submit, is because the recommendations of the Secretary of Labor in response to the directive of Congress were that the problem of age discrimination in the workplace is fundamentally different than the problem of - than the problems that were addressed by Title VII. And the critical difference is this, that the - the kinds of discrimination that Title VII addressed was discrimination on the basis of characteristics that are always irrelevant to a decision about who should be hired, fired, or promoted, or demoted. And what the Secretary of Labor said is that age is different, the age is not always irrelevant, age distinctions are not always arbitrary, and I submit the Court - the opinion for the Court in Betts identified exactly that principle, that this is a different kind of problem warranting a different kind of solution. The problem was that there are stereotypes that exist that - that - on which employers act that - that prospective employees are - don't have the competence or the productivity to handle a job because they are too old, and that was the problem that this statute tried to address and it's why it tried to address it in such a fundamentally different manner than Title VII. Context makes all the difference here. Again, and - and I think the Court really did recognize that in Betts. Justice Kennedy, in Betts, you had the operative language privileges - terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, identical in Title VII to - and the ADEA. But what the Court concluded in Betts was that that language had a different meaning. In Title VII it included fringe benefits. In the ADEA it did not include fringe benefits, and the reason for that was because reading the provision not in isolation, but in the context of the rest of the statute, it was quite clear that Title - that the ADEA was meant to address a different kind of problem, and that there was age-based decision-making that was appropriate and not invidious and that ought not to be prohibited by law. And I submit that the kind of age- based decision-making that's at issue in this case is precisely the kind of age-based decision-making that Congress did not want to make unlawful. And the reason for this is quite - is quite simply that people at the end of their working lives are in a different position, especially with respect to retirement security measure, which is what at issue - is at issue here, even than a 41-year-old, someone else in the protected class. And so when an employer acts, as General Dynamics did here, with the union, to come up with a solution that protected them from a harsh outcome and protected their reliance interests, it's simply not anything remotely within the contemplation of Congress when it - when it - in the prohibitory - prohibitory sections of the ADEA. If the Court -",
  "I - I believe it's - I believe it's a comparable number, but I have to confess, Your Honor, I don't know for sure what the exact number is. If the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. We're prepared to submit our case.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Copyright infringement is the only commercially significant use of the Grokster and StreamCast services, and that is no accident. Respondents deliberately set out to capture a clientele of known infringers to stock their services with infringing content, they intentionally and directly promote the infringing use of the service, they support infringing use of the service, and they directly --",
  "Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I - -",
  "Well, I think it's an absolutely incorrect assertion of reality, and perhaps I could delve into it and explain why. The evidence in this case, which was presented at summary judgment, showed that 90 percent of the material on the services was either definitely or very likely to be infringing.",
  "Well, this was submitted on summary judgment, Your Honor, and we lost summary judgment, so the evidence has got to be construed in the light most favorable to us. And the Ninth Circuit decided the case on the assumption, we'd submit, of 90 percent. But with respect to that 10 percent, what happened, and we submit is completely wrong, is that the Ninth Circuit drew the inference, because it wasn't shown by our expert study, which, by the way, is the only empirical analysis in the case, to be infringing, that the Court could assume that it was noninfringing and then extrapolate from that to a number along the lines of the number that Your Honor suggested. And I think that that's completely illegitimate analysis, factually, and, besides, that number is big only because the overall activity is so big. The scale of the whole thing is mind-boggling. If there are that many noninfringing uses - -",
  "-- imagine how many infringing - -",
  "I don't think there -- I think it's quite accurate on the summary-judgment record, and certainly drawing the inferences in our favor, as we must here on summary -- on this summary-judgment record, that there is commercially significant noninfringing use.",
  "I don't think, in the context of this record in this case and the business model of these Defendants, Grokster and StreamCast, that that is true, Justice Ginsburg. I don't think that's right. I think what Grokster and StreamCast are arguing is that this Court's decision in Sony stands for the proposition that their massive actual infringement is -- gets a free pass, a perpetual free pass, so long as they can speculate that there are noninfringing uses out there, such as public- domain uses and authorized uses. We don't think that that -- that Sony stands for any such proposition. We also want to point out that that doesn't help them -- that proposition doesn't help them with respect to one very significant part of this case, and that's the fact that they intentionally built a network of infringing users, and they actively encouraged and assisted infringement. Now, even if there are commercially significant noninfringing uses, and we submit there most definitely aren't under Sony, but even if there are, that's no defense to a contributory infringement claim based on intentional building up of an infringing business and active encouragement and assistance of infringement, and it can't be; because, otherwise, then the fact that they had commercially significant noninfringing uses, again, would be just a free pass to actively promote infringing uses; not merely to support them, but to promote them. And so - -",
  "The active-encouragement aspect of our argument would be the same, certainly.",
  "They don't get a -- they don't get a free pass to encourage any infringement.",
  "Yes. I think there's - -",
  "-- there's a lot of --",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor, there's a lot of lingo floating around in this case -- inducement, active encouragement, assistance.",
  "Yes, very definitely. I think - - I think the Court, of course, should find that there's contributory liability under the Sony theory - -",
  "-- but with respect to - -",
  "-- that theory - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor, and let me explain why. The District Court in this case issued a partial final judgment, under rule 54(b), granting the Respondent's summary-judgment motions. Now, we argued for contributory liability on two theories in the District Court and in the Ninth Circuit. We argued that there was a lack of commercially significant noninfringing use under Sony, and we've argued the inducement or active- encouragement theory. We argued that both theories entitle us to relief against the current operations of the service, to entitle us to damages, and entitle us to injunctive relief to eliminate the harmful ongoing infringing consequences of this intentionally built-up infringement machine. The District Court granted summary judgment against us and gave a clean bill of health, gave absolution, essentially, to the current versions of the services. The only thing that was left to us, as the Ninth Circuit and the District Court -- and the District Court, both, understood the law, is that we can go back and try to show that, with respect to specific past acts of infringement, if we can show that they occurred at a time when we had given them notice that they were about to occur, and that we had the power to -- and they had the power to stop them at the moment we gave them the notice, that we can get damages for those specific things, and those specific things only. That's all that's left in this case. And I think it's quite clear, from the Rule 54(b) certification order of the District Court that it was only damages with the past services and the past acts --",
  "Here's what I -- here's where I think the test - -",
  "Right. Here's what I -- here's what we think the test is on the -- what we'll call the Sony aspect of the case, that it's -- the question here is -- Sony poses to us -- is really a touchstone kind of question, not a numerical kind of question. The question under Sony is whether this is a business that is substantially unrelated to infringement. In other words, are they building their business on supporting legitimate activity, or, instead, are they building their business supporting infringing activity?",
  "No, I think - -",
  "And that's where you start. That's the touchstone. Now, the numbers, the relative proportions of use, are relevant. In a case like Sony itself, certainly, where the majority use was noninfringing, that's a legitimate business; you don't need to go further. In a case like this one, where, taking the record at summary judgeent in our favor, as it must be, and the Ninth Circuit's assumption that you've got 90 percent infringing use, billions and billions of acts of infringing use, and minuscule actual noninfringing use, it seems to us it's just - -",
  "Yes, I think my answer to - -",
  "-- those questions are: yes, yes, yes, and yes.",
  "I disagree with that, Your Honor. Certainly not -- I don't think there's any empirical evidence to suggest, with respect to any of the things that Your Honor just identified -- and let me pick out the iPod as one, because it's the most current example, I guess. From the moment that device was introduced, it was obvious that there were very significant lawful commercial uses for it. And let me clarify something I think is unclear from the amicus briefs. The record companies, my clients, have said, for some time now, and it's been on their Website for some time now, that it's perfectly lawful to take a CD that you've purchased, upload it onto your computer, put it onto your iPod. There is a very, very significant lawful commercial use for that device, going forward. And, remember, I -- what our test -- our test is not \"substantial.\" Our test is that it's a -- it's a - - when it's a vast-majority use, like here, it's a clear case of contribution - -",
  "Well, I - -",
  "I think the weight - -",
  "I don't think that's right, Your Honor, and here's why. To -- it's not just the absence of commercially significant noninfringing uses that demonstrates contributory infringement. I mean, you have to demonstrate that you're making a material contribution, with knowledge that you're doing so. The inventor, at the outset, is not in that position. They're not making a contribution with knowledge that they're doing so. Do they have absolute certainty? No, they don't have absolute certainty.",

  "Well, first of all, I don't -- I think it's just counterfactual to think that there is going to be overwhelming infringing use of the iPod in the way that there indisputably is here. Second, to the extent you get the closer cases, it is our position, as I gather it is the position of the United States, that you look at -- to see what kind of business model the Defendant is operating under. Is it a -- is it -- are they marketing it for legitimate purposes? Are they taking reasonable steps to prevent infringement? If they are, then they -- then they're not liable. Third - -",
  "No, I don't think it is an inducement argument, because it doesn't go all the way to requiring us to show, as we can show here, that they've got intent. But I do think that the issue is, you know, really -- in the real world, you know, it isn't the case that these guys have gotten immediately sued. That's just not right. And the -- and the reality is that what happens is what happens here. There's perfectly valid uses - -",
  "No, I don't think that's right, Justice Kennedy. If there's vast-majority infringing use, and you continue to operate your business with the knowledge that there's vast-majority infringing use, then you've got liability.

  "I think that it is a -- I think --",
  "Neither, is the answer.",
  "Neither, is the answer. It is a basis for resolving this case, but not to the exclusion of getting the law right on Sony.",
  "Yes.",
  "We - -",
  "We agree with that. We think, in a situation where the vast majority of the use is infringing and there isn't any evidence of a legitimate business plan, on the Sony part of the case we would be entitled to summary judgment. We agree with you, Your Honor, that with respect to - -",
  "That's right.",
  "It came after the trial, that's right. But the -- a key point I think I want to make here is that this is not about this technology. What happens in the real world is that inventors come up with technology. Some people use it for lawful purposes and valid purposes, as some people use this technology for; some people abuse the technology to run business that - - businesses that are devoted to expropriating the value of copyrights. That's exactly what's going on in this case. If I could reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to start by clarifying the inducement issue, and then explain why inducement is not enough, and then have a word, if I might, about the reality of this case. The reason, Justice Souter, you find it bizarre is because a shell game is going on here. What the Respondent's position -- excuse me -- the Respondent's position here is that we can sue for specific infringements that we can show were induced by these specific acts, such as e-mail support. Our position on inducement is that we are entitled to injunctive relief against the continued operation of this gigantic infringement machine, which was built by the inducement. Now, I think that the Respondents have quite clearly said that they're -- they don't think any injunctive relief is available, going forward. But we're entitled, under Section 502 of the Copyright Act, to effective relief, not merely a -- relief, judgment relief, that says, \"Go and sin no more,\" but relief that undoes the consequences of this inducement, of this massive effort to build a gigantic engine of infringement. And that is why they're just wrong about that. And you certainly can't affirm the Ninth Circuit and allow us to go forward with anything like that theory, because the Ninth Circuit said the only thing we can sue for -- the only thing we can sue for -- is a situation in which we can show that we had knowledge of specific acts of infringement at a time when we could stop those specific acts of infringement. So there's just no way to affirm and let that go forward. Now, why is infringement -- why is inducement not enough? It's not enough because, as Justice Scalia suggested, these companies already operate in the shadows, and a ruling here, which would be, I submit, a significant cutback of the Sony rule, that inducement is the only available ground of liability, would just leave them to paper over -- you know, we do have some paper evidence here, a paper trail here, but that'll just -- they just won't exist next time. And it's just -- it's just not enough. And I submit that Sony was quite clear on this. Sony said that the staple article-of-commerce doctrine, not copyright law, generally, and not secondary liability, generally, but the staple article-of-commerce doctrine, the noninducement part of the analysis, has got to strike an effective balance -- a real balance that provides effective protection of copyright, as well as protecting unrelated lines of commerce. Now, their rule is a rule of immunity. It's a free pass. It says, all you've got to do is speculate about noninfringing use, and you can continue with infringement, ad infinitum. And that's not a rule that protects innovation; that's a rule that destroys innovation. It certainly destroys the innovation that the creators of the copyright law is supposed to protect, and that's supposed to be the effective protection part of the balance that Sony said this law is supposed to strike. It also -- it also deters legitimate technological innovation moving towards legitimate means of distributing this -- of distributing, in a digital format, music and movies through the kinds of companies that filed amicus briefs and that are trying to do this legitimately. They are inevitably and invariably undercut by the kinds of businesses that Respondents and the others run, so it deters innovation; it doesn't move it forward. And, beyond that, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested, it isn't just that they get to use our copyrighted -- the value of our copyrighted materials as the seed capital, that's the whole business. That is the whole business. And that's the reality here, and that's the problem. They can talk about the hundreds of thousands, or maybe even millions, of uses, but the reality is that there are 2.6 billion downloads, unlawfully, every month. So what they're talking about as lawful is a tiny, teeny little fraction of what's really going on here. And the problem with the rule which they say is a clear rule, but it obviously isn't in Sony, because Sony said, \"strike a balance.\" And the problem with that rule, Your Honor, is that it gives them a perpetual license to keep going forward with billions and billions of unlawful downloads a month. They never have to do anything to try to bring their conduct into conformity with law. They're not in the position of that inventor that you identified, Justice Scalia, who has to, sort of, think through, \"What am I doing?\" They're just in a position where they have every economic incentive in the world to maximize the number of infringing uses, because they make more money when they do so. Now, and with respect to the reality of this situation, let me just say -- and I must beg to differ, Justice Breyer, with the suggestion that this industry is thriving. What the -- the facts are that we have lost - - the recording industry has lost 25 percent of its revenue since the onslaught of these services. And that's particularly critical, because, remember, this is really -- the recording business, in particular, is really a venture-capital business. Most of the records we put out don't make money. A few make a lot of money. Well, what do you think's getting traded on Grokster and StreamCast and the rest of them? It's the few that make all the money. So they're draining all of the money out of the system that we use to find new artists and - -",

  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think it's important to focus at the outset on exactly what a workers' compensation plan provides. A workers' compensation plan provides health insurance that pays for the medical costs of a workplace accident, disability insurance --",
  "Well, I'd be happy to go right to the question of whether it's a plan, Justice Scalia, because I think it's indisputably a plan under this -- under the dictionary definition, ordinary meaning of plan, this Court's interpretation of it in Pegram, under ERISA, under the Department of Labor's interpretation of it, and under plain common sense. A plan is an arrangement or program or scheme, as Pegram said, to -- established by an employer or an employee organization to secure the provision of benefits to an employee through insurance or otherwise.",
  "See, I -- I --",
  "I think there is a plan for this reason, Justice Ginsburg. The -- what the law prescribes is that which the employer must provide to the employees. But it's not a self-executing law. The -- the employer has got to make arrangements to ensure that the benefits are provided, and under the laws of the vast majority of the States, the employer has options for doing that. The employer can contract with an insurance company to do it. The employer can self-insure to do it. And by the way, Justice Kennedy, there are quite stringent requirements for fiscal solvency and there is a surety bond that needs to be posted in order to -- in order to self-insure.",
  "I agree that that aspect of the arrangement is not negotiated, but there is nonetheless an arrangement that secures and guarantees the provisions of the benefits, and that's the plan. There are steps that the employer has to take to secure the provision of the benefits, here through the purchase of insurance, and that is the plan. The plan is the arrangement to secure the provision of benefits. Certainly they are --",
  "I don't think the answer to that question is yes, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the answer is no. I mean, I suppose you could say that those are -- that's a benefit provided to employees, but --",
  "I don't think so. I think there's a limiting principle here and I think the limiting principle is to look to ERISA. ERISA has a set of -- it defines what employee benefits are for ERISA purposes, and it's not -- and it's not these benefits and similar things. It's an exhaustive list of benefits. The parking lot isn't on the list. Similarly, a break room wouldn't be on the list. None of those things are on the list, and therefore, I think by reference to ERISA, one can relatively easily exclude those --",
  "Well, I think both of them are on the list actually, Mr. Chief Justice, because both of those are programs or arrangements to secure the provision of benefits, and one is through insurance and the other through self-insurance. So I think they're plans in both instances.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, because the amounts that Zurich is seeking in premiums are the amounts that were due for providing coverage during the 180 days before Howard ceased operations, and the reason that arises from -- it seems to me there are two ways in which that could arise from services rendered. It can arise from services rendered to the employees in the following sense. Howard has the obligation to provide those benefits by virtue of the fact that the employees are working for it during that period of time. That's what Judge King said in his opinion in the Fourth Circuit, and that seems to me exactly right. Alternatively -- alternatively, as other courts have suggested, the -- the services rendered --",
  "Well --",
  "I appreciate that, Justice Scalia, but I do think the -- the obligation on the part of the employer to keep paying the premiums during that period arises from the fact that the employees are continuing to work during that period. And what the -- and what the insurance company is seeking to recover is merely the cost of providing the insurance during that period of 180 days which arises --",
  "That's an important point, Justice Souter, and I would like to focus on that and I -- I hope correct something that the Petitioners said. With respect -- it all depends on when the insurance policy cancels. If there's nonpayment of premiums, then the insurance company has the right to cancel the policy, and there has -- there's a notice provision, 10 days in some jurisdictions, up to 30 days in others. But they have a right to cancel the policy. If an injury occurs before cancellation, that injury is covered and it's covered for all time, even if the policy subsequently cancels. But the key thing here, I think, the critical point is that without the priority, the -- the insurance company is going to look at the situation and say, we have very little prospect of recovering if this company actually goes down the tubes and into bankruptcy as a general unsecured creditor. Therefore, we need to get out of this situation fast. And they -- at that point, they're going to cancel the policy. There's going to be much more of a hair-trigger sense of the need to cancel policies. When they cancel policies, the immediate consequence, of course, is that the -- that the employees are no longer covered. And then, the -- it seems to me, the secondary consequence, which is also quite important --",
  "It's absolutely --",
  "That -- I -- I disagree with that, Justice Scalia. I think in -- in the real common practice here, the amount that they can recover and the amount that they think they have a prospect of recovering is a very important determinant in their decision on whether to hang in and how long to hang in until they get to the chapter 11 process where the debtor can then husband its assets and can pay the workers' compensation premiums as an administrative claim. So I think it's a -- it's a significant determinant. Without the priority, there's going to be a hair trigger, which means coverage is terminated sooner, and it's going to mean for many employers that they're going to have to go out of business because you can't operate without --",
  "I think my answer would be the same as to the Chief Justice that in some sense, I suppose you could say it's an employee benefit; in some sense, I suppose you could say that there's a contract to provide it. But I think you can set the outer bounds here by reference to the employee benefits that ERISA defines as employee benefits. But in any event --",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't think so, Justice Breyer --",
  "Well, first, if I can make a prefatory point, that the bottled water example doesn't distinguish the Petitioners' position from our position. The Petitioners' position is that if it's a -- if it's a negotiated-for, bargained-for benefit, it's in. So I don't think that's a -- it provides a limiting principle. And it seems to me, wherever the line is --",
  "Right, but --",
  "Well, I -- I don't think that's right. For example, in the -- in the case of most voluntarily provided health insurance, the vast majority of employees in this country -- it's not bargained for. It's something an employer provides unilaterally --",
  "Well, the fact that there may be a benefit to the employer doesn't make it any less of an employee benefit. The question is whether there is a plan that provides employee benefits, and the insurance coverage provided by workers' compensation are clearly employee benefits. I also -- and -- and, of course, the with -- with respect to that tradeoff, that's -- that tradeoff is an employee benefit too, Justice Ginsburg, because the -- the employee has no- fault liability, gets paid promptly rather than have to sue and wait years, doesn't lose his or her job as a result of the injury or as a result of bringing the lawsuit. So I don't think you can make the judgment that it's not an employee benefit plan on the basis of that fact. And of course, voluntarily provided benefits also benefit the employer by making it a more attractive place to work and -- and --",
  "-- better morale.",
  "I think there are four things I'd like to say in response to that, Justice Stevens. First, there isn't a textual hook for -- for that being a determinant, and it -- and it --",
  "And the second thing -- well, I think to the contrary, Justice Stevens. I think in the overwhelming majority of instances, the contributions employers make to employee benefit plans is the payment of insurance premiums to secure the benefits. Collectively bargained benefits provided by union trusts are a small minority of the benefits that are provided to workers in this country. But -- but going back to the specific question, of course, as Justice Alito's question earlier suggested, in a multi-employer pension plan situation, the plan is obligated by law to provide all vested pension benefits whether or not the employee's employer has defaulted on its payments into the fund. So it's in exactly the same position as the insurance company is with respect to that set of benefits, and therefore, the argument doesn't draw a distinction between the two.",
  "The answer is no. The statute expressly covers this. The last provision of section 507 says no subrogation, and those would be subrogation situations. So the statute just expressly covers it. They aren't -- they don't get bumped up in the line, period. I don't think there's any dispute about that. If I could, though, return to a -- a point that --",
  "I'm sorry. I can't direct you to where it is --",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.",
  "It should be in the briefs. It's not, but that is what the last section of section 507 says, that those who are subrogated to the rights of someone with a priority don't get the priority. So that's just taken care of by the statute.",
  "It does increase the likelihood, and it goes back to the example I was -- I was discussing with Justice Souter earlier. And -- and what -- it will not affect employees who are injured before cancellation, but it will accelerate cancellation. And as a result of accelerating cancellation, employers who are injured after cancellation will not get the benefits. And so it will --",
  "No. I think that -- I think, again, that last section of 507 takes care of that.",
  "The insurance contract is not in the record. That's right, but the --",
  "As a systematic matter -- it seems to me as a systematic matter, this is what insurance companies will do. I don't think that's dependent actually, Justice Scalia, on -- on the particular terms of this contract. I'm saying as a systematic matter insurance companies --",
  "Well -- well, sure, but the contracts comply with State law. State law sets notice periods for cancellation, 10 days minimum, up to 30 days. We've cited those in our briefs. And so in most States and in many States here, within as few as 10 days after nonpayment, you can cancel.",
  "Well, that -- there would be no priority there because that would be -- that would be a subrogated claim, and the last section of section of -- the last provision of section 507 says if you're subrogated to a --",
  "Well, I don't think --",
  "-- I don't think that would be a claim for contribution to the plan, Your Honor, in the same sense that we're talking about here. The -- if I -- if I could --",
  "Well, I'm -- I think there's an order of -- there's another order of degree of removal, and it would make it a harder question, I suppose, as to whether there would be a -- whether there would be a claim for priority in that context. But I think, if I could, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to return to the question of narrow construction where we started the argument.",
  "Yes. I think there are two significant points there, Justice Ginsburg, in terms of the history. First, in 1934 what Congress said was that workers' compensation could be a provable claim. It then said it's -- it gets the -- the seventh priority, but the seventh priority was not a priority specific to workers' compensation. It was a priority that's -- it was a provision that said you get a priority if State law provides the priority. In 1938, what Congress did was wipe out that provision for all State law granted priorities, not for workers' comp in specific. So it doesn't seem to me it was a specific judgment about workers' comp and its place in the priority system. And, of course, you didn't have the well- developed system of employee benefit plans in the 1930's that you have now. And what Congress did, when it enacted this provision in 1978, following closely after ERISA, was to use language which is identical to ERISA in providing a priority for employee benefit plans which, as ERISA on its face, I think, makes clear, would encompass workers' compensation plans.",
  "I think the complete explanation for the relationship between (a)(3) and (a)(4) was that Congress was trying to expand the scope of the priority here without doing damage either to the wage priority above it, which -- and -- and there would have been damage to the wage priority above it if wages were simply redefined to include the broader set of employee benefits -- or to the priorities below. Congress just took the aggregate amount. It seems to me just an elegant solution that protects the wage priority above, creates a new priority, and doesn't disadvantage any of the -- any of the priority-holders below. And I really do think that's the complete explanation for the relationship between the two. You really can't infer anything more than that. But if I could just address the so-called rule of narrow construction. Certainly there is a sentence or two in Nathanson and Embassy Restaurant, but those were such clear cases of statutory construction that -- that the rule of narrow construction, I submit, played no role there. In many, many more cases in which this Court has interpreted the priority provisions of the act and the code, the Court has not mentioned this idea that there's a rule of narrow construction or that the principle of equality of distribution to creditors should trump everything else. We've cited four in our brief: Lewis, Shropshire, Ricketts, and SBA v. McClellan, which by the way, expressly cut back on Nathanson. But there are many more cases. There's a whole line of tax priority cases culminating in the Reorganized CF&I Fabricators decision in which the courts adjudicated the question of -- of the scope of the tax priority. Most of the time, they find priority. Occasionally they find no priority. But in none of those cases is this so-called rule of construction ever mentioned or the supposed primacy of the rule of equality of -- of the principle of equality of distribution ever mentioned.",
  "Well, I think the fact that the phrase is identical to the phrase that appears in ERISA, employee benefit plan, is significant. ERISA was one of the most substantial legislative accomplishments of that decade of the 1970s. And so I think the mere fact that the exact same language appears in both places, importantly, however, with -- without the limiting qualification in section 507(a)(4) that exists in ERISA itself with respect to workers' compensation plans. I also think that if the Court does look at the legislative history, what -- what one learns from the legislative history is that when the bill was originally introduced to -- to create this priority, it created a priority for -- proposed to create a priority for pensions, insurance, and similar employee benefit plans. The union representatives came in to Congress and said that's too narrow. We need something significantly broader to ensure that the full range of employee benefits is protected and granted this priority. What the union representatives all urged Congress to do was to adopt the ERISA definition wholesale. Now, we don't have anything in the -- in the House or Senate report saying that's what we did. In other words, we intended to adopted ERISA wholesale, but we do know that is what, in fact, they did. They used exactly the language from ERISA and they moved it into the priority in section 507.",
  "Well, I think that the -- I think that the statute could be read --",
  "It could be the -- it could be either, it seems to me, Justice Stevens.",
  "And I -- but I don't think it matters in this case because you get to the same answer either way. If it's the services rendered of the employees, the -- the claim is for contributions to -- for the cost of providing insurance to those employees during the 180 days. If it's the services rendered at Zurich it's the provision of services during the 180 days --",
  "But it -- but it arises from. The -- had -- I think it arises from in this sense, Justice Scalia. Had Howard shut down on a certain day and didn't have employees anymore, it wouldn't have any continuing obligation to or need to pay workers' compensation premiums because there would be no workers to cover. And so it arises from --",
  "Right, but you don't need --",
  "But -- yes. But not -- but -- but we -- let's see. I think that maybe this will clear up the confusion. We continue to pay for them even after the policy is over --",
  "-- and -- but -- and so --",
  "Well, depending on the kind of policy, that may be true to some extent. Sometimes policies are loss-sensitive policies in which the amounts owed are calculated very carefully with respect to the amounts actually of loss incurred during the period. That is, in fact, the case here. If you have an understanding of insurance, you can infer that from the charts that are included in the joint appendix, although I acknowledge it's very difficult to do so. So I do think -- I do think on any common sense understanding of the -- of the phrase, arising from, which is a capacious phrase, it really does arise from. But in terms of -- I think, Justice Stevens, with respect to your question, to get to the same answer, in terms of calculating the amount of the claim, whichever one you pick here, there's actually a division of authority in the lower courts. There's a Fourth Circuit opinion by Judge Luttig, saying it's services rendered by the insurance company. Other courts say services rendered by the employees. Since it doesn't make a difference in this case, I would respectfully suggest probably it ought not to be decided in this case because you get to the same place either way. I do -- I do think that it's important also -- I'm sorry. Excuse me. If I may just go back to the narrow construction rule. The -- the point of this idea of primacy of equality of distribution. Equality of distribution is an important policy under the bankruptcy code, but it's only one important policy under the bankruptcy code. Rehabilitation of the debtor is an important policy under the code. The maximizing the value of the estate is an important policy under the code, and specific code provisions advance other specific policies as well. So in any given case, as here, all of those co - policies aren't going to align and point in the same direction. Sometimes they're going to be at cross purposes. And what -- what the Court said in Union Bank, in I think a closely analogous context interpreting the ordinary course exemption from -- from the preference rule, was that we don't put a thumb on the scale either way here. We don't assume that one of these policies is more important than the other. What we assume is that Congress struck the balance between the potentially competing policies, that the balance is reflected in the text of the statute that Congress enacted, and that we should interpret the text as it's written without -- without a presumption in either direction. I really think Union Bank is highly instructive on that, and it's just -- it's just right and plain common sense. And that's why I think in the vast majority of cases, there is no rule of narrow construction.",
  "No, because the employer doesn't have the obligation to provide unemployment compensation. That's a State-run system in which the State has the obligation to provide the benefit, and the State does in fact provide the benefit. It's usually funded through a tax. The key difference is this is an employer obligation to provide these benefits, and I think that's why this is an employee benefit plan. The employer is obligated to provide it to employees by virtue of the fact that the employees are working for the employer. Not true about unemployment compensation. In conclusion, if I could just focus on the -- the point that it really is the case that enforcing this priority, as it is written, will advance the purposes for which Congress included it in the code. It will protect the interests of workers, millions of whom have no employee benefit plan other than workers' compensation, because it will increase the prospects that that money is there to pay workers' compensation claims. It will also advance the code's purpose of better rehabilitation because it will give insurance companies a reason not to pull the hair trigger, to hang in there with these companies, and to allow them to have a chance to rehabilitate rather than forcing them into liquidation by canceling coverage which the law allows. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by clearing up what exactly we did and didn't argue with respect to waiver and what exactly is and isn't before this Court on that set of issues in our judgment. I then would like to spend a couple of minutes on what I think the Ninth Circuit did and what effect that would have on this Court's disposition of the case. And if there's any time remaining. I'd like to turn to the question of whether we have asserted colorable claims that warrant an evidentiary hearing here, which is all that we're asking for. Now, with respect to this question of whether we pursued or didn't pursue waiver, I'm afraid counsel for the State is just wrong about this. It's important to understand how this comes up. We asserted a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, deficient performance and prejudice. The State asserted as a defense to that claim: No, no, he's waived. And the trial judge, the State habeas judge in the State court conviction ruling, agreed with that and said, well, yes, he's waived. We then filed a petition for rehearing in which we said, no, you can't rely on that defense because it's got to be a knowing and intelligent waiver under Johnson against Zerbst. That's at page 92 of the joint appendix. That motion for rehearing was denied without any further comment. We then took a petition to review to the Arizona Supreme Court. That's also in the joint appendix and I believe the page cite is 101 and 102, in which we specifically argued that you can't look to this so-called waiver as a defense to our claim of ineffective assistance because it wasn't knowingly and intent. Now, in the State's response to our petition, which unfortunately is not in the joint appendix but is in the record, the State says: No, this waiver is binding and, furthermore, you're procedurally defaulted because this procedure was decided on direct review. But the one thing the State does not say is that you raised this Johnson against Zerbst issue too late, it can't be considered. We then went to - -",
  "I may have the wrong page.",
  "I'm sorry. I will find it for Your Honor. I'm sorry for the delay here. The motion for rehearing is, I'm sorry, 99, and on 102 is where we raise it, and then subsequently -- then subsequently we raise it - -",
  "Well, it doesn't have to, but, Your Honor - -",
  "Well, there's no -- but the point is that's not -- when we took this to the Arizona Supreme Court that's not an argument that the State made in opposition to our raising Johnson against Zerbst. Then when we got to the Federal district court we raised this again, this exact argument in Federal district court, and the State in Federal district court didn't object that we had failed to raise this appropriately in the State proceedings. We took it to the Ninth Circuit. They didn't raise the objection that we failed to raise it appropriately in the State proceedings. The first time that question has even been raised here is in the reply brief on the merits in this Court. And I think that's tied to the next point I want to make, which is significant, which is as the case comes to this Court the Ninth Circuit has ruled that we have met the requirements of 2254(e)(2) and are therefore entitled to an evidentiary hearing. Now, what the State is essentially saying is, well, no, you really aren't entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this set of issues because you didn't raise them adequately in the State court.",
  "On both, Your Honor.",
  "Let me move to that if I could, because I do think that's significant. I think the Court has elucidated the two potential readings of the Ninth Circuit's decision. It seemed to us as we prepared this case on the merits that the reality is that the two, the issue of performance and the issue of waiver, are tied together, because if it comes out after a hearing that counsel did perform an effective job, a diligent job of performing the investigation, and did instruct the client as to what the mitigation evidence was, then you view the waiver in a different light than of course you would if the counsel hadn't. So we acknowledge here that the proper disposition of this case ought to be a remand for an evidentiary hearing.",
  "We're trying to establish there, Your Honor - -",
  "Your Honor, I want to respond directly to Your Honor's question, if you'll just permit me one more thought about the Ninth Circuit and I'll turn right back to that.",
  "So in other words, we are making a more modest request for relief here which, is affirmance of the judgment sending back for an evidentiary hearing, but with a recognition that the evidentiary hearing ought to deal with the issue of waiver, which should be understood to be left open. I think we're conceding something here, that waiver ought to be left open and not definitively resolved. It's premature to definitively resolve that against the State without an inquiry. Now, turning to Your Honor's point, the - - with respect to whether there was a waiver here or not and what the State judge did or didn't do, something very significant here that I think the State's argument just overlooks. There's an assumption in the State's argument that Landrigan's conduct at the sentencing hearing itself was a waiver and considered to be a waiver. But if one looks at the transcript of that hearing, and this is D to the appendix to the petition and beginning at page D-4 -- D-3 is where the colloquy occurs where this alleged waiver happened. The very next thing that occurs, the very next thing that occurs, is the trial judge says: Okay, I want to hear from the mitigation witnesses. Then the mitigation witnesses say: Well, we're not going to testify. Then the very next thing that occurs is the trial judge says: Well, I want a proffer of what they would have said. Then when -- then when all that's said and done, the trial judge says to the lawyer -- - and this is at D-15 -- you got anything else, and the lawyer says, no, Your Honor, that's all I've got, all I've got is what's in the sentencing memo and these two witnesses. Then the judge proceeds to pass sentence. That's the -- the particularly important pages are D-20 and 21, and on those pages you will see that what the judge does is not treat Mr. Landrigan's statements as a waiver, because if she had treated those statements as a waiver what she would have said is, well, here's the aggravation case, Mr. Landrigan has waived mitigation, he has a right to do that.",
  "I respectfully - -",
  "Let me address your second question first and then your first question. I think that that in two senses does not accurately represent what this mitigation case presented to the State court and presented to the Federal court is all about. With respect even to his affidavit, which I don't think fairly under Arizona procedure can define the full scope of his claim, but with respect to that affidavit alone, what it says is not genetic predisposition. It says the \"biological component of violence.\" That's the language that Mr. Landrigan's affidavit uses.",
  "But one other thing it does that's very significant, Mr. Chief Justice, is it also says that these witnesses can attest to the use of alcohol and drugs by the biological mother when Landrigan was in utero.",
  "Yes, but what he's saying that he would have agreed to, it seems to me the only fair reading in this affidavit, which again I don't think fairly defines the full scope of what he's allowed to proceed with under Arizona procedure, but with respect to this affidavit he's saying, well, if you had had an expert who could have come in and given testimony about fetal alcohol syndrome and the organic brain damage and other impairments that it causes, I would have cooperated with that. And that's really significant because if you look at page D-21 of the appendix to the petition - -",
  "Because all the biological mother would have had to do was to give that information to the expert. That's a routine matter, for experts to gather factual information and assimilate it into an expert opinion and then provide it to the court. That could have happened easily here. And I think it's very significant because on page 21 you'll see that the trial judge makes a fundamental error about this exact issue. She says: Well, I'll grant this, I'll take the mother's testimony as a proffer. I'll consider the possibility of fetal alcohol syndrome, but all fetal alcohol syndrome establishes is that the kid will also have a predisposition to addiction.",
  "Sure, and I don't think there's anything unreasonable about that. Those are very different experiences, but - -",
  "If I -- whatever else happened, the trial judge here considered this evidence of mitigation and did a weighing. And the key point I want to make sure I make here is that therefore any evidence that this lawyer had prepared, an expert on fetal alcohol syndrome most prominently and any other evidence, the trial lawyer could have proffered at the time and had considered at the time and had weighed at the time by this trial judge. And that's a claim of prejudice, it seems to me, that even if one grants, even if one assumes -- and we dispute it and I'd like too talk about that -- but even if one assumes that there is a finding and we can't do anything about it that Landrigan would not have cooperated in the presentation of any - -",
  "I don't think there's a yes or no answer to that question. It's something - -",
  "Yes. Yes, it's possible. It's certainly possible.",
  "But I think I don't -- I want to make sure I don't leave any implication that the rule we're asking for here is going to open the door to lots of claims, because I don't think it does for two sets of reasons. One is a procedural set of reasons and that's the -- that, we refer the Court to the Blackledge against Allison decision -- that if -- that it's not going to be enough in every case for you to plead an adequate claim and then jump right to an evidentiary hearing. As the court said in Allison, the district court has available to it a number of tools that it can use to test the claim before granting an evidentiary hearing. So there's a limitation there. Now - -",
  "I think that's important, and hopefully it will help explain why we think that this is a narrow -- that the rule we're asking for here is a narrow one, and it's not going to open the door to lots of claims. It's clear that just like the waiver of any other fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial, the defendant's got to understand what mitigation means. He's got to understand its significance in the proceedings - -",
  "And he needs to be assisted by competent counsel. That's a consistent theme of this Court's decisions on the Johnson inquiry. And so if you have a situation in which you have documented that the client understands what mitigation is -- and frankly I don't think, with all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, this is the kind of documentation that ought to suffice. But even if you had that, even if you documented that the defendant understood it, even if you documented that the defendant clearly waived it and documented that was done with counsel's assistance, then it seems to me it is going to be very hard for a habeas petitioner to plead something that's going to get past - -",
  "Well, because I think there isn't clarity at all that he understands what mitigating evidence is, what the full scope of it is and how it could - -",
  "But again, Mr. Chief Justice, at the time the trial judge didn't treat that as a waiver. And so I don't think you can cut off his ability to litigate an ineffective assistance claim years later on the ground that it was an ineffective waiver.",
  "I think, Justice Alito, we're making a couple of different claims, not that claim, but a couple of different claims. One is, and it pertains particularly to a mental health expert, that even if Landrigan behaved exactly the way -- at 13 -- he in fact behaved in the counterfactual world in which he had received adequate representation, that the mental health expert testimony could have been proffered to the Court, had it been prepared and developed, would have been considered, and could have made a critically important difference and for precisely the reason that Justice Ginsburg's question suggested, which is that he's obviously behaving badly in this situation. What the trial court ruled out of that is, well, he's an amoral person. What the mental health testimony would give you is an alternative frame of reference for making a reasoned moral judgment about this guy, and could be critically important in explaining that behavior. So even within the confines of accepting that the world would have unfolded exactly the way it did, it was ineffective to have dropped the ball on preparing that kind of evidence. Then it's also ineffective in - -",
  "No.",
  "No, to the basic weighing the mitigation which the judge undertook based on all proffered evidence. Then beyond that, we're making an argument that the waiver that, even if you are going to consider that a waiver, you can't consider it a knowing and voluntary waiver, knowing intelligent waiver supported adequately by the efforts of counsel.",
  "No. I don't think that's the issue. With all due respect, Justice Alito, I think the test under Strickland is whether there was sufficient performance, which we think we have a very powerful record of here, and then a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different. And I think the inquiry here that the State habeas judge is undertaking is the reasonable probability inquiry. That seems to me to be a mixed question that requires - -",
  "Well, taking our first argument to the side, our first argument which I've been discussing about what happened at the hearing, I think with respect to that argument the answer's no, that argument stands without any need to disprove the factual finding, if you assume it is a factual finding, and we don't concede that. But if it is a factual finding, then yes, we would have to disprove it by clear and convincing evidence, but we think we can do that, and all we're asking for is a hearing to enable us the opportunity.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor, for bringing us back to that question.",
  "Yes.",
  "With one addition, which is this one, fetal alcohol syndrome expert testimony is very important.",
  "Yes.",
  "No.",
  "Well, but - -",
  "Justice Scalia, would you permit me to answer that question, and I'll come back to Your Honor's?",
  "Thank you. The -- with respect to the standard, there are two things that we have to show and if we do, we're entitled to a hearing. One is that we're not disentitled under the analysis under Section 2254(e)(2) as explicated in the Court's Michael Williams decision, to show that the court below found it, it was not raised in the cert petition. We pointed out in the brief in opposition that it wasn't raised, it had nothing about it. That's established and the case comes to the court.",
  "That (e)(2) does not apply to us proceeding to an evidentiary hearing.",
  "Because the -- there is no lack of diligence here that would trigger us meeting the heightened requirements of (e)(2), and therefore it doesn't apply to bar us. That's the theory. Now, with -- the other thing we have to show - -",
  "I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "No. No, Your Honor. That's -- as we understand the Michael Williams decision interpreting that provision, Your Honor, those requirements only kick in in a situation where you haven't shown diligence and therefore you're at fault, and you can overcome your fault by meeting those heightened standards. They don't apply in a situation where you have been diligent and therefore you're not - - they don't apply to you at all. With respect to the -- what else -- with respect to what else we'd have to show, we'd have to show that -- and this is the Townsend standard, which nothing has changed -- that we've alleged facts which, if proven, entitle us to relief. Those are the two things we have to show and we've done both of those things.",
  "And the Ninth Circuit -- and it seems to us actually, Your Honor, under Townsend in that situation the hearing's mandatory. The district court would have discretion under habeas, under habeas practice, to hold a hearing as a discretionary matter even in a situation where we haven't shown a mandatory entitlement to it. So there is discretion there.",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Well, but I think -- what I think is important there is that that issue ought to be decided after an evidentiary hearing when you know what it's going to be. It's premature to decide that - -",
  "Well, that's true.",
  "Well, they could, but it seems to me not until you actually hear the expert testimony, and then we have all of the other testimony that Justice Breyer detailed that you'd want to consider. I do want to try to come back, Justice Scalia, to your point. Yes, we acknowledge that the Ninth Circuit went too far in the way Your Honor described. But you don't get from that conclusion to the conclusion that you ought to grant the relief that the State is requesting here, which is a reversal and directing dismissal of the petition, because to get to that you have to show that there's no set of circumstances under which we could prevail. We're -- our position is an intermediate one, which is that the right answer here is that the judgment to send it back for an evidentiary hearing was correct and should be affirmed.",
  "I think the answer is that that is an inappropriately truncated assessment of the mitigation case and a wrongly focused assessment of the mitigation case, which ought to Focus on the troubled history and the fetal alcohol syndrome, which provide a medical mental health explanation for his conduct which is quite different and that -- and so that's what ought to be balanced.",
  "That's not correct, Your Honor.",
  "The fact that she used abusive -- that she abused alcohol, but not the medical expert testimony explaining what effects that would have. That's precisely the thing that wasn't there and that was the big problem. So I do think that that -- that's why we need an evidentiary hearing, to develop that. This weighing, by the way - -",
  "Well, if you look at page D-21, Mr. Chief Justice, what you'll see is actually proof in the transcript that she had no familiarity, because she said on page D-21 all it does is predispose you to being an addict yourself. But fetal alcohol syndrome is a much, much broader set of impairments that can bear directly on one's, one's moral culpability. If I could just say - -",
  "Sure. What there was that the Ninth Circuit, upon receiving this letter, contacted counsel for Mr. Landrigan, asked him -- asked them to go visit him in prison and find out what's going on. They did so. They reported back to the Ninth Circuit that Mr. Landrigan did in fact want to proceed with the appeals. He has continued to want to proceed with the appeals, signing the IFP papers, et cetera, and it turns out there were neurological problems that were afflicting him, very serious, at the time. So that's what happened. If I could say in conclusion, just remind the Court what it said in the first Norrell decision, that even in the world of habeas there's a difference between deference and abdication. And in a situation like this one, in which the State court has not afforded an evidentiary hearing and has not allowed the development of the evidence that bears directly on Mr. Landrigan's claims, it would be a form of abdication to hold that he can be conclusively barred from proceeding further, even to an evidentiary hearing, on the basis of the present record. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Kentucky's lethal injection procedures pose a danger of cruelly inhumane executions. If the first drug in the three-drug sequence, the anesthetic thiopental, is not effectively administered to the executed inmate, then the second drug, pancuronium, will induce a terrifying conscious paralysis and suffocation and the third drug, potassium chloride, will inflict an excruciating burning pain as it courses through the veins.",
  "I disagree with that respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice. The protocol simply does not address several key steps where risks can arise and, beyond that, the protocol's -- and I think this is critically important -- the protocol's procedures for monitoring to assure that the inmate is adequately anesthetized are practically nonexistent.",
  "That is true, but there can be no guarantee that it will be properly administered and that is because even in clinical settings there are always -- there is always the potential for difficulty which manifests itself in actual problems, for example in the setting of an IV.",
  "If there were a way to guarantee that the procedure worked every time, then we wouldn't have substantial risk.",
  "But - -",
  "Well, if the \"if\" is, I apologize for this, but for clarity -- the \"if\" is that 100 percent of the time the dose of anesthetic is properly administered into the condemned inmate, then we don't have a significant risk. Of course that is not what the record in this case establishes. The record establishes the contrary. There is -- you cannot assure that there is going to be a guarantee of -- of successful administration of the anesthetic. And that is why the monitoring part of the process is so critical.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I think we have tried to suggest in our brief that there is a way to monitor effectively even with the three-drug protocol. It's challenging. The key component of that is that one needs a person trained in monitoring anesthetic death to participate in the process.",
  "Well, Your Honor, of course, that's why there is another practical alternative here, which solves that problem, which is the single dose of barbituate, which does not require the participation of a medically trained professional.",
  "Well, if I may Justice Alito, I do think and I'd like to provide the references where it is raised and then the evidentiary references that support the argument - -",
  "Well, at page 684 of the joint appendix, the -- this is the trial brief, the brief raised in the trial court -- one assertion made there is that an alternative chemical or combination of chemicals that poses less risk of unnecessary pain and suffering during an execution is - -",
  "And then -- and then, no. And then later, on page 701, the brief argues that there are nonpainful ways of stopping the heart.",
  "The thiopental is a barbiturate and by definition will inflict death painlessly. The record in this case establishes -- each expert, the Petitioner s expert and Respondents' expert, testified that it is guaranteed at the three gram dose to cause death.",
  "Well, I think the record references, which I think the record pretty clearly establishes, Your Honor, that death is certain to occur through the use of thiopental at the three gram dose.",
  "Well, I think to refer instead to the expert testimony in this case which says that death is certain to occur, and in addition, that medical testimony in this case that it is certain to occur in a very few minutes. Those are the transcript references that we provided at page 18 of the reply brief.",
  "Well, it has never been tried on humans. That is correct. It is - -",
  "I think you do, Mr. Chief Justice, because by definition, barbituates cannot inflict pain and do not inflict pain.",
  "Well, yes there would, Mr. Chief Justice, because the reality is that thiopental and other barbituates are anti-convulsives. Their point is to -- among other things to suppress any involuntary muscle - -",
  "No, because to the extent that the reason that they are offering to do it, is because of the potential for discomfort that it may cause the audience given the risk that the - -",
  "I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice, but given the extent to which it increases the risk that there can be ineffective anesthesia, and it can go undetected, it doesn't seem to us to be an argument of sufficient force to justify using it despite that risk particularly when it seems to us that the issue of dignity can be addressed by communication with the audience.",
  "Well, I think with respect to the lingering death point, I think it would, this Court's cases are talking about is the consciousness of lingering death and the torture that that imposes, which you wouldn't have of course in this situation. I don't think there is a credible argument that the use of a barbituate alone could inflict pain. They do not inflict any pain. Now, of course there are possibilities of maladministration, but not maladministration of a one drug protocol that results in any pain, and therefore there is just not a credible Eight Amendment argument. It seems to me that it couldn't be cruel and unusual punishment, because there is no pain.",
  "The monitor for anesthetic.",
  "To ensure that anesthetic depth has been achieved and maintained.",
  "That is correct.",
  "The trained personnel could be a physician, a nurse or anyone trained by them adequately in this process.",
  "Well, I think the one point of the one-drug protocol, of course, is to demonstrate that we are not doing that. Beyond that, it seems to me that the State can't have it both ways with respect to the -- the issue of the participation of medically trained personnel. On the one hand, they cannot say that we have qualified medically able personnel participating in this process and that's our guarantee of its efficacy, and on the other hand say a requirement of having trained qualified personnel participate is impossible. And they do say that. For example the EMTs that participate in Kentucky are under the same ethical set of issues as doctors are.",
  "With additional training they could be qualified. They aren't qualified by virtue of their training to become EMTs. They would have to be additionally trained.",
  "It is true Justice Souter that the trial court did not make factual findings on a whole range of issues with respect to the difficulties of constituting the proper dose, the risk of catheter placement, the risk of blowouts, the risk of mixing up syringes, and the adequacy of the monitoring. And I agree, Your Honor, that it did so because it didn't believe that that was particularly relevant to the issue before it. And that's the -- the basis of our disagreement with respect to the legal test. Now, it is -- it is our position that the record is sufficiently clear and sufficiently uncontradicted on the key points with particular respect to monitoring that the Court would not have to remand but it certainly would be a reasonable thing to do in view of the deficiencies in the actual findings.",
  "Right.",
  "With respect to the second, it's a combination. They would use the available equipment, EKG and blood pressure cuff which is the standard practice used for monitoring for unconsciousness, but in addition, as the expert testimony in the case established, you have to have close -- close visual observation by the trained person.",
  "No, I don't think so, Justice Kennedy. There was some question about whether the third device that this monitor is used but the blood - - the tracking of blood pressure is a critical way of monitoring for unconsciousness as is the EKG and - -",
  "Well - -",
  "There is no slap in the face. There is no shaking the person. There's no testing of that kind whatsoever under the Kentucky protocol. So even under that understanding, which we don't think is correct, that -- we don't have that here and that's one of the problems. All there is, is visual observation by an untrained warden and an untrained deputy warden who had testified in this case that they don't know what to look for to determine whether somebody is conscious or unconscious.",
  "Yes. It - -",
  "I don't think we introduced evidence that medically trained personnel were ready available, but we did introduce evidence about what needed to be done and, of course, as I said, Kentucky like the other states had their ability to bring medically qualified personnel to bear to run this process. And so I do think - -",
  "I understand that, Your Honor, and that's why I suggest - -",
  "That's why I suggested that there is -- that this case can be decided on the basis of the record here because the undisputed expert testimony on these key issues shows the deficiencies in the protocol.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Each side's expert testified to precisely the same thing.",
  "Three grams was certain to cause death.",
  "The record establishes that death is certain.",
  "No. Three grams is a massive dose.",
  "But if one had any doubt about the certainty of the effect of causing death, one could always just increase the dose. But the record here is that three grams - -",
  "I'm not sure there's anything in the record, Your Honor. There is discussion in the amicus briefs about some other jurisdictions that have gone as high as five grams.",
  "Right.",
  "No, Mr. Chief Justice, because, as I've tried to say earlier, even if there is maladministration - -",
  "That's correct. But the difference is if there's an error at that stage in the process and the execution proceeds, there may be a problem that needs to be fixed, but it will not be a problem that causes any pain, and that's the critical difference because if it doesn't cause pain it can't be a cruel and unusual punishment.",
  "We don't make the argument that States are required to choose the least painful method possible. Our standard is grounded on three, I think, extremely solid, well- established points of Eighth Amendment doctrine. The first one is this: The core concern of the Eighth Amendment at the time of its founding, of course, was precisely the question of whether the carrying out of death sentences would inflict torturous deaths. So we're at the core of the historical concern.",
  "That's the second principle, Your Honor, is that this Court's cases, including the ones that Your Honor averted to, have said that the standard is whether the means of execution inflicts unnecessary pain.",
  "And - -",
  "Well, the -- with all due respect, Wilkerson and Kemmler say \"unnecessary pain.\" Resweber says \"unnecessary pain and\" - -",
  "No, that's correct, because --",
  "No.",
  "Yes, because, Justice Scalia, our position is that the pain that is inflicted here when this goes wrong is torturous, excruciating pain under any definition. We're not talking about a slight increment different. We're talking about the infliction of torturous pain.",
  "No.",
  "We would have to suggest it to the test that we are advocating, which it would - - whether there is a risk of torturous pain.",
  "Well, it would have to be subjected to the test.",
  "If there is a risk of torturous pain and if there are readily available alternatives that could obviate the risk, then any significant risk - -",
  "Well, it would depend. The argument about electrocution, Justice Scalia, is whether or not it is painless, and that was its point when it was enacted, that it would be a painless form of death.",
  "It does not, but that was its point, and I think one would have to subject it to the test to see whether it inflicts severe pain that is readily avoidable by an alternative.",
  "Well, electrocution may well. But it would depend again, Your Honor. If it could be established that it was painless, that there wasn't a risk that it could go wrong in a way that inflicts excruciating pain then it would be upheld. If it couldn't, it wouldn't. That does seem a serious question. Obviously, the Court granted certiorari to consider it a few terms ago. But that would be the test, the mode of analysis here, and I - -",
  "There is an unnecessary pain requirement. There is also, Justice Scalia - -",
  "From this Court's cases.",
  "Yes, it comes from this Court's cases.",
  "Well, it seems to me it's more than that. And Pinetti is one case that shows it, because there's a case in which the Eighth Amendment forbid the execution of a person who was insane at the time of execution. In that situation there is no intent on the part of the people carrying out the execution to inflict cruel and unusual punishment. This Court didn't require intent in Pinetti. In fact, it said something quite different, really the polar opposite. It said that the States have to have in place procedures to ensure that there wasn't an arbitrary infliction of the death penalty in that circumstance, without any requirement of intent. The Gregg-Woodson-Lockett cases don't have a requirement of intent, and the Kemmler and Wilkinson cases don't have a requirement of intent in them either. With respect to the \"unusual\" character of it, just drawing from the dictionary definitions that Your Honor posed in the Harmline case, this is unusual in precisely that way in that it is, if Your Honor will just bear me, it is such that does not occur in ordinary practice. So I do think it's unusual in that sense. And I'd like to reserve the balance of my time if I may.",
  "They have -- they have zero expertise in pushing drugs. They have expertise in placing the line. They have expertise in finding a vein. They have no more experience pushing drugs than the person who pushes the drugs.",
  "Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. The risk here is real that is why in the State of Kentucky it's unlawful to euthanize animals in the way that carries out its executions that's true not only with the use of pancuronium one cannot use potassium unless someone trained in ensuring effective anesthesia is participating in the process and what that is is a marker that this is a real danger sufficiently real that it's not tolerated with animals.",
  "Nor is it present with respect to euthanizing animals and never the -- it's the danger of the anesthesia going wrong there can be a torturous pain inflicted that has led veterinarians to say you have to have somebody in the process who is trained in monitoring anesthetic death and Justice Breyer if I could refer back to your Netherlands point my understanding is that in the Netherlands there is a doctor present who is trained in anesthesiology who administers this whole process and so the risk is dramatically different in a situation where you have that trained person there than the situation we have in Kentucky now with respect to the other states and the other so-called botched executions that my friend Mr. Englert referred to is just not right to say that they were all about cut downs and small problems. The record finds a fact in the Morales case without respect to the 11 lethal injection studies there six out of the seven were inadequately -- the experts in that case admitted it was likely that one was not likely an at the time -- at the time that the pancuronium and potassium were put in the system similarly in the case in North Carolina the evidence credited by the court was that with respect to four of them the condemned inmate was on the -- any gasping struggling not the kind of involuntary twitching that Mr. Englert is worried about but clear that the anesthetics are not working with respect to the lethality of thiopental at page 42 of the joint appendix Dr. Heath says that thiopental will be lethal by itself three grams at page 494 he says indeed it will be lethal by itself in virtually every case at two grams. At page, at page forgive me I don't have the page number reference handy but Dr. Dershowitz the state's expert says the same thing now the reference that Mr. Englert referred to at page 499 is where Dr. Heath is being a asked a question of whether would you expect death to occur when three grams are administered but he is being asked a series of questions about administration in a surgical procedure which are using ventilators and other procedures to keep the person alive and he said in that setting the answer is no so that's just not a fair representation of the record at all now with respect to the question of whether we ought to analogize this to the deliberate indifference standard and convictions of confinement cases it seems to me there is a fundamental difference here which is that the Commonwealth of Kentucky is making a deliberate choice here.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A deliberate choice here to use chemicals that create this danger and given that it has done so it ought to have the commensurate obligation to take the reasonable steps necessary to on vote the risk.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether Petitioner Montejo should be denied the Sixth Amendment protections of Michigan v. Jackson because he silently acquiesced in the appointment of counsel at his initial hearing, rather than affirmatively accepting the appointment. The Louisiana Supreme Court believed that an affirmative acceptance was required to trigger Jackson and therefore upheld the admission of a confession elicited during police-initiated interrogation after Montejo's Sixth Amendment right had attached and after a lawyer had been appointed to represent him. If Jackson applies, that confession should not have been admitted, and Jackson should apply because nothing in this Court's precedents or, frankly, in common sense supports a rule that affords less Sixth Amendment protection to defendants who are automatically appointed counsel at initial hearings than to defendants who are appointed counsel after a request for counsel has - -",
  "Well, I don't -- without taking up at the moment the question whether Jackson was extravagant, it does seem to me, Your Honor, that your question does get to the heart of the matter. In a situation like Jackson, the defendant requested counsel and that was deemed to be an election of the right to rely on counsel, not merely at the initial hearing but for all purposes.",
  "And the question here, it seems to me, Your Honor, is what does one do when a defendant is automatically appointed counsel? There are two options: One is to treat that defendant as having elected the right to rely on counsel, and - -",
  "And the other option is to deem that the defendant has decided to go it alone. Those are the two possibilities here, and it seems to me that - -",
  "I think the problem, Mr. Chief Justice, is that in the -- it is an either/or choice because, if you -- if the defendant is deemed to have elected to rely on counsel on the basis of the appointment, then the police may not initiate interrogation. It's only if the defendant - -",
  "Well, I don't think so. I think if the police initiate interrogation after a lawyer has been automatically appointed, then that interrogation either has to be deemed to be in violation of the rule of Jackson or not, and that seems to me to depend on how you characterize what happens in the course of an automatic appointment. If you - -",
  "That's absolutely the critical point, Justice Ginsburg. This is a limited rule, and the free choice of the defendant to initiate a conversation with the authorities is always present. The question is, what do we do in an automatic appointment situation? And this is a significant question because -- and I would refer the Court to the appendix, to the amicus brief of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, which I think is a helpful reference here. It goes through each State, and what it shows is that approximately half the States have procedures in which, as a matter of course, the defendant is asked at the hearing whether he or she wants counsel, and if the defendant says yes, then we're in a Jackson situation.",
  "Yes, if he initiates. Initiation is the key. Initiation - -",
  "I don't think so, Justice Kennedy. A couple things. First of all, it seems to me that to reach that conclusion that the Court really would have to overrule what is a key holding in Jackson, and I don't think that that would be appropriate to do in this case for a whole host of reasons.",
  "Yes. It depends on initiation. It depends on who initiates.",
  "If the defendant - -",
  "Well, if the -- if the defendant initiates, then the defendant is -- then the bar of Jackson doesn't apply. That's the rule, but the --",
  "I don't -- apart from the question of whether you can reach that result without overruling the core holding of Jackson here, it does seem to me, with all due respect, we don't agree with that because, on the one hand, we do think that free choice is preserved in the existing regime and, on the other, hand we don't think Miranda can give you all the protection you need. And I think a good illustration of that is this Court's decision in the Moran case. Now, recall in Moran, that was an interrogation that occurred before the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights had attached, and the -- and the police -- and the defendant had a lawyer in that case. His sister had hired a lawyer for him. The lawyer was trying to reach him. The police kept him away, kept the lawyer away from the defendant. The Court held that, in the Fifth Amendment context, because the Sixth Amendment right had not attached, that the Miranda warnings sufficed to guarantee the reliability of the confession. But the Court was very quick to point out, and then reiterated this again in Patterson, that in the Sixth Amendment context that would be a violation because it's an interference with the relationship between the defendant and his lawyer, and the ability of the defendant to rely on the lawyer. And that's the key.",
  "Well, what the -- we're applying -- the question here is whether defendants in this category, the category that Mr. Montejo is in, automatic appointment, are entitled to the same Sixth Amendment protection as defendants who are in the category of -- who are brought to trial in States where they -- you have this colloquy as part of the initial hearing where the defendant is asked.",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, two things, Your Honor. First, it seems to me that what the dispute here is is whether there is a principled basis for treating these two categories of defendants differently, the defendants who are brought to hearings in States where the procedures require that they be asked and defendants who are brought to hearing in States where they are automatically appointed counsel without a showing of indigency -- upon a showing of indigency. And I don't -- I think with respect to the question of practical problems going forward, sure, if all States -- if the States in that second category were to conform their practices such that the defendants were asked and had the opportunity to say yes, indeed, I want counsel, then I suppose the problem would be solved. But you really get to the same place by holding, as we submit the Court really should hold, that when -- when you have an automatic appointment, unless there is some reason to think the defendant is rejecting it, that Jackson kicks in and that - -",
  "Sure. I think it's quite clear that the rule of Michigan against Jackson applies, and that's because - -",
  "Well, from cases applying it, because in that situation the person is deemed to assert the right to counsel by hiring a lawyer, just as by asking, and the question here is when you have an automatic appointment why should you treat that category of defendants any differently for purposes of applying the Jackson rule?",
  "And that's the whole problem here, Justice Ginsburg. All we have is a one-page minute order which reflects that counsel was appointed. It doesn't reflect anything about a colloquy because in the normal course there's not -- there's no occasion for the colloquy. You come in, you get your lawyer, a decision about bail is made, and you move on, and the next person comes in and that happens.",
  "The Office of Indigent Counsel is appointed to represents you.",
  "Right. The way the process works is -- it's not in the record, but the way the process works in this judicial district is there is a legal assistant there who takes the names of people who need lawyers and then immediately -- and the public defender service in this district is a contract service. They're private attorneys who contract out to do it. And then the legal assistant immediately calls, tells the lawyers, well, here is who you are representing. Now, in a case like this one, which is a capital case, there was of course a great sense of urgency. There are only two lawyers in this district who are qualified to represent capital defendants. They got called immediately. Recall what happened here was that this hearing took place in the morning and Mr. Montejo gets taken back to the jail and very soon after he arrives he gets checked back out by these officers again and taken out in the squad car where he is kept for six hours, and in the meantime essentially while he's going out the back door, while he's being taken out the back door with the police, his lawyer is coming in the front door and raising holy heck about the fact that his client's not - -",
  "If the police initiated the interrogation, yes, because I think it gets to the heart of the - -",
  "I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. If the defendant initiated the conversation - -",
  "If the police initiated the interrogation, it's a violation.",
  "No, I think that in that situation the defendant has initiated and then you've got the kind of free choice that the law respects, and that's where the line is drawn here. But that is - -",
  "It's at the outset.",
  "At the outset, it seems to me. He has initiated. He exercises free choice.",
  "No, it isn't what happened here at all. In fact, it seems to me the opposite, the opposite thing happened here. For one thing, as a factual matter he was told by the police on September 10th that he didn't have a lawyer, despite the fact that one had been appointed for him in the morning. That was his testimony. Now, I recognize that there is a factual issue here that is not resolved, but the Louisiana Supreme Court did not discredit that testimony. It acknowledged it. What it said was -- and I think this points up, Justice Kennedy, what the problem is with relying solely on Miranda -- that even in that situation, even if it's true that the police officers told him on September 10th that he did not have a lawyer, that that wouldn't rise to the level of a problem that would cause a Fifth Amendment issue under Miranda because of the facts of Moran. And it seems to me that's exactly the problem there, that that means in fact, if we apply Moran that way, that the police could deliberately tell him incorrectly that he didn't have a lawyer when he did.",
  "Well, I don't -- well, Moran says no.",
  "Well, Moran says that a Miranda waiver is valid despite that kind of deception. That's the problem here, it seems to me. It does get to the difference. In the Fifth Amendment context, the right to have a lawyer there is a prophylactic protection against a coerced self-incrimination in the setting of custodial interrogation.",
  "Well, I think it would be hard, given Moran, to say that there was. And that points up the problem. The essence of this right is the right to rely on the assistance of counsel at critical stages and interrogation is a critical stage.",
  "Well, I think that's a bit complicated, Justice Stevens.",
  "But here's my best way to work through the facts. Detective Hall, the only officer who testified, testified that he was not aware. The State court credited that and we don't take issue with it. The problem is that this is a police precinct that has, I don't know, maybe 10, 12 officers in it. They have a capital murder suspect in there. He was taken by the police to the hearing. The police were present at the hearing that morning. He was taken back - -",
  "Well, I think -- I think under Jackson, Justice Stevens, they are charged with the knowledge. And I think it's important that they have to be charged with the knowledge, because otherwise there is all kinds of room for manipulation and deception. And I do think that's a big part of the problem here, that -- and I also think it's important to point out as a factual matter the one detective who did testify, Detective Hall, testified very carefully. He testified that he asked the defendant when he went to see him whether he had been contacted by counsel or whether his family had gotten him a lawyer, and of course neither of those things was true. He was indigent, his family hadn't gotten him a lawyer, and he hadn't yet been contacted by counsel. He didn't ask him: Did you have a lawyer appointed for you?",
  "I think it ought not be reexamined here, Justice Alito, for several reasons. One, the Respondent has not asked for it. Two, there's a special justification that has to be shown to overrule it, as Dickerson says, in the Miranda context, and this is quite parallel.",
  "I think it's quite important that the Court do so, and there was a strong consensus in Dickerson that the Court do so. I think there's a real problem. This is not something that should be done lightly based on four pages of discussion in one amicus brief. There's a very sharp dividing line in the law between the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment here, and it applies in numerous areas. It's true, for example, with respect to lineups. You can have an uncounseled lineup before the Sixth Amendment right attaches, you can't after. You can have an uncounseled psychiatric examination before it attaches, you can't after. You can engage in surreptitious interrogation of a suspect before the Fifth Amendment -- before the Sixth Amendment right attaches; you can't after. Certain kinds of arraignments have to be done in the presence of counsel. So it seems to me you would be destabilizing a whole significant area of law without very much consideration here were you to say that in this context we're going to just say that the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment operate in an equivalent manner.",
  "You would be overruling Jackson in that regard.",
  "And in a case in which it seems to me manifestly not appropriate to do so, given the lack of consideration given to this by the Respondent - -",
  "And -- well, this is serious business. You are going to overrule a precedent that's been in place for more than 20 years, that provides a very clear bright-line rule for the police to -- to manage their affairs with not the slightest showing that this rule is presenting any practical problems in its administration out there in the field. Nobody has even argued that.",
  "That is absolutely correct, Justice Souter. The text of the Sixth Amendment provides that the -- the accused shall have the right to the assistance of counsel. The essence of the right is the right to rely on the lawyer at critical stages of the proceeding. And what Jackson says is that that right deserves a very significant measure of protection, and we are going to assume that once a defendant asserts it, the defendant wants the -- wants the assistance of counsel through every critical stage of the proceeding.",
  "Well, I think -- I think the facts of this case make it quite clear that it's a very serious risk. Here you have a situation in which a defendant who, after all, even before his right attached has been subjected to very, very aggressive tactics that the Louisiana Supreme Court recognized presented even a close case even -- even under the Fifth Amendment. Then he -- he finally has a 72-hour hearing. He gets a lawyer appointed. As soon as he gets back, they take him out in a squad car for six or seven hours, at the end of which he produces a -- an apology-letter confession written on a pad with a pen given to him by the police officers and - -",
  "No, you have -- what you have is a right to rely on the assistance of your lawyer, and you have -- and -- and it's critical. A good example of why it's critical - -",
  "But Jackson drew a clear line. It did so because -- and the Court has said -- it was a -- a prophylactic rule, but it's a prophylactic rule that represents -- reflects the centrality of -- of the - -",
  "-- criminal process.",
  "Well, I think two -- two points on that, Mr. Chief Justice: First, I think it would actually break new ground for this Court to hold that the defendant who has a lawyer isn't entitled to the protection of Jackson. This Court has never held that. And every time it has addressed the issue, it said the opposite. Admittedly in dictum, but in Patterson and Moran it said the opposite. So that is what is really breaking new ground, it seems to me. And second, the only way to treat these two categories of people differently is to come up with a principled distinction for why the right should apply differently to one than the other, and I submit that none has been offered. I would like to reserve the balance of my time. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A couple points of clarification, if I might: Counsel for Respondent has made the suggestion that the only facts that are before you are the facts that were in the suppression hearing, rather than the facts that were subsequently adduced at trial when Mr. Montejo testified that he told them he didn't want to go with them and he thought he had a lawyer and was told he didn't. That's not correct as a matter of Louisiana law. The citation there is State v. Green, 655 Southern 2d 272, where it's quite clear as a matter of Louisiana law that the supreme court evaluates the entire record. It's not clear as a matter of federal law. That was one of the holdings of Arizona against Fulminante. Now, we cited that case for harmless error purposes, not this purpose, but - -",
  "-- but quite clear - -",
  "Yes. We don't contest that, Justice Ginsburg. Of course, it wasn't used for impeachment purposes; it was used in fact as substantive evidence, and there was no limiting instruction to let the jury know that it could only be considered for that limited purpose. And I don't think that suffices even remotely to overcome the harmless error problem here. The second point of clarification, it does seem to me clear, both from pages 14 and 15 of Respondent's brief and Respondent's argument here today and in particular the citation to the Montoya case in the Fifth Circuit, they are not advocating a request rule; they are advocating a request or assertion rule. In fact, the very passage in Montoya to which Respondent's counsel adverts -- it says there doesn't have to be a request so long as there is an assertion. And that's the principle they're advocating. It just doesn't make any sense as a sensible dividing line between categories of defendants who are protected by Jackson and those who aren't for the reasons that we have discussed.",
  "Well, it would come - -",
  "Well, if it's introduced in the case in chief, it's substantive evidence on which the prosecution relied or can rely to establish the case. It's very much like Fulminante in that regard. There were two confessions, one admissible, the other inadmissible. And it was the self-reinforcing character of the two that made it not a harmless error for Fulminante. We really have the same thing. But, if I could, I would like to get back, Justice Kennedy, to the Moran case. I do think, with all due respect, there was an element of deception in Moran that was sanctioned as consistent with Miranda. Two things happened there: The police informed Moran's lawyer that they -- incorrectly, falsely -- that they weren't going to interrogate him, but they also failed to inform Moran that he had a lawyer, and the lawyer was standing out there. And that's fully as much of a deception as telling somebody he doesn't have a lawyer when he does, or withholding information that made a big difference for Sixth Amendment purposes, which is why the Court in Moran drew that line very sharply and said, for Fifth Amendment purposes, the Sixth Amendment right hasn't attached, there isn't an interference with the attorney-client relationship, but the very same thing would be forbidden under the Sixth Amendment. And Patterson says exactly the same thing. In Patterson, again -- just to conclude, Justice Breyer -- drew the line exactly where Your Honor's hypothetical drew it. What Patterson says is that, if a defendant does not have a lawyer, we operate one way; when a defendant has a lawyer, a different set of rules kick in. And then, it says, indeed the different rules kick in even if a defendant requests a lawyer, making clear that the point of extending to request was to put defendants who have asked for lawyers but don't have them yet in the same position as defendants who have lawyers, not to give them a superior Sixth Amendment protection. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by picking up on a point that my friend made in response to Justice Ginsburg suggesting that with respect to foreign works what Congress has done is set the copyright term at zero. I don't really think that's a fair description of the situation, and it obscures what Section 514 actually does and what Congress is all about here. Since 1891, Congress has concluded as a matter of copyright law that foreign works are entitled to the same protection as domestic works. The problem with respect to the authors that section 514 covers is not that Congress set the copyright limit at zero; is that as a matter of foreign relations, we did not have treaties with these individual countries. And what 514 does is remedy that problem. What 514 says is, with respect to a defined set of foreign authors, they get the remainder of the copyright term that they would otherwise have gotten, and nothing more, had they lived in countries where we had -- with which we had copyright relations at the time they published, or had they complied with the formalities that we used to enforce but no longer do to perfect and renew copyrights. That's what it does. It doesn't grant anybody a perpetual term. It does not renew a copyright term that has run its full course and create a new one. It rectifies that problem which doesn't -- doesn't reflect anything about a congressional judgment setting the copyright term at zero for foreign works.",
  "We think that the -- there isn't an ironclad limit that can be derived from the text of the Copyright Clause or from history that would say that Congress is forbidden in any circumstance from doing that. We do think that there are significant limits in the text of the Copyright Clause that would restrict any ability Congress might have to do that. But one thing I think is important here is that section 514 is not a statute in which Congress did that, and we'd respectfully suggest that any assessment by this Court of whether Congress had that power should await a concrete context in which Congress exercises it, if it ever does.",
  "Excuse me, Justice Sotomayor.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, one limit I think is a quite important one is that the Copyright Clause says that you can only grant copyright in authors, to authors. And as a work gets older and older when you're talking about Shakespeare and Ben Johnson, there really at that point isn't an author in which you could vest the copyright. And creating any copyright for a long-expired work like that would really, I think, raise the problem that the Framers were addressing by restricting copyright to authors, which -- which was to avoid the creation of patronage monopolies in which publishers who weren't the authors could claim the exclusive rights of copyright.",
  "Yes, it does.",
  "Well, because they --",
  "No, but --",
  "What 514 does, Justice Alito, is provide copyright protection to works of foreign authors whose works still have copyright protection in their own country, whether they're dead or alive. So long as the work has protection in the country, then 514 provides copyright protection. And the reason it does so is to ensure our compliance with the Berne Convention. And so, the why here is very important and, I think, provides the answer to Justice Scalia's question about how 514 contributes to the progress of arts and sciences. What 514 does -- 514 is, in essence, the price of admission to the international system. We decided, the policymaking branches of our government, the executive and the Congress, decided that we needed to be -- and it was in the national interest -- to be part of the international copyright system and to join the Berne Convention to accomplish that. The reason we did so was because our intellectual property is subject to very serious levels of piracy in many foreign countries because of under-enforcement. By joining Berne, what we did was commit ourselves to the international standards. And by enacting Section 514 to implement the Uruguay Round Agreements in 1994, what we did was say to the world that we are going to ensure compliance in this country.",
  "We completely --",
  "We completely agreement with that, Justice Scalia.",
  "There's no textual limit in the Copyright Clause that would preclude Congress from enacting this statute. The Petitioners have also raised the First Amendment argument. We don't think First Amendment scrutiny applies here. To the extent it did, the why would matter there, and there's definitely a substantial interest on the part of Congress in -- in ensuring compliance with Berne and getting protection for our works in Berne. Now, in Eldred, the Court did say, I think quite clearly, that there is no requirement under the Copyright Clause that a new financial benefit granted to an existing -- that a new financial benefit cannot be granted to an existing work --",
  "I disagree.",
  "Because it creates additional incentives for authors today and going forward, because they know that there's a much greater likelihood that whatever intellectual property they create will be better protected in foreign countries as a result of our joining the Berne Convention.",
  "Well, but --",
  "But we can't -- we can't get the protections of Berne -- Berne is not a menu --",
  "-- in which we get to choose options.",
  "Right, but --",
  "But --",
  "But there's another way of looking at that, Justice Breyer, of course, which is that the -- but for the fact that these individual authors lived in countries that didn't have copyright relations with the United States, they would have the protection of our copyright law, and they would have the term of copyright --",
  "And there is no textual limit in the Copyright Clause that says that Congress cannot provide the same limited term to those categories of works that it provides to other works. There just is no textual limit.",
  "And -- yes.",
  "Yes, there is. First, with respect to section 514, it's part and parcel of joining Berne, and Berne gives protection not only to the previously created works but to newly created works, and it creates additional economic incentives in foreign -- by assuring better protection in foreign countries for newly created works. So, it creates many, many more than one new work. And I think it's also quite reasonable, Justice Breyer, to read the incentive structure here in a way parallel to the way the Court did in Eldred, which is to say that, just as in Eldred the Court assumed that there was an implicit guarantee to an author making a creation that that author would get the benefit not only of the existing term of copyright but any extension, I think here, with respect to American authors, it's an implicit guarantee that they get the benefit not only of the foreign protection in existence at the time but any expansion of foreign protection through adjoining treaties, and article 8 -- and section 514 implementing article 18 of Berne is the price of admission to that treaty --",
  "I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, and I do think -- for a host of reasons. One is I think that it's -- it's just not so simple, and I think the question that I think Your Honor asked my friend was what about when Congress expands the scope of exclusive rights for existing works? Well, Congress has done that many, many times, and musical composition is a really good example of that. In 1831, Congress created exclusive right in the publishing and vending of musical compositions, but not in their public performance. So, from 1831 on, once I bought the sheet music, the public performance was, to borrow the Petitioners' way of thinking, in the public domain. You could do it any time you wanted without having to get --",
  "-- a license to pay any money. But --",
  "But then, in 1897, Congress granted an exclusive right in the public performance of musical compositions --",
  "-- and made it applicable to all existing copyrights. And so --",
  "Well, that they've done it many times before, and it's a process -- I think it reflects -- and -- and the point is that no one has thought with respect to any of those significant adjustments of the boundaries, that it was an occasion for First Amendment scrutiny. And I think that's because of the wisdom of the Court's opinion in Eldred, that these are --",
  "I think -- because I think there is -- once the Court gets into the business of First Amendment analysis, there's no stopping point, because all of the adjustments of the boundaries could have the same kind of effect, I think, as the musical composition example shows.",
  "What copyright does, by definition, is provide exclusive rights in expression; and so, if the First Amendment is triggered whenever copyright provides exclusive rights in expression that it didn't used to provide, then heightened scrutiny will apply any time Congress exercises its copyright power. And what the Court said in Eldred --",
  "Well, of course, under section 514, they're not out of luck because it has significant protections and accommodations for derivative works. The question of whether there should be heightened First Amendment scrutiny, we think, Eldred answers, that -- that the First -- the Copyright Clause already contains very significant accommodations of First Amendment interests, the idea/expression dichotomy, fair use. And -- and that is going to provide -- maybe -- maybe Jimi Hendrix could claim fair use in that situation. And those are at the core of the traditional contours of copyright. So, if Congress were to try to extinguish fair use, I'd say yes, we'd have a First Amendment issue there. If Congress were to try to provide exclusive right in the ideas that are expressed, as opposed to the expression itself, yes, we'd have a First Amendment issue there. If Congress were to, say, use the copyright power to engage in viewpoint discrimination --",
  "We don't think it would have any problem passing intermediate scrutiny, but we don't think --",
  "-- intermediate scrutiny ought to apply, Justice Kennedy.",
  "No. We don't say it doesn't apply, but Eldred --",
  "Yes. And what Eldred said, as I read it, Justice Kennedy, is that unless Congress alters their traditional contours of copyright, then rational basis scrutiny, rather than any heightened form of First Amendment scrutiny, applies.",
  "I think it is going to tip the balance, Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- I -- the reason Congress enacted section 514, at the urging of executive branch officials who were charged with trying to ensure that we could integrate ourselves into the international system of copyright protection, was that if we didn't have this provision, then we were not going to be taken seriously; our works were not going to be protected in these foreign countries; and that it would defeat the purpose of joining Berne in the first place.",
  "So, two points: First, with respect to the interest in what foreign countries will do, I think it's incorrect to assume that this will be tit-for-tat, that if we don't enforce article 18, the only thing other countries won't do is enforce article 18 with respect to our works, as opposed to believing that we're not an -- an effective partner and not enforcing their copyright laws for the whole corpus of our works. Second, Justice Breyer, that problem that you identified just exists as a feature of copyright law. Copyright law exists for a certain time. With respect to those works, it's going to create that issue. The problem here is just the result of a fortuity that those works might have been published in a country that at the time they were published didn't have copyright relations with the United States. And what section 514 does is address that fortuity by putting those authors in the same position they would have been in had their country had copyright relations with the United States. And so, I don't think that's a principled objection on a constitutional basis to section 514 --",
  "Well, it doesn't make it millions of times worse. It applies to a small number of -- but a significant number of countries --",
  "No, we don't -- we don't have any reason to doubt the -- the aggregate number.",
  "Well, with respect to reliance parties, that's certainly true. They would have to give notice. It is the case, Justice Ginsburg, that if you're not a reliance party, then there would be an infringement even without notice. So, I do think there's something to that point. But, again, I just think that's a result of the fortuity of the countries not having copyright relations with the United States. It's not about the -- it's not anything integral as a matter of constitutional principle of the statute, and --",
  "I -- I don't think it had to --",
  "I don't think it had to take --",
  "Yes. I don't think that they had -- I don't think there is an act of infringement by having a library book on the shelf, and, of course, there are protections for libraries built into the Copyright Act in all events. And I do -- if I could in my remaining time, I want to go back to the history that we started with, because I do think it is important that there is no -- as a matter of text, I think it's clear -- there is no unyielding requirement that you cannot restore copyright to works in the public domain. I think the history really does bear that out. I think Justice Sotomayor had the history exactly right, that in 1790, you had three States with no copyright statutes. Of the 10 States with copyright statutes, you had 7 that did not provide copyright to maps and charts, which the Federal statute did. And I think this is the key point: Of the States that did enact copyright statutes to -- in the 1780s, in advance of the 1790 Federal Act, at least four, and depending on how you counted, as many as eight provided copyright protection only to works printed after the date of the State statute. They did that at the urging of the Continental Congress in 1783. So, I don't think there's any doubt that when Congress enacted the Copyright Act in 1790, it made a conscious choice to take a different approach, to grant copyright protection to existing works, including many, many, many works that were freely available for exploitation in those States --",
  "I think -- I don't think so, Justice Alito. I think they could have followed the model nationally of prospective copyright only and extinguishing the prior copyright --",
  "-- and -- but they didn't make that choice. They made a different choice. Now, my friend suggests that the 1790 Act was just a transition. But, of course, the same thing is really true in an important sense of section 514. It's part of a tradition -- of a transition of the United States into the international system, which has required an adjustment of our rules in order to bring us into conformity with the international system. And beyond the example, of course, of the 1790 -- and by the way, with respect to that language in the 1790 copyright -- who hath or hath not have copyright -- that's just a rerun of an argument that the Court rejected in Wheaton v. Peters. In Wheaton, the Court said that that language in the 1790 Act was referring to pre-publication common law copyright, not post-publication common law copyright. Beyond that, it seems to me pretty clear that what that language was referring to -- of course, Congress presupposed the existence of copyrights. There were all these State statutes that created some copyrights. But what Congress did was act far more broadly. And -- so, I do think -- and then when one looks at the examples of patents -- and I think the Oliver Evans example and that case is an important example. Early in our history, Congress creates a new patent term to an expired patent. President Jefferson signs it. Secretary of State Madison issues it. Chief Justice Marshall upholds it as a circuit justice, and the Court upholds it against a charge that it's impermissibly burdening people who act in reliance on the expiration of the prior patent. There wasn't a word in this Court's decision in that case about any potential constitutional infirmity with doing that. And one would think if this was such a significant and viable principle of constitutional law, that someone would have brought it up in those cases. In fact, the striking thing about reading the Evans decision is that the Court clearly looks at this all as a matter of legislative policy judgment. It says, you know, yes, you're right, it might have been an argument, a good argument in favor of creating some reliance interest here, but that's a judgment Congress should have made if anybody was going to make it. It didn't -- and there is no reading of the -- there's no required reading of that statute that has to protect the reliance party. So, I don't -- I just think when you look at the patent protection, when you look at the 1790 Act, when you consider the fact that when Congress expands exclusive rights, as it did for example with respect to musical compositions but did in the 1976 Act with respect to lots of exclusive rights, it does so with existing copyrights. And all of that points up the wisdom of what this court said in Eldred, that within very wide margins, these are matters for legislative choice. These are policy calls that require the balancing of a complex set of interests, the drawing of a complex set of lines made even more complex by virtue of the fact that we are now trying to make a transition into full participation in an international system, which is of vital importance to protecting one of our most valuable economic exports, intellectual property. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The executive has determined that the passports it issues should not identify Israel as the place of birth for persons born in Jerusalem. Petitioner seeks relief under section 214(d) that would countermand that executive judgment. But under the Constitution, that is an exercise of the executive's exclusive recognition power. The Constitution commits that power exclusively to the executive, and neither a court nor the Congress can override that judgment.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, if I might spend a minute or two on that history, because I don't think it shows what my friend suggests that it does. Before getting to the starting point of that story, which I think is the Monroe administration, I would like to point out that in the Washington administration, the President confronted the question with respect to whether to recognize the revolutionary government of France. And President Washington consulted with his cabinet, and, of course, his cabinet included Jefferson and Madison and Hamilton and Jay. And they decided that this was a power that was exclusive to the President to such an extent that they didn't even need to send a message to the Congress that they were going to recognize the new revolutionary government in France. Now, the second fact that I think is critical as a matter of history is that there is not a single piece of legislation that has passed both houses of Congress and come to the President purporting to recognize a foreign nation or a territorial boundary of a foreign nation.",
  "I don't -- I can't think of an instance of Congress's sustained objection. I think probably the closest we would come is the revolutionary government of Mexico, which President Wilson first recognized on a de facto basis in 1915 and a de jure basis in 1917. Congress indicated displeasure with that. President Wilson sent his message to Congress saying that this is an exclusive executive function. Congress backed down.",
  "Yes. Yes, I will answer that question directly.",
  "It is true that the Court has never before, with respect to the recognition power, confronted the question of whether the President is free to act in a manner different than a congressional command because Congress has never purported to issue a command. That does not mean, however, that my friend is correct that this is a situation in which Congress has the authority to countermand or direct the decision of the President. This is, we submit -- even if one thinks about this as a Youngstown category three case, this is a Youngstown category three case of the kind that Justice Jackson identified in footnote 4, where he cited Myers v. The United States. The kind of case in category three of Youngstown, in which the President's judgment can prevail even over a contrary judgment of Congress, is a case in which the President has exclusive authority.",
  "And that is this case.",
  "Well, let me -­",
  "Yes.",
  "So, I do think, if I could -- I think it would be helpful in answering your question, Justice Breyer, if I could return to the Chief Justice's question about history. Moving beyond that initial recognition by Washington that this is an exclusive power, which I think is quite significant, when we get to the Monroe administration, there is a fight between Clay and Monroe about whether the President has exclusive authority to recognize the new South American republics. Now, a couple of points there. I think the -- what -- the only thing that one could point to as an action by the Congress that even implicates the recognition power is one house of Congress passed an appropriations measure for an ambassador. What the -­ the history treatise, the Goebel treatise that my friend cites, says on page 133, the very page that he cites in his reply brief, is that Clay's effort to contest the President's exclusive authority came to a, quote, \"inglorious end,\" unquote. He then goes on to say -- my friend goes on to say, well, but a year later when President Monroe sought to actually recognize these South American republics, he asked -- he asked the Congress to join him in it. What he asked Congress for was an appropriation for an ambassador. But it was not the sending of an ambassador to the Republic of Colombia that was the recognition. It was when President Monroe received an ambassador from Colombia that constituted the recognition, and that was an exclusive act that he undertook without any consultation with Congress. Now -­",
  "I'd like to address Texas because I do think that's probably the most significant example that my friend's identified. But even there, I think if one works through the history, we'll see that it's an exclusive executive power. President Jackson, in his first letter in 1836 to the Congress, says essentially: I hear you; you think we should recognize Texas. And then he says: It's an open question as far as I am concerned whether there's exclusive authority or not. It's not been something that the legislature has ever studied, but as a matter of expediency, he says, we don't need to resolve that question, because I want to work with you. He then goes on to caution the Congress to not move too quickly for fear of precipitating war with Mexico, which I think, Justice Breyer, I'll try to return to a functional analysis later, and that's, I think, an important point. What -- then -- but I think what's important, Justice Ginsburg, is that what Congress did next was to pass two appropriations measures, one in the House, one in the Senate. Each of those measures appropriates funds for an emissary to the Republic of Texas, but each includes language that says: At such time that the President determines that it's appropriate to do so. If one looks at the page in the Congressional Globe that my friend cites, one will see that that language was added because, as originally introduced, the appropriations riders were objected to by members of Congress on the ground that they infringed on the President's exclusive recognition authority.",

This position was arrived at after very careful thought, and it is enforced very carefully.

Of course, Congress can't act with the dispatch needed in a situation like the recognition of Israel. But the -- but apart from that, recognition -- a recognition that occurs too soon could send events in a direction that could be very disadvantageous to our foreign policy. A recognition that comes too late could -- could squander an important opportunity in the national interest in the foreign policy realm.",
  "So -- here's our position on that, Justice Kagan: We do think that the Reception Clause is the source of the recognition power. Hamilton identified it as the source of the recognition power in the Washington administration. I think it's now understood that it's hornbook law that that's the textual source, but to the extent that -­",
  "But -­",
  "It is there.",
  "And in addition -- I would say in addition, to the extent there is a question, we do think, as I think we indicated in our brief, that -­ that one can see this power as part of what the Court in Garamendi described as the vast share of responsibility that the Constitution assigns to the executive. Now, we don't think all of that shared responsibility is exclusive to the executive, but we think this responsibility is exclusive.",
  "If the Reception Clause were not in the Constitution, but we had the same history that we have now and the same functional considerations about the need for it being in the control of the executive, yes, we would.",
  "The -- I think that there would be a difference between -- I -- I think that -­ that Congress has authority over appropriations. Congress has authority to appoint ambassadors. It's entitled to exercise that authority, and it's entitled to exercise that authority even if it's in tension with the President's recognition decision. It is the position of the executive, though, that there could be circumstances in which Congress could try to exercise its appropriations authority in a way that would preclude the executive from exercising its -- its recognition power, and that -- the executive would in some circumstances believe that it had the authority to move ahead despite those actions by Congress. But, of course, this is not a situation in which Congress has passed a sense of the Congress resolution about what it thinks. It's not a situation in which Congress has exercised attaching conditions to its spending power about what private parties do. This is an effort by Congress to regulate the content of a passport, which, as the Court recognized in Haig v. Agee, is a core instrument of diplomatic communication.",
  "We -­",
  "We don't think that the entire content of passports is an exclusive power. I would -- and I'll explain, Justice Alito, where we think the line is. But before doing so, I do want to push back a little bit on the notion that Congress has for a long time exercised authority over the content of passports. The first Passport Act was in 1856. What this Court said in Haig v. Agee was that the enactment of that statute merely confirmed a power that everyone understood to be inherent in the executive. That statute did not purport to regulate the content of passports. It, in fact, said that passports shall be issued under such rules as the President shall proscribe. And -- and in Haig, that was that language, I think, that led the Court to conclude that this was a confirmation of the executive's authority and an action in aid of that authority. Now -­",
  "Yes. Well, we do think -­ that's what -- we think that the appropriate inquiry for political question purposes is into the relief that the Petitioner is seeking and if the relief the Petitioner is seeking would invade the kinds of judgments that the Constitution commits exclusively to the executive. And the reason it commits these kinds of judgments exclusively to the executive is because this is a situation in which multifarious voices are inimical to the national interest.",
  "Well, I -- I think in -­ in -- let me try to put it this way, Justice Ginsburg: In the absence of section 214, I think it would be clear from Pink and Belmont that this -- that the judgment on recognition is exclusively committed to the executive, and it would be a political question, if a party came in and said I want my passport to say something different about Jerusalem than it says, that -­",
  "Well, I -­",
  "I think, Justice Sotomayor, it's actually quite narrow, and the problem isn't a significant one in the case of textual commitment, because the Court does -- in reaching the conclusion, as the D.C. Circuit did, that it's a political question, the Court does have to decide whether there is a textual commitment to the executive here. So, the Court would resolve that question. The Court would resolve the question of whether the conduct at issue here is within the scope of that textual commitment. So, the Court would issue those rulings.",
  "But I -- I didn't mean to suggest it wouldn't be a textual commitment. It would be -- it would be a commitment that one would read as the historical gloss on the vesting power, which is what Garamendi said.",
  "Well, I think it's the historical gloss on the vesting power. It is -- it functions as the equivalent of the specific textual commitment. Of course, we do have the specific textual commitment here, the -­",
  "Well, as I said earlier or I tried to say, we think that the -- the analysis under the political question doctrine goes a very long way towards answering that question, Justice Scalia. We do think that this could be seen as a case like Gilligan, in which looking at the relief that the petitioner is seeking, the plaintiff is seeking, leads the Court to conclude that this -- that -- that entertaining the claim would embroil the Court in decisions that are supposed to be made by another branch; and that, in fact, I think you can understand section 214(d) as precisely that, an effort to try to draw the Court into this dispute between Congress and the executive over whether section -- over whether Jerusalem should be recognized as part of Israel.",
  "That's correct, Justice Scalia. It's not what we're asking -­",
  "Yes. That is correct.",
  "We -- we do think that the -- whether the Court is looking at it as a political question or whether the Court is looking at it as a judgment of the merits, the issue is textual commitment. This is -- there is textual commitment. This is a situation in which the country has to speak with one voice, and the executive has determined what the country should say. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Each party in this case has got a valid point. Mayo is correct that you can't get a patent by tacking a mental step onto an utterly conventional process for administering drugs and testing their effects. But that is an issue under sections 102 and 103 of the Patent Act.",
  "I think the answer, Justice Ginsburg, is that from the perspective of the United States and the PTO, it's exactly the opposite; that importing these -- taking -- as Justice Kennedy suggested, taking up the temptation to import a look into novelty and nonobviousness into the 101 inquiry is going to be very destabilizing; that 101, as Bilski said, is a threshold eligibility test, and the question is whether there is a process. Here there is a process. It's the administration of a drug that changes the body chemistry, and there's then a test to determine the extent of the change, and then there's an inference at end of the test. That's a process.",
  "No. It's not novel, and -- and it's obvious.",
  "You can't get a patent for it.",
  "But that's our -- that's our point, Mr. Chief Justice, that the -- that the right way to look at this issue is under 102 and under 103. And I think --",
  "Because --",
  "Most are pretty obvious.",
  "Well, here's -- here's --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "But our position is a little different.",
  "Your Honor, if I could -- if I could, I do think that one has to think about if -- what -- this seems like a straightforward case on these facts, but if one thinks about the principles that Mayo is advocating and applying them in a different set of circumstances, I think you'll see the problems. Take, for example, nuclear stress tests that cardiologists use. That's a process. The patient gets on a treadmill. The heart rate gets elevated. Radioactive dye gets put into the body. It allows an image to be taken of the heart with an X-ray machine. That improves treatment. Now, the transformation there is, as in this case, incidental to the process. It's not the point of the process. But I don't think anyone would suggest that that's not a patentable process, but under Mayo's test, it's not a patentable process. Similarly, I think -- I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "As a practical matter, at the PTO, Mr. Chief Justice, it doesn't make any difference, because the PTO examiner gets a patent application and answers every question, 101, 102, 103, 112, and makes a decision about all of them. So, it's not going to lead to any benefit at the PTO.",
  "Not -- not if one moves the novelty and the obviousness inquiries from 102 and 103 into 101. You've just taken --",
  "-- the complexity of 102 and 103 and moved it into 101.",
  "I think this case is a pretty good illustration, Justice Kennedy, of why that's not true. Think of -- if I may pick up on the question Justice Scalia asked my friend, think of all the trouble we're having in this case figuring out what the standard is: How much pre-emption is too much? How do you even figure out the scope of pre-emption? What you're actually doing here is multiplying a whole new set of very difficult, complex questions that you don't have to answer if --",
  "But there was no new process, Justice Kagan. There's exactly the same process that already exists, with a new inference drawn at the end, and that's why you can capture this under 102. And I do think it's important to think about it in terms of the points Mr. Shapiro is making. If this patent had involved -- instead of standard old blood tests, had involved a breakthrough new test that allowed one to measure metabolite levels in a way that could never have been done before, of course the person who invented that could get this patent, even though it would have the excluding effect that Mr. Shapiro has identified. Similarly, if the drug is a breakthrough drug and a patentable drug, any use of the drug during its patented period, including a use in a test like this, would be an infringement under 271.",
  "Well, I think that's a harder question, but there are, for example -- and I think the Court was looking at some of this in the Caraco case on Monday -- these follow-on patents with respect to pharmaceutical products, where you patent it originally for one use, and then you can later patent it when you discover a different use. And, in fact, there's an entire regulatory system set up to deal with that. So, I do think there are circumstances in which that can be patentable, yes.",
  "The existence of a pollutant in the air and its effect probably is a natural phenomenon, but the difference here is that there's a conversion of the natural body chemistry. The metabolites wouldn't be in the body but for the administration of these drugs. And I do think if one were to say that that's an unpatentable natural phenomenon -- and this is what I mean about the destabilizing risk of thinking about this as a 101 issue rather than 102 or 103 -- you're going to call into question lots and lots, thousands in fact, of medical use patents where the patent is administer a therapeutically effective dosage of this drug in order to treat this disease.",
  "Yes, Justice Breyer, but those patents are not on the composition of matter.",
  "Those are process patents.",
  "Well, but that's a use patent. That's not a composition-of-matter patent and --",
  "Yes, it's a process patent.",
  "It is a process patent, and the problem would be if one says --",
  "If one says that it's -- it's nonpatentable because all you're doing is patenting the application of a law of nature, you're invalidating all those process patents. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In its previous decision in this case, the Court observed that when a broadcast licensee takes a license for the free and exclusive use of a valuable part of the public domain, it also accepts enforceable public obligations. One of those enforceable obligations is the indecency restriction which Congress has instructed the Federal Communications Commission to enforce between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Respondents in this case have for years benefited enormously from their free and exclusive use of public spectrum. They argue, however, that neither Congress nor the commission may as a condition of their licenses require that they refrain from broadcasting indecent material when children are most likely to be in the audience.",
  "This condition is appropriate, Justice Kagan, because it has been a defining feature of the broadcast medium from its inception in the 1920s in the Radio Act and has continued to be a defining feature of this medium throughout its history. And the argument that my friends on the other side are making here is that that norm, that legally enforceable norm which has been recognized by this Court in Pacifica and has been applied since the inception of this medium, needs to be overturned now because circumstances have changed. And I would point out first, if I may, something that --",
  "Yes, that's true.",
  "That's certainly true, Justice Scalia, and I will certainly get to vagueness, if I -- if I may just continue on this line. The -- their argument is that circumstances have fundamentally changed. I want to point out at the outset something I think is significant, which is that their argument would sweep away indecency restriction with respect to radio as well as television, and they would sweep that away in the arguments they are making today without making any showing that circumstances have changed at all with respect to the ubiquity of -- or accessibility of radio. And I think if one looks at the FCC orders that this Court cited in its prior decision in this case, one will see that a lot of the most vile and lewd material really is in radio. So, I just want to put that marker down at the beginning here because I do think it is quite important. No showing has been made about radio.",
  "Yes. Pacifica itself, Justice Kennedy, was a case about a radio broadcast.",
  "And the Respondents are arguing in this case that Pacifica ought to be overruled because the circumstances that justified its rule no longer obtain. I want to put a marker in at the outset here with respect to radio, because I do think it's quite important, that they haven't made any argument that those circumstances are any different with respect to radio. It's just as ubiquitous as it was. There isn't even any argument that there's blocking technology available. And I want to make sure, given the kind of vile material that the record demonstrates has been transmitted over time on radio, that the Court focuses on the breadth of the argument that the Respondents are making here. Now, with respect to television, I do think they're making an argument that -- that television broadcasting is no longer uniquely pervasive in the way that it was before. They're not making an argument -- but that, if I may, is a very different kind of argument than one would normally get in support of a -- the suggestion that we ought to depart from stare decisis. They're not -- they're not arguing that broadcast television is any less pervasive than it was. If anything, it's probably more pervasive now. They're not arguing that the harms of that pervasiveness no longer exist. What they're arguing is that there are other media that present harms as well and that with respect -- and that because those other media also present harms, the circumstances require a change in the rule with respect to broadcasters. Now, that -- you can I think look at that in one of two ways. You could say either that's an argument that it's futile to continue to impose this restriction on broadcasters. And I think that's what Fox says at page 33 of its brief. Two points in response to that. I think a significant, if not complete, answer was in this Court's prior decision in this case in which it said that the maintenance of a safe haven is actually particularly important in the context of these changes, a broadcast safe haven. And also I do think that the idea of futility in that nature is foreign to our First Amendment jurisprudence.",
  "Let me turn to that, Justice Ginsburg. The -- two points about that: The first one is that as we read this Court's recent decision in Humanitarian Law Project, the question on the Fifth Amendment analysis of whether there is vagueness and arbitrary enforcement has to be answered by reference to the specific broadcasts at issue here. In other words, was there fair notice with respect to these specific broadcasts? And I will get to that, but I -- but let me first go directly to Your Honor's more significant question. And I think the -- the problem with looking at the case that way is that the lens is focused too narrowly in that there, actually, if you -- one broadens out the lens and looks at the wide range of decisions that the commission is making about indecency and then broadens it out even further and looks at the wide range of broadcasts that occur, actually the number of broadcasts are -- that have been identified as even raising a question of arbitrariness or inconsistency is a -- is really quite a miniscule fraction. It's even quite a miniscule fraction even with respect to broadcasts that the commission has adjudicated as indecent or not indecent. And, yes, we would concede that there is not perfect clarity in this rule. It's a context-based rule. As we read Pacifica, the Court suggested in Pacifica that a context-based rule may well be what the Constitution requires here, and that's going to result in some -- something less than absolute precision. But the -- of course, the alternative, I would assume from my friend's perspective, would be worse. The commission could have a list that said never say the following, however many words; never show broadcasting between the hours of 6:00 a.m. -- nudity between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. That would be clearer, but it would -- but, in a way, the commission here, I think by following the context-based approach that I think Pacifica suggested was required, is being -- I mean, \"punished\" is too strong a word, but it's being held against it that it's trying to make reasonable accommodations for First Amendment values. And so, I think when one looks at it both in terms of where the lenses actually ought to be focused here and the fact that the -- the alternative of perfect clarity would reach a less effective accommodation of First Amendment values, then I do think that the commission's position is quite -- quite reasonable and defensible.",
  "I do -- I agree with you, Justice Breyer, (a) that this is a complex procedural posture; (b) that the Court would have some discretion in how it approached and resolved the case. With respect to the ABC case, as I read the commission's orders, which are in the appendix to the petition, it applied the 2001 industry guidance to reach the conclusion that the ABC broadcast was indecent. And then that was -- that -- then ABC appealed that to the Second Circuit --",
  "-- as I understand it, and that the Second Circuit then found that the -- that the commission had violated the Constitution in reaching that result. It first --",
  "Right.",
  "They did on -- when it came back, Your Honor, they then -- they disposed of the Fox case with a lengthy opinion --",
  "-- and then essentially applied that analysis to the ABC case.",
  "So, I think in fairness --",
  "So, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure that I can vouch for the proposition that the arguments have all been made in front of the commission --",
  "In fairness, I do think that -- that if one reads the commission's disposition of the -- the ABC case, it is applying the 2001 guidance reaching the conclusion that the broadcast was indecent under the 2001 guidance. ABC paid the fine that it was assessed and then, as it has -- as it can do, then invoked the Hobbs Act, went to the court of appeals to challenge it. And so, I do think -- I do actually think that the issues have been considered by the agency and are before the Court. And I do agree with Your Honor, moving I think more directly to the vagueness point, that there really isn't a vagueness issue left with respect to the fleeting expletives in the -- in the Fox case because the Court said the last time the case was here that there is no problem of arbitrary punishment because there was no forfeiture or any other sanction. ABC is in a different position because they were sanctioned. And so, there is an issue with respect to the question of whether the commission's indecency standards can constitutionally be applied here and whether they're too vague. But I do think, and I do -- I would like to spend a minute on that question of whether there is vagueness as applied to the ABC broadcast. Now, the commission's standards in the 2001 guidance say that this is essentially a two-part test. First is a subject matter question: Is there a description or depiction of sexual or excretory activities or organs? And then there's a question of whether the depiction or description is patently offensive under community standards for broadcast informed by three factors: whether the expression is explicit, whether the broadcast dwells on it, and whether it's shocking or pandering or titillating. Now, ABC makes an argument with respect to this broadcast that the nudity in the \"NYPD Blue\" episode is outside of the first subject matter criteria because it didn't have fair notice that buttocks would be considered sexual organs for purposes of application of this -- of this standard. The commission said -- and this is at page 137a of the appendix to the petition -- that it's impossible to believe that they didn't think that the naked display of buttocks would bring them within -- that weren't -- didn't have fair notice that the naked display of buttocks would bring them within this rule. I'm not sure anything more needs to be said about that.",
  "I don't --",
  "With respect, Justice Kagan, I really disagree with that characterization of the situation. Moving to the second part of the analysis here, I think it's important to take a half a step back. The fact of the matter is -- and I think everybody, all of us, understand this in our experience -- that nudity on broadcast television is an exceedingly, exceedingly, rare thing at any time of the day and certainly between 6:00 a.m. and 10 p.m. It is exceedingly rare, and all of us from our experience know that. And the --",
  "Yes, that's true, Justice Ginsburg. But, again, I think that's another issue about where the lens is focused. There have been thousands and thousands and thousands of broadcasts, and the Respondents have identified four in which -- over 25 years, in which any nudity has been present.",
  "That's certainty true, Justice Scalia. And I do think, in Reno, this Court described the Carlin monologue at issue in Pacifica in the following way: It said that monologue was readily identifiable as indecent because it was a dramatic departure from the customary norms for the broadcast medium. I think the kind of nudity -- and I think if one just looks at the video here and sees it, I don’t -- I think it's hard to disagree with the proposition that that's a dramatic departure from what's the norm for broadcast television.",
  "I think it would raise serious questions. I think nudity is going to raise very serious questions, and I think --",
  "Well, I don't -- I think, Justice Ginsburg, that in a context-based approach, there's not going to be perfect clarity. We recognize that. But I do think with respect to this broadcast -- and that's the question before the Court, whether Fox -- excuse me -- whether ABC was on fair notice of whether this broadcast would bring them within the rule.",
  "Two points in response to that, Justice Kennedy: First, I think the Court's previous decision in this case goes a long way to providing an answer, that yes, it does make a difference to preserve a safe haven where, if parents want to put their kids down in front of the television set at 8:00 p.m., they know that there's a segment of what's available that -- where they're not going to have to worry about whether the kids are going to get bombarded with curse words or nudity. And then the reason --",
  "Right.",
  "Well, and that -- that does point out the problem with the -- with the V-chip. Of course, the V-chip is not new. It's been around for more than a decade, and the -- the broadcasters have tried to encourage uptake. The government has tried to encourage uptake. It hasn't taken.",
  "No, a different point. I think the -- I want to get to what I think is the fundamental point here, that whatever may be the case with respect to the ability of a viewer to differentiate whether something is a broadcast channel or a cable channel, the reality is that broadcasters are in a different position by virtue of the fact that they have a license from the government that comes with this enforceable public obligation that allows the government to create this safe haven, and that puts them in a different position.",
  "Right.",
  "Is there -- well, I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy. The V-chip works with both broadcast and -- and cable transmissions, to the extent it works. The -- what the briefs have pointed out -- and I would suggest in particular that the Court look at the brief from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which does a very thorough job in explaining the many ways in which the V-chip has proven to be a deficient technology. A lot of it goes to the inaccuracy and incompleteness of the codes, the labels that -- that the programmers put in to begin with, which have to be there in order for the V-chip to decide what gets through and what doesn't. And I would point out in this very case, for example, with respect to the -- for example, the 2003 Billboard Music Award broadcast with the Paris Hilton- Nicole Richie back and forth, one would never have known from the code affixed for the V-chip purpose that that broadcast was going to have those kinds of words in them.",
  "Well, I do think we're not there now, as we've said in our brief, but --",
  "And I do -- but that I think -- that really makes what I think is one of the most fundamental points here, is that the broadcasters want to have it both ways, right? They -- the spectrum licenses they have are worth billions and billions of dollars. Spectrum is staggeringly, staggeringly scarce, and -- and they're sitting on an enormously valuable resource which they got for free, and then they have a statutory benefit of must-carry, which gets them on cable systems automatically, and a further statutory benefit of preferred channel placement on -- on those --",
  "And -- and we certainly agree, Justice Scalia, with the point that was made in the Court's previous decision in this case, that -- for example, the words that are in the Fox broadcasts -- teachers don't use those words with students. You don't hear those words in churches or synagogues. There are many, many contexts --",
  "And I do think, if I may --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I think something this Court said in its prior decision is -- is right on the mark with respect to this issue, which is it's a question of whether it's portrayed as appropriate. And when it is -- it's one thing when your 13-year-old brother is saying it to you or some bully in the schoolyard is saying it to you. It's another when it's presented to you in this medium as an appropriate means of communication. That's true with respect to words, and it's also true with respect to nudity. If I might reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First with respect to the notion of self-restraint on the part of broadcasters, I think a little history is in order here. The commission started with the rule that came out of Pacifica. What it faced in the 1980s, with that being the outer bound of the commission's authority, was the explosion of the shock jock phenomenon, Howard Stern and Bubba the Love Sponge and the rest of it, which didn't use any of the seven words in the Carlin monologue, but which was highly vile and lewd, and it required the commission to make a judgment. Now, that was all advertising-sponsored broadcast. And so, I do think the risk of a race to the bottom is real --",
  "-- and this history is showing it.",
  "I -- well, I disagree. First, that's the lens problem again. We are talking about a tiny, tiny number of the broadcasts that occur in a month, much less a year, much less a decade. So, the idea that there's a significant First Amendment problem that encompasses a wide variety of broadcast expression I just don't think comports with the facts. Second, I do think if one looks at the corpus of decisions that the commission has made about what's indecent and what isn't, I think one can see with respect to the large majority of them, the vast majority of them, that it's clear which side of the line something fell on. Yes, there isn't perfect clarity. There are going to be some hard cases. But they really have identified what is, in the great scheme of things, a trivial number of hard cases. I don't think one can say that this is a situation like Reno in which there's effectively no standard at all. In Reno, this Court distinguished the Pacifica situation eight ways to Sunday, and I think we've identified them in our brief and those are valid. I do think there's a significant problem certain artists to be interviewed because, even though it's unscripted, there's always a risk they're going to say something they shouldn't say.",
  "But I -- a couple answers there. One is the delaying bleeping technology, Justice Ginsburg, and the other one is that there is a scienter requirement under the commission's enforcement authority here. And so, in that situation, it seems highly unlikely you would have the requisite scienter that could lead to a forfeiture.",
  "Let me spend, if I could, a minute on the \"NYPD Blue\" broadcast. The -- ABC hinges a lot on the notion, Justice Breyer, that this is a non-sexualized episode. I mean, I guess one could make up one's own mind looking at the video. The commission decided that that was -- it was essentially voyeurism. The --",
  "Thank you. The little boy walks into the room at the very end of that -- of that segment of nudity, and I do think that fully vindicates the commission's judgment with respect to the nature of that broadcast. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Military honors play a vital role in inculcating and sustaining the core values of our nation's armed forces. The military applies exacting criteria in awarding honors, and Congress has a long tradition of legislating to protect the integrity of the honors system. The Stolen Valor Act continues that tradition by prohibiting knowingly false statements that one has been awarded a military honor. It regulates a carefully limited and narrowly drawn category of calculated factual falsehoods. It advances a legitimate substantial, and, indeed, compelling governmental interest, and it chills no protected speech. This Court has recognized -­",

  "Well, Your Honor -­",
  "Well, what -- what I would say with respect to that, Your Honor, is that this Court has said in numerous contexts, numerous contexts, that the calculated factual falsehood has no First Amendment value for its own sake.",
  "I want to be -­",
  "I want to respond with precision, Justice Kennedy, that the -- I think what this Court -- and Gertz is a good example -- has done is to draw a line, and that line -- and I think it is Gertz itself that contains this Court's statement that false statements of fact have no First Amendment value. That doesn't automatically mean that a false statement of fact lacks First Amendment protection.",
  "Yes.",
  "The -- no, I'm trying to say something much narrower than that, Justice Kennedy, that, with respect to factually false statements, the government has the authority, if it can meet the \"breathing space\" principles that this Court's cases have articulated, along with the recognition that factually false statements have no intrinsic First Amendment value. Those are substantial constraints, but they are substantial constraints that are satisfied in this case because the Stolen Valor Act regulates a very narrowly drawn and specific category of calculated factual falsehood, a verifiably false claim that an individual has won a military honor, and that's information that is within you, and only punishes speech about yourself. So, it is speech that's uniquely within the knowledge of the individual speaker.",
  "Well, I do think the decorations matter, Justice Ginsburg. We -- we think that that kind of a statute would be a harder case and, under the Court's \"breathing space\" principles, closer to the line because the category is much broader, much harder to define, and it would depend on the interest.",

  "And if that's the -- and if that is the -- that's what I was trying to get to, Justice Scalia, is that -­",

  "I do -- if I could get back to Your Honor's point about the nature of the harm, it is true that in Gertz you had the particularized harm, but this Court -- the common characteristic that allowed this Court to move from defamation to false-light privacy, to intentional infliction of emotional distress in the Falwell case, then to baseless lawsuits, the sham exception in Noerr-Pennington, the sham exception under the National Labor Relations Act, the common characteristic was not an analogy to the particularized harm that existed in defamation contexts. The common characteristic that this Court's opinions identify is the calculated factual falsehood. It is true that the harm here is different. It's a -­",
  "That -- that is true. And this -- this is a case in which the -- one of the harms that justifies this statute is the misappropriation of the government-conferred honor and esteem, and that is a real harm and a significant harm. And there is also the particularized harm of the erosion of the -- of the value of the military honors confirmed -- conferred by our government; and those are particularized harms that are real.

  "Well, I think three points. First, if I could just make a general point in response to Your Honor's question. I think that one reality here is that, as I read this Court's cases, this Court has never held or even suggested in any context when the government wants to regulate a properly defined category of calculated factual falsehood, that it has to meet strict scrutiny.

And, of course, with respect to the Stolen Valor Act, the -- Congress -- Congress is building the Stolen Valor Act on a statute that Congress enacted in 1923 which prohibited the -- the wearing of medals without justification to wear the medals. And, of course, one of the reasons Congress acted in 1923 to do that was out of concern that the misappropriation of the government conferral of esteem was going to cause substantial harm. That's been on the books for the better part -­",

  "I think -­",
  "I think that would be a -- that would be a case in which under the \"breathing space\" principles that this Court applies when we're talking about calculated factual falsehood, you'd have to answer a question, which is, how much risk is there of chilling constitutionally protected speech, because when you're talking about somebody else -­",

And so, you -- it may be a more difficult case. But under the Court's \"breathing space\" principles, that's the question that one would have to answer.",
  "It could be. I think a statute seeking to regulate that, Justice Ginsburg, would have viewpoint discrimination problems of the kind that the Court identified in R.A.V., and I think also under the Court's \"breathing space\" analysis you would -- you'd have to look long and hard and have significant concerns about that kind of a -- a statement because it's so bound up with matters of ideological controversy that -- that you'd want to exercise care, but that's really quite different from what we have here. This is a pinpoint accuracy, a specific verifiable factual claim about yourself, that you've won a medal.",
  "Well, that is the position we've taken in this case, Your Honor, and the reason we've taken it is because we read the Court's precedents, Gertz and many others, Falwell v. Hustler, as saying precisely that. In fact, Falwell goes a step further and says false statements of fact are affirmatively harmful to First Amendment interests because they impede the -- the search for truth. That's -- so, our -- our position is based on the precise language of cases stretching back a half a century. Garrison said calculated falsehood is a category of speech that is no part of the expression of ideas or the search for truth, and then it cites Chaplinsky -­",

  "That's not -- well, that's not what the honors system is about. The honors system is about identifying the attributes, the essence, of what we want in our service men and women: Courage, sacrifice, love of country, willingness to put your life on the line for your comrades. And what the medals do is say to the -- to our military this is what we care about. It's what George Washington said in 1782, when he set up the honors system. It's designed to cherish -- it's designed to cherish a valorous ambition in soldiers and to encourage every species of military merit. And I -- what I think with respect to the government's interest here and why there is a harm to that interest is that the point of these medals is that it's a big deal. You get one for doing something very important after a lot of scrutiny. And for the government to say this is a really big deal and then to stand idly by when one charlatan after another makes a false claim to have won the medal does debase the value of the medal in the eyes of the soldiers. It does do that. That is the government's interest, we think that is a real and substantial interest, and it's threatened here -­",

But, of course, that's not the kind of statute that we have here. This is a targeted statute that's designed to deal with a particular harm.",
  "Well, I think -- but that's why I think the \"breathing space\" analysis requires before a statute gets upheld that it -- that it not have that kind of chilling effect.",

  "Well -­",
  "May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?",
  "Thank you. The Respondent has conceded that this statute chills nothing. That should be a sufficient answer to Your Honor's concern that, with respect to other statutes in the future, they can be evaluated to determine whether or not they impose a -- a chill that would lead as an instrumental matter to the conclusion that they ought not to be found to satisfy the First Amendment. As Respondent concedes, there is no chill here. So, this statute is constitutional. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court This case presents issues of great moment, and the Anti-Injunction Act does not bar the Court's consideration of those issues. That is so even though the Anti-Injunction Act is a jurisdictional limit that serves what this Court described in Clintwood Elkhorn as an exceedingly strong interest in protecting the financial stability of the Federal Government, and even though the minimum coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act is an exercise of Congress's taxing power as well as its commerce power. Congress has authority under the taxing power to enact a measure not labeled as a tax, and it did so when it put section 5000A into the Internal Revenue Code. But for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, the precise language Congress used is determinative. And there is no language in the Anti-Injunction Act -- excuse me -- no language in section 5000A of the Affordable Care Act or in the Internal Revenue Code generally that provides a textual instruction that - -",
  "No, Justice Alito, but the Court has held in the license tax cases that something can be a constitutional exercise of the taxing power whether or not it is called a tax. And that's because the nature of the inquiry that we will conduct tomorrow is different from the nature of the inquiry that we will conduct today. Tomorrow, the question is whether Congress has the authority under the taxing power to enact it, and the form of words doesn't have a dispositive effect on that analysis. Today, we're construing statutory text where the precise choice of words does have a dispositive effect on the analysis.",
  "Yes. I do think, Justice Sotomayor, that with respect to one of the arguments that my friend from the NFIB has made in the brief, that Bailey v. George is a significant problem because I think their argument on the constitutionality under the taxing power is essentially that the Affordable Care Act provision is the same thing as the provision that was held unconstitutional in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture.",
  "But on the same day - - right, but on the same day as Bailey v. Drexel Furniture, the Court issued Bailey v. George, which held that the Anti-Injunction Act did bar a challenge to that provision, even though the Court had concluded that it was invalid under the tax power. So -- and I think the reason for that has been -- is clear now after Williams Packing and Bob Jones, in that, in order to find that the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply to something that otherwise would be a tax that triggers it, you have to conclude essentially that there's no substantial argument that can be made in defense of it as a tax. We don't have that here. So, I don't think you can get around the Anti-Injunction Act if the Court were to read it, as the amicus suggest it should be read, on that theory, but - -",
  "No. I apologize if I'm creating any confusion about that, Justice Ginsburg. We think by far the better route here is to understand the statute as we have proposed that it be construed as not applying here. From the perspective of the United States -- and if I could, I'd like to take a minute on this -- the idea that the Anti-Injunction Act would be construed as not being a jurisdictional provision is very troubling, and we don't think it's correct. And I would, if I could, follow up on a question, Justice Ginsburg, that you asked Mr. Long in terms of the language of the Anti-Injunction Act, 7421(a), which can be found at page 16a of the appendix to our brief. I'd ask the Court to compare that to the language of the very next provision in the code, which is on the next page of our statutory appendix, 17a, which is the refund statute, which we've talked about a little bit so far this morning, 7422(a). The refund statute this Court held in Dolan was jurisdictional, and the Court in both Dolan and Brockamp held that the statute of limitations that applies to the refund statute cases is jurisdictional. The language in 7422(a) is virtually identical to the language in 7421(a) - -",
  "Right. But I - - 7421(a) - -",
  "-- and 7422(a) were the same - -",
  "And, originally, they were the same statutory provision.",
  "They were only separated out later. So, I do think that's the strongest textual indication, Justice Ginsburg, that -- that 7421(a) is jurisdictional.",
  "Yes, that is exactly our position. And the reason we don't - -",
  "There would be no reason to decide the jurisdictional issue.",
  "Justice Kennedy, I think we all want to know the answer to a lot of things in this case. But -- but I do -- but I do think that the prudent course here is to construe the statute in the manner that we read it.",
  "I think there are two problems. One is the problem that Justice Scalia identified, that if it's not jurisdictional, then courts have authority to craft equitable exceptions. And it may seem from where we stand now that that authority is or could be very, very tightly cabined. But if -- if this Court were to conclude that it isn't jurisdictional, that does empower courts to find other circumstances in which they might find it equitable to allow cases to go forward in the absence of -- despite the existence of the Anti-Injunction Act. And, second, although I certainly am not going to stand up here and disparage the attorneys for the United States in the slightest, the reality is that if this isn't jurisdictional, then it's -- the argument -- it's open to the argument that it's subject to forfeiture by a simple omission in failing to raise it in an answer. And that -- and that's a troubling prospect.",
  "That's -- that is not our assessment of the institutional interests of the United States, Justice Ginsburg. And we do think that the - - the right way to go in this case is to read the statute as not applying to the minimum coverage provision of - - of the Affordable Care Act.",
  "That's true, Mr. Chief Justice. Several points about that, though. We do agree with Mr. Long's analysis that Davis occurred in -- during a time in -- in which under the Standard Nut case, the Court had interpreted the Anti-Injunction Act as doing no more than codifying the traditional equitable principles which allowed courts discretion to conclude that in certain circumstances, a case could go forward. Williams Packing repudiated that analysis, and Bob Jones v. Simon again repudiated that analysis and said, no, we're no longer abiding by that. It is true that the Davis case has not formally been overruled, but we do think it's fundamentally inconsistent with the Court's understanding now of - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. And - -",
  "Well, in fairness, Justice Breyer, the United States did intervene in the -- in the Davis case and was a party, and so -- not as far as I'd like, I guess, is the answer.",
  "Well - -",
  "Our view here is that it is jurisdictional. Because it's jurisdictional as this Court understands jurisdiction now, it's not waivable. And, therefore, we don't think that -- that that part of the Davis decision is good law.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Kagan. First, we think -- I guess I'm repeating myself and I apologize. But we think the closest analogue is the very next provision in the United States Code, 7422(a), which this Court has held is jurisdictional, and is phrased in exactly the same way as 7421(a). In fact, as I said, they were the same provision back in the earlier days. That's the closest analogue. This isn't -- and it's actually 7422 that's a statute that says do something first. But this statute is just a flat-out command that no suit shall be maintained to restrain - -",
  "-- the assessment or collection.",
  "Well, because the -- I think the best answer to that is that there are no magic words, and that history and context matter, as the Court said in Henderson. And the history and context here is that 7422 and 7421 function together to protect an exceedingly strong interest that the Court has held with respect to 7422, sufficiently strong that it explains the jurisdictional nature of that. The same interest applies here. This isn't just a matter of do X and then you can -- and then you can come to court. It's just a fundamentally different set of interests at stake. So, we do think that that makes a big difference. And - -",
  "It is -- we do think it's very much in that nature and different from this case, Your Honor. And one way I think it's helpful to get at this is to look at the history. We've cited a string of court of appeals cases in a footnote in our opening brief, and over time, it's been very consistent that the courts of appeals have treated the Anti-Injunction Act as a jurisdictional provision. Again, if the Court agrees with our statutory construction, we don't need to reach this issue. But they have -- in fact, one of those cases, the Hansen case, the district court in that case had dismissed the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court of appeals vacated and sent it back with instructions to dismiss under 12(b)(1), which is the subject-matter jurisdiction provision. So, I do think that, to the extent this issue is before the Court, it is jurisdictional, but it doesn't need to be before the Court because of the statutory construction argument that we had offered.",
  "It's -- it's not quite out there all by itself. There are other provisions that fall outside of subchapter B of chapter 68 and, therefore, wouldn't be governed by the instruction in section 6671(a), which answers the question about the applicability of the Act for most penalties. The ones that we've identified -- I may be overlapping a little bit with Mr. Long here -- one is 26 U.S.C. 857, which imposes certain penalties in connection with the administration of real estate investment trusts. There are provisions that Mr. Long identified in his brief, sections 6038(a) through (c) of the code, which impose certain penalties with respect to reporting requirements for foreign corporations. We have, in addition, in footnote 22 at page 36 of our brief, identified three provisions that Mr. Long also identified about -- about alcohol and tobacco. Now - -",
  "Yes. That is not a correct reading of the statute, Justice Sotomayor. The only consequence that ensues is the tax penalty. And the -- we have made a representation, and it was a carefully made representation, in our brief that it is the interpretation of the agencies charged with interpreting this statute, the Treasury Department and the Department of Health and Human Services, that there is no other consequence apart from the tax penalty. And I do think, if I could talk for a couple of minutes about the argument that was discussed as to whether this can be conceived of as a suit just challenging the requirement, which is entirely stand-alone based on inferences drawn from the exemptions, I really don't think that's right. And if I could spend a minute on it, I think it's important. The exemptions in section 5000A -- it is true that there are two categories of exemptions. There are exemptions to the penalty and exemptions to the subsection (a) requirement. But the -- but I think, not only as a practical matter, but I think there's a textual indication and even as a legal matter, they are -- they both function as exceptions to the requirement. First, as a practical matter, one of those exemptions is a hardship exemption. And if the Court will just bear with me for one minute here, it's at page 11a of the appendix to our brief. It provides that a person can go to the Secretary of HHS and obtain a hardship exemption for -- which would, as a formal matter here, excuse compliance with the penalty. It seems to me to make very little sense to say that someone who has gone to an official of the United States and obtained an exemption would, nonetheless, be in the position of being a law breaker. We think another way in which you can get to the same conclusion slightly differently is by considering the provision on the prior page, 10a, which is 5000A -- 5000A(e)(3), members of Indian tribes. Members of Indian tribes are exempt only from the penalty as a formal matter under the structure of the statute here, but the reason for that is because members of Indian tribes obtain their health care through the Indian Health Service, which is a clinic-based system that doesn't involve insurance at all, and it's an entirely different system. They were taken out of this statute because they get their health care through a different system. And it doesn't make any sense to think that persons getting their health care through the Indian Health Service are violating the law because -- because exempt only from the penalty but still under a legal obligation to have insurance, when the whole point of this is that they're supposed to be in a clinic-based system.",
  "I guess what I would say about it, Your Honor, is that the way in which this statute is drafted doesn't permit the inference that my friends from the NFIB are trying to draw from it. And there is an additional textual indication of that, which one can find at page 13 of our reply brief. This is a provision that is 42 U.S.C.A. section 18022(e). This is a provision that provides for a certification that certain individuals can get. And this is the paragraph starting with the words \"Other provisions\" contains the quote. And it says, \"an individual with a 'certification' ... that the individual is exempt from the requirement under Section 5000A ... by reason of section 5000A(e)(1) of such Code,\" is entitled to a certificate that allows for enrollment in a particular program for this category of people. But you can see here, Congress is saying an exemption under 5000A(e)(1), which is the exemption from the penalty, and not the underlying requirement, is, as Congress says, an exemption from the requirement of section 5000A.",
  "That's correct. And we think that's what Congress is saying, both in the provision I just pointed to, Your Honor, and by virtue of the fact -- by virtue of the way the exemptions work. I just think that's the -- reading this in context, that is the stronger reading of the statute.",
  "I don't -- I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice. I don't think it makes it easy for the government in the future. We think this is the fairest reading of the statute, that the -- that the - - you cannot infer from the fact that someone is exempt from the penalty, that they're still under an obligation to have insurance. That's just not the fairest reading of the statute.",
  "No. Our position is that person should give the answer \"no.\"",
  "That if they don't pay the tax, they've violated a Federal law.",
  "If they've paid the tax, then they're in compliance with the law.",
  "If they pay the tax penalty - -",
  "-- they're in compliance with the law. Thank you, Justice Breyer.",
  "Right. That's right.",
  "No, I don't think so, Justice Alito, for the same reason I just gave. I think that the -- that the answer in that situation is that that person, assuming that person -- well, if that person is eligible for Medicaid, they may well not be in a situation where they're going to face any tax penalty and therefore - -",
  "Right. Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "I do think it's - -",
  "I think it's certainly fair to say that the Congress wants people in that position to sign up for Medicaid. I think that's absolutely right. And I think the statute is structured to accomplish that objective, but the reality still is that the only consequence of noncompliance is the penalty.",
  "Well, it all -- the penalty is keyed to income.",
  "And the -- it's keyed to a number of things. One is, are you making so little money that you aren't obligated to file a tax return? And if you're in that situation, you're not subject to the penalty. It's also if the cost of insurance would be more than 8 percent of your income, you're not subject to the penalty. So, there isn't necessarily a precise mapping between somebody's income level and their Medicaid eligibility at the present moment. That will depend on where things are and what the eligibility requirements are in the State.",
  "Right. As a general matter, for people below the poverty line, it's almost inconceivable that they're ever going to be subject to the penalty, and they would, after the Act's Medicaid reforms go into place, be eligible for Medicaid at that point.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's the essence of it. They called it a penalty. They didn't give any other textual instruction in the Affordable Care Act or in the Internal Revenue Code that that penalty should be treated as a tax - -",
  "-- for Anti-Injunction Act purposes.",
  "It will -- well, it will raise revenue. It has been predicted by the CBO that it will raise revenue, Your Honor. But even though that's the case -- and I think that would be true of any -- of any penalty, that it will raise some revenue, but even though that's the case, there still needs to be textual instruction in the statute that this penalty should be treated as a tax for Anti-Injunction Act purposes, and that's what's lacking here.",
  "Those are two different things, Justice Alito. I think for reasons that Justice Kennedy, I think, suggested in one of his questions to Mr. Long, all of the other doctrines, that exhaustion of remedies and related doctrines, would still be there, and the United States would rely on them in those circumstances. And -- and so, I don't think the answer is that they can all go to court, no.",
  "Yes. We don't -- we've taken this position after very careful consideration, and we've assessed the institutional interests of the United States, and we think we're in the right place.",
  "We don't -- because the exhaustion would go to the individual amount owed, we think, and that's a different situation from this case. If the Court has no further questions.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Affordable Care Act addresses a fundamental and enduring problem in our health care system and our economy. Insurance has become the predominant means of paying for health care in this country. Insurance has become the predominant means of paying for health care in this country. For most Americans, for more than 80 percent of Americans, the insurance system does provide effective access. Excuse me. But for more than 40 million Americans who do not have access to health insurance either through their employer or through government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, the system does not work. Those individuals must resort to the individual market, and that market does not provide affordable health insurance. It does not do so because it -- because the multibillion dollar subsidies that are available for the -- the employer market are not available in the individual market. It does not do so because ERISA and HIPAA regulations that preclude -- that preclude discrimination against people based on their medical history do not apply in the individual market. That is an economic problem. And it begets another economic problem.",
  "They can address it directly, Justice Scalia, and they are addressing it directly through this -- through this Act by regulating the means by which health care -- by which health care is purchased. That is the way this Act works. Under the Commerce Clause, what Congress has done is to enact reforms of the insurance market, directed at the individual insurance market, that preclude -- that preclude discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, that require guaranteed issue and community rating. And it uses -- and the minimum coverage provision is necessary to carry into execution those insurance reforms --",
  "That's not what's going on here, Justice Kennedy, and we're not seeking to defend the law on that basis. In this case, the -- what is being regulated is the method of financing health -- the purchase of health care. That itself is economic activity with substantial effects on interstate commerce. And --",
  "No. That's not our position at all, Justice Scalia. In the health care market -- the health care market is characterized by the fact that aside from the few groups that Congress chose to exempt from the minimum coverage requirement -- those who for religious reasons don't participate, those who are incarcerated, Indian tribes -- virtually everybody else is either in that market or will be in that market, and a distinguishing feature of that is that they cannot -- people cannot generally control when they enter that market or what they need when they enter that market.",
  "No, Mr. Chief Justice. I think that's different. It's -- we -- I don't think we think of that as a market. This is a market. This is market regulation. And, in addition, you have a situation in this market not only where people enter involuntarily as to when they enter and won't be able to control what they need when they enter, but when they --",
  "I think the fundamental difference, Mr. Chief Justice, is that that's not an issue of market regulation. This is an issue of market regulation, and that's how Congress -- that's how Congress looked at this problem. There is a market. Insurance is provided through a market system --",
  "For burial services?",
  "Yes, Justice Alito, I think there is.",
  "No --",
  "It's -- I think it's completely different. The -- and the reason is that the burial example is not -- the difference is here you are regulating the method by which you are paying for something else -- health care -- and the insurance requirement I think -- the key thing here is my friends on the other side acknowledge that it is within the authority of Congress under Article I under the commerce power to impose guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms, to end -- to impose a minimum coverage provision. Their argument is just that it has to occur at the point of sale, and --",
  "Well, one big difference --",
  "One big difference, Justice Alito, is the -- you don't have the cost shifting to other market participants. Here --",
  "But that's different.",
  "That's a difference, and it's a significant difference, that this -- in this situation, one of the economic effects Congress is addressing is that the -- there -- the many billions of dollars of uncompensated costs are transferred directly to other market participants. It's transferred directly to other market participants because health care providers charge higher rates in order to cover the cost of uncompensated care, and insurance companies reflect those higher rates in higher premiums, which Congress found translates to a thousand dollars per family in additional health insurance costs.",
  "No, I think that -- and I do think that's what the Respondents argue. It's just not right. I think it -- it really gets to a fundamental problem with their argument.",
  "(A) it is how insurance works, but (b) the problem that they -- that they're identifying is not that problem. The guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms do not have the effect of forcing insurance companies to take on lots of additional people who they then can't afford to cover because they're -- they tend to be the sick, and that is -- in fact, the exact opposite is what happens here. The -- when you enact guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms, and you do so in the absence of a minimum coverage provision, it's not that insurance companies take on more and more people and then need a subsidy to cover it; it's that fewer and fewer people end up with insurance because the rates are not regulated. Insurance companies, when they -- when they have to offer guaranteed issue and community rating, they're entitled to make a profit. They charge rates sufficient to cover only the sick population because healthy people --",
  "So, two things about that, Justice Kennedy. First, we think this is regulation of people's participation in the health care market, and all it -- all this minimum coverage provision does is say that, instead of requiring insurance at the point of sale, that Congress has the authority under the commerce power and the necessary and proper power to ensure that people have insurance in advance of the point of sale because of the unique nature of this market, because this is a market in which -- in which you -- although most of the population is in the market most of the time -- 83 percent visit a physician every year; 96 percent over a 5-year period -- so, virtually everybody in society is in this market. And you've got to pay for the health care you get, the predominant way in which it's -- in which it's paid for is insurance, and -- and the Respondents agree that Congress could require that you have insurance in order to get health care or forbid health care from being provided --",
  "That's correct, Justice Scalia, but you never know whether you're going to be that person.",
  "No, that is quite different. It is quite different. The food market, while it shares that trait that everybody's in it, it is not a market in which your participation is often unpredictable and often involuntary. It is not a market in which you often don't know before you go in what you need, and it is not a market in which, if you go in and -- and seek to obtain a product or service, you will get it even if you can't pay for it. It doesn't have --",
  "It is a --",
  "Yes, for two reasons. First, this -- the test, as this Court has articulated it, is: Is Congress regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerce? The way in which this statute satisfies the test is on the basis of the factors that I have identified. It --",
  "That is -- and that is definitely a difference that distinguished this market and justifies this as a regulation --",
  "-- of common activity.",
  "Well --",
  "So --",
  "It does, Justice Breyer, and if Congress were to enact laws like that, we --",
  "It would be my responsibility to defend them --",
  "-- and I would defend them on a rationale like that, but I do think that we are advancing a narrower rationale.",
  "Yes. The -- the rationale purely under the Commerce Clause that we're advocating here would not justify forced purchases of commodities for the purpose of stimulating demand. We -- the -- it would not justify purchases of insurance for the purposes -- in situations in which insurance doesn't serve as the method of payment for a service --",
  "-- Congress can regulate.",
  "No. The -- we think that in a -- when -- the difference between those situations and this situation is that in those situations, Your Honor, Congress would be moving to create commerce. Here Congress is regulating existing commerce, economic activity that is already going on, people's participation in the health care market, and is regulating to deal with existing effects of existing commerce.",
  "No --",
  "The difference, Mr. Chief Justice, is that health insurance is the means of payment for health care, and broccoli is --",
  "And broccoli is not the means of payment for anything else. And an automobile is not --",
  "But --",
  "But I do think that's the difference between existing commerce, activity in the market already occurring -- the people in the health care market purchasing, obtaining health care services -- and the creation of commerce. And the principle that we're advocating here under the Commerce Clause does not take the step of justifying the creation of commerce.",
  "This is a regulation of existing commerce.",
  "That -- that absolutely is a justification for Congress's action here. That is existing economic activity that Congress is regulating by means of this rule.",
  "That is not what we're saying, Justice Scalia.",
  "That's not -- not --",
  "No. It's because you're going -- in the health care market, you're going into the market without the ability to pay for what you get, getting the health care service anyway as a result of the social norms that allow -- that -- to which we've obligated ourselves so that people get health care.",
  "Well, I can't imagine that that -- that the Commerce Clause would -- would forbid Congress from taking into account this deeply embedded social norm.",
  "I -- this is not a purchase mandate. This is a -- this is a law that regulates the method of paying for a service that the class of people to whom it applies are either consuming --",
  "-- or inevitably will consume.",
  "So, let me try to state it this way: The Congress enacted reforms of the insurance market, the guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms. It did so to deal with a very serious problem that results in 40 million people not being able to get insurance and therefore not access to the health care market. Everybody agrees in this case that those are within Congress's Article I powers. The minimum coverage provision is necessary to carry those provisions into execution, because without them, without those provisions, without minimum coverage, guaranteed issue and community rating will, as the experience in the States showed, make matters worse, not better. There will be fewer people covered; it will cost more. Now, the --",
  "So --",
  "So -- no. No.",
  "No, because that's -­ that's the first part of our argument. The second part of our argument is that the means here that Congress has chosen, the minimum coverage provision, is a means that regulates the -- that regulates economic activity, namely your transaction in the health care market, with substantial effects on interstate commerce; and it is the conjunction of those two that we think provides the particularly secure foundation for this statute under the commerce power.",
  "I do think, Justice Kagan, that the point of difference between my friends on the other side and the United States is about one of timing. They've agreed that Congress has Article I authority to impose an insurance requirement or other -- or other penalty at the point of sale, and they have agreed that Congress has the authority to do that to achieve the same objectives that the minimum coverage provision in the Affordable Care Act is designed to achieve. This is a situation in which we are talking about means. Congress gets substantial deference in the choice of means, and if one thinks about the difference between the means they say Congress should have chosen and the means Congress did choose, I think you can see why it was eminently more sensible for Congress to choose the means that it chose.",
  "Let me try to answer that question, Justice Kennedy, and get back to the question you asked me earlier. The -- the -- I do think one striking feature of the argument here that this is a novel exercise of power is that what Congress chose to do was to rely on market mechanisms and efficiency and a method that has more choice than would the traditional Medicare or Medicaid type model. And so, it seems a little ironic to suggest that that counts against it. But beyond that, in the sense that it's novel, this provision is novel in the same way, or unprecedented in the same way, that the Sherman Act was unprecedented when the Court upheld it in the Northern Securities case, or the Packers and Stockyards Act was unprecedented when the Court upheld it, or the National Labor Relations Act was unprecedented when the Court upheld it in Jones & Laughlin, or the dairy price supports in Wrightwood Dairy and Rock Royal. And --",
  "Well, to the extent that we're looking at the comprehensive scheme, Justice Scalia, it is regulating commerce that already exists out there. And the means in which that regulation is made effective here, the minimum coverage provision, is a regulation of the way in which people participate, the method of their payment in the health care market. That is what it is. And I do think, Justice Kennedy, getting back to the question you asked before, what -- what matters here is whether Congress is choosing a tool that's reasonably adapted to the problem that Congress is confronting. And that may mean that the tool is different from a tool that Congress has chosen to use in the past. That's not something that counts against the provision in a Commerce Clause analysis.",
  "This does not violate the norm of proper, as this Court articulated it in Printz or in New York, because it does not interfere with the States as sovereigns. This is a regulation that -- this is a regulation --",
  "But it --",
  "Of course, we do, Your Honor, but this is --",
  "And the way in which this Court in its cases has policed the boundary that -- of what's in the national sphere and what's in the local sphere is to ask whether Congress is regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerce. And here I think it's really impossible, in view of our history, to say that Congress is invading the State sphere. This is a -- this is a market in which 50 percent of the people in this country get their health care through their employer. There is a massive Federal tax subsidy of $250 billion a year that makes that much more affordable. ERISA and HIPAA regulate that to ensure that the kinds of bans on pre-existing condition discrimination and pricing practices that occur in the individual market don't occur.",
  "This is in --",
  "No, not at all.",
  "But what --",
  "But this -- but, Your Honor, this is -- what the Court has said, and I think it would be a very substantial departure from what the Court has said, is that when Congress is regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerce, that will be upheld. And that is what is going on here. And to embark on -- I would submit with all due respect, to embark on the kind of analysis that my friends on the other side suggest the Court ought to embark on is to import Lochner-style substantive due process --",
  "I agree, except, Mr. Chief Justice, that what the Court has said, as I read the Court's cases, is that the way in which you ensure that the Federal Government stays in its sphere and the sphere reserved for the States is protected is by policing the boundary. Is the national government regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerce?",
  "Well --",
  "I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, because it is predicated on the participation of these individuals in the market for health care services. Now, it happens to be that this is a market in which, aside from the groups that the statute excludes, virtually everybody participates. But it is a regulation of their participation in that market.",
  "Well, it's part of what the statute requires the insurers to offer. And I think the reason is because it's trying to define minimum essential coverage because the problem --",
  "The -- with respect to what insurance has to cover, Your Honor, I think Congress is entitled the latitude of making the judgments of what the appropriate scope of coverage is. And the problem here in this market is that for -- you may think you're perfectly healthy and you may think that you're not -- that you're being forced to subsidize somebody else, but this is not a market in which you can say that there is a immutable class of healthy people who are being forced to subsidize the unhealthy. This is a market in which you may be healthy one day, and you may be a very unhealthy participant in that market the next day. And that is a fundamental difference, and you're not going to know in which -­",
  "Congress has got -- Congress is enacting economic regulation here. It has latitude to define essential -- the attributes of essential coverage. That doesn't -- that doesn't seem to me to implicate the question of whether Congress is engaging in economic regulation and solving an economic problem here --",
  "-- and that's what Congress is doing.",
  "Well, while they're young and healthy, that would be true, but they're not going to be young and healthy forever. They're going to be on the other side of that actuarial equation at some point. And, of course, you don't know which among that group is the person who's going to be hit by the bus or get the definitive diagnosis. And that --",
  "Well, no, the people in that class get benefits, too, Justice Alito. They get the guaranteed-issue benefit that they would not otherwise have, which is an enormously valuable benefit. And in terms of the -- the subsidy rationale, I don't think -- I think it's -- it would be unusual to say that it's an illegitimate exercise of the commerce power for some people to subsidize others. Telephone rates in this country for a century were set via the exercise of the commerce power in a way in which some people paid rates that were much higher than their costs in order to subsidize --",
  "Well, right. But -- but everybody -- to live in the modern world, everybody needs a telephone. And the same thing with respect to the -- you know, the dairy price supports that -- that the Court upheld in Wrightwood Dairy and Rock Royal. You can look at those as disadvantageous contracts, as forced transfers, that -- you know, I suppose it's theoretically true that you could raise your kids without milk, but the reality is you've got to go to the store and buy milk. And the commerce power -- as a result of the exercise of the commerce power, you're subsidizing somebody else --",
  "-- because that's a judgment Congress has made.",
  "Well, that was the point I was trying to make, Justice Kagan, that you're young and healthy one day, but you don't stay that way, and the system works over time. And so, I just don't think it's a fair characterization of it. And it does get back to, I think, a problem I think is important to understand --",
  "But that's --",
  "But that's -- that's --",
  "That's the problem, Justice Scalia. That's -- and that's exactly the experience that the States had that made the imposition of guaranteed issue and community rating not only be ineffectual but be highly counterproductive. Rates, for example, in New Jersey doubled or tripled, went from 180,000 people covered in this market down to 80,000 people covered in this market. In Kentucky, virtually every insurer left the market. And the reason for that is because when people have that guarantee of -- that they can get insurance, they're going to make that calculation that they won't get it until they're sick and they need it. And so, the pool of people in the insurance market gets smaller and smaller. The rates you have to charge to cover them get higher and higher. It helps fewer and fewer -- insurance covers fewer and fewer people until the system ends. This is not a situation in which you're conscripting -- you're forcing insurance companies to cover very large numbers of unhealthy people --",
  "But that seems to me to say, Justice Scalia, that Congress -- that's the problem here. And that seems to me -­",
  "-- to say that Congress cannot solve the problem through standard economic regulation, and that -- and I do not think that can be the premise of our understanding of the Commerce Clause.",
  "This is an economic problem.",
  "I think --",
  "This is not a -- it's not a problem of Congress's creation. The problem is that you have 40 million people who cannot get affordable insurance through the means that the rest of us get affordable insurance. Congress, after long study and careful deliberation, and viewing the experiences of the States and the way they tried to handle this problem, adopted a package of reforms. Guaranteed issue and community rating and subsidies and the minimum coverage provision are a package of reforms that solve that problem. I don't -- I think it's highly artificial to view this as a problem of Congress's own creation.",
  "Yes. It's limited to insurance.",
  "But this is insurance as a method of payment for health care services. And that --",
  "And that --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, let me answer that, and then if I may, I'd like to move to the tax power argument.",
  "No. The position we're taking here would not justify that rule, Justice Scalia, because health club membership is not a means of payment for -- for consumption of anything in a market. And --",
  "But I think it's common ground between us and the Respondents that this is an interstate market in which everybody participates.",
  "And they agree that Congress could impose the insurance requirement at the point of sale. And this is just a question of timing and whether Congress's -- whether the necessary and proper authority gives Congress, because of the particular features of this market, the ability to impose the -- the insurance, the need for insurance, the maintenance of insurance before you show up to get health care, rather than at the moment you get up to --",
  "-- show up to get health care. And that --",
  "And it is --",
  "But we agree Congress can regulate this market. ERISA regulates this market. HIPAA regulates this market. The market is regulated at the Federal level in very significant ways already. So, I don't think that's the question, Mr. Chief Justice. The question is, is there a limit to the authority that we're advocating here under the commerce power? And the answer is yes, because we are not advocating for a power that would allow Congress to compel purchases.",
  "Yes.",
  "We've got --",
  "We've got --",
  "We got two and they're -- they're different. Let me state them. First, with respect to the comprehensive scheme. When Congress is regulating -- is enacting a comprehensive scheme that it has the authority to enact, that the Necessary and Proper Clause gives it the authority to include regulation, including a regulation of this kind, if it is necessary to counteract risks attributable to the scheme itself that people engage in economic activity that would undercut the scheme. It's like -- it's very much like Wickard in that respect. Very much like Raich in that respect. With respect to the -- with respect to the -- considering the Commerce Clause alone and not embedded in the comprehensive scheme, our position is that Congress can regulate the method of payment by imposing an insurance requirement in advance of the time in which the -- the service is consumed when the class to which that requirement applies either is, or virtually most certain to be, in that market, when the timing of one's entry into that market and what you will need when you enter that market is uncertain, and when -- when you will get the care in that market, whether you can afford to pay for it or not and shift costs to other market participants. So, those -- those are our views as to -- those are the principles we're advocating for, and it's, in fact, the conjunction of the two of them here that makes this, we think, a strong case under the Commerce Clause.",
  "Yes. Thank you,so --",
  "Well, I think I would point the Court to the license tax case, where it was -- was denominated a fee, a nontax, and the Court upheld it as an exercise of the taxing power, in a situation in which the structure of the law was very much like the structure of this law, in that there was a separate stand-alone provision that set the predicate and then a separate provision imposing the fee.",
  "And that -- and I think in terms of the tax power, I think it's useful to separate this into two questions. One is a question of characterization. Can this be characterized as a tax? And, second, is it a constitutional exercise of the power? With respect to the question of characterization, the -- this is in the Internal Revenue Code. It is administered by the IRS. It is paid on your Form 1040 on April 15th. I think --",
  "They may still be exercise of the tax -- exercises of the taxing power, Justice Ginsburg, as this is, and I think there isn't a case in which the Court has, to my mind, suggested anything that bears this many indicia of a tax can't be considered as an exercise of the taxing power. In fact, it seems to me the license tax cases point you in the opposite direction. And beyond that, your -- the -- it seems to me the right way to think about this question is whether it is capable of being understood as an exercise of the tax power.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, what the -- two things about that. First is, it seems to me, what matters is what power Congress was exercising. And they were -- and I think it's clear that the -- they were exercising the tax power as well as the commerce power.",
  "What the President said --",
  "The President said it wasn't a tax increase because it ought to be understood as an incentive to get people to have insurance. I don't think it's fair to infer from that anything about whether that is an exercise of the tax power or not.",
  "That -- that is true, Justice Ginsburg. That is also true of the marijuana tax that was upheld in Sanchez. That's commonly true of penalties under the code. They do -- if they raise revenue, they are exercises of the taxing power. But their purpose is not to raise revenue; their purpose is to discourage behavior. The mortgage deduction works that way. When the mortgage deduction is -- it's clearly an exercise of the taxing power. When it's successful, it raises less revenue for the Federal Government. It's still an exercise of the taxing power. So, I don't -­",
  "I don't think that that's a fair characterization of the actions of Congress here, Justice Kagan. On the -- December 23rd, a point of constitutional order was called, too, in fact, with respect to this law. The floor sponsor, Senator Baucus, defended it as an exercise of the taxing power. In his response to the point of order, the Senate voted 60 to 39 on that proposition. The legislative history is replete with members of Congress explaining that this law is constitutional as an exercise of the taxing power. It was attacked as a tax by its opponents. So, I don't think this is a situation where you can say that Congress was avoiding any mention of the tax power. It would be one thing if Congress explicitly disavowed an exercise of the tax power. But given that it hasn't done so, it seems to me that it's -- not only is it fair to read this as an exercise of the tax power, but this Court has got an obligation to construe it as an exercise of the tax power, if it can be upheld on that basis.",
  "Well --",
  "They might have thought, Your Honor, that calling it a penalty as they did would make it more effective in accomplishing its objectives. But it is in the Internal Revenue Code. It is collected by the IRS on April 15th. I don't think this is a situation in which you can say --",
  "Well, I -- you know, I don't -- there's nothing that I know of that illuminates that. Certainly --",
  "No. There are certain limiting principles under the taxing power, and --",
  "-- and they -- and I think, of course, the Constitution imposes some: Got to be uniform; can't be a tax on exports; if it's a direct tax, it's got to be apportioned. Beyond that, the limiting principle, as the Court has identified from Drexel Furniture to Kurth Ranch, is that it can't be punishment, punitive in the guise of a tax. And there are three factors the Court has identified to look at that. The first is the sanction and how disproportionate it is to the conduct; the second is whether there is scienter; and the third is whether there is an administrative apparatus out there to enforce the tax. Now, in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture, for example, the tax was 10 percent of the company's profits, even if they had only one child laborer for one day. There was a scienter requirement. And it was enforced by the Department of Labor. It wasn't just collected by the Internal Revenue Service. Here you don't have any of those things. This -- the penalty is calculated to be no more than, at most, the equivalent of what one would have paid for insurance that you've forgone. There is no scienter requirement. There's no enforcement apparatus out there. So, it's certainly --",
  "-- consistent with those limits.",
  "I think it could, for the reasons I -- I discussed yesterday. I don't think it can or should be read that way. But if there's any doubt about that, Your Honor, if there is -- if it is the view of the Court that it can't be, then I think the right way to handle this case is by analogy to New York v. United States, in which the -- the Court read the \"shall\" provision, shall handle low-level radioactive waste, as setting the predicate, and then the other provisions were merely incentives to get the predicate met, and so --",
  "It -- it used its powers together to solve the problem of the market not --",
  "It used its --",
  "It used its -- it is justifiable under its tax power.",
  "If I may reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Congress confronted a grave problem when it enacted the Affordable Care Act: the 40 million Americans who can't get health insurance and suffered often very terrible consequences. Now, we agree, I think, everyone arguing this case agrees, that Congress could remedy that problem by imposing an insurance requirement at the point of sale. That won't work. The reason it won't work is because people will still show up at the hospital or at their physician's office seeking care without insurance, causing the cost-shifting problem. And Mr. Clement's suggestion that they can be signed up for a high risk pool at that point is utterly unrealistic. Think about how much it would cost to get the insurance when you are at the hospital or at the doctor. It would be -- it would be unfathomably high. That will never work. Congress understood that. It chose the means that will work, the means that it saw worked in the States and -- in the State of Massachusetts, and that -- and that it had every reason to think would work on a national basis. That is the kind of choice of means that McCulloch says that the Constitution leaves to the democratically accountable branches of government. There is no temporal limitation in the Commerce Clause. Everyone subject to this regulation is in or will be in the health care market. They are just being regulated in advance. That's exactly the kind of thing that ought to be left to the judgment of Congress and the democratically accountable branches of government. And I think this is actually a paradigm example of the kind of situation that Chief Justice Marshall envisioned in McCulloch itself, that the provisions of the Constitution needed to be interpreted in a manner that would allow them to be effective in addressing the great crises of human affairs that the Framers could not even envision. But if there's any doubt about that under the Commerce Clause, then I urge this Court to uphold the -- the minimum coverage provision as an exercise of the taxing power. Under New York v. United States, this is precisely a parallel situation. If the Court thinks there's any doubt about the ability of Congress to impose the requirement in 5000A(a), it can be treated as simply the predicate to which the tax incentive of 5000A(b) seeks accomplishment. And the Court, as the Court said in New York, has a solemn obligation to respect the judgments of the democratically accountable branches of government, and because this statute can be construed in a manner that allows it to be upheld in that way, I respectfully submit that it is this Court's duty to do so. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion provisions will provide millions of Americans with the opportunity to have access to essential health care that they cannot now afford. It is an exercise of the Spending Clause power that complies with all of the limits set forth in this Court's decision in Dole, and the States do not contend otherwise. The States are asking this Court to do something unprecedented, which is to declare this an impermissibly coercive exercise of power.",
  "-- of power --",
  "Yes. First, if I could just try to be a little more precise about it, Justice Scalia, I think the -- what the Court said in Steward Machine and in Dole is that it's possible that you might envision a situation in which there's coercion.",
  "And the courts didn't say much more, but I can think of something. One example I could think of that might serve as a limit would be a Coyle-type situation, in which the condition attached was a -- worked a fundamental transformation in the structure of State government in a situation in which the State didn't have a choice but to accept it. But -- and so --",

  "-- what the connection is between getting you to do A and the money you're getting for --",

  "Well, but I -- but I don't think that this is a case that presents that question, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Well, I think the Court has said, in Steward Machine and Dole, that this is something that needs to be considered in an appropriate case, and we acknowledge that. But I do think it's so dependent on the circumstances that it's very hard to say in the abstract with respect to a particular program that there is a --",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not prepared to -- to say right here that I can -- that – I’m not prepared to give that decision.",
  "Well, I -- Congress has authority to act and --",
  "But I do think -- but I do think -- I really do think that it's important to look at this -- an issue like this, if you're going to consider it, it's got to be considered in the factual context --",
  "-- in which it arises.",
  "No, I don't think so --",
  "-- because they do -- the States do have a choice there, especially as a -- as a going-in proposition. I mean, the argument the States are making here is not that they're -- that -- this is not a going-in proposition. Their -- their argument is that they're -- they are in a position where they don't have a choice because of everything that's happened before. But --",
  "Well, but as a --",
  "-- as a practical matter -- I disagree with that, Justice Alito. First of all, as a practical matter, there's a pretty serious political constraint on that situation ever arising, because it's not like the Federal Government is going to have an easy time of raising the kinds of tax revenues that need to be -- needed to raised to work that kind of fundamental transformation, and that's real. And -- and political constraints do operate to protect federalism in this area, and --",
  "But -- but with respect to a situation like that one, Justice Scalia, the -- the States have their education system, and they can decide whether they're going to go in or not. But here, of course, I think it's important to trace through the history of Medicaid. It is not the case, as my friend from the other side suggested, that the norm here is that the Federal Government has offered to the States the opportunity either to stay where they are or add the new piece. We can debate that proposition with respect to 1972 one way or another. The States have one view about that; we have a different one. But starting in the 1984 expansion, with respect to pregnant women and infants, it was an expansion of the entire program; States were given the choice to stay in the entire program or not. 1989, when the program was expanded to children under 6 years of age, under 133 percent of poverty, same thing. 1990, kids 6 to 18 and 100 percent of poverty, same thing. In fact, every major expansion, same thing. And so, I just think the history of the program, and particularly when you read that in context of 42 U.S.C. 1304, which reserves the right of the Federal Government to amend the program going forward, shows you that this is something that the States have understood all along. This has been the evolution of it, and with respect to --",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it would not be responsible of me to stand here in advance of any particular situation becoming -- coming before the Secretary of Health and Human Services and commit to how that would be resolved one way or another. But that --",
  "That discretion is there in the statute, and I think there's every reason to think it's real, but I do think, getting back to the circumstances here --",
  "That's correct, Justice Kagan. It's never been used to --",
  "It has never been used to cut off --",
  "If we could go to the situation we have here, Mr. Chief Justice, this -- with respect to the Medicaid expansion, the States' argument is, as they've said it in their briefs, they articulated a little bit different this morning -- this afternoon. But as they said it in their briefs was it's not what you stand to gain, but what you stand to lose. But I think an important thing in evaluating that argument in this context is fully 60 percent of Medicaid expenditures in this country are based on optional choices. And I don't mean by that the optional choices of the States to stay in the program in '84 or '88 or '89. But -- but States are given choices to expand the beneficiaries beyond the Federal minimum and to expand services beyond the Federal minimum.",
  "It's much more nuanced than that, Justice Kennedy. There is something called a maintenance of effort provision which lasts until 2014, until such time as the Medicaid expansion takes place and the exchanges are in place. That applies to the population. It says, with respect to the population, you can't take anybody out. It does not apply to the optional benefits where the States still have flexibility. They can still reduce optional benefits that they're now providing if they -- if they want to, to control costs. They can also work on provider rates. There's also -- with respect to demonstration projects by which some States have expanded their populations beyond the required eligibility levels, they don't have to keep them in. And then there's also, if the State has a budgetary crisis, it can get a waiver of that, as Wisconsin did. So, that is a -- that's a provision I think that does a significant degree less than my friends on the other side have suggested in terms of -- in terms of its effect, and its effect beyond that is just temporary. But I do think with respect to the -- the first of their three arguments for coercion, the sheer size argument, that it's very difficult to see how that is going to work, because if the question is about what you stand to lose rather than what you stand to gain, then it seems to me that it doesn't matter whether the Medicaid expansion is substantial or whether it's modest, or whether there's any expansion at all. The States, for example -- the Federal Government, for example, could decide that under the -- under the current system, too much money has ended up flowing to nursing home care and that money would be better serving the general welfare if it were directed at infants and children. But if the Federal Government said we're going to redirect the spending priorities of the Federal money that we're offering to you, the States could say, well, geez, we don't like that; we'd like to keep spending the money the way we were, and we have no choice, because this has gotten too big for us to exit. And so -- and in fact, it seems to me, standing here today before these expansions take place, under their theory, the provision is coercive.",
  "Well --",
  "The more they stand to lose. And so -- and then I think it -- I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.",
  "Right. Well --",
  "Well --",
  "I think the situation is generally as you've described it, but I do want to be careful in saying I don't think it would be responsible of me to commit now that the Secretary would exercise the discretion uniformly in one way or another.",
  "But --",
  "But that --",
  "But it --",
  "It's not coercion, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "It's not coercion.",
  "But, of course --",
  "It's -- my understanding is that these situations are usually worked out back and forth between the States and the Federal Government. And I think that most --",
  "And I'm not. And -- but the --",
  "Well, I think -- that's what I think is the problem here, Justice Scalia, is it seems to me we're operating under a conception that isn't right. The reason we've had all these Medicaid expansions, and the reason, it seems to me, why we are were where we are now and why 60 percent of what's being spent on Medicaid is based on voluntary decisions by the States to expand beyond what Federal law requires, is because this is a good program and it works. And the States generally like what it accomplishes.",
  "Well, just as I can't make a commitment that the authority wouldn't be exercised, I'm not going to make a commitment that it would be exercised. But I do think that that -- to try and move away from the first of their arguments, the sheer size argument, to the second one, which is that it's coercive by virtue of its relationship to the Affordable Care Act, I really think that that's a misconception, and I'd like to be able to take a minute and walk through and explain why that is.",
  "That's correct, Justice Kagan. That is no --",
  "I'm sorry --",
  "That's another way of trying to say what I was trying to say to Justice Scalia earlier, is that the States and the Federal Government share a common objective here, which is to get health care to the needy. And, in the vast majority of instances, they work together to make that happen.",
  "Well, but what I would say about that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that we recognize that these decisions aren't going to be easy decisions in some circumstances. As a practical matter, there may be circumstances in which they are very difficult decisions. But that's different from saying that they're coercive, and it's different from saying that is an -- that it's an unconstitutional --",
  "No. I --",
  "In the situation described in your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, I think it's -- the Secretary of Health and Human Services would never do it. But what I'm saying is, with respect to the Medicaid expansion in this case --",
  "Would never do it.",
  "Well, and I think that it would have to satisfy the Administrative Procedure Act, and that's a real constraint. What I'm not -- what I don't feel able to do here is to say with respect to this Medicaid expansion --",
  "So --",
  "What I'm -- what I'm trying to do here is to -- is to suggest that the Secretary does have discretion under the statute, and that that -- and that's not --",
  "And it is possible, and I'm not willing to give that away. But that doesn't make this --",
  "I agree with that, Justice Kagan, but --",
  "I'm not trying to be -- I'm not trying to be reluctant. I understand how -- how this works. I'm trying to be careful about the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services and how it will apply in the future.",
  "Holly Hill.",
  "If I could go back to the sheer size idea, there are, I think, another couple of points that are important in thinking about whether that's a principle courts could ever apply. Once you get into that business -- in addition to the problem I identified earlier, that it basically means that Congress has frozen in place now, based on the size of the program, you've got this additional issue of having to make a judgment about in what circumstances will -- will the loss of the Federal funding be so significant that you would count it as being coercive.",
  "Well, but I think -- I think this going to come from a --",
  "This is going to come from a withdrawal situation. Their argument's about it's what you stand to lose, and with respect to withdrawal -- I mean -- so, does it depend on -- is it an absolute or a relative number with respect to how much of the State budget? Is it a situation where you have to make a calculation about how hard would it be for that State to make up in State tax revenues the Federal revenue they would lose? Does that depend on whether it's a high tax State or a low tax State? It just seems to me -- and then, what is the political climate in that State? It seems to me like --",
  "Yes, of course, it does, Justice Kennedy. But, here --",
  "You know, here, the coercion test, as it's been discussed, I think, for example, in Justice O'Connor's dissent in Dole and in some of the other literature, does address federalism concerns in the sense of the Federal Government using Federal funding in one area to try to get States to act in an area where the Federal Government may not have Article I authority.",
  "But, as Your Honor suggested earlier, this is a situation in which, while it is certainly true that the Federal Government couldn't require the States, as the Chief Justice indicated, to carry out this program, the Federal Government could, as Your Honor suggested, expand Medicare and do it itself.",
  "Certainly, but I think the problem here is --",
  "Yes, but I think --",
  "Well, I think it relates to it in the opposite way that my friends on the other side would like it to, in that I think their argument is that it would subject us to such a high degree of political accountability at the State level to withdraw ourselves from the program, that it's an unpalatable choice for us, and that's where the coercive effect comes from. And that's why I think coercion --",
  "And it may -- and, of course, it may do so, and it can make --",
  "I think --",
  "I think -- I think Congress predicted that States would stay in this program, but the -- prediction is not coercion. And the reason Congress predicted it, I think, Justice Scalia, is because the Federal Government is paying 90-plus percent of the costs. It increases State costs by 21 percent.",
  "Prediction is not coercion. I disagree, Justice Scalia. That's just an assumption, and if it proves to be wrong, then Congress has time to recalibrate. And beyond that, I do think -- I just want to go back to the -- the other part of Your Honor's point -- that with respect to the relationship between Medicaid and the -- and the Act and particularly the minimum coverage provision, my friend Mr. Clement has suggested that you can infer coercion because, with respect to the population to which the provision applies, if there's no Medicaid, there's no other way for them to satisfy the requirement. I want to work through that for a minute, if I may, because it's just incorrect. First of all, with respect to anybody at 100 percent of the poverty line or above, there is an alternative in the statute. It's the exchanges with tax credits and with subsidies to insurance companies. So, with respect to that, the part of the population at 100 percent of poverty to 133 percent of poverty, the -- the statute actually has an alternative for them. For people below 100 percent of poverty, it is true that there is no insurance alternative. But by the same token, there is no penalty that is going to be imposed on anybody in that group. To begin with, right now, the level of 100 percent of poverty is $10,800. The -- the requirement for filing a Federal income tax return is $9500. So, anybody below $9500, no penalty, because they don't have to file an income tax return. The sliver of people between $9500 and $10,800 -- the question there is, are they going to be able to find health insurance that will cost them less than 8 percent of their income? And so --",
  "Yes, that's true. But this --",
  "Well, I --",
  "Well, it --",
  "This is -- this is a -- this is -- these are Federal dollars that Congress has offered to the States and said we're going to make this offer to you, but here's how these dollars need to be spent. This is the essence of Congress's Article I authority under the General Welfare Clause and the Appropriations Clause. This is not some remote contingency or an effort to leverage in that regard. This is how Congress is going to have the Federal Government's money be used if States choose to accept it. Yes, it was reasonable for Congress to predict in this circumstance that the States were going to take this money, because -- because it is an extremely generous offer of funds: 90-plus percent of the funding. States can -- can expand their Medicaid coverage to more than 20 percent of their population for an increase of only 1 percent --",
  "-- of their funding.",
  "Well, the -- the --",
  "Yes, but that's --",
  "That's a judgment for Congress to make about how the Federal -- how Federal funds are going to be used if States choose to accept them, and Congress has made that judgment. That's Congress's judgment to make, and it's -- it doesn't mean that it's coercive.",
  "Lucky me. Lucky me.",
  "Well, I guess I --",
  "I would go back, Justice Kennedy, to the --",
  "I would go back to the fact that 60 percent of the Medicaid spending is now optional. It's -- it's a result of choices that States have made that – it’s expanded the – their own applications.",
  "Well, no, to a much more modest extent was my point, Justice Kennedy. For example, optional services where a huge amount of money is spent -- more than $100 billion annually -- the largest component of that is nursing home services. That remains optional. It's -- right now, once the minimum -- once the maintenance-of-effort provision remains in place, States have the flexibility to reduce that -- those numbers. States have considerable flexibility now and going forward with respect to the way that money is spent. And I do think in terms of evaluating whether this expansion should be considered coercive, it’s got to be evaluated against the backdrop of the fact that the States are generally -- are generally taking advantage of the opportunities of this statute to greatly expand the amount of money that the Federal Government spends and the amount of money that they spend to try to make the -- the lives of their citizens better. I think it's very --",
  "Well, but -- I would take issue with that, Justice Kennedy. Part of the Affordable Care Act is that it -- it provides for new streamlined eligibility processes to get people into the system at a -- at a much faster and cheaper rate. There are going to be costs to set that up. But under the statute, the Federal Government is going to pay 90 percent of those costs, the short-term set-up costs. And then all of the projections that we have seen suggest that the medium- to long-term costs, once these changes are in place, are going to be dramatically lower for the States --",
  "-- on the administrative side.",
  "Well, I think -- then -- then the States would have a choice at that -- at that point whether they were going to stay in the program or not. But that isn't what we have here, and --",
  "Well --",
  "I'm not saying it would be an easy choice, Mr. Chief Justice --",
  "The States would have to --",
  "The States would have to –- right. That would be --",
  "Right. That that would be the option. They can leave Medicaid if they decide that that isn't working for them. I'm saying -- I'm not saying this is an easy choice. I'm also not saying it would happen, because the Secretary does have this discretion. So --",
  "But that would be true, Mr. Chief Justice, whether this Medicaid expansion occurred or not. So --",
  "Well, like I said, I -- I agree that it would be a difficult choice in some circumstances. But that is not to say it's coercion as a legal matter or even as a practical matter. And I think it would depend on what the circumstances were on how -- and I think, trying to think about how a court would ever answer the question of whether it was coercive, it was too difficult as a practical matter for States --",
  "-- to withdraw.",
  "Yes, Justice Sotomayor, and this argument was raised in Dole, and the Court rejected it as a --",
  "Well, the citizens of the State, but that's the citizens of the State acting --",
  "-- in their capacity as citizens of the State. And I think that's why I get -- try to get back to the point, that's why I think this is wrong to think about this as coercion, because this is a program that works effectively for the citizens of the State, and States' governments -- and State governments think that, and that's why it has expanded the way it has expanded, because it's providing an essential service for millions of needy citizens in these States. It's providing access to health care that they would not otherwise have.",
  "Or lose a percentage of your highway funds.",
  "Seven percent, yes.",
  "It's -- I think -- I agree with Your Honor that it -- that it's different, but I don't think that that makes coercion as a legal matter. As I said, I think that this is a situation in which the -- if the States -- is it -- I'm not saying it would be an easy choice, but the States made the choice, they've made the choice. And --",
  "That's -- that's correct, Justice Sotomayor. And --",
  "That's right.",
  "That's -- that is correct.",
  "That answer I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "I don't know the answer to that. I don't know the answer to that. But if I may just say in conclusion that -- I'd like to take half a step back here. That this provision, the Medicaid expansion that we're talking about this afternoon and the provisions we talked about yesterday, we've been talking about them in terms of their effect as measures that solve problems, problems in the economic marketplace, that have resulted in millions of people not having health care because they can't afford insurance. There is an important connection, a profound connection, between that problem and liberty. And I do think it's important that we not lose sight of that. That in this population of Medicaid eligible people who will receive health care that they cannot now afford under this Medicaid expansion, there will be millions of people with chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease, and as a result of the health care that they will get, they will be unshackled from the disabilities that those diseases put on them and have the opportunity to enjoy the blessings of liberty. And the same thing will be true for -- for a husband whose wife is diagnosed with breast cancer and who won't face the prospect of being forced into bankruptcy to try to get care for his wife and face the risk of having to raise his children alone. And I could multiply example after example after example. In a very fundamental way, this Medicaid expansion, as well as the provisions we discussed yesterday, secure of the blessings of liberty. And I think that that is important as the Court is considering these issues that that be kept in mind. The -- the Congress struggled with the issue of how to deal with this profound problem of 40 million people without health care for many years, and it made a judgment, and its judgment is one that is, I think, in conformity with what lots of experts’ thought, was the best complex of options to handle this problem. Maybe they were right; maybe they weren't. But this is something about which the people of the United States can deliberate and they can vote, and if they think it needs to be changed, they can change it. And I would suggest to the Court, with profound respect for the Court's obligation to ensure that the Federal Government remains a government of enumerated powers, that this is not a case in any of its aspects that calls that into question. That this was a judgment of policy that democratically accountable branches of this government made by their best lights. And I would urge this Court to respect that judgment and ask that the Affordable Care Act, in its entirety, be upheld. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court - -",
  "Where -- that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "We're not making any allegation about racial or ethnic profiling in the case. Mr. Clement is working hard this morning to portray SB 1070 as an aid to Federal immigration enforcement. But the very first provision of the statute declares that Arizona is pursuing its own policy of attrition through enforcement and that the provisions of this law are designed to work together to drive unlawfully present aliens out of the state. That is something Arizona cannot do because the Constitution vests exclusive - -",
  "That is our position, Your Honor. It is our position because the Constitution vests exclusive authority over immigration matters with the national government.",
  "Your Honor, the -- the Framers vested in the national government the authority over immigration because they understood that the way this nation treats citizens of other countries is a vital aspect of our foreign relations. The national government, and not an individual state - -",
  "But they cannot do what Arizona is seeking to do here, Your Honor, which is to elevate one consideration above all others. Arizona is pursuing a policy that -- that maximizes the apprehension of unlawfully present aliens, so they can be jailed as criminals in Arizona, unless the Federal government agrees to direct its enforcement resources to remove the people that Arizona has identified.",
  "I think the mandatory character of the Arizona law and the mandatory character of the obligations it imposes, in -- especially as backed by this extraordinary provision in Section 2(H), which imposes civil penalties of up to $5000 a day on any official in the state of Arizona who is not following Section 2 or, as we read it, the rest of SB 1070, to the maximum extent possible, does create a conflict. But I do think the most fundamental point about Section 2 is to understand its relationship to the other provisions in the statute. Section 2 is in the statute to identify the class of people who Arizona is then committed to prosecute under Section 3 and, if they are employed, also under Section 5.",
  "No, I think it's still a problem, Your Honor. These decisions have to be made at the national level because it's the national government and not -- it's the whole country and not an individual state that pays the price - -",
  "Well, I think we should think about Section 3 of the law, Your Honor. I think it will help illustrate the point - -",
  "I think the preemption here -- focusing for a moment on Section 3 -- the preemption here flows from judgments of Congress, from the registration system that Congress set up in Sections 1301 through 1306, from the decision of Congress in Section 1103 in the law to vest the Secretary of DHS and the Attorney General with the authority to make the judgments about how this law is going to be enforced - -",
  "They -- they can make - - they can engage in detention, in support of the enforcement of Federal law. That's what the OLC opinion from 2002 says. It does not say that they can prosecute under Federal law and make their own decisions. That's a far different matter. And it really goes to the heart, I think, of what's wrong with Section 3 of this Act, in that - -",
  "That's correct, but, with respect to -- and I will -- let me address something fundamental about Section 2. That is true, but I -- I think it doesn't get at the heart of the problem here. The -- Section 1 of this statute says that Sections 2 and 3 and 5 are supposed to work together to achieve this policy of attrition through enforcement. And so what Section 2 does is identify a population that the state of Arizona is going to prosecute under Section 3 and Section 5 - -",
  "We do, Your Honor. But, before I take 3 and 5 off the table, if I could make one more point about 3 and 5, please? The -- I think - - because I think it's important to understand the dilemma that this puts the Federal government in. Arizona has got this population, and they've -- and they're, by law, committed to maximum enforcement. And so the Federal government's got to decide, are we going to take our resources, which we deploy for removal, and are we going to use them to deal with this population, even if it is to the detriment of our priorities - -",
  "Here's the other half -- here's the other half of the equation, Mr. Chief Justice, which is that they say, if you're not going to remove them, we are going to prosecute them. And that means that the -- and I think this does get at the heart of why this needs to be an exclusive national power - -",
  "Yes, but those are -- but what you're talking about is taking somebody whose - - whose only offense is being unlawfully present in the country and putting them in jail for up to 6 months, or somebody who - -",
  "-- or like 30 days, forgive me. 6 months for employment.",
  "Well, we're not saying the state can't ask it in any individual case. We -- we recognize that section - -",
  "Yes, certainly, but that doesn't make - -",
  "No. I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- I think the problem here is in that -- is in every circumstance, as a result of Section 2(B) of the law, backed by the penalties of section 2(H), the state official must pursue the priorities that the state has set, irrespective of whether they are helpful to or in conflict with the Federal priorities. And so - -",
  "No, it wouldn't be, Your Honor, because, in that situation, they would be free to be responsive to Federal priorities, if the Federal officials came back to them and said, look, we need to focus on gangs, we need to focus on this drug problem at the border - -",
  "Well -- yes, well - -",
  "Well, if there's a -- if there's a state policy locked into law by statute, locked into law by regulation, then we have a problem. If it's not - -",
  "-- the line is mandatory versus discretionary - -",
  "But they -- but, with respect to immigration enforcement, and to the extent all they're doing is bringing people to the Federal Government's attention, they are cooperating in the enforcement of Federal law - -",
  "Well, except I think, Justice Kennedy, the problem is that it's not cooperation if, in every instance, the officers in the state must respond to the priorities set by the state government and are not free to respond to the priorities of the Federal officials who are trying to enforce the law in the most effective manner possible.",
  "Well - -",
  "I think there are three. The first is the -- the Hines problem of harassment. Now, we are not making an allegation of racial profiling; nevertheless, there are already tens of thousands of stops that result in inquiries in Arizona, even in the absence of SB 1070. It stands to reason that -- that the legislature thought that that wasn't sufficient and there needed to be more. And it -- given that you have a population in Arizona of 2 million Latinos, of whom only 400,000, at most, are there unlawfully, there - -",
  "And they're -- and given that what we're talking about is the status of being unlawfully present, which - -",

  "The - -",
  "And other -- and other people lawfully present in the country, certainly, but this is - -",

  "Hines identified this problem as harassment as -- as a central feature of preemption under the immigration laws because of the concern that the way this nation treats citizens of other countries is fundamental to our foreign relations. And this is a - -",
  "Yes. I -- we would think it would ameliorate - -",
  "-- it would ameliorate the practical problem. But there is still a structural problem here in that this is an effort to enforce Federal law. And the -- under the Constitution, it's the President and the Executive Branch that are responsible for the enforcement of Federal law - -",
  "-- and - -",
  "It is, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "That's correct. But the process of -- the process of cooperating to enforce the Federal immigration law starts earlier. And it starts with the process of making the decisions about who to - - who to stop, who to apprehend, who to check on. And the problem -- the structural problem we have is that those decisions -- in the making of those decisions, Arizona officials are not free - -",
  "No, I -- I don't think that's right. I think we want to be able to cooperate and focus on our priorities. And one thing that's instructive in that regard, Mr. Chief Justice, are the declarations put into the record by the police chiefs from Phoenix and Tucson, both of whom I think explain effectively why SB -- the Section 2(B) obligation gets in the way of the mutual effort to -- to focus on the priorities of identifying serious criminals, so that they can be removed from the country.",
  "I think it could, but I think that's quite - -",
  "Well, of course, no one would - -",
  "Of course not.",
  "But this argument is quite different, Justice Scalia, because here what we are talking about is that Federal registration requirement in an area of dominant Federal concern - - exclusive Federal concern, with respect to immigration, who can be in the country, under what circumstances, and what obligations they have - -",
  "Yes.",
  "This is an argument about Section 3.",
  "Well, in any individual case, that's correct. You -- you would need to make the inquiry in the first place. It won't always be correct, if you're arresting somebody based on probable cause that they have committed a serious crime, and they - - and they -- the inquiry into whether -- into their status will be enough to identify that person for priority - -",
  "Well, I think -- I think it's correct that you can't, but there is a -- there is difference, Justice Alito, I think, between the question of any individual circumstance and a mandatory policy backed by this civil fine, that you've got to make the inquiry in every case. I think it's as though, if I can use an analogy, if you ask one of your law clerks to bring you the most important preemption cases from the last 10 years, and they rolled in the last -- the last hundred volumes of the U.S. Reports and said, well, they are in there. That -- that doesn't make it - -",
  "So - -",
  "Yes.",
  "I think -- I understand the question. And I think the answer is this: 1373 was enacted in 1996, along with 1357. And 1357 is the provision that sets forth the powers and authorities of Federal immigration officials. It contains 1357(g), which effectively says that Federal -- that the Federal government, the Attorney General, can deputize state officials, so long as they're -- they obtain adequate training, and they are subject to the direction and control of the Attorney General in carrying out immigration functions. Then the last provision, (g)(10), says that nothing that we've said so far should be read to -- to preclude informal cooperation, communication or other informal cooperation in the apprehension, detention, and removal of unlawfully present persons, but it's the focus on cooperation. And I think you have to -- so I don't think you can read into 1373 the -- the conclusion that what Congress was intending to do was to shift from the Federal government to the states the authority to set enforcement priorities because I think the cooperation in this context is cooperation in the service of the Federal enforcement.",
  "So let me -- let me just summarize what I think the three are, and then maybe I can move on to sections 3 and 5. The -- with respect to -- with respect to 2, we think the harassment argument -- we think this is a more significant harassment problem than was present in Hines - -",
  "With respect to -- in addition, we do think that there is a structural accountability problem, in that they are enforcing Federal law, but not answerable to the Federal officials. And, third, we do think there are practical impediments, in that the -- the result of this is to deliver to the Federal system a volume of inquiries that makes it harder and not easier to identify who the priority persons are for removal. So those are the three reasons.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The -- I do think the key thing about Section 3 is that we -- is that Section 3 is purporting to enforce a Federal registration requirement. That's a relationship between the alien and the United States government that's exclusively a Federal relationship. It's governed by the terms of 1301 through 1306. And the way in which those terms are enforced does have very significant Federal interest at its heart. And there is no state police power interest in that Federal registration relationship. And I do think -- I think it's very important -- Justice Alito raised the question of these categories of people. I think it's -- it is quite important to get clarity on that. The -- if you are -- if you have come into the country unlawfully, but you have a pending application for asylum, a pending application for temporary protective status, because you -- you would have to be removed to a country to which you can't be removed, because of the conditions in the country, if you have a valid claim for relief under the Violence Against Women Act based on your treatment, if you have a valid claim for relief because you are a victim of human trafficking, if you have a valid claim for relief because you are the victim of a crime or a witness to a crime, all of those persons are in technical violation of 1306(a). And -- and it seems to me. They -- they are in violation of 1306(a), so my friend, Mr. Clement, just is not correct in saying that those are people who aren't in violation of 1306(a) and, therefore, aren't in violation of -- of Section 3. They are in violation.",
  "But -- but it's a situation in which no reasonable person would think that the individual ought to be prosecuted. And, yet, very often, the states aren't even going to know, in fact, about asylum status. They can't know because there are regulations that require that to be kept private, to avoid retaliation against the person making the application. And so, this -- so this is -- this is, I think, a very strong illustration of why the enforcement discretion over Section 3 needs to be vested exclusively in the Federal government.",
  "Well, this is - -",
  "I think what is extraordinary about this, actually, Justice Scalia, is the state's decision to enact a statute purporting to criminalize the violation of a Federal registration obligation. And I think that's the problem here. And they are doing it for a reason - -",
  "But -- but what - -",
  "Well.",
  "I think it's quite different. What they are doing here is using 1306(a) to get at the status of unlawful presence. The only people who can be prosecuted under Section 3 are people who are unlawfully present in the country. That's what the statute says. And they are using it to get at that category of people, to, essentially, use their state criminal law to perform an immigration function. And the immigration function is to try to - - to prosecute these people. And, by the way, you can prosecute somebody, they can be put in jail for 30 days here. But, under Federal law, a violation of 1306(a) is a continuing offense. So the day they get out of jail for that 30 days, they can be arrested again. And this can happen over and over again. And the point of this provision is to drive unlawfully present people out of the state of Arizona.",
  "Of course, they have legitimate concerns in that situation. Justice Kennedy - -",
  "They -- they certainly can enact laws of general application. They can enforce the laws of general application that are on the books. They already -- as a result of 8 U.S.C. 1621, it's clear that they are under no obligation to provide any state benefits to the -- the population. But I think, most importantly, they can - - can -- not most importantly, but as importantly, they can engage in cooperative efforts with the Federal government -- excuse me. I see my - -",
  "They can -- they can engage in cooperative efforts with the Federal government, of which there are many going on in Arizona and around the country, in order to address these problems.",
  "Of course, we have to set priorities. There are only - -",
  "Well -- well, what I think they are going to do in Arizona is something quite extraordinary, that has significant real and practical foreign relations effects. And that's the problem, and it's the reason why this power needs to be vested exclusively in the Federal government. They -- what they are going to do is engage, effectively, in mass incarceration because the obligation under Section 2(H), of course, is not merely to enforce Section 2 to the fullest possible extent at the -- at the risk of civil fine, but to enforce Federal immigration law, which is what they claim they are doing in Section 3 and in Section 5. And so -- so you're going to have a situation of mass incarceration of people who are unlawfully present. That is going to raise -- poses a very serious risk of raising significant foreign relations problems. And these problems are real. It is the problem of reciprocal treatment of the United States citizens in other countries.",
  "No. We have a legitimate interest in enforcing the law, of course, but it needs to be -- but these -- this Court has said, over and over again, has recognized that the -- the balance of interest that has to be achieved in enforcing the -- the immigration laws is exceedingly delicate and complex, and it involves consideration of foreign relations, it involves humanitarian concerns, and it also involves public order and public safety.",
  "I assume so, yes.",
  "Well, they -- I mean, it can come in lots of different ways, but, generally, they will get a name and some other identifying information.",
  "Yes. So the way this works is there is a system for -- for incoming inquiries. And then there is a person at a computer terminal. And that person searches a number of different databases. There are eight or ten different databases, and that person will check the name against this one, check the name against that one, check the name against the other one, to see if there are any hits.",
  "Well - -",
  "Well - -",
  "The citizen problem is actually -- yes.",
  "The citizen problem is actually a significant problem. There isn't a citizen database. If you - -",
  "There is not. If you have a passport, there is a database if you look passports. So you could be discovered that way. But, otherwise, there is no reliable way in the database to verify that you are a citizen, unless you are in the passport database. So you have lots of circumstances in which people who are citizens are going to come up no match. There's no -- there is nothing suggesting in the databases that they have an immigration problem of any kind, but there's nothing to - -",
  "Yes, and I - -",
  "While I'm at it, there is a factual point I think I'd like to correct. Mr. Clement suggested that it takes 10 minutes to process these calls. That's true, but you're in a queue for 60 minutes before it takes the 10 minutes to process the call. So the average time is 70 minutes, not 10 minutes. And - -",
  "Well, it's a little more complicated than that. I think the -- the point is this: That with respect to persons who are unlawfully present, there are some who are going to fall in our priority categories. There are those who have committed serious offenses. There are those who have been removed and have come back. And there are other priority categories. Because we have resource constraints and there are only so many beds in the detention centers and only so many immigration judges, we want to focus on those priority categories, find them, remove them. There is a second category, and that is, individuals who are here in violation, technically, of 1306(a), but who have a valid asylum application or application for temporary protected status or other - - and, with respect to those persons that we think would -- it's affirmatively harmful to think that they ought to be prosecuted. And then there is an additional category of people who are not in the second category and not priorities, and the form and we think there, the idea that an individual state will engage in a process of mass incarceration of that population, which we do think is what Section 2(H) commits Arizona to do under Section 3, raises a significant foreign relations problem.",
  "Look -- I really think - -",
  "This is a -- this is a - -",
  "Well, a couple of things. First is I don't think it's realistic to assume that the aggressive enforcement of Sections 3 and 5 in Arizona is going to lead to a mass migration back to countries of origin. It seems a far more likely outcome is going to be migration to other states. And that's a significant problem. That's part of the reason why this problem needs to be managed on a national basis. Beyond that, I do think, you know, the - - it's worth bearing in mind here that the country of Mexico is in a central role in this situation. Between 60 and 70 percent of the people that we remove every year, we remove to Mexico. And, in addition, we have to have the cooperation of the Mexicans. And I think, as the Court knows from other cases, the cooperation of the country to whom we are - - to which we are removing people who are unlawfully present is vital to be able to make removal work. In addition, we have very significant issues on the border with Mexico. And, in fact, they are the very issues that Arizona is complaining about, in that - -",
  "No, Your Honor, but what it does -- no, Your Honor, I'm not saying that - -",
  "No, but what I am saying is that this points up why the Framers made this power an exclusive national power. It's because the entire country feels the effects of a decision -- conduct by an individual state. And that's why the -- the power needs to be exercised at the national level and not the state level.",
  "Right, but the problem I'm focused on -- we're focused on, Mr. Chief Justice, is not our removal decisions, but Arizona's decision to incarcerate, and the foreign relations problem that that raises. That's why this power has got to be exercised at the national level.",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, 2 -- 2 identifies the population that's going to be prosecuted under 3 and 5. I haven't -- I've been up here a long time. I haven't said anything about Section 5 yet. And I don't want to tax the Court's patience, but if I could spend a minute on Section 5?",
  "The -- I do think the fundamental point about Section 5 here is that, in 1986, Congress fundamentally changed the landscape. Congress made a decision in 1986 to make the employment of aliens a central concern of national immigration policy. And this Court has described the 1986 law as a comprehensive regime. Now, what my friend, Mr. Clement, says, is that it may be a comprehensive regime for employers; it's not a comprehensive regime for employees. And, therefore, it's -- there ought not be any inference here that the states are precluded from criminalizing efforts to seek or obtain employment in Arizona. But I really think that's not right. The -- employment is one problem. And Congress tackled the problem of employment and made a decision -- a comprehensive decision, about this -- the sanctions it thought were appropriate to govern. And Congress did, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, make judgments with respect to the circumstances under which employees could be held criminally liable, as well as the circumstances under which employers could be held liable. And I think it is useful, in thinking about the judgments Congress actually made - -",
  "It's -- it's both. I think we're making both a field and a conflict preemption argument here, Justice Scalia. And the - - and the -- I think it's worth examining the specific judgments Congress made in 1986. On the employer's side -- and, after all, this is a situation in which the concern here is that the employer is in a position of being the exploiter and the -- the alien of being the exploited -- on the employer's side, Congress said that states may not impose criminal sanctions, and even -- and the Federal government will not impose criminal sanctions for the hiring of employees, unless there's a pattern or practice. It seems quite incongruous to think that Congress, having made that judgment and imposed those restrictions on the employer's side, would have left states free to impose criminal liability on employees merely for seeking work, for doing what you, I think, would expect most otherwise law-abiding people to do, which is to find a job, so they can feed their families. So I think that's -- that's a significant problem. The -- in addition, Congress made clear in the law that the I-9 form could not be used for any other purpose than prosecutions for violation of the Federal antifraud requirements. And, if Congress wanted to leave states free to impose criminal sanctions on employees for seeking work, they wouldn't have done that, it seems to me. So there, I think there are strong indicators in the text that Congress did make a judgment, and the judgment was this far and no farther. And it's reasonable that Congress would have done so, for the same kinds of foreign relations concerns that I was discussing with -- with respect to Section 3. It would be an extraordinary thing to put someone in jail merely for seeking work. And, yet, that's what Arizona proposes to do under Section 5 of its law. Now, of course, there is an express preemption provision, but the express preemption provision, as this Court has said many times, does not operate to the exclusion of implied preemption, field or conflict. So we do think those principles apply here. We think there's a reason why the express preemption provision was limited to the employer's side, which is that, after DeCanas, laws had been enacted on the employer's side, and with -- Congress was making clear that those were preemptive, there were no laws on the employee's side at the time and, therefore, no reason for preemption.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Alien Tort Statute should not afford a cause of action to address the extraterritorial conduct of a foreign corporation when the allegation is that the defendant aided and abetted a foreign sovereign. In this category of cases, there just isn't any meaningful connection to the United States.",
  "Yes.",
  "It's -- it's a narrower statement than that, Justice Sotomayor. It's that there shouldn't be a cause of action to address the extraterritorial conduct of a foreign corporation that is alleged to have aided and abetted the acts of a foreign sovereign.",
  "Yes, we do, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Well, we think in Filartiga, Justice Ginsburg, that the -- the -- that there is a nexus to the United States. The actual perpetrator was -- A, it was a case against the actual perpetrator.",
  "And B - -",
  "Yes, I think our reasons for why Filartiga was okay is that -- that it was the actual perpetrator, not an aider and abettor, and the actual perpetrator was resident in the United States. And I do think when Congress enacted the TVPA, that is what Congress looked to as the salient features of the Filartiga situation that justified - -",
  "I -- I think Filartiga is the paradigm, and cases like Filartiga are the paradigm that -- where we think ATS -- ATS causes of action should be recognized.",
  "It's a new - -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, in a case like this one, in cases under the Alien Tort Statute, the United States has multiple interests. We certainly have foreign relations interests in avoiding friction with foreign governments; we have interests in avoiding subjecting United States companies to liability abroad. We also have interests in ensuring that our Nation's foreign relations commitments to the rule of law and human rights are not eroded.",
  "It's my responsibility to balance those sometimes competing interests and make a judgment about what the position of the United States should be, consistent with existing law.",
  "And we have done so.",
  "Well, because we think they are persuasive, Your Honor.",
  "So, Mr. Chief Justice, let me be clear: In this case our position is that the Court ought not recognize a cause of action.",
  "In that case the possible risk of foreign relations friction would be comparable. The risk of reciprocal exposure to American companies would also exist. The difference between that case and this case, Your Honor, is that there'd be a much more substantial connection to the United States because it's an American company. The question in the case would be whether the -- that substantial connection provided a sufficient justification for subjecting the United States company to these international law norms to avoid undermining the credibility of our Nation's commitment to those norms. We haven't taken a position on that question in this case because we think that the Court ought to proceed incrementally here. The case before the Court involves a foreign corporation in which there just isn't any connection to the United States at all, and it's our judgment that the Court should decide that case - -",
  "Our view about that, Justice Sotomayor, is that the key determinant here, and the reason why there ought not be a cause of action here, is the absence of any meaningful connection to the United States. And the question is - -",
  "We don't think that the question of the availability of a forum or nonavailability of a forum is sufficient to override the absence of any connection to the United States. Now, I will say - -",
  "Well, I think it would depend on a weighing of the strength of the interests of the United States, the foreign relations interests of the United States, in applying this narrow category of Sosa norms in order to avoid undermining the credibility - -",
  "Congress can always act in this area, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, actually what we are advocating here, Your Honor, is that the Court can make categorical judgments, not pure case by case factual judgments. We just think there is more than one category. There are salient differences between a situation like this one, in which there is no connection to the United States at all, or a situation like the one Justice Alito raised about an American corporation. And there are also cases in which the suit is against a direct perpetrator.",
  "Well, I think the categories are evident from the kinds of cases that have been brought. But -- but certainly, the views of the State Department do deserve deference.",
  "I think what we're - - we're not -- we're talking about something different, Justice Sotomayor. The question is whether to recognize a Federal common law cause of action. I think that depends on - -",
  "It depends on a weighing of interests, I believe, Your Honor, and that there are interests that cut against recognizing causes of acts in this area, and that's what Sosa said.",
  "Well, if no one ever came to the United States.",
  "No. It's just -- it's not -- the connection is not an on/off switch. But our position is you need a connection in order to assess whether there is even an interest in having cause of action - -",
  "Well, if it's an individual perpetrator like Filartiga we think that it is because it's the direct perpetrator.",
  "If the -- if the -- it was -- I think torture has to be - -",
  "If it's a norm that has to be violated by - -",
  "If they do it directly. If they are the direct violator of a norm that they can violate directly, then yes they can.",
  "Then if it's a foreign corporation and it occurred entirely in a foreign country.",
  "May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?",
  "The difference is that while you would have a comparable -- you would have a risk of friction in subjecting a foreign sovereign's acts to scrutiny in the United States, you have the reciprocity risk I mentioned. You would have to make a judgment about whether those concerns are overcome by the countervailing concern of applying the -- finding an ATS cause of action to apply U.S. norms. If it's an entirely foreign corporation with no connection to the United States, our position is the answer to that is no.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In resolving this case, it is important to focus on what is, or more precisely, what is not at issue. Petitioner is not challenging Grutter's reaffirmation of the principle of Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke that student body diversity is a compelling interest that can justify the consideration of race in university admissions. Colleges and universities across the country have relied on that principle in shaping their admissions policies, and it is of vital interest to the United States that they continue to be able to do so. The core of our interest is in ensuring that the Nation's universities produce graduates who are going to be effective citizens and effective leaders in an increasingly diverse society, and effective competitors in diverse global markets.",
  "I understand that differently, Justice Alito. Here's how we understand what is going on with respect to the admissions process in the University of Texas, and I am going to address it directly. I just think it needs a bit of context to do so. The top 10 percent plan certainly does produce some ethnic diversity. Significant numbers get in. The problem is the university can't control that diversity in the same way it can with respect to the 25 percent of the class that is admitted through the holistic process. So my understanding of what the university here is looking to do, and what universities generally are looking to do in this circumstance, is not to grant a preference for privilege, but to make individualized decisions about applicants who will directly further the educational mission. For example, they will look for individuals who will play against racial stereotypes just by what they bring: The African American fencer; the Hispanic who has -- who has mastered classical Greek. They can also look for people who have a demonstrated track record of - -",
  "No. I think the -- in the - -",
  "I think it's both. I think the -- there is no automatic preference in Texas. And I think this is right in the -- it says at page 398a of the Joint Appendix -- the -- they describe the process as saying, \"An applicant's race is considered only to the extent that the applicant, viewed holistically, will contribute to the broader vision of diversity desired by the university.\"",
  "Right. But the point - -",
  "I disagree, Justice Scalia. What the -- Texas, I think, has made clear -- and I think this is a common feature of these kinds of holistic approaches -- that not everyone in an underrepresented group gets a preference, gets a plus factor.",
  "Right.",
  "There may not be a racial preference in that situation. It's going to depend on a holistic, individualized consideration of the applicant.",
  "I don't think it's a tie-breaker. I think it functions more subtly than that, Justice Kennedy.",
  "It can make a difference. It just doesn't invariably make a difference with respect to every minority applicant, and that's the key here - -",
  "Yes, it does.",
  "But it doesn't necessarily make a difference in the situation that Justice Alito posited in the hypothetical - -",
  "That -- that is exactly right, Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that it's not a mechanical factor. Now, with respect to the implementation of -- and the narrow tailoring inquiry, with respect to the University's implementation of this -- of its compelling interest, I do think it's clear that, although the Petitioner says she's challenging implementation, that this plan meets every requirement of Grutter and addresses the concern of Justice Kennedy that you raised in dissent in Grutter. Whether Texas had to or not, it did address that concern. There's no quota. Everyone competes against everyone else. Race is not a mechanical automatic factor. It's an holistic individualized consideration. And because of the way the process is structured, they do not monitor the racial composition on an ongoing basis.",
  "That's correct. They make specific individualized judgments about each applicant - -",
  "Yes. But the key, Mr. Chief Justice, is the way it makes a difference. And it makes a difference by casting the accomplishments of the individual applicant in a particular light, or the potential of an individual applicant in a particular light. What -- what universities are looking for principally with respect to this individualized consideration is what is this individual going to contribute to our campus? And race can have a bearing on that because it can have a bearing on evaluating what they've accomplished, and it can have a bearing for the reasons I tried to identify earlier to Justice Alito on what they can bring to the table, what they can bring to that freshman seminar, what they can bring to the student government, what they can bring to the campus environment - -",
  "Not necessarily.",
  "Because -- because -- I'm trying to make a simple point here. Neither - -",
  "-- neither -- neither might get in.",
  "Sure.",
  "Our -- our military effectiveness depends on a pipeline of well-qualified and well-prepared candidates from diverse backgrounds who are comfortable exercising leadership in diverse settings, and - -",
  "Right.",
  "No, Justice Alito.",
  "The point of educational diversity, the point of what the University of Texas is trying to achieve is to create an environment in which everyone develops an appropriate sense of citizenship, everyone develops the capacity to lead in a racially diverse society, and so it will benefit every ROTC applicant from the University of Texas. And 43 percent of the Officer Corps comes from the ROTC. It's a very significant source of our military leadership.",
  "I don't think critical - - I agree with my friend that critical mass is not a number. I think it would be very ill-advised to suggest that it is numerical. So - -",
  "May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?",
  "Thank you. I think -- I don't think that this is a situation in which the Court simply affords complete deference to the University's judgment that it hasn't yet achieved the level of diversity that it needs to accomplish its educational mission. I think that the Court ought to -- has to make its own independent judgment. I think the way the Court would go about making that independent judgment is to look at the kind of information that the university considered. That could be information about the composition of the class. It could be information about classroom diversity. It could be information about retention and graduation rates. It can be information about -- that's specific to the university's context in history. Is it a university that has had a history of racial incidents and trouble or not? A series of factors. And then what the Court's got to do is satisfy itself that the University has substantiated its conclusion based on that -- based on the information it's considered, that it needs to consider race to further advance the educational goals that Grutter has identified as a compelling interest. And I will say, I do think, as the number of minority enrollees gets higher, the burden on the university to do that is going to get harder to meet. But I don't think -- I don't think there is a number, and I don't think it would be prudent for this Court to suggest that there is a number, because it would raise exactly the kind of problem that I -- that I think Justice Kennedy identified in the Grutter dissent of creating hydraulic pressure towards that number.",
  "I agree.",
  "I agree.",
  "I agree that critical mass -- the idea of critical mass has taken on a life of its own in a way that's not helpful because it doesn't focus the inquiry where it should be. If I may just add one word in conclusion.",
  "Thank you. I think it is important, Your Honors, not just to the government, but to the country, that our universities have the flexibility to shape their environments and their educational experience to make a reality of the principle that Justice Kennedy identified in Parents Involved, that our strength comes from people of different races, different creeds, different cultures, uniting in a commitment to freedom, and to more a perfect union. That's what the University of Texas is trying to do with its admissions policy, and it should be upheld. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether Respondents have standing to bring a facial challenge to the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Those amendments provide authority to the executive to conduct surveillance targeted at foreign persons located abroad for foreign intelligence purposes. Along with that grant of authority, Congress imposed statutory protections designed - -",
  "Several points, Your Honor - -",
  "Your Honor, under the statute, there are two clear examples of situations in which the individuals would have standing. The first is if an aggrieved person, someone who is a party to a communication, gets notice that the government intends to introduce information in a proceeding against them. They have standing. That standing could include a facial challenge like the one here.",
  "Well, if the information were -- if anyone gets notice, including the client, then the lawyer would know, and the lawyer would be in a position at that point to act.",
  "That's certainly true. But, in addition, Your Honor, the statute provides that -- that electronic communication service providers can challenge authorizations under the Act, so you -- there certainly would be standing in that instance. There was such a case.",
  "Well, the service provider did object to the immediate statutory predecessor to the 2008 amendments. And the -- and the FISA court litigated that constitutional challenge. So there's a concrete context there in which it arises. But even -- but beyond that - -",
  "Well, that's right. The Court found there was no Fourth Amendment violation there. But I think the point here, Your Honor, is -- the key point is this, that the -- in a normal case, a plaintiff would challenge the application of the authority to that plaintiff. In a situation like this one, we acknowledge that it may be difficult for a plaintiff to do so because an -- a challenge to the application gets into classified information pretty quickly. I think what the Respondents have tried to do here is to find a theory of the case that avoids that difficulty.",
  "That is a possibility. Of course, there's a procedure that the executive branch would have to go through, but that's a possibility. But I don't think we can get to that point, Your Honor, because I do think the key point here is that the Respondents' claims about this statute depend on a cascade of speculation. This statute only grants authority. It doesn't command anything. And in order for the Respondents to make a claim that they are injured, in fact, by this statute - -",
  "I don't think it's appropriate, Your Honor, to relax the Article III standing requirement of injury in fact based on the reality that the specific applications of this statute may involve classified information.",
  "That's exactly right, Justice Scalia.",
  "That the Court's authority cannot be invoked in that circumstance. And the mere fact that a specific application requires getting into classified matters can't change that basic Article III requirement.",
  "No. The key point, I think, is narrower than that, Justice Kennedy. This is a case in which the speculation is about the government's conduct, not the connection between the government action and an ultimate effect on the Plaintiff.",
  "The government conduct being challenged has to either have occurred or be certainly impending. And here, we have the polar opposite, Your Honor. I think it is important to think about - -",
  "Certainly impending. That's the language from this Court's opinions. And I think -- I think, if the Court thinks about it, every single case in which the Court has found standing, there's never been a dispute about whether the government was going to act or not; the dispute was only about the connection between the government action and the plaintiff's injury. Here, they're fighting about what - -",
  "Yes, that's not speculative, Justice Ginsburg, but what is speculative is the connection between the grant of authority and a claim of injury. I do think it's important - -",
  "There's a cascade of speculation - -",
  "I'd like very much to do that. Thank you, Your Honor, yes. First, the Respondents have to speculate about what the intelligence priorities and objectives of the executive branch are. Second, they have to speculate about how the executive branch officials are going to exercise their judgment to translate those priorities into procedures and procedures that comply with the statutory targeting and minimization requirements. Third, they have to speculate about the independent judgment of an Article III court assessing the lawfulness of those procedures and assessing whether those procedures comply with the Fourth Amendment.",
  "Yes, but that, Your Honor, is, I think, not a fair assessment of the process. It's really very much an iterative process in which there's a dialogue between the executive branch and the FISA court in which the court can demand more information, raise objections. Those get worked out, and then there's a final order. So I don't think it's fair to infer from the fact that there's only one rejection that this -- that it's a process that isn't rigorous. But, in addition to the speculation I just described, once you get through all that, you still have to speculate about whether the communication that - - whether the persons with whom the Respondents are communicating are going to be targeted, and that Respondents' communications will get picked up and - -",
  "It may be a harm, yes.",
  "No, I think the question under this Court's cases, Your Honor, is whether the government is going to take an action that makes that certainly impending.",
  "Actually, Your Honor - -",
  "-- I think that gets to the last speculative inference that needs to be drawn in order for them to make out their chain of causation, and it's this: They have to speculate that whatever surveillance occurs will occur under this authority, as opposed to other forms of lawful authority that they do not challenge. And Mr. McKay, that situation is a very good example of this. We point out in footnote 11 at page 32 of our brief that Mr. McKay says, yes, my client was subjected to 10,000 interceptions of phone calls, 20,000 interceptions of e-mails. Every one of those, it's a matter of public record, was under the authority of FISA before it was amended in 2008 - -",

And so the only information that's in front of the Court in making a decision now is information that that surveillance occurred under another authority that still exists and could still be applied - -",
  "I think it's -- I think the problem, Mr. Chief Justice, is redressability, in that the argument of the lawyers is that we have a duty to incur costs to avoid the surveillance, but that duty is triggered by, according to their expert affidavit - -",
  "But they still have to show a concrete application of the authority they're challenging. That's what this Court faces - -",
  "No, I don't. But -- but I do think the redressability point is a valid one. They have to show - -",
  "That's precisely what I'm saying.",
  "Well, I think, as compared to -- let me make two points about that. First, in terms of the expansion of authority, yes, that's fair with respect to the authority that existed immediately preceding the statute. I actually think -- a bit of context is relevant here -- that what this statute was trying to do is reset the initial balance that Congress struck under FISA in 1978, when the large majority of overseas communications were carried by satellite and, therefore, not within FISA. And, of course, what - -",
  "I don't agree with that, Justice Kagan. I think -- this statute does not regulate them. It confers authority on the government. They take whatever precautions they choose to take based on their beliefs about how that authority's going to be exercised. That depends on the speculation I described. What this Court held in Summers is that you have to have a concrete application of the authority in order to meet the minimum constitutional requirement for Article III standing.",
  "I think -- I think it is speculation. I think you do not have a concrete application of this authority against anyone, and therefore you cannot meet the basic Article III requirement of standing that's set forth in Summers.",
  "I think the difference between this case and Monsanto illustrates our point. If the plaintiff in Monsanto had come into court and said, Congress has enacted a statute that gives the government agency the authority to deregulate genetically modified seeds, we think there is an objectively reasonable likelihood that the government is going to exercise that authority to deregulate alfalfa - -",
  "-- and then - -",
  "There is at least two differences, Justice Kagan, with all due respect. First, there is an exercise of the delegation of authority in Monsanto that is not present here. Here, there is speculation about how the authority will be exercised. Second, with respect to the authority, the record in that -- in Monsanto showed the seeds were in the ground, and the only question was a question of scientific assessment about the likelihood that the plaintiff farmers' crops were going to be affected, and that was a scientific judgment based on the pollination radius of the bumblebee, whether it would affect their crops. But what we're talking about here is speculation about how government officials are going to exercise policy judgments to implement the statute and - -",
  "If I took precautions, it would be because of a belief that I had to comply with an ethics rule, and the ethics rule would be the cause of me taking those precautions. It doesn't change the standard.",
  "Your Honor, it seems to me that that hypothetical is a variant of exactly the argument that the Court rejected in Summers. There isn't a concrete application. In Summers, the Court said, even in a situation where it would be likely that some members of the Sierra Club would be affected by the exercise of authority that the statute conferred, that you cannot - - you do not have a case - -",
  "-- or controversy absent the exercise of the authority.",
  "Well, I do think the problem here, Justice Ginsburg, really is -- the heart of the matter here really is that in a normal lawsuit a plaintiff would challenge the application of a statute, of the authority conferred under the statute. Here, that would run into classified information. So the Respondents have tried to plead a theory that allows them to avoid that problem. But it is inherently based on speculation, and I - -",
  "In a case like that, the lawyer -- the normal course would be for the lawyer to challenge the application of the statute. Here, you have the classified information problem. But I will say - -",
  "No, they don't. And the other thing I think that's critical here is that I think Congress was sensitive to the probability that you could not have facial challenges of the kind that Respondents want to bring. And so there is an entire - -",
  "I'm not - -",
  "I -- I'm not saying that at all, Justice Kennedy. But it remains the case that the way -- that in order for there to be an Article III case or controversy, a concrete application of that authority has to be demonstrated and it hasn't been under the theory of the plaintiffs' case.",
  "And -- and I think it would be the ethics rule that caused the lawyer to take those steps, not the statute. He would still have the same inferences.",
  "I would like to make one more point, if I could, Justice Kennedy, that I think goes to this and then I would like to reserve the balance of my time. Congress was aware of the difficultly that -- of bringing facial challenges, and so Congress put into place an alternative structure of accountability here. There are -- this is not unbounded authority. There are targeting requirements, minimization requirements, certification by the highest level - - highest levels of the executive, and there is independent review by an Article III judge to ensure compliance not only with the statute, but also with the Fourth Amendment, and there is ample congressional oversight. So it's not the case that this is a free-ranging authority at all. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Two specific points and then three broader points. First, Justice Kagan, with respect to the Naomi Klein declaration, what it says on page 338a is, \"Some of my sources will decline to share information with me if they believe that their communications are being monitored by the United States.\"",
  "I think you'd still have the problem of speculation there. And if I could, Justice Breyer, go to your proposed solution. I don't think it's a solution. I think it's a mechanism for people who think they may be under surveillance, foreign terrorists who think they may be under surveillance, to find out whether they are or not. I -- I just don't think that's a workable solution at all. Now, three broader points, if I may. First, the -- in every case in which the Court has found standing, every one on which the Respondents rely, the government conduct either happened or was certain to happen. In Meese against Keene, the films had been labeled as political propaganda. It wasn't a question about how authority to do so would be exercised. In Laidlaw, the permit had issued, and the pollution was in the water. There wasn't speculation about that. Monsanto, we already talked about; the government action was certain. That's true in every case. And Summers drew a distinction with those cases because, in Summers, there was no example of a concrete application of the authority. Second, their -- the fact that some of their clients may take steps that incur costs doesn't change the injury. It's still speculative. It's the kind of subjective chill that Laird said was -- was not sufficient to establish standing. And I think, if you take a step back, think -- ask -- think about what they're asking you to do. They are asking you to invalidate a vitally important national security statute based not on a concrete application - -",
  "But the whole point, Justice Kagan, the basic, most fundamental point about the case or controversy requirement and the injury-in-fact requirement that is embedded in it is to preserve the separation of powers. They are asking the Court to consider invalidating the statute based on an assumption either that there is dragnet surveillance or an assumption that their clients are going to be put under surveillance, without a single fact to substantiate either of those assumptions. I submit to the Court that it would be - -",
  "It's a little bit hard to talk about, Your Honor, because, to the extent we're talking about the process of acquiring foreign intelligence, that's a very sensitive intelligence method; and, to the extent minimization plays into that, it's -- it's not public information. But there are some steps that are publicly known, and they are, for example, that information acquired can be retained only for certain limited periods of time; that whenever -- when reports are done on information, that the names of U.S. persons or corporations are redacted. There are other restrictions on the ability to use the information. So there are steps of that nature.",
  "Well, that -- that - - again, Your Honor, there are procedures that govern those issues. They're not public procedures, but there are procedures that govern those issues, yes. But -- but, I do -- I understand the point, Your Honor, but I do think that's why Congress established this alternative structure of accountability, with the statutory protections, with the FISA court review, including review for conformity with the Fourth Amendment, with very robust reporting requirements, semiannual reporting requirements -- I see my time's expired. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me start with a central point that I think cuts through most of the arguments that Petitioner has made this morning. Chevron does apply to a court's review of an agency's determination of ITS jurisdiction, but only after a court concludes that Congress has delegated to the agency, generally, the authority to make rules carrying the force of law and that the rule in question was promulgated in exercise of that authority.",
  "No, in general. I think that the language this Court used, taken from Meade, last term in Astrue, in the unanimous opinion for the Court in Mayo the term before, was is the authority -- is -- is the agency vested with authority, generally, to make rules with the force of law.",
  "I would not, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Well, I'm not sure I agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice, because I think the point here is that to the extent -- once you've satisfied that general threshold that I identified, then to the extent there is ambiguity -- if the statute is clear -- and in Your Honor's hypothetical I'd submit the statute is clear at that point, that the agency -- that the agency's authority has been carved out with respect to that particular provision. If it's clear, you don't get to the question of whether there's any deference due. The issue arises when there's ambiguity. And our position is --",
  "Either one because --",
  "That -- that's correct.",
  "But if there is ambiguity on the first, our position is that Chevron applies and that the agency gets deference, so long as it's a permissible construction of the statute. And that's true whether you call it jurisdiction and -- or whether you call it substance. And one reason for that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that I don't think there is -- I do think this is really a Pandora's Box situation. I do not think there is a clear, neat dividing line between what my friend, Mr. Goldstein, describes as a jurisdictional issue, an issue of interpretive authority, and a question of substance. And I think you can see that in the briefing in this case. Mr. Goldstein has tried to define jurisdiction in a particular way; the IMLA has defined it in a very different way. They say any question that goes to the who, what, when, or where of an agency's assertion of authority is a jurisdictional question, as to which agencies get no Chevron deference in the course of ambiguity. And the reason that IMLA gives for stating that position is exactly the same reason that Mr. Goldstein gives for stating his position, which is that you're talking about an agency action in excess of the scope of its delegated authority, and, once you say that, there's no Chevron deference. And I would respectfully submit, once you have got a situation in which it is clear that the agency has general authority to implement and the argument is whether its authority to implement has, with respect to a particular provision, has been carved out, at that point, Chevron deference is appropriate, and that is the practice of this Court in repeated numbers of cases. American Hospital Association is certainly one such case where the -- the NLRB had general rule-making authority. There was a statutory provision that said bargaining units needed to be determined by the NLRB in each case. And the argument was made that that ought to be understood as a carveout from the NLRB's general authority requiring case-by-case decisionmaking with respect to bargaining units. And the Court rejected that argument, saying that -- that, in that case, whatever ambiguity there was in the statute ought to be resolved under Chevron in favor of the agency. Schor -- CFTC v. Schor is a comparable case. And I would submit Iowa Utilities Board is a case --",
  "Our position -- let me walk through the steps of our position and how we answer the question presented.",
  "Here's our answer to the question presented, Justice Sotomayor: That there is de novo review of the question of whether Congress has delegated authority to the agency, generally, to act with the force of law and whether the interpretation claiming deference is an exercise of that delegated authority. Once that is satisfied under de novo review, Chevron kicks in. Now, Step One of Chevron is, of course, de novo review using the normal tools of statutory construction to answer the question whether Congress has spoken clearly on the issue of whether the agency has authority. If the answer is that Congress has, then that disposes of the case. If Congress hasn't, then one moves to Step Two of Chevron and asks whether the agency's interpretation of the provision at issue, whether you call it substantive or whether you call it jurisdiction, is a permissible construction. Is it within the bounds of what the language can reasonably accommodate it? And, if it is, the agency is upheld. That's the way we think the issue in this case should be analyzed. That's the way we think every issue should be analyzed under Chevron. We think that's what this case is -- this Court's cases say. We think this is what the Court uniformly and routinely does in analyzing these questions. I think --",
  "Louisiana Public Service Commission, a little bit of confusion, I think, about that case. That case was decided in 1986. Congress added the sections Mr. Goldstein referred to, 251 and 252 of -- of the Communications Act, in 1996. And what Louisiana Public Service Commission did was define the outer limits of the Commission's authority. It said nothing shall be -- nothing in this Act shall give or -- shall be construed to give the commission authority or jurisdiction over intrastate communications, so it was an express carveout. That seems, to me, had you had run that through the Chevron analysis, it'd be a pretty straightforward Chevron Step One case. Adams Fruit, the - the Court held specifically in Adams Fruit that the plain meaning of the statutory provision at issue foreclosed the agency's interpretation. And that's at 494 U.S., at page 646. So that was a Chevron Step One case. It then did go on to say, with respect to Chevron Step Two, that, even if we were going to think about granting the agency deference here, they wouldn't get it. But I think the reasons -- if you map the reasoning of Adams Fruit onto this case, it supports our position and not Mr. Goldstein's. What the Court said in Adams Fruit was that the Department of Labor did have the authority to implement the substantive provisions of the Agricultural Workers Protection Act, including the substantive provisions governing motor vehicle safety. What it didn't have was the authority to restrict judicial remedies available for the private cause of action created under the statute. Well, if you map that onto here, what the FCC has done here with respect to the reasonable time provision in 332(c)(7)(B) of the statute was to provide a rule of decision for the substantive provision of the Act, leaving to the courts the decision of what remedy, if any, there would be for a violation of those substantive provisions. And so it's -- it totally maps onto -- to the FCC's interpretation of the right way to think about statutory authority in this case. And if I -- I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.",
  "So --",
  "Two points. First, applying that approach, I think it's pretty clear that one would uphold the FCC's judgment here. Second, I understand that that's Your Honor's approach. I don't --",
  "I understand that Your Honor is the most recent proponent of this approach.",
  "But -- but I think the Court is in a different place. And I think the Court is in a different place for a good reason because I think it's our interpretation of Chevron that avoids turning it into the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code because I think, if you think about what my friends on the other side are proposing here, what they're suggesting is that, once you've cleared that initial hurdle of deciding the agency has general authority to implement the statute with the force of law and that this is an exercise of that general authority and, therefore, not --",
  "I guess I would beg to differ about that. I think our -- our view is that Chevron does provide a stable framework for the development of administrative law.",
  "I guess -- I guess --",
  "With respect to the issue -- with respect to the issue that's in front of the Court now, I think the -- I think the -- what my friends on the other side are asking is, actually, for an additional layer of complexity in the analysis, even after the general authority is established to -- to make rules with the force of law and even after it's established that the rule at issue is -- has been done in the exercise of that, what my friend on the other side suggests is there is another layer of de novo review there to answer the question of whether this particular provision --",
  "-- gives authority to act with the force of law.",
  "Yes.",
  "It is definitely a pertinent consideration, Mr. Chief Justice. And let me talk about that in general and then move to the specifics in this case. In general, it's a pertinent consideration that is accommodated within the Chevron framework. At Chevron Step One, the Court applies the normal tools of statutory construction. The normal tools of statutory construction include a clear statement rule, they include the presumption against preemption. And this Court -- I -- one point --",
  "Well, when the question is whether Congress -- and let me try to view this with a specific case, the Solid Waste of Cook County case. That's a case in which the Court declined -- it didn't say that that issue there was exempt from Chevron analysis. It applied the Chevron framework. And it said it's Step One of Chevron because the Migratory Bird Rule pushed to the very outer limits of Congress's commerce clause authority, that the Court was going to apply a clear statement rule in that situation before assuming that --",
  "Congress has to be clear in its --",
  "That it intended to give that authority to that extent -- exactly.",
  "But -- but Chevron Step One is, of course, applied by the courts, Justice Kennedy, and that's where the protection comes in. And with respect to this particular --",
  "That is the -- was going to be my specific point in response to your question, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Yes, but there is a third variable here, and that's what's key, which is, in this situation -- in 332(c)(7)(B), the limitations provision, Congress has spoken, unambiguously, and said that the following limitations on local zoning authority must be respected.",
  "And no one has suggested that that was at the outer limit of Congress's Commerce Clause authority or anywhere close to it. And --",
  "But I -- but I do think -- I do think that what Justice Scalia said is correct, that the question here is not whether the States will decide. The question, at the end of the day, is whether the agency will be able to exercise its usual authority to interpret reasonable --",
  "-- whether Federal courts will make those decisions on a case-by-case basis upon de novo review.",
  "I do think -- in that -- in that respect, I think this case is really just like Iowa Utilities Board, in that the argument there --",
  "Yes.",
  "In that -- in that -- the argument there was that you ought not interpret the FCC to have authority to implement particular rules because Congress gave to State public utility commissions the responsibility to carry out and execute the rules and then, to Federal courts, the power to review them and cut the FCC out. And the argument there was that respect for States ought to lead you to conclude not to apply Chevron deference to the agency --",
  "I -- I understand that the Petitioners made that argument, Mr. Chief Justice. I read the opinion differently, and, if I could, I'll explain why. In Section 2 and looking at pages 384 and 385 of the opinion, after the Court had established that there was general authority, under Section 201(b), to implement the provisions of the Act, which I do think the Court established de novo, and we would agree that that's appropriate, the Court then moved on to consider these specific jurisdictional questions. And -- and the Court looked at the provision of the statute which gave authority to the State commissions and then considered the -- the argument that one ought to infer from that, that the FCC's cut out of the process. And the -- the opinion of the Court says, \"We think this attributes to that task a greater degree of autonomy than the phrase 'establish any rates' necessarily implies.\" It seems to me what the Court was saying there -- and then, on the next page, says something very similar about the next argument that the -- that the challengers were making in that case. And I think --",
  "It does not.",
  "It does not, Mr. Chief Justice, but --",
  "It does not.",
  "It does not. But the conclusion -- I think my -- my friend has suggested that we weren't accurate in our discussion of the -- the concluding paragraph of this phrase. But I would like to turn the Court's attention to that because I think we were. This is at page 397 of the opinion.",
  "There is a sentence that starts, \"The 1996 Act can be read to grant most promiscuous rights to the FCC vis-a-vis the State commissions and to competing carriers vis-a-vis the incumbents, and the Commission has chosen, in some instances, to read it that way, but Congress is well aware that the ambiguities it chooses to produce in the statute will be resolved by the implementing agency. We can only enforce the clear limits that the 1996 Act contains, which, in the present case, invalidate only Rule 319.\" Now, the jurisdictional dispute was the dispute between the FCC -- the FCC vis-a-vis the State commissions over who had the authority to implement the rules. So, while I -- I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, that Chevron is not cited in that Section 2 of the opinion, the tenor of that discussion does seem to me to say that the Court was looking, once it had established general authority, for clear evidence that Congress had intended to carve out, from that general authority, the particular provisions at issue and because the -- the provisions to which the challengers pointed did not necessarily imply an intent on the part of Congress to carve it out, that the Court wasn't going to find a carveout. So I do think that, really, the analysis in Iowa Utilities Board is quite consistent with that --",
  "Yes, you had a different view.",
  "That -- that's certainly how we understand the situation, Justice Breyer, that the agency does what agencies do.",
  "It interpreted the meaning of the language \"reasonable time,\" to give it more precise content, to allow -- to deal with the failure to act situation --",
  "Well, our view, Justice Ginsburg, is that there isn't any ambiguity, that the -- that the rule ought to be upheld, no matter what standard of review applies, in fairness to my friends on the other side. But I do think this points up the problems going down the road they are suggesting is --",
  "I took that -- I think that's it's -- it's, certainly, susceptible to further elaboration in that sense. But I took Justice Ginsburg to be asking me about the ambiguity with respect to the authority of the (7)(A) - -",
  "Right. And, in fairness to my friends and as the Chief Justice has just indicated, it's an inference from (7)(A), and I suppose an inference from (7)(B)(v), and that -- and that the courts are in the process. But I do think this points up the difficulty is that, if you -- if you look at the provision that the FCC's actually implementing here, it's not a jurisdictional provision; it's a normal substantive standard. The FCC is giving it more precise content. That's what an agency's job is. It's doing its job here.",
  "Yes, (7)(B)(ii), right, exactly.",
  "We think it's -- it's clear that the FCC has authority, given (7)(A), because of the \"except as provided in this paragraph\" argument. It's, I think, our friends on the other side who say that it's (7)(A) that creates uncertainty about whether the FCC has the authority to implement the reasonable time provision in (7)(B)(ii) -- and I think that points up the problem of adding this additional step to the analysis. Once the Court has satisfied itself that the agency has general rule-making authority, it's not going to be hard to cobble together inferences to make arguments on de novo review that the -- that the agency lacked the authority to implement a particular provision with the force of law. And I think you're adding needless complexity, and I do think -- the reason I suggested, earlier, that I think this is a Pandora's Box is because I do not think there's, at the end of the day, a principled line that can be drawn between what my friend describes as interpretive authority questions and the kind of who, what, when, where substantive questions -- substantive jurisdictional questions that Respondent IMLA is focused on. In each of those situations, the argument is that the agency has acted in excess of its statutory authority. And, if that's sufficient to justify de novo review in the first instance, it's sufficient to justify de novo review in the second instance. And, if that's the case, then I would submit that you have really unravelled Chevron. The -- the good work that that -- that that doctrine does to stabilize the development of administrative law is gone. There will be an argument in every case that -- that de novo review is required, and, in every case in which a court agrees that de novo review is required, once the court has interpreted the statute as a matter of de novo review, then you have ossification of the administrative process because that interpretation is locked in.",
  "No, I don't think it is, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the -- the federalism values are important, but I do think, as the -- as the --",
  "Well, I do -- I do think that's true, and I think that the arguments that are being made by my friends on the other side demonstrate that. But I guess what I would say, in this situation, in particular, is that -- that we're really not -- the fact that it does involve the Federal and State authorities doesn't change the analysis because, applying Chevron in the normal way, one would not conclude that Congress has spoken clearly and -- and restricted the agency's authority. And there is no means -- there's no basis to apply a clear statement rule here because Congress, clearly, had the authority to impose the limitations that it imposed in Subsection (B). And those are direct limitations on the State authority, and Congress made that judgment. It isn't the agency wading on -- in on its own to decide that State or local authorities should be subject to limitations. These are judgments that Congress made, and the agency is implementing them in very much the same way that the Court found it was appropriate for the agency to implement the preemptive scope of the word \"interest\" in the National Bank Act in the Smiley case.",
  "That's why -- that's why -- that's our --",
  "No. I think the question is whether the agency has the authority to flesh out the substantive standard that the court will subsequently apply --",
  "I agree with Justice Scalia because -- because I do think that, no matter what view of the matter the Court takes, the FCC's rule ought to be upheld. But I do think that the -- the position my friends on the other side are advocating threaten to unravel the -- the Chevron framework and destabilize administrative law. And I would urge the Court not to do it.",
  "I think --",
  "You -- you would analyze that under Step Two of Chevron, Justice Sotomayor. You decide whether that's a permissible construction of the statute, whether it's reasonable or whether it's arbitrary and capricious, that would depend on what the record looked like. But, certainly, a court would exercise review over that matter. If the Court has nothing further? Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There's a fundamental point that needs to be made at the outset. Everyone acknowledges, Petitioner, its amici, this Court in Northwest Austin, that the Voting Rights Act made a huge difference in transforming the culture of blatantly racist vote suppression that characterized parts of this country for a century. Section 5 preclearance was the principal engine of that progress. And it has always been true that only a tiny fraction of submissions under Section 5 result in objections. So that progress under Section 5 that follows from that has been as a result of the deterrence and the constraint Section 5 imposes on States and subjurisdictions and not on the actual enforcement by means of objection. Now, when Congress faced the question whether to reauthorize Section 5 in 2006, it had to decide whether the -- whether it could be confident that the attitudes and behaviors in covered jurisdictions had changed enough that that very effective constraint and deterrence could be confidently removed. And Congress had, as Judge Kagan identified earlier, a very substantial record of continuing need before it when it --",
  "I don't know the precise number, but many thousands. That's true.",
  "There was one in that year.",
  "But I think -- but, Mr. Chief Justice, that is why I made the point a minute ago that the key way in which Section 5 -- it has to be the case, everyone agrees, that the significant progress that we've made is principally because of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. And it has always been true that only a tiny fraction of submissions result in objections.",
  "No.",
  "That is not the argument. We do not think that --",
  "It is not. Congress relied on far more on just the deterrent effect. There was a substantial record based on the number of objections, the types of objections, the findings of --",
  "But they are related. They're related.",
  "I do not.",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. But Congress recognized that expressly in the findings when it reauthorized the act in 2006. It said that the first generation problems had been largely dealt with, but there persisted significant --",
  "I do not know that.",
  "But when Congress -- the choice Congress faced when it -- Congress wasn't writing on a blank slate in 2006, Mr. Chief Justice. It faced a choice. And the choice was whether the conditions were such that it could confidently conclude that this deterrence and this constraint was no longer needed, and in view of the record of continuing need and in view of that history, which we acknowledge is not sufficient on its own to justify reenactment, but it's certainly relevant to the judgment Congress made because it justifies Congress having made a cautious choice in 2006 to keep the constraint and to keep the deterrence in place.",
  "No, but what Congress did in 2006 was different than what Congress did in 1965. What Congress did -- Congress in 2006 was not writing on a clean slate. The judgment had been made what the coverage formula ought to be in 1965, this Court upheld it four separate times over the years, and that it seems to me the question before Congress under congruence and proportionality or the reasonably adapted test in McCullough -- or whatever the test is, and under the formula in Northwest Austin is whether the judgment to retain that geographic coverage for a sufficient relation to the problem Congress was trying to target, and Congress did have before it very significant evidence about disproportionate results in Section 2 litigation in covered jurisdictions, and that, we submit, is a substantial basis for Congress to have made the judgment that the coverage formula should be kept in place, particularly given that it does have a bail-in mechanism and it does have a bailout mechanism, which allows for tailoring over time.",
  "I think the -- the formula was -- was rational and effective in 1965. The Court upheld it then, it upheld it three more times after that.",
  "And -- but the question is whether times had changed enough and whether the differential between the covered jurisdictions and the rest of the country had changed enough that Congress could confidently make the judgment that this was no longer needed.",
  "Yes. With respect to -- start with Katzenbach. Katzenbach made the point that Section 2 litigation wasn't an effective substitute for Section 5 because what Section 5 does is shift the burden of inertia. And there's a -- I think it is self-evident that Section 2 cannot do the work of Section 5. Take one example: Polling place changes. That in fact is the most frequent type of Section 5 submission, polling place changes. Now, changes in the polling places at the last minute before an election can be a source of great mischief. Closing polling places, moving them to inconvenient locations, et cetera. What Section 5 does is require those kinds of changes to be pre-cleared and on a 60-day calendar, which effectively prevents that kind of mischief. And there is no way in the world you could use Section 2 to effectively police those kinds of activities.",
  "And I think it remains true --",
  "I -- I don't -- I don't really think that that conclusion follows. I think these under the -- there are thousands and thousands of these under-the-radar screen changes, the polling places and registration techniques, et cetera. And in most of those I submit, Your Honor, the -- the cost-benefit ratio is going to be, given the cost of this litigation, which one of the -- one of the reasons Katzenbach said Section 5 was necessary, is going to tilt strongly against bringing these suits. Even with respect to the big ticket items, the big redistrictings, I think the logic Katzenbach holds in that those suits are extremely expensive and they typically result in after-the-fact litigation. Now, it is true, and the Petitioners raised the notion that there could be a preliminary injunction, but I really think the Petitioner's argument that Section 2 is a satisfactory and complete substitute for Section 5 rests entirely on their ability to demonstrate that preliminary injunctions can do comparable work to what Section 5 does. They haven't made any effort to do that. And while I don't have statistics for you, I can tell you that the Civil Rights Division tells me that it's their understanding that in fewer than one-quarter of ultimately successful Section 2 suits was there a preliminary injunction issued. So I don't think that there's a basis, certainly given the weighty question before this Court of the constitutionality of this law, to the extent the argument is that Section 2 is a valid substitute for Section 5, I just don't think that the -- that the Petitioners have given the Court anything that allows the Court to reach that conclusion and of course --",
  "It's a -- it's a very substantial number and --",
  "It means I don't know the exact number, Justice Kennedy.",
  "I think it's dozens. And so the -- and so it -- so it's a substantial number. It is true in theory that those people could be used to bring Section 2 litigation.",
  "But that doesn't answer the mail, I submit, because it's still -- you're never going to get at all these thousands of under-the-radar changes and you're still going to be in the position where the question will be whether preliminary injunctions are available to do the job. There is no evidence that that's true. And I'll point out there's a certain irony in the argument that what -- that what Petitioner wants is to substitute Section 2 litigation of that kind for the Section 5 process, which is much more efficient and much more -- and much speedier, much more efficient and much more cost effective.",
  "Well, because I think Congress made a reasonable judgment that the problem -- that in 2006, that its prior judgments, that there -- that there was more of a risk in the covered jurisdictions continued to be validated by the Section 2 evidence.",
  "I think the combination of the history, which I concede is not dispositive, but is relevant because it suggests caution is in order and that's a reasonable judgment on the part of Congress, the combination of that history and the fact that there is a very significant disproportion in successful Section 2 results in the covered jurisdictions as compared to the rest of the country, that Congress was justified in concluding that there -- that it -- there was reason to think that there continued to be a serious enough differential problem to justify --",
  "Well, I think the -- the -- you have to look at it, and Congress appropriately looked at it through a broader -- in a -- in a broader timeframe, and it made judgments. And I think that actually, the -- the right way to look at it is not just the population judgment that Mr. Rein was critical of, the fact is, and I think this is in the Katz amicus brief, that the covered jurisdictions contain only 14 percent of the subjurisdictions in the nation. And so 14 percent of the subjurisdictions in the nation are generating up to 81 percent of the successful Section 2 litigation. And I think --",
  "It is not, and I do not know the answer to that, Your Honor, but I do think it was reasonable for Congress --",
  "I -- it's not our submission. As an objective matter, I don't know the answer to that question. But what I do know is that Congress had before it evidence that there was a continuing need based on Section 5 objections, based on the purpose-based character of those objections, based on the disparate Section 2 rate, based on the persistence of polarized voting, and based on a gigantic wealth of jurisdiction-specific and anecdotal evidence, that there was a continuing need.",
  "To maintain the deterrent and constraining effect of the Section 5 preclearance process in the covered jurisdictions, and that --",
  "And -- that's right, given the differential in Section 2 litigation, there was a basis for Congress to do that.",
  "Let me give two responses, Justice Breyer. The first is one that focuses on the practical operation of the law and the consequences that flow from it. I do not think that Shelby County or Alabama ought to be able to bring a successful facial challenge against this law on the basis that it ought not to have covered Arizona or Alaska. The statute has bailout mechanism. Those jurisdictions can try to avail themselves of it. And if they do and it doesn't work, then they -- they may very well have an as-applied challenge that they can bring to the law. But that doesn't justify -- given the structure of the law and that there is a tailoring mechanism in it, it doesn't justify Alabama --",
  "Congress's decision in 2006 to reenact the geographic coverage was congruent and proportional because Congress had evidence --",
  "The Court has upheld the formula in four different applications. So the Court has found four different times that the formula was congruent and proportional. And the same kinds of problems that Mr. Rein is identifying now were --",
  "-- were true even back in City of Rome because of course the tests and devices were eliminated by the statute, so no -- no jurisdiction could have tests and devices. And City of Rome itself said that the registration problems had been very substantially ameliorated by then, but there were additional kinds of problems. The ascent of these second-generation problems was true in City of Rome as a justification that made it congruent and proportional. And we submit that it's still true now, that Congress wasn't writing on a blank slate in 2006. Congress was making a judgment about whether this formula, which everyone agrees, and in fact Mr. Rein's case depends on the proposition that Section 5 was a big success.",
  "Thank you. I may need it for that question.",
  "Justice Scalia, there's a number of things to say. First, we are talking about the enforcement power that the Constitution gives to the Congress to make these judgments to ensure protection of fundamental rights. So this is -- this is a situation in which Congress is given a power which is expressly given to it to act upon the States in their sovereign capacity. And it cannot have been lost on the framers of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments that the power Congress was conferring on them was likely to be exercised in a differential manner because it was, the power was conferred to deal with the problems in the former States of the Confederacy. So with respect to the constitutional grant of power, we do think it is a grant of power to Congress to make these judgments, now of course subject to review by this Court under the standard of Northwest Austin, which we agree is an appropriate standard. That's the first point. The second point is I do -- I do say with all due respect, I think it would be extraordinary to -- to look behind the judgment of Congress as expressed in the statutory findings, and -- and evaluate the judgment of Congress on the basis of that sort of motive analysis, as opposed to --",
  "And -- but -- but I do think that the deference that Congress is owed, as City of Boerne said, \"much deference\" -- Katzenbach said \"much deference.\" That deference is appropriate because of the nature of the power that has been conferred here and because, frankly, of the superior institutional competence of Congress to make these kinds of judgments. These are judgments that assess social conditions. These are predictive judgments about human behavior and they're predictive judgments about social conditions and human behavior about something that the people in Congress know the most about, which is voting and the political process. And I would also say I understand your point about entrenchment, Justice Scalia, but certainly with respect to the Senate, you just can't say that it's in everybody's interests -- that -- that the enforcement of Section 5 is going to make it easier for some of those Senators to win and it's going to make it harder for some of those Senators to win. And yet they voted unanimously in favor of the statute.",
  "I don't think there is a record that would substantiate that. But I do think Congress was --",
  "And we agree with that, we respect that, we acknowledge that Northwest Austin requires an inquiry into that.",
  "Of course it would be better in the former situation. But with all due respect, Your Honor, everyone agrees that it was appropriate for -- for Congress to have exercised this express constitutional authority when it did in 1965, and everybody agrees that it was the -- was the exercise of that authority that brought about the situation where we can now argue about whether it's still necessary. And the point, I think, is of fundamental importance here is that that history remains relevant. What Congress did was make a cautious choice in 2006 that given the record before it and given the history, the more prudent course was to maintain the deterrent and constraining effect of Section 5, even given the federalism costs because, after all, what it protects is a right of fundamental importance that the Constitution gives Congress the express authority to protect through appropriate legislation.",
  "No. Not -- not -- no. Let me just try to articulate clearly what our -- what our position is. They've brought a facial challenge. We -- we recognize that it's a facial challenge. We're defending it as a facial challenge, but our point is that the facial challenge can't succeed because they are able to point out that there may be some other jurisdictions that ought not to be appropriately covered, and that's especially true because there is a tailoring mechanism in the statute. And if the tailoring mechanism doesn't work, then jurisdictions that could make such a claim may well have an as-applied challenge. That's how we feel.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Proposition 8 denies gay and lesbian persons the equal protection of the laws --",
  "As an amicus, I thought I might actually, Your Honor. And -- and, of course, we didn't take a position on standing. We didn't -- we didn't brief it. We don't have a formal position on standing, but I will offer this observation based on the discussion today and the briefing. We do think that, while it's certainly not free of doubt, that the better argument is that there is not Article III standing here because -- I don't want to go beyond just summarizing our position, but -- because we don't have a formal position. But we do think that with respect to standing, that at this point with the initiative process over, that Petitioners really have what is more in the nature of a generalized grievance and because they're not an agent of the State of California or don't have any other official tie to the State that would -- would result in any official control of their litigation, that the better conclusion is that there's not Article III standing here.",
  "Well, we said this was a -- we said this was a close question, and -- and our interests are, Justice Alito, in tomorrow's issues where we have briefed the matter thoroughly and will be prepared to discuss it with the Court tomorrow. With respect to the merits, two fundamental points lead to the conclusion that there's an equal protection violation here. First, every warning flag that warrants exacting scrutiny is present in this case. And Petitioners' defense of Proposition 8 requires the Court to ignore those warning flags and instead apply highly deferential Lee Optical rational basis review as though Proposition 8 were on a par with the law of treating opticians less favorably than optometrists, when it really is the polar opposite of such a law.",
  "I -- that gets to my second point, Your Honor, which is that I do think the problem here with the arguments that Petitioners are advancing is that California's own laws do cut the legs out from under all of the justifications that Petitioners have offered in defense of Proposition 8. And I understand Your Honor's point and the point that Justice Kennedy raised earlier, but I do think this Court's equal protection jurisprudence requires the Court to evaluate the interests that the State puts forward, not in a vacuum, but in the context of the actual substance of California law. And here, with respect to California law, gay and lesbian couples do have the legal rights and benefits of marriage, full equality and adoption, full access to assistive reproduction, and therefore, the argument about the State's interests that -- that Petitioners advance have to be tested against that reality, and -- and they just don't measure up. None of the --",
  "Well, because you have to measure the -- under the standard of equal protection scrutiny that we think this Court's cases require.",
  "Well, we -- what we're -- what we're saying about that is that we're not prepared to close the door to an argument in another State where the State's interests haven't cut the legs out from under the arguments. And I think -- I suppose the caution rationale that Mr. Cooper identified with respect to the effects on children, if it came up in a different case with a different record, after all here, this case was litigated by Petitioners on the theory that rational basis applied and they didn't need to show anything and so they didn't try to show anything. Our view is that heightened scrutiny should apply and so I don't want to -- I don't want to kid about this, we understand, that would be a very heavy burden for a State to meet. All we're suggesting is that in a situation in which the -- the State interests aren't cut out from under it, as they -- as they are here, that that issue ought to remain open for a future case. And I -- and I think the caution rationale would be the one place where we might leave it open. But you can't leave it open in this case.",
  "Well -- well, I understand that, Your Honor, but I do think that you have to think about the claim of right on the other side of the equation here. And in this situation, California -- the argument here that -- that gay and lesbian couples can be denied access to marriage on the ground of an interest in responsible procreation and child rearing just can't stand up given that the parents have full equality, the gay and lesbian parents have full equality apart from --",
  "I have four points I would like to make to that in response to that, Justice Alito, and I think they are all important. First, California did not, through Proposition 8, do what my friend Mr. Cooper said and push a pause button. They pushed a delete button. This is a permanent ban. It's in the Constitution. It's supposed to take this issue out from the legislative process. So that's the first point. Second --",
  "But the --",
  "But it does -- of course not. But it is -- but the aim of this is to take it out of the normal legislative process. The second point is that, with respect to concerns that Your Honor has raised, California has been anything but cautious. It has given equal parenting rights, equal adoption rights. Those rights are on the books in California now and so the interest of California is -- that Petitioners are articulating, with respect to Proposition 8, has to be measured in that light.",
  "And -- and that's why --",
  "No, respectfully Justice Scalia, we are not. Our position is narrower than that. Our position -- the position we have taken, is about States, it applies to States that have, like California and perhaps other States, that have granted these rights short of marriage, but --",
  "We are not -- we are not taking the position that it is required throughout the country. We think that that ought to be left open for a future adjudication in other States that don't have the situation California has.",
  "I -- I see my red light is on.",
  "Thank you. Our position is -- I would just take out a red pen and take the word \"only\" out of that sentence. When that is true, then the Equal Protection Clause forbids the exclusion of same-sex marriage and it's an open question otherwise. And if I could just get to the third reason, which I do think is quite significant. The -- the argument here about caution is an argument that, well, we need to wait. We understand that. We take it seriously. But waiting is not a neutral act. Waiting imposes real costs in the here and now. It denies to the -- to the parents who want to marry the ability to marry, and it denies to the children, ironically, the very thing that Petitioners focus on is at the heart of the marriage relationship.",
  "It -- if, with respect to a State that allows gay couples to have children and to have families and then denies the stabilizing effect --",
  "Well, we think --",
  "What I said is it's an open question with respect to those States and the Court should wait and see what kind of a record a State could make. But in California you can't make the record to justify the exclusion. And the fourth point I would make on this, recognizing that these situations are not --",
  "Well, they might try to make a different record about the effects on children. But there isn't a record to that effect here. And the fourth point I would make, and I do think this is significant, is that the principal argument in 1967, with respect to Loving and that the Commonwealth of Virginia advanced was, well, the social science is still uncertain about how biracial children will fare in this world, and so you ought to apply rational basis scrutiny and wait. And I think the Court recognized that there is a cost to waiting and that that has got to be part of the equal protection calculus. And so -- so I do think that's quite fundamental.",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, I -- I think what Proposition 8 does is deny the long-term stabilizing effect that marriage brings. That's -- that's the argument for -- for marriage, that - -",
  "California -- there are 37,000 children in same-sex families in California now. Their parents cannot marry and that has effects on them in the here and now. A stabilizing effect is not there. When they go to school, they have to -- you know -- they don't have parents like everybody else's parents. That's a real effect, a real cost in the here and now.",
  "Well, we -- we think that, as I started my argument, Your Honor, that all the warning flags for exacting equal protection scrutiny are present here. This is a group that has suffered a history of terrible discrimination. The Petitioners don't deny it. Petitioners said at the podium today that there is no justification for that discrimination in any realm other than the one posed in this case and the -- and so when those two factors are present, those are paradigm considerations for the application of heightened scrutiny, and so I don't want to suggest that in States that haven't taken those steps --",
  "-- that States that haven't taken this step, that they are going to have an easy time meeting heightened scrutiny, which I think has to apply --",
  "It would be a different case. And all I'm saying is that the door ought to remain open to that case, not that it would be easy for the State to prevail in that case.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The equal protection analysis in this case should focus on two fundamental points. First, what does Section 3 do. And second, to whom does Section 3 do it? What Section 3 does is exclude from an array of Federal benefits lawfully married couples. That means that the spouse of a soldier killed in the line of duty cannot receive the dignity and solace of an official notification of next of kin.",
  "We think that wouldn't raise an equal protection problem like this statute does, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "I don't think it would raise a federalism problem.",
  "And I -- but the key for the -- for the -- our purposes is that, in addition to denying these fundamental important -- fundamentally important benefits, is who they are being denied to.",
  "We -- no, we don't, Mr. Chief Justice. The question is what is the constitutionality for equal protection purposes, and because it's unconstitutional and it's embedded into numerous Federal statutes, those statutes will have an unconstitutional effect. But it's the equal protection violation from -- from the perspective of the United States that --",
  "No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor. I think if Congress passed such a statute, then we would have to consider how to defend it. But that's not --",
  "Well, with respect to Section 3 of DOMA, the problem is an equal protection problem from the point of view of the United States.",
  "It's central to the inquiry, Justice Kagan. I completely agree with that point.",
  "Well, the difference is what Section 3 does is impose this exclusion from Federal benefits on a class that has undeniably been subject to a history of terrible discrimination on the basis of character --",
  "Well, I think -- I want -- I just want to clarify. The equal protection question would be different than the other circumstance. That's a matter of --",
  "But the federalism concerns come into play in the following way in that Mr. Clement has made the argument that, look, whatever States can do in terms of recognizing marriage or not recognizing marriage, the Federal government has commensurate authority to do or not do. We don't think that's right as a matter of our equal protection analysis because we don't think the Federal government should be thought of as the 51st State. States, as we told the Court, yesterday we believe heightened scrutiny ought to apply even to the State decisions --",
  "Yes. We think whatever the outer bounds of the Federal government's authority, and there certainly are outer bounds, would be, apart from the equal protection violation, we don't think that Section 3 apart from equal protection analysis raises a federalism problem. But we do think the federalism analysis does play into the equal protection analysis because the Federal -- the Federal government is not the 51st state for purposes of -- of the interests that Mr. Clement has identified on behalf of BLAG.",
  "The question in the case, Justice Alito is whether Congress has a sufficiently persuasive justification for the exclusion that it has imposed. And it -- and it does not. The only way in which -- that BLAG's arguments for its -- for the constitutionality of this statute have any prospect of being upheld is if the Court adopts the minimal rationality standard of Lee Optical. But the fundamental --",
  "Well, the question before the Court is whether the exclusion that DOMA imposes violates equal protection, and it does violate equal protection because you can't treat this as though it were just a distinction between optometrists and ophthalmologists, as the Lee Optical case did. This is a different kind of a situation because the discrimination here is being visited on a group that has historically been subject to terrible discrimination on the basis of personal --",
  "No, I didn't say that. I said it would be subject to equal protection analysis, certainly, and there might be a problem.",
  "But the issue -- they have to be analyzed under equal protections principles, but whatever is true about the other situations. In the situation in which the couple is lawfully married for purposes of State law and the exclusion is a result of DOMA itself, the exclusion has to be justified under this Court's equal protection analysis, and DOMA doesn't do it.",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "You would have -- you would have to impose the -- the heightened scrutiny equal protection analysis, sure.",
  "Yes, that's certainly --",
  "That -- that is certainly true, Your Honor. If I could turn to the interest that BLAG has actually identified as supporting this statute, I think there are -- there are -- I think that you can see what the problem is here. Now, this statute is not called the Federal Uniform Marriage Benefits Act; it's called the Defense of Marriage Act. And the reason for that is because the statute is not directed at uniformity in the administration of Federal benefits. All -- there is two equally uniform systems, the system of respecting the State choices and the system of -- that BLAG is advocating here. And what BLAG's got to do in order to satisfy equal protection scrutiny is justify the choice between one and the other. And the difference between the two is that the Section 3 choice is a choice that -- Section 3 choice is a choice that discriminates. And so it's not simply a matter sufficient to say, well, uniformity is enough. Section 3 discriminates. And with respect --",
  "Well, I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice, why you wouldn't assume that what Congress was doing when it enacted a statute, particularly a statute that had the word \"marriage\" in it, was assuming that the normal rule that applies in the vast majority of circumstances of deference to the State definition of marriage would be the operative principle.",
  "No, but they may well have had in mind deferring to the normal State definition of marriage, whatever it is. Not that they were making the specific choice that my friend suggested they were. But whatever is the case, when Congress enacted DOMA that choice of exclusion has to be justified under appropriate equal protection principles. And so the issue of uniformity just doesn't get you there because there is no uniformity advantage to Section 3 of DOMA as opposed to the traditional rule. The issue of administration doesn't get you there. I mean, at a very basic level administrative concerns ought not be an important enough interest to justify this kind of a discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause. But even if you look at them, there are no genuine administrative benefits to DOMA. If anything, DOMA -- Section 3 of DOMA makes Federal administration more difficult because now the Federal government has to look behind valid State marriage licenses and see whether they are about State marriages that are out of compliance with DOMA. It's an additional administrative burden. So there is no administrative -- there is no administrative advantage to be gained here by what -- by what Congress sought to achieve. And the fundamental reality of it is, and I think the House report makes this glaringly clear, is that DOMA was not enacted for any purpose of uniformity, administration, caution, pausing, any of that. It was enacted to exclude same-sex married -- lawfully married couples from Federal benefit regimes based on a conclusion that was driven by moral disapproval. It is quite clear in black and white in the pages of the House report which we cite on page 38 of our brief --",
  "No, Mr. Chief Justice. We quoted our -- we quoted the Garrett concurrence in our brief. And I think there is a lot of wisdom there, that it may well not have been animus or hostility. It may well have been what Garrett described as the simple want of careful reflection or an instinctive response to a class of people, or a group of people who we perceive as alien or other. But whatever the explanation, whether it's animus, whether it's that -- more subtle, more unthinking, more reflective kind of discrimination, Section 3 is discrimination. And I think it's time for the Court to recognize that this discrimination, excluding lawfully married gay and lesbian couples from Federal benefits, cannot be reconciled with our fundamental commitment to equal treatment under law. This is discrimination in its most very basic aspect and the House Report, whether -- and I certainly would not suggest that it was universally motivated by something other than goodwill -- but the reality is that it was an expression of moral disapproval of exactly the kind that this Court said in Lawrence would not justify the law that was struck down there.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, and that's the -- we took the position we took yesterday with respect to marriage -- the analysis --",
  "Well, as we said yesterday, we think it's an open question with respect to State recognition of marriage, and they may well be able to advance interests -- they may be able to advance it. I guess I shouldn't say \"may well,\" because I do think it would be difficult, as we said yesterday. They may be able to advance interests that would satisfy heightened scrutiny and justify non-recognition --",
  "But -- but here, the Federal government's not in the same position because as BLAG concedes, the Federal government at the most can act at the margins in influencing these decisions about marriage and child rearing at the State level. And the Second Circuit and the First Circuit both concluded that there's no connection at all, and that's of course because Section 3 doesn't make it any more likely that unmarried men and women in States that -- unmarried men and women who confront an unplanned pregnancy are going to get married. And -- and elimination of Section 3 wouldn't make it any less likely that unmarried men and women are going to get married. It doesn't have any effect at all. It doesn't have any connection at all. So it's not at the margins. There's no interest at all at this -- in DOMA in promoting -­",
  "But our point here, Justice Breyer, is that whatever -- may I finish? Thank you. Whatever the issue is, with -- whatever the outcome is with respect to States and marriage, that the Federal government's interest in advancing those justifications through Section 3 of DOMA is so attenuated that two Federal courts of appeals have seen it as non-existent, and it cannot justify Section 3.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Enforcing the distinction between human invention and a product of nature preserves a necessary balance in the patent system between encouraging individual inventors and keeping the basic building blocks of innovation free for all to use. Isolated DNA falls on the ineligible side of that divide because it is simply native DNA extracted from the body. The claim that it is a --",
  "I actually think that -- I think we're -- we're fighting about something of importance. That question gets right to it. I want to answer the question directly, Your Honor. I'd like to make a prefatory point before doing so. The claim that isolated DNA is a human invention rests entirely on the fact that it is no longer connected at the molecular level to what surrounded it in the body. But allowing a patent on that basis would effectively preempt anyone else from using the gene itself for any medical or scientific purpose. That is not true about a patent on cDNA. A patent on cDNA leaves the isolated DNA available for other scientists and other -- and others in the medical profession to try to generate new uses.",
  "That's not my understanding, Justice Kagan. My understanding is that you -- that the native DNA can be used for recombinant DNA without the step of cDNA. We do think cDNA is important and the position of the United States is that cDNA is patent eligible. We disagree --",
  "Our position, though, is that cDNA is patent eligible because we don't -- we think, unlike the isolated DNA which is just taken from your body, cDNA is an artificial creation in the laboratory that doesn't correspond to anything in your body.",
  "That's true now, Justice Ginsburg, but obviousness is determined at the time that the patent is issued, so what may be true now might not have been true at the time the patents were initially issued. And --",
  "That's a little --",
  "Well, I think my answer to that, I guess, Your Honor, would -- would point first to Mayo, in which the Court recognized that the threshold test under Section 101 for patent eligibility does do work that the obviousness test and a novelty test and a specification test do not do, and the work that it does here, I would respectfully submit, is to ensure that the natural substance, the product of nature itself, is not subjected effectively to a monopoly because if it can be deemed to be a human invention solely as a result of the change that occurs when you extract it from the body, then that means, as a -- as a practical matter that you have granted a patent on the gene itself because no one else can extract it because extracting it is isolating it, isolating it violates the patent. And so as a result of that, no one else can try to develop competing tests for breast cancer, no one else can try to use this gene for recombinant DNA.",
  "Well, the Court identified in Chakrabarty and then reiterated in Mayo that -- that it is -- that the right answer to that question, Your Honor, is to focus on them at the eligibility stage because the -- because getting the balance right is of critical importance.",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "Well, I would -- again, I would point the Court to what the Court said last term in Mayo, which is that the determination of patent eligibility really is a double-edged sword. And it may be that in a -- in a particular case, maybe this case, although we are not expressing a view on it, you could sort the issue out on some of the other criteria, but that won't generally be true, and the proposition of whether you can patent the gene itself is a question we think of fundamental importance, and it raises exactly the two-edged sword concern that led the Court to conclude what it did in Mayo. And Mayo was a situation very much -- I'm sorry.",
  "Yes, and that --",
  "No. I think the picture is much more complicated than that. In many other nations it wouldn't be patentable and the patent law is different from nation to nation. I'll give one example I think helps illustrate the point. In Germany and France, for example, you can get a patent on isolated genomic DNA, but only for a particular use. So you would get what is the equivalent of a use patent, which is a patent that we would think under our patent laws is acceptable, too. If you -- just as with the question that Justice Alito asked earlier about identifying a -- a useful substance in a plant in the Amazon, if you isolate that and it proves to have therapeutic effects, you can get a patent on that use of it, but what you can't do is get a patent on the substance itself so that no one else can explore it for different uses and for -- and for different therapeutic purposes or to try to recombine it and turn it into a -- an even more therapeutic -- therapeutically valuable substance. And that's --",
  "Your Honor, as a -- I am going to invoke my privilege as an amicus in this situation. I think that's a fight between the parties. The point that we wanted to make is that as a conceptual matter cDNA is patent eligible.",
  "That's right, Your Honor. We're just saying as a conceptual matter that we think cDNA is a creation of the lab, it's an artificial creation, it's as a general matter patent eligible.",
  "That -- that may well be right, Your Honor. As I said, we're not taking a position on the particulars. But if I -- just to return to the point that Justice Alito made, the Court really was faced with a similar situation in Mayo. On the one side you had the -- the industry coming in and saying, look, we have got a lot of reliance issue, PTO has issued more than 150,000 patents here. You are going to really disrupt those reliance issues. On the other side you had the American Medical Association, as you have here, coming in and saying, actually, these patents inhibit much more innovation than they incent. And what the Court said is that -- as Justice Kennedy alluded to earlier, that the Court's not in a position to resolve that dispute conclusively. It doesn't have the institutional wherewithal to do it. But what the Court is in a position to do is to apply the general principles of law as they were articulated in Mayo, and then if there needs to be a particular different set of rules for the biotech industry, Congress can provide that different set of rules.",
  "May I answer briefly, Mr. Chief Justice?",
  "Yes, you certainly can, and that illustrates the difference. That patent is just for the use, it doesn't tie up all other potential uses of the substance and that's the key. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Aggregate limits combat corruption. Let me start by explaining exactly how. Aggregate limits combat corruption both by blocking circumvention of individual contribution limits and, equally, fundamentally, by serving as a bulwark against a campaign finance system dominated by massive individual contributions in which the dangers of quid pro quo corruption would be obvious and inherent and the corrosive appearance of corruption would be overwhelming. Now, the Appellants in this case have tried to present the case as though the issue were whether there were some corrupting potential in giving contribution to the nineteenth candidate after someone has already contributed to ­­ the maximum to the eighteenth. But that is not what this case is about. The Appellants are not arguing that the aggregate limit is drawn in the wrong place. They are arguing that there can be no aggregate limit because the base contribution limits do all the work. And so what that means is that you ­­ you're taking the lid off the aggregate contribution limit, and as Justice Kagan and her question earlier indicated, that means that an individual can contribute, every two years, up to $3.6 million to candidates for a party, party national committees and state committees ­­",
  "So, Mr. Chief Justice, I want to make two different points in response to that question. The first is that restricting transfers would have a bearing on the circumvention problem. It wouldn't eliminate all circumvention risk, but would have a bearing on that problem. But there is a more fundamental problem here. It's a problem analogous to the one that was at issue with soft money in McConnell, which is the very fact of delivering a $3.6 million check to the ­­ whoever it is, the Speaker of the House, the Senate Majority Leader, whoever it is who solicits that check, the very fact of delivering that check creates the inherent opportunity for quid pro quo corruption, exactly the kind of risk that the Court identified in Buckley, wholly apart from where that money goes after it's delivered. But the delivery of it ­­",
  "Let me make a specific point about that and then work into the framework. The specific point is this: The ­­ the aggregate limit would have the effect of restricting the ability of a contributor to make the maximum contribution to more than a certain number of candidates. That's true. We can't help but acknowledge that. It's math. But that doesn't mean that that individual cannot spend as much as the individual wants on independent expenditures to try to advance the interest of those candidates or the interests of the causes that those candidates stand for. Mr. McCutcheon, for example, can spend as much of his considerable fortune as he wants on independent expenditure advocating the election of these candidates.",
  "The foundation ­­",
  "The foundation of this Court's jurisprudence in this area is the careful line between independent expenditures, which this Court has held repeatedly, do not create a sufficient risk of quid pro quo ­­ quid pro quo corruption to justify their regulation, and contributions which do.",
  "Well, I do think we have limits on contributions to political parties, in addition to limits on contributions to candidates. And I think that does help establish the point here, which is that candidates are not hermetically sealed off from each other, and parties are not hermetically sealed off from candidates. They ­­ you know, they're all on the same team. And we limit the amount that an ­­ that an individual can contribute to a political party, as well as the amount that an individual can contribute to candidates ­­",
  "Let me try to answer this with an analogy, if I could, Justice Kennedy. I think the right way to think about it is this, if somebody thinks the Secretary of Defense is doing a great job, they can take out an ad in the Washington Post, spend $500,000 on that ad saying, the Secretary of Defense has done a great job. And ­­ and they would have an undoubted First Amendment right to do that. No one could think that there's a content ­­ it's hard to imagine a content­neutral justification for prohibiting that speech. But if, instead, the person wanted to express their symbolic ­­",
  "I still think ­­",
  "­­ that would be an independent expression. But if, instead, somebody wanted to express symbolically their view that the Secretary of Defense has done a great job by giving the Secretary of Defense a Maserati, nobody would think that there was a First Amendment ground that could be ­­ that could be invoked.",
  "We ­­ yes, it is, but the point ­­",
  "But ­­ it get ­­ I think it does, if I may, Justice Alito, because I think that the point is that the ­­ that the rule against gifts, the conflict of interest rules, they exist to advance a content­neutral government interest of the highest importance. That ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. But I think there are two ­­ Justice Alito, I think that, with all due respect, I think the point Your Honor is making confuses two different ways in which these laws combat the risk of corruption. The first one is that the ­­ the handing over of the large check and whether it's a $3.6 million check for everyone or a $2.2 million check for the House candidates or a $1 million check for all the state committees, the very ­­ just as the Court found in McConnell, with respect to massive soft money contributions and the inherent risks of ­­ of corruption there, there's an inherent risk of corruption. And that's why, indeed, as I said, we have limits on how much we can contribute to a political party for that reason ­­",
  "­­ and that's apart from how it gets transferred.",
  "Well, I think that the ­­ I think that the way these joint fundraising committees work is you hand over a single check to a candidate who solicits it. Now, it could be any candidate who sets up a joint fundraising committee, says, give to me and give to the rest of my team. And that's ­­ so the handing over the check to that candidate is a ­­ seems to me ­­ you know, creates a significant risk of indebtedness on the part of that candidate, even though a lot of the money is flowing through to others. In addition, the party leaders are often going to be the ones who solicit those contributions, and they're going to be ­­ have a particular indebtedness to candidates because, of course, their power, their authority depends on the party retaining or ­­ or gaining a majority in the legislature. And so they're going to feel a particular sense of indebtedness, that this person is helping, not only them, but everybody ­­",
  "­­ in these massive amounts and then ­­ I'm sorry, if I may just make my third point, Mr. Chief Justice?",
  "And then the third point I think is that every ­­ every candidate in the party is going to be affected by this because every candidate is going to get a slice of the money, and every candidate is going to know that this person who wrote the multimillion dollar check has helped, not only the candidate, but the whole team, and that creates a particular sense of indebtedness. And, of course, every member of the party is likely to ­­ every ­­ every officeholder in the party is likely to be leaned on by the party leadership to deliver legislation to the people who are buttering their bread.",
  "So ­­ you know, I think that that ­­ I think it's possible, but I think, if somebody had that goal, that circumvention goal, but by far better ways of achieving it would be giving significant ­­ and you've taken the aggregate caps off ­­ would be making significant contributions to state parties and national parties who are free to transfer money among themselves without restriction, and by ­­ and by making contributions to PACs. And so ­­",
  "No. No, I don't think so. I think it ­­ I think it ­­ I think it ­­ first of all, I think it could happen in that situation, but I think it's more likely to happen in those ­­",
  "Well, I think ­­ well, I ­­ in McConnell and in Colorado Republican to this Court said that earmarking is not the outer limit of the government's authority to regulate here. And the reason the Court said that is because a lot of this can be done with winks and nods and subtly. And so I ­­ and so I don't think it's the case that earmarking would work to prohibit that. But I also think that the ­­ when we're talking about aggregate limits, they're part of an overall system of regulation. And I think that they work to keep the ­­ to keep the circumvention risk in check, and they work to make sure that you don't have the kind of problem that you identified in McConnell.",
  "Well, I think, Justice Breyer, that the statute can be upheld under the current state of the record. I understand and take Your Honor's point. But I do think that you had a substantial record in Buckley, you had a substantial record in McConnell, but that substantial record bears directly on the question of whether massive aggregate contributions pose the inherent danger of corruption and the corrosive appearance of corruption and that the case can be decided on that basis.",
  "That's correct, Your Honor.",
  "Well, the ­­ we take the constitutional First Amendment framework of this Court's decisions as a given. The Court has ­­ the Court has determined that independent expenditures do not present a risk of quid pro quo corruption that allows their regulation; that contributions ­­ direct contributions to candidates and to parties can pose that risk ­­",
  "So I think the answer is we don't know, one way or another, whether that's the consequence, but we ­­",
  "Well, I don't ­­ with all due respect, Justice Scalia, I don't think we do. The parties still raise and spend very substantial amounts of money, and so I don't think that ­­ that we know. But beyond that, what ­­ the Congress has made a determination that there is a real risk of quid pro quo corruption and ­­ the appearance of quid pro quo corruption here and has regulated with respect to that risk, and Congress is, of course, free to take this into consideration.",
  "Well, I think that's ­­",
  "I think that's a good point, Justice Scalia. I think it helps illustrate ­­",
  "I do, I do. Take the 2010 election, non­presidential year. Each party spent ­­ parties and candidates together, on each side, spent approximately $1.5 billion.",
  "Right.",
  "That ­­ that, I don't have specifics for, but if that were ­­",
  "But ­­ but the parties ­­ but here's the problem ­­",
  "I don't think ­­",
  "I don't think that's the right way to look at it, Your Honor. If you think that a party's got to get $1.5 billion together to run a congressional campaign, parties and candidates together, and you've got a maximum of $3.6 million, that is about 450 people you need to round up. Less than 500 people can fund the whole shooting match. And that, I think, is part of the problem here, is that you are going to create a situation, if you take off the aggregate limits, in which there is a very real risk that ­­ that both ­­ that the government will be run of, by, and for those 500 people and that the public will perceive that the government is being run of, by, and for those 500 people. And that is why we have these aggregate limits and why they need to remain in place.",
  "I take that point, Mr. Chief Justice. But I think the right ­­ you asked earlier about the right analytical framework. I think the right analytical framework under the First Amendment is to think about this in terms of content neutrality. The government's interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption, which is why I brought up the example of the Maserati to the Secretary of Defense, is an entirely content­neutral justification ­­",
  "No ­­",
  "I would think that would be a content­based justification because the ­­ you are not ­­ you are not trying to prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption by doing that, and there is no other neutral justification that I can think of for why you would impose such a rule. But the point is, with respect to elected officials and the giving of money to the elected officials, there is this content­neutral justification that just doesn't exist with respect to any other entity out there in the world. And, yes, it is not free of First Amendment costs and we acknowledge that, but ­­ but that cost is mitigated in that this is not a prohibition, that you can ­­ you can't make it at the maximum, but you can make less. And then you have all the ­­",
  "Well, I suppose you could try to calculate an aggregate contribution limit that is different and higher than the one that is here now, but the problem with that is that the Appellants are not making that argument. They're making the argument that you cannot have ­­ the only argument they've made in this case is that you cannot have aggregate limits because base contribution limits do all the work.",
  "So, again, I apologize for repeating myself, Justice Alito, but circumvention is not the only problem. The delivery of the ­­ the solicitation and receipt of these very large checks is a problem, a direct corruption problem, and none of the alternatives that the Appellant's have identified address that problem.",
  "Well, they're not ­­ they are not going to burn it.",
  "And ­­ but ­­ and that's the point. They're not going to burn it. They need it.",
  "I ­­ I beg to differ, Your Honor. I think what it does is create the sense of indebtedness on the part of the recipient and on a part of the party leadership when it's delivered, and ­­ and that's the inherent risk of corruption in that situation. It's ­­ it's quite parallel to McConnell. It's why we have aggregate limits on what you can give to a party because these people are not hermetically sealed off from each other. They are all on the same team. They all have an interest in each other's success. And so party leaders, in particular, are going to feel a sense of indebtedness, and their less restrictive alternatives don't deal with that. But now, going ­­ if I could, I will try to address the circumvention problem. You know, they ­­ what they have done is come up with a whole series of things that you would have to ­­ there is not one thing that you would have to do to take care of this problem. You would have to say no transfers. You would have to say segregated accounts. You would have to say no giving money to PACs who have indicated that they are going to give money to candidates once you have already given money. You're going to have to do five or six things to deal with the risks of corruption. The idea that that is a less­restrictive means ­­ it seems to me like a significantly more restrictive means, and it's going to impose First Amendment costs of its own. I'm sure the PACs are going to say, what do you mean we can't say who we want to give money to? We have a First Amendment right to do that. So ­­",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I'm not here to debate the question of whether the Court's jurisprudence is correct with respect to the risks of corruption from independent expenditures.",
  "But we accept it and ­­ and the line is that there ­­ in this Court's jurisprudence, that there is an unacceptable risk when contributions are too high. And if I may just say this in conclusion ­­",
  "It's ­­ well ­­",
  "Congress isn't ­­",

  "And far be it from me to suggest that you don't, Your Honor.",
  "Well, I ­­ well, I think with respect to McConnell, this is ­­",
  "­­ it is really a very close parallel.",
  "May I answer that?",
  "I understand that, Your Honor. I would say that I think the record ­­ you know, after all, these aggregate limits were enacted in BCRA, the same statute that ­­ to which that legislative record pertains, and that really does go to the same problem.

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The framers gave the Federal Government exclusive control over the treaty function to ensure that it could knit the nation together as one and allow it to be fully sovereign in the conduct of foreign affairs.

  "No, I am ­­ I am answering. I think I already answered it once, Justice Scalia, but I'll answer it again. The answer is I think, given this ­­ a practice going back to the founding of the Republic, the practice should be ­­ the practice should govern, but we don't have that here. This provision has been subject to contention as to its meaning since the first days of the Republic.",
  "But the word \"happens\" may not always be an apt phrase, the phrase \"may happen,\" the constitutional phrase, but it is a natural use. And if I may, Justice Alito, I'll give you a counterexample. If Congress had enacted a statute in the summer of 2008 that said the Federal Reserve is invested with all powers necessary to deal with any financial emergency that may happen in 2009, if that emergency first arose in November of 2008, I don't think anybody would interpret that statute as denying the Federal Reserve the authority that Congress conferred. And that's because \"may happen\" ­­ \"may happen\" won't cover every situation of a persisting state, but it's certainly a natural reading of it that covers some. And as Jefferson said, it's certain ­­ in this context, it's certainly susceptible of being interpreted to mean ­­",
  "So I think I have two points to make in response to the question of what to do. The first one is that, with respect to the original understanding, we do think that the term \"recess\" and the phrase \"the recess\" certainly, at the time of the founding, did encompass recesses that occurred during a session of Congress, during a session of a legislature, and not just in between sessions of the legislature. I would point the Court to Jefferson's Manual of Parliamentary Procedure, which describes a recess by adjournment as occurring within a session. I would point to the Adjournment Clause itself, which says if the ­­ one house of Congress wants to take a break of longer than 3 days during the session, it needs the consent of the other house, which indicates that the Framers contemplated the possibility of a break longer than 3 days. I would point the Court to the parliamentary practice of the House of Commons, where the speaker of the House of Commons had authority to call elections when a member died during the recess.",
  "I think the ­­ the way we resolve that problem is by looking to the Adjournment Clause. We think, if it's a break that is sufficiently short, that it wouldn't require the ­­ wouldn't require the one House to get the consent of the other, but that's a de minimis recess, and that's not a recess in which the President would have authority ­­",
  "Well, but the problem with the pro forma sessions, I think, Justice Kennedy, is in thinking about the length of the recess. The recess, we would submit ­­ and this is based on the formal dictionary definition of \"recess\" at the time of the founding and now, which is \"a suspension of business,\" the recess was from January 3 when the session started until January 23. And the reason I think that ­­",
  "There is a recess. And the reason is because the Senate has issued a formal order that no business shall be conducted and that's a formal ­­",
  "I think that it's a ­­ that's a different case, and I think, concededly, a significantly harder case for the Executive because here ­­",
  "Well, I think it is significant, Mr. Chief Justice. It's a formal action by the Senate by rule saying that no business shall be conducted. And then in addition, there are other formal actions that the Senate took during this period that are confirming indicia. The Senate passed ­­ the Senate passed a resolution that gave committees the authority to submit reports and report bills. They passed a resolution giving the ­­ the President Pro Tempore the power to sign enrolled bills. It passed ­­",
  "I think there has to be a limit to that point, Justice Kagan, because, after all, what we're talking about here is a power that the Constitution gives to the President, the power in Article II, and the President has got to make the determination of when there's a recess.",
  "Sure. Of course, it could.",
  "That's true.",
  "That's true. They could ­­ they could decide not to take a recess.",
  "That's absolutely true. But ­­ but it seems to me that that is the choice that the Constitution puts ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "I think our view is that it's hard to see how the ­­ what the ­­ what the Senate did with pro forma sessions complies with either and ­­",
  "Or there is another option, Justice Breyer.",
  "No, no. I don't think you need ­­ I don't think you need to write that opinion.",
  "Because you might, perhaps, give the Senate some deference with respect to requirements that apply only internally to the Congress. But when what you're talking about is the Senate's use of pro forma sessions in a manner that deprives the President of authority that Article II would otherwise give to the President ­­",
  "So why ­­",
  "So it's important for multiple reasons, with respect to practicalities and fundamental questions of constitutional structure. Let me start with practicalities and with the happens point, the \"may happen\" point, that our appendix doesn't purport to be comprehensive or anything like comprehensive. Part of the reason why it can't be comprehensive is that there really aren't records of when the vacancy first arose with respect to huge numbers of recess appointments, and that's because, I submit, it wasn't considered material. But second, I can ­­ there are ­­ there are numerous practical examples in our history of when it made a very great deal of difference that the President had the authority to make an appointment to a vacancy that preexisted the recess. We have mentioned the 1948 example; the Secretary of Labor dies on the verge of a very extended intra­session recess by the ­­ by the Senate. They're going to be out for a month, back for 12 days, and then out all the way from June ­­ they go out in June, they're out for a month, they are back for 12 days, and then they're out all the way until December 31st. The Secretary of Labor dies just in advance of them going out in June, and this is ­­ remember, 1948 is a period of significant labor unrest. They needed a Secretary of Labor in place.",
  "Well, two answers. I don't think its original purpose has disappeared. I mean, the NLRB was going to go dark. It was going to lose its quorum.",
  "And that gets to the second point, which is that it may be true, as a matter of raw power, that the Senate has the ability to sit on nominations for months and years at a time, but that is 100 miles from what the Framers would have expected. If you look at what Hamilton said in Federalist 76 about the advice and consent role of the Senate, he said he thought it would be a power that was rarely exercised and would operate, if at all, invisibly or silently. And in the early days of the Republic, it was ­­ advice and consent was a matter of days, not months and years.",
  "Well, I do ­­ I think this ­­ I think the recess power may now act as a safety valve given that intransigence, and that is actually quite consistent ­­",
  "So let me take a half a step back, if I could, Justice Ginsburg, and answer that question in this way ­­ you know, perhaps it sounds like this is an aggressive assertion of executive authority, but I'd ask the Court to think back to Federalist 51. And what the Framers were most concerned about was that Congress, in the separation of powers calculus, was going to amass authority and drain authority and energy from the Executive, and therefore, the Executive needed to be fortified against those actions by Congress. And one specific way in which the Framers decided to fortify the Executive was by rejecting the notion that the appointment power should reside with the Senate. The Framers considered that, and they rejected it. And the reason they rejected it, as this Court noted in its Edmund opinion, was ­­ was to protect the Executive against encroachment by the legislature.",
  "Well, but those things ­­ there are often situations in which the Senate is not in session when a vacancy becomes open or needs to be filled, I guess would be the more accurate way to say it. The examples ­­ I'll give you another example, if I could, from the 1940s. Taft­Hartley gets enacted in 1947 in the summer. One requirement of Taft­Hartley is that the general counsel of the NLRB must enforce the ban on secondary boycotts within a fixed period of time, 30 or 60 days. Well, it turns out there is no general counsel of the NLRB at that time, so President Truman ­­",
  "Well, actually, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to multi­member boards, the Vacancy Act doesn't cover them. That's one reason we have the problem here. But beyond that, the Framers made a judgment that this wasn't going to be left to congressional largesse. That's why there is a Recess Appointment Clause, and it's not left to the Congress.",
  "That's true, Justice Scalia. But the ­­",
  "Well, I think it seems to me the Framers made a different judgment because they gave the President both the power to call back in extraordinary circumstances and the recess appointment power. And if the Framers had intended the power to call back to be the way to deal with vacancies during absences of the Senate, then ­­",
  "So what I would say about this, and also to your point, Mr. Chief Justice, is we have, I would submit, a stable equilibrium that has emerged over the course of this country's history between the two branches. After all, what we are advocating for here is the status quo. It is the equilibrium that has emerged since Congress ­­ since the Senate started taking lengthy intra­session recesses, Presidents started making recess appointments during those recesses. That began in the Civil War days. It's continued to the present. The President ­­",
  "Well, winning on questions 1 and 2 would be of great importance to the Executive, but we also should win on question 3, and here's why: There isn't a long history reflecting the equilibrium with respect to the use of pro forma sessions in order to restrict the President's ability to use the recess appointment power. There really is no history before 2007 of this daisy chaining of one pro forma session after another after another in conjunction with an order that no business shall be conducted.",
  "No, we don't. I think the right way to think about that is the same way that you would think about if the Senate declares that it's in recess from August 1st until September 15th and then comes back early because an emergency has happened, for example, with Hurricane Katrina. Once they are back in doing business, they are doing business. Now, what the Senate did with respect to the legislation Your Honor identified was they came out of pro forma session, they passed legislation, and then went back in to ­­ they went back in under the order of pro forma session. So they take that action ­­",
  "I don't think that that's an interpretation that really could be squared with the body of contemporaneous evidence from the time of the framing. And I would start with the text of the Constitution itself and the Adjournment Clause, which is at page 91a of the appendix to our brief. And it ­­ one thing it says is that, \"Neither house during the session of the Congress shall, without consent of the other, adjourn for more than 3 days.\" It seems clear from that language that \"the session of the Congress\" is referring to the period that commences on the constitutionally prescribed date and continues until the Congress adjourns sine die because, otherwise, these recesses wouldn't be during the session of the Congress. It's also clear from this language that the framers at least contemplated the possibility of breaks longer than 3 days within sessions because they provided a mechanism to get permission to do it.",
  "No, that's right. But I'm going back now to think about what \"session\" means in the Recess Appointment Clause where \"the session\" is also used. I would submit, Your Honor, that it means the same thing as it means here, which is the full session of the Congress.",
  "No, I don't think so because the dictionary definition then and now of recess is a suspension of business. And you could have recesses of that kind, suspensions of business within sessions. That's ­­ Jefferson's parliamentary manual refers to recess by adjournment ­­",
  "Well, I'm just talking now, Justice Sotomayor, if I may, about the intra­session recess point.",
  "Right, but with respect to ­­ putting the pro forma issue aside for a second, with respect to intra­session recesses, the meaning of the \"session,\" it seems to me, is the session, the full session, because you can have ­­ you can have recesses by adjournment, as Jefferson's parliamentary manual said. And as I think I said earlier, there is quite substantial evidence that the term \"the recess\" at the time of the framing could refer to a break during a session and not just breaks between sessions. So I just don't think there is contemporaneous evidence from the framing generation that would lead you to conclude that intra­session recesses are not within the meaning of the word \"recess.\"",
  "Okay.",
  "I don't ­­ I don't think that that's ­­ I don't think that that ­­ I don't think that's its purpose, but it is in the Constitution. The President has the authority to make appointments ­­",
  "Well, I don't think that language points unambiguously in one direction.",
  "A vacancy is an enduring state, and from the perspective of the ­­",
  "I tried with my statutory example before, but from ­­",
  "No, it was an emergency. It was the statutory example about a financial emergency that may happen, which is a state, just like the vacancy.",
  "Well, a vacancy is an enduring state. From the perspective of the ­­",
  "Well, I think ­­",
  "Your Honor, maybe this statutory ­­ maybe the language in the Constitution looks unambiguous to you now, but it has been the subject of contention, it has been thought to be ambiguous from the time of George Washington to the President ­­ to the present. And with respect to the question of the practice and there being ­­ I don't think it's correct to assume that because there are a certain number of identified examples of preexisting vacancies being filled in our appendix, that that's a sum total. I think this is far, far less than the sum total. It represents ­­",
  "The fact ­­ the fact that ­­ the fact it happens ­­",
  "But the fact that \"may happen\" is a phrase that isn't always apt to describe an enduring state doesn't mean it's never apt to describe an enduring state. It's what Jefferson thought. It's what ­­ it's ­­ it has been the understanding, since the framing, that there is ambiguity here and there ­­",
  "I don't know why they put the language in there, Mr. Chief Justice, but it doesn't ­­ it isn't superfluous because it does serve that function, whatever their intent.",
  "And we don't disagree with that. We think it's just what Wirt said. It's ­­ does no violence to the language and is consistent with the purpose of the ­­ of the clause. And from the ­­ from the perspective of the purpose of the clause, the office is equally vacant, whether that vacancy arose the day before or the day after the Senate went into recess. The Senate is equally unavailable to act because they're dispersed, whether the vacancy arose the day before or the day after. And the public's need that the office be filled so that the laws can be faithfully executed is the same whether the vacancy arose the day before or the day after.",
  "And so you do have that very established practice that is completely in accord with the purpose and the structure.",
  "I think that's a way harder case for us. I would agree with that, Justice Ginsburg, and ­­ but they're two things. One is that formalities do matter; and two, going back to the point you made earlier, Justice Kagan, I think it's not an accident that there's a no­business order in place. It's because that's what gives the Senators the protection to know that they can leave town without somebody else going to the ­­",
  "Well, I think if they did business each of the three days, then you wouldn't have a situation in which no business was conducted and you wouldn't meet the definition of a recess. But that's a different case than this one.",
  "No, I think the problem with looking at it that way, Justice Kagan, is that that's the end of the recess appointment power. You write it out of the Constitution, if you look at it that way, because all the Senate needs to do is stay in pro forma session until 11:59 a.m., on January 3rd when that term ends and the next term starts, and then there are no inter­session recesses ­­",
  "Well, this does. This does. And whether something else might or might not, I guess we could try to fight that out if the Senate were ever to do it. But I assume, if this Court were to hold that pro forma sessions of this kind are not real and they don't defeat the President's recess appointment power, that maybe the Senate would think twice before doing something like that.",
  "Yes.",
  "That would be a different case because they would be ­­",
  "­­ they would be there ­­ they would be here. You know, they're not ­­ they're in business for something.",
  "It's not because the recess ­­ or the definition of recess is when no business shall be conducted. And that's exactly what the Senate said. If I may reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me begin with a couple of points on intra­session recesses. With respect to the question that Justice Alito raised, it would have been perfectly familiar to the Framers that a legislative body could take an intra­session recess. Jefferson's parliamentary manual written while he was Vice President and presiding over the Senate specifically refers to recesses by adjournment that occur within a session and the session resumes when they are over. The adjournment clause itself contemplates the need for approval by the other branch for a period longer than three days during the session. I think it's difficult to imagine that if, as Justice Alito's hypothetical suggested, that the Senate had in the first years under President Washington decided to take a two­month, intra­session break, that President Washington wouldn't have been able to staff the offices of the fledgling republic using the recess appointment power.",
  "We think the number should ­­ should be the number in the Adjournments Clause, 3 days or less. Now, Presidents have exercised restraint and there haven't been recess appointments in periods below 10 days, but we think that would be the line. Now ­­",
  "Well, I think that there isn't really a need for explanation. A recess is a suspension of business, and what the Adjournment Clause really suspending your business, but if you are gone for more than 3 days you are. And I think that is quite consistent with the argument that my friends on the other side are making. Now, with respect to the history on intra­session recess appointments, really if you look at the congressional directory, which is a document that we cite in our brief, and you just look at the column that says intra­session recesses, you will see page after page of blank space until you get to the Civil War era when intra­session recesses become more frequent. And intra­session recess appointments really just precisely parallel the increasing use by the Senate of intra­session recesses.",
  "Well, if they ­­",
  "Well, a couple of things about that, Mr. Chief Justice. The Pay Act, of course, was first enacted in this period, in the 1860s, when the first intra­session recess appointments occurred. The Pay Act, even in its original form never said ­­ and since, never said anything about trying to restrict intra­session appointments. If the Congress felt that these were improper, they could have done what they did in the Tenure of Office Act and passed a statute of making it a crime for somebody to take one of these appointments. But they didn't do anything like that.",
  "Of course.",
  "Well, we would. But in terms of ­­",
  "But in terms of ­­",
  "But in terms of an expression of their disagreement as opposed to acquiescence it would certainly be a question of disagreement, and it didn't happen.",
  "But they didn't, I guess, would be, or the point being ­­",
  "­­ senators ­­",
  "Yeah, but he famously objected to it, Mr. Chief Justice, by saying that the intra­session recess ought to be 30 days or longer, not that intra­session recesses are inappropriate as a matter of constitutional power. So I actually think that is just haggling about the length of the recess, not about the existence of the power. Now, if I can move to the question of ­­",
  "Well, the Senator who objects can say whatever the Senator wants, but we don't have a historical record of objection. We have a historical record of acquiescence.",
  "Well, if the Congress as a body thought that these were inappropriate they could take legislative action to try to limit the President's authority, and they just, they never have.",
  "Well, we agree on the ­­ we certainly agree on the criminalizing point, but in terms of the Pay Act, for example, they just never in all their ­­ in their original consideration of the Pay Act and subsequent, they never tried to address this. Now if I could turn to the ­­",
  "And, yes, Your Honor, and of course ­­ and that's an individual objecting and it's not the Senate objecting.",
  "I was thinking the same thing, Your Honor. There were a couple of committee reports but I believe those were on the \"happen\" issue, and let me turn to that, if I could. Now Your Honor had pointed out the number of – on happens, the number of appointments. As I said, don't take that chart as comprehensive. As we said in our brief, it's not; we think there are many more, and of course 39 Presidents have made those appointments. Now, the purposes of the clause as we discussed earlier, I think, are far better served by our reading than the other side's. Jefferson gave a reasonable textual reading, and then Your Honor asked about the Pay Act. The Pay Act of course says if the nomination ­­ if the vacancy arose within 30 days, but it says something else, too, which is if a nomination is pending ­­",
  "I guess what I ­­",
  "Yes, of course. And what I would point out by analogy also is that there is another provision in the Pay Act, the very same statute, that says so long as a nomination is pending, even if the vacancy arose more than 30 days, that's the same expression of Congress's views about what's appropriate. What they care about is the chance to exercise their advice against the ­­",
  "That is an expression of the law of the United States that the Congress enacted.",
  "Well, I think it, as I said, I think there is an equilibrium here and the 30 days doesn't fully capture it. And let me just talk about that if I could.",
  "Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, briefly. The vast majority of appointees are submitted for advice and consent. That was true historically; it's true now. The vast majority of recess appointees are subsequently confirmed. So it's just not the case that this is an end­run around the advice and consent role of the Senate. And there are powerful reasons, of course, why Presidents do that. They don't want to have temporary appointments that they have got to then deal with vacancies again, and they don't want to unnecessarily create inter­branch friction. The real problem, I would submit here, is that if you go with Respondents on the pro forma issue or under the ­­ on the two underlying issuesthat the D.C. Circuit ruled on, you really are writing the recess appointment power out of the Constitution, and that's antithetical to the liberty­enhancing properties of separation of powers that Madison described in Federalist 51, because ambitions should counteract ambitions. They shouldn't disarm one side. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The line drawn in Abood is sound. It has the force of stare decisis behind it, it is completely consistent with this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, and it requires affirmance. If I could, I'd like to turn to the questions that Justice Kennedy has raised because I do think it gets to the key issue in the case. I think the key point ­­ the key takeaway in this case is that the context we are dealing with here is the government as proprietor and manager of its own operations. And this Court's case law has said, over and over again, that in that context, two things follow. First, the government's interest in the effective and efficient carrying out of its own operations is entitled to very substantial weight, more substantial weight than it would get if you were looking at the government as a sovereign regulating the citizenry. And second, yes, Justice Kennedy, indeed, as Your Honors' opinion in Garcetti and Your Honors' opinion in Borough of Duryea recognized both times, the employees' First Amendment interests are diminished to the extent that the government has more latitude when the government can show that the obligation it is imposing is in furtherance of the government's legitimate interests as manager of its own operations.",
  "Yes. Let me do my best to try to clear that up, Mr. Chief Justice. I'm going to give you the best answer I can to your question. Remember, Medicaid, of course, is a joint Federal/State program. The Federal government provides funds; the State provides funds. Here, we're operating within a waiver program in which the State is given considerable latitude to set wages and set rates, so long as it is saving money as compared to the institutionalization of this population. My understanding is that HHS will review wage rates set to make sure that they meet very general parameters. They were of the kind described in the Douglas case that was before the Court a couple of years ago.",
  "That ­­ are they high enough to make sure the services providing ­­ they're provided effectively and are they ­­ and are they constrained enough that you’re not wasting money­­",
  "Right, but it's not that the ­­ but the Federal government isn't approving the specific hourly wage rate as Medicaid reimbursement within this program. That's a judgment that the Medicaid program leaves to the considerable discretion of the State.",
  "Not as I understand it. I think applying the line of Lehnert, that that would be on the impermissible side of the line. That would be effectively seeking to change public policy by changing what the legislature or the ­­",
  "I think ­­ my understanding is that that would be ­­ the question there was at which side of the line that the Court drew in Lehnert is that on. I think that's probably on the ­­ on the impermissible side of the line. But that's where the fight would be. It would be over where that line should be drawn, not over whether the ­­ whether the State, as manager of its own operations, can use collective bargaining with a fair share, as Justice Scalia mentioned earlier, in a way that private employers routinely do. I mean, I do think that's the fundamental point of Abood, that private ­­ that the government as employer, as manager of its own operations, ought to be able to make the same kind of choice that private employers make when they think it advances their interests in efficiency and sound operations.",
  "No, they would not, Justice Alito, and we're not ­­ we're not here making an argument that, as a matter of policy, States ought to adopt fair share or not. The thing that matters to us is the principle of First Amendment law that's at stake.",
  "It hasn't, but the key point for us, the point of vital importance for the United States here, is that the Court continue to recognize the context ­­ the First Amendment context of the government as manager of its own operations. And whatever choice the United States has made, many States have made different choices in their role as manager of their own operations. And under the Court's established case law, which Abood, I think, is a quite good example of, the principle that, when the government is acting to further its operations as manager, they get substantial latitude. Now, there's a limit on that, of course. They can't use that authority to ­­ they can't leverage that authority to affect the way citizens interact as citizens ­­",
  "Well, I think ­­",
  "Yes, but, here, we argue ­­",
  "I guess what I would say about that, Justice Scalia, is that one could speculate about motives of States like Illinois, one could speculate about motives of the right­to­work States, but I would suggest that, under our Federal system, that States get to make those kinds of policy choices. And Illinois has made a policy choice, as many private employers have, that using collective bargaining ­­ and it is, I want to stress here, very narrowly tailored collective bargaining. By law, it can only be over wages, hours, and conditions of employment, by law.",
  "I don't think so. When the legislation was enacted, it was enacted with a very large bipartisan margin, and I just don't think it would be appropriate, in the context of the government as manager of its own operations, to look behind and try to consider motive. This is a choice that many ­­",
  "Whatever happened ­­",
  "Well, I think the issue before the Court is the constitutionality of the statute that was enacted subsequent to that by a large bipartisan majority, and I don't think it would be appropriate to look behind the legislature's action to consider and try to evaluate its motives. And I think, under our Federal system, States get to make choices. It's true, not every State does it this way, but many do. They do so for reasons of efficient management of their internal operations, and that's the principle that we think is of critical importance here.",
  "And they ought to have the discretion to make that choice under this Court's case law. That's our position with respect to that. If I could make a point that I think is an important point about the free rider rationale under Abood. There's been some suggestion that the point of the free rider rationale is to ­­ is to force the dissenters ­­ the nonunion members to pay up. I don't think that's the right way to understand the free rider point. That, once the State has imposed a duty of fair representation, then everybody's got an incentive to free ride, whether you're a union supporter or not, because, by operation of law, you're going to get the benefits. It's just a classic logic of collective action problem, and so the ­­ the fair share requirement really is content neutral, in that it's ­­ it's designed to ensure that the union has the funds it needs to carry out the responsibilities that the State wants it to carry out and that that could be jeopardized by supporters, as well as dissidents, deciding that they ­­ that they don't want to pay because they don't have to because the law would get them the benefit of the duty of fair representation even if they didn't. Now, with respect to the question of ­­ of whether Abood should be overruled, I would suggest to the Court that it's got a very powerful stare decisis effect behind it. Abood's not exactly an outlier. It was reaffirmed in Lehnert, in Ellis. It was reaffirmed just in 2009, unanimously, in the Locke case. As Justice Breyer indicated, there is very substantial reliance and contractual reliance throughout the country on the constitutionality of Abood. And as I ­­ I said, I think the most important point here is that the line the Court drew in Abood and the line that has stood for 40 years is entirely consistent with the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence in the context of government as employer, not as regulator of sovereign. Of course, if the government was acting as sovereign regulating the citizenry, an obligation of this kind would trigger the most exacting scrutiny.",
  "Yes, certainly, that question has been raised. But those questions were actually all raised before ­­ may I please ­­",
  "­­ before it was reaffirmed in Lehnert, before it was reaffirmed in Ellis and before it was reaffirmed unanimously in Locke. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Greenhouse gases pose the same threat to public health and welfare when they are emitted from a power plant as when they are emitted from the tailpipe of a car; and in American Electric Power this Court said it was plain that EPA has the authority to prescribe general rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions by stationary sources like power plants. Yet Petitioners say EPA lacks any authority to use the PSD permitting program to regulate the same emissions, from the same sources, causing the same harms.

For example, if one looks at Section 7475(a)(3), which you can find at page 21A of our appendix, you will see that in order to become eligible for a PSD permit if you are a major emitting facility, you've got to ­­ if you are looking at subsection (3), under (3)(A) and (3)(B), you've got to show that you can meet all of the local air quality requirements of the NAAQS, those standards; and then (C) says you've got to meet any other applicable emissions standard or standard of performance under this chapter. And that standard of performance language is not an accident. In 7411 the standards that are set, the nationwide standards that Mr. Keisler was discussing for greenhouse gases or other air pollutants, are called standards of performance. So it's specifically picking up the Section 7411 standard. Then if one turns to the definition of Best Available Control Technology under the PSD program, which you can find at page 34A of the appendix to our brief, you will notice that Congress specifically linked the operation of the Section 7411 standards and the Best Available Control Technology under the PSD program. And what this provision says, I won't belabor you by reading the lengthy provision, but what it says is that once Congress has set a standard under section 7411, a nationwide standard, that becomes a floor for the evaluation of Best Available Control Technology.",
  "Yes, they all three have have to be complied with, yes, Justice ­­",
  "Well, I would be happy to ­­",
  "Well, I would be happy to get to that. But if I could just finish off this point about the connection between the operation of the two, because I do think it's of critical importance here. That what you are supposed to do under BACT is use Best Available Control Technology to get above the floor, that the NSPS program sets those standards on an every 8­year basis, and the point of BACT is to force best practices to keep raising the bar during those 8­year intervals. And there is an additional point to be made about the relationship between the two. This goes back to Senator Muskie in 1977. The NSPS program was enacted as part of the 1970 Act. The PSD program was added in 1977; and it was added in 1977 because of dissatisfaction over both the pace and the comprehensiveness of the ­­ of air pollution regulations that were being enacted by EPA under the 7411 standard; and it's because under 7411, EPA has got to go one source category at a time. It has got to do power plants; then it's got to do refineries; then it's got to do the next thing, and the next thing, and the next thing. And so EPA hadn't gotten standards in place for all the different sources, and the point of ­­ of the PSD program is to put in place an additional requirement. It's exactly what Congress was after. So that when there is a standard under 7411 that becomes the floor, and you ­­ and BACT says let's keep raising the bar. But when there isn't a standard under 7411, PSD is supposed to fill the breach, and it makes sense because you want to get ­­ the PSD program, remember, applies to ­­ excuse me ­­ it applies to new construction or major modification. The idea behind it is you want to get in there at the beginning when the source is first being constructed, so that they don't lock in old pollution ­­ pollution­causing technology. They have got to meet Best Available Control Technology.",
  "Well, it's an evolving process, Your Honor, and there are now 140 or so permits that have been issued applying BACT to greenhouse gas emissions. There is some very helpful discussion of this kind of specifics in two places: The State Respondents' brief, pages 35 to 39, and the Calpine amicus brief. Calpine is a major utility, regulated ­­",
  "Well, it's ­­ one thing we're doing ­­ the main thing now is significant energy efficiency, for example, different kinds of turbines; different kinds of processes, that sort of ­­ that sort of thing. That's right.",
  "Well, I really don't think this is about light bulbs, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "At the ­­ at the moment that's largely true, not entirely true; there are some other technologies described. But of course, the EPA is considering and scientists are trying to develop additional control technologies like carbon capture technologies; and that's the whole point of Best Available Control Technology, is as technology advances and better options come on line, that allow for even greater control of the pollutants, the statute requires that they be incorporated. That's how it's supposed to work.",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Right. Just an aside on the high school football game. Human beings are actually net neutral on carbon emissions, and you will need a chemist to explain that to you. But it doesn't matter how many family members you have; you won't get to the limit. But with respect to the ­­ with respect to the question ­­",
  "The lights at the game I don't think would be a problem, either. But anyway, there obviously is ­­ and EPA has acknowledged that there is a significant expansion of the permitting obligation under EPA's present understanding of permitting. But let me try to take this in two pieces, if I could. Let me first talk about why it's not just about the 3 percent, and then let me try to get back to Justice Kennedy's question to talk about the expansion of the permitting obligation and what EPA is actually thinking and doing about that. The problem here is that the options ­­ one of the problems, significant problem is that the options that the ­­ the American Chemistry Council have advanced and even that Judge Kavanaugh has advanced would require an invalidation of or at least a significant, a significant revision of EPA's 34­year understanding of the meaning of the phrase \"any air \"pollutant\" in 7479(1), which they have always interpreted to mean any ­­ any air pollutant subject to regulation under the Act. That ­­ you can't apply that 34­year­long agency interpretation here and get to one of those results. You've got to ­­ you've got to change it.",
  "No, it's not, Justice Scalia, of course.",
  "Well, I ­­ with all due respect, I don't think that's what the agency is doing. And if I may, just ­­ let me, if I could just sort of finish off this. The problem is that if you take the ­­ if you draw the line either at NAAQS pollutants versus all other previously regulated pollutants, or if you draw the line at local pollutants, but not global pollutants, you are going to knock out some sources that have been subjected to the permitting requirement previously.",
  "Yes, they did say that.",
  "No, that's a fundamental misconception, Justice Alito, and I would like to try to clear it up, and it goes to ­­ I'll try to answer Your Honor's question as well, Justice Scalia. What EPA's doing here is saying this is a transition, it's not a rewrite. And the goal of the transition is not to gradually expand the permitting requirement until they've got all the Dunkin' Donuts in America under it. That's not what's going on. In fact, it's the opposite. What they're saying is, they're taking a look at the standards they used to decide who's eligible for a permit. They're looking to change those, to the extent they can, consistent with their statutory authority and appropriate Chevron deference, to substantially narrow the numbers of people who will be deemed eligible. And that's in particular ­­",
  "No, this is ­­ this is to try to get to the statutory threshold. Well, let me give you an example of the main ­­ one of the main ways ­­",
  "Under the point ­­ the nuance there, that I think answers Your Honor's question, is that there ­­ the agency has discretion in deciding what constitutes the potential to emit 250 tons per year. What they have done historically is evaluate that on the basis of an assumption that it's facilities operating 24 hours a day ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "It is. But I think the two things converge, Justice Breyer. They're trying to get to the point of saying that you won't have to apply ­­ if you apply the standards EPA uses now, you sweep in all these people, and EPA says, well ­­",
  "Right.",
  "That's correct.",
  "So the ­­ it's the reason I tried to suggest earlier, Justice Breyer, that the PSD program is supposed to work as a complement together with 7411. For example, if 7411 now is being used, at least EPA's contemplating setting standards, greenhouse gas emission standards for power plants. That's a very significant contributor of greenhouse gases, but it's not the only one. There are refineries, there are other major sources ­­",
  "They can do all of that, but the ­­ but the problem is that that's going to take a lot of time, and that was the very reason Congress put the PSD program into existence in 1977 was because of the dissatisfaction, because of the time it took to go source by source, pollutant by pollutant under the EPA's 7411 program.",
  "No, you can set a national standard.",
  "But part of the reason, as I said, I think it's just wrong to think about the PSD program as being ­­ addressing a different kind of problem from the 7411 problem is that you've got to meet the 7411 standard in your PSD application.",
  "I take that point, Your Honor. I don't actually think that's what EPA was trying to do. I know it's been portrayed that way. I think that they were trying to do the opposite. They were trying to say, well, let's look at how we define what it means to emit 250 tons per year, and see if we can make that a more realistic analysis by going from the 24/7, 365­day­a­year hypothesis to figuring out how much this source is actually likely to emit, and you could drastically lower the number of sources who would be found to emit 250 tons per year, and that would bring ­­ it would try to bring the system into line with the expectations that major emitters would be regulated. That ­­ that's their objective here.",
  "Well, I'd like to make a point, if I could, about that. The real problem here is CO2. Actually, of the other ­­ of the six greenhouse gases, the other five you could use the statutory thresholds on without difficulty. It's the CO2 alone really that causes a difficulty.",
  "Well, I think, in fairness, what EPA is saying here is that we've got an obligation under the statute to regulate. We've got an obligation to require a permit when there's more than 250 tons per year, and we've got an obligation to get the permits out within a year. That's also a statutory requirement. And that just given the reality of the CO2 emission, something's got to give. So I don't think it's that they're asserting authority to rewrite the statutory thresholds. They're dealing with a practical problem that's arisen under the immediate circumstances.",
  "But I think the reason, Justice Ginsburg, is because that is not going to make ­­ the carbon dioxide is also a huge part of the problem, and so you're really not going to be getting to the heart of the problem. And there really is an urgency here, you know, that's part of what's driving EPA in this situation, of course, is understanding that this is an urgent environmental problem. It's the ­­ it is the gravest environmental problem that we face now as far as EPA and EPA's judgment, and it is one that gets worse with the passage of time. The effects are cumulative and they're delayed, and so every year we wait, we make the hole deeper and we create an even greater threat to future generations. And that really goes to ­­",
  "Well, if you're ­­ if you're going to use the NAAQS approach and designate it as a NAAQ, as a NAAQS pollutant, then you would be under the rules of NAAQS pollutant and ­­ pollutants, and that would include this standard. But this is ­­",
  "I think it would be within EPA's authority to do so, but there are really significant problems with trying to regulate that way, and that's why ­­ but ­­ and ­­ but it's important to understand, Mr. Chief Justice, that the PSD program applies to more than just NAAQS pollutants. It's ­­ it's any pollutant subject to regulation under the Act.",
  "I guess what I would say about that is that if EPA found itself in exactly the same circumstances it finds itself in with respect to greenhouse gases, where it's ­­ it feels like the statutory definition compels it to regulate, it kicks in at 250, and you've got to issue a permit in a year, that they could make a judgment comparable to the one they made here. But it's ­­ that would require that confluence of circumstances to arise.",
  "Well, if the Court were to do that, that would certainly justify the EPA's judgement ­­",
  "Well, EPA has committed itself in this ­­ in the regulations, in the rulemaking proceedings, to try to bring the 250 tons per year into alignment with the expectation that only large sources will be regulated. That's what EPA is committed to. It's ­­",
  "Two points about that, if I could. First, that goes to the question of what triggers the permit application. It's only the expansion of the number of permit applicants that even raises this question of the so­called absurdity. It doesn't go to the ­­ to the argument ­­ the Petitioners are making a far more substantial argument, that EPA lacks any authority to consider greenhouse gas emission under the BACT provision and other provisions, even for sources that have a permit for their emissions of non­greenhouse gases. So it only goes to the question of the scope of the triggering provision, not to EPA's authority to use PSD to regulate greenhouse gases for entities that are already subject to the permit for other reasons. Now, with respect to the trigger, what I would say about that, Justice Scalia, is that the statutory language is \"any air pollutant.\" Reading Massachusetts against EPA, the EPA came to the conclusion that that language necessarily encompasses greenhouse gas emissions. That conclusion is most consistent with the EPA's statutory obligations here, because if the choice ­­ and you can say the choice is between doing something sensible and absurd results. But really, the choice is between throwing up your hands with respect to what EPA considers to be the most serious air pollution problem we have or trying to deal with the implementation problem that exists with respect to the ­­",
  "­­ about 15 percent of the sources. That's really the choice here.",
  "Yes, that's exactly the argument, and I think that's exactly what EPA did when it read Massachusetts against EPA and its understanding of air pollutant and thought about that in the context of the regulatory goals of this program.",
  "I think that states it fairly. I think that states it fairly.",
  "I think that was Justice Breyer who said \"unthinkable.\"",
  "That's certainly true, but it wasn't ­­ but it ­­ also, even before Massachusetts, it had ­­ there's significant problems with it.",
  "Obviously, I wouldn't characterize it quite that way. I don't have a case that's exactly on point. I think Morton against Ruiz is a case that's like this in the sense that the agency had an obligation to provide something to a certain population, and it didn't have the funds that made it available to provide it to the whole population that was statutorily entitled, and it made the judgments it made to try to get the program to work. And I mean, if I could give you a hypothetical ­­",
  "Morton against Ruiz. And ­­ and if I gave you a hypothetical on that ­­ if Congress enacted a statute that said that the ­­ the Customs authorities, border authorities have an obligation to search every cargo container that comes into a port in the United States for radioactive materials, but no container shall be delayed more than 3 days, if a ­­ if an agency were faced with those kinds of obligations, and it didn't have the resources to get every container searched within 3 days, and it said, well, what we're going to do is search the containers that come from places where we think the risk is most likely, I think everyone would think that that's a reasonable interpretation of the ­­ of the agency's charge under the statute; and that's essentially what the EPA has done here.",
  "No. I think ­­ I want to provide some more specificity, though, in my answer, if I could. The Court has held in American Electric Power that the EPA has the authority to prescribe general national standards. Now, with respect to the PSD program, I want to ­­ I do want to emphasize that there is a distinction between the question of what triggers your obligation to get a PSD permit and whether your emissions of greenhouse gases count as any air pollutant that triggers it, versus a situation in which if you are already subject to a PSD permit because you are emitting, say, a NAAQS pollutant or another one of the regulated pollutants, whether under Section 7574(a)(4), you have to meet the Best Available Control Technology requirement, which is phrased in terms of a requirement for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Act.",
  "That's correct, Your Honor. That's correct. And so I think those things are different. And so there really are three points. There's 7411, there's triggering, and then there's if ­­ if you're already subject to the permit. And the questions about whether the PSD program is limited entirely to pollutants that affect local ambient air quality, I just don't think that adds up at the end of the day. For one thing, EPA has been regulating since 1988 under the PSD program something called ozone­depleting substances. We talked about this a little bit in our brief. Those are substances that have no local effects; they ­­ they are substances that are released; they go up into the stratosphere; and they eat up the ozone and that then creates additional ultraviolet rays which cause cancer and cataracts.",
  "Well, that ­­ well, if those local effects count, then certainly, greenhouse gases have those kinds of local effects, because they raise the sea levels, which cause flooding in certain places and they cause droughts in other places. And so, to the extent you're talking about local effects, the greenhouse gases really aren't local ­­",
  "Well, certainly Massachusetts, but ­­ but with respect ­­ but EPA has been regulating ozone­depleting substances since 1988.",
  "Yes. In fact, we think in 1990, that they ratified it. Because in 1990, Congress undertook a very substantial amendment of the Clean Air Act. One thing they did was specifically address ozone­depleting substances. They created a new Title VI for ozone­depleting substances, so they were clearly focused on it. And they did not pull ozone­depleting substances out of the PSD program at that time. They left them in. And that's significant because they did pull out hazardous air pollution ­­ air pollutants, which was another new category they created in 1990 for the PSD program.",
  "2 years. It was 2 years.",
  "I don't know if it was a full 2 years, but ­­ but the Congress focused specifically on exactly how ozone­depleting substances were going to be regulated under the Clean Air Act, and they created a new ­­ they were ­­ it's not an accident. They were focused exactly on how they were going to be regulated. So I do think ­­ so I do think it's quite a strong ratification argument. And ­­",
  "I knew you were going to ask me that question.",
  "So I actually think, you know, there's the Judge Kavanaugh approach, there's the ACC approach, you know, we ­­ obviously, we're not endorsing this, but ­­",
  "There is a significant difference between them. But ­­",
  "Well, I've got another thought on that subject ­­",
  "­­ which is, as I said to Justice Alito earlier, the whole problem in terms of expanding the permitting requirement is CO2. And so that if the Court were to say that \"any air pollutant\" can't be interpreted in the way that EPA has interpreted it at the trigger level, to mean what we think it says, and what Massachusetts against EPA compelled, but if the Court disagrees with that, it seems to me the ­­ the answer that is least problematic from EPA's point of view does the ­­ is the least dissonant and the least ­­ causes the least risk of collateral consequences with respect to established regulatory programs, which go beyond NAAQS pollutants under PSD, would be to say that you can't read any air pollutant to include CO2, because the inclusion of CO2 generates a permitting obligation that is out of accord with what Congress would have expected. I think ­­ I'm not endorsing that, but I think that's ­­",
  "Well, no, BACT would be in ­­ that's just at the trigger, Justice Ginsburg. Just at the trigger. We think that the ­­ I just don't see, given that BACT says in unambiguous terms in Section 7475(a)(4) that anybody who's subject to a permit has got to meet BACT for each pollutant subject to regulation under the chapter, meaning the Act. I just don't see how you can get out from under that ­­",
  "Well, if the command of the statute is that BACT applies for each pollutant subject to regulation ­­",
  "Right, but I think ­­",
  "Well, 7475(3)(c) also does say that if ­­ if EPA does set a greenhouse gas standard for a particular stationary source like power plants, then that becomes a condition of the permit. That's what (c)(3) says. And so between (c)(3) and BACT, greenhouse gas ­­ assuming that EPA acts under 7411, those, it seems to me, have to be in. This is a question about the definition of the trigger. Now, we don't agree with it. But ­­ but in trying to faithfully answer Your Honor's question, that's what I think. That that's ­­",
  "If you took CO2 out of the equation, I don't think this ­­ the expanded scope of the permitting obligation is going to happen, because it's the CO2 emissions that expand the scope. And so that's why ­­ you know, I'm not endorsing this. I'm just saying ­­",
  "That's correct.",
  "Pretty close. But I think ­­ but I think the reason that we would ­­ the reason that the exclusion of CO2 seems to me to be the least problematic is that EPA does have an established regulatory framework here that applies not just to NAAQS pollutants, but to the other non­NAAQS pollutants, sulfuric acid mist and the other things that EPA regulates under the PSD program. And you wouldn't be redefining the trigger to exclude those things which have previously been included. That's, I think, the ­­ the rifle shot solution, to the extent that the Court thinks it's a problem.",
  "Yes, certainly that's right. Certainly, that's right. But I think the ­­ the argument that, as I ­­ as I read Judge Kavanaugh's opinion and as I understood my friend's argument on behalf of the ACC, was that the statute essentially compelled the conclusion that you had to pick one or the other of those alternative readings in order to avoid expanding the permitting obligation. And the problem with that way of thinking about it is that there are many other pollutants, non­NAAQS pollutants that EPA has regulated for years and used as a trigger for years to require PSD permits, which you would be at risk of excluding from the program if you were to adopt the ACC or the Judge Kavanaugh reading as triggers, and that's a problem that, it seems to me, the Court ought to be thinking about trying to avoid.",
  "So at the ­­ at the ­­ sustaining the argument that the trigger applies here, I do think there aren't ­­ there aren't a lot of cases. You're right. This is not a ­­ a situation that arises very often. I think Morton against Ruiz comes the closest.",
  "No, it's not, Mr. Chief Justice. That's true. It was cited and relied upon by the EPA in the rulemaking proceedings and rulemaking opinions. So if I could just sum up here. The EPA did what it did because the problem it's confronting is a problem that EPA considers to be urgent.",
  "You know, I'm glad you raised that, Justice Alito. That's actually quite important. That's just not right. I mean, if you think about it in multiple ways, there are multiple pollutants that are currently regulated under the PSD program. Some of them have National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and the local testing makes sense for those. Others don't have National Air Quality ­­ Ambient Air Quality Standards, like sulfuric acid mists, for example, and others. There aren't standards for those. And the way EPA has handled that is they look at the regulations. The regulation says in terms of the monitoring that the statute requires, there's a specific exemption for substances that are otherwise regulated but for which there is no NAAQS or related standard. So they're just exempt from the monitoring requirement. There's also an analysis requirement. And what EPA has said and what the States do in their permitting processes with respect to the analysis requirement for the non­NAAQS substances, for example, sulfuric acid mists, is to apply a very simple idea. You're not trying in that situation to make sure that the particular emissions aren't having ­­ are consistent with the overall ambient air quality level. It's a very simple calculus. More is worse; less is better. And so with respect to things like sulfuric acid mist, with respect to things like ozone­depleting substances, that is how it has always worked at the State level under the PSD program. You just ­­ you look at what the BACT emissions levels are. You try to get them down. And so you're not treating greenhouse gases any differently than sulfuric acid mist or ozone­depleting substances or the others that don't have those requirements. And then in terms of localized effects versus wider effects, I mean, I would just remind the Court about the EMC­Homer City case from just a few months ago, it's not at all unusual that the EPA would be regulating emissions in one place because they ­­ they impose effects hundreds or even thousands of miles away. The pollutants emitted in Ohio or Kentucky contribute to the air pollution levels in New Haven or Bangor, Maine. That's what that case was all about. And so ­­ and you regulate those pollutants also through the PSD program. And so you don't ­­ you aren't in that situation looking just to see what happens in the local area. It's just never been the nature of this program. It's not ­­ it just doesn't work that way. And if I could just remind the Court, in conclusion, why EPA did what it did, it is because this is an urgent problem. Every year that passes, this problem gets worse, and the threat to future generations get worse. And I think, faced with the obligations that EPA had, it made the most reasonable choice available to it. Thank you.",
  "You should have told me that before my summation.",
  "Yes. Certainly ­­",
  "Well, I think ­­",
  "You would want to look at the definition of what it means to emit 250 tons per year, and then you'd want to think about the underlying notion that what Congress is trying to do is to impose these obligations on facilities that are capable of responding to them, that are going to tend to be facilities that are major in quality. And then those are the things that are going to guide you in trying to figure out what the number is. And I think that is what EPA is trying to do.",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Kagan. The same class of emitters as?",
  "It might ­­ I don't think it would ­­",
  "I think ­­ I don't know that it will be the same, but I think it'll be ­­ but I think the ­­ the class will be a lot smaller than the class under EPA's current understanding of what it means to emit 250 tons per year.",
  "Yeah, they tried to explain that in ­­ in one of the rulemaking orders, and I think what they did was to try to figure out the right balance point where they were accomplishing very significant emissions limitations while not sweeping in sources that were ­­ these very large number of small sources that were only making the incremental ­­ an incremental difference. And what EPA did was say, essentially, we can get to 85 percent of the emissions we're trying to get to by setting the standards where we've set them.",
  "Well, I think the streamlining. Same idea, I mean ­­",
  "Well, I ­­",
  "There would be a helpful point for us, but for this, and then I'll tell you why ­­ explain why we didn't, because there is a citizen suit provision in the ­­ in the law. And so the ­­ that's what they'll tell you on rebuttal.",
  "And so, I think that's the reason why, because it's subject to a citizen suit, whether we exercise our ­­",
  "Right.",
  "That's the problem with that. If there are no further questions, thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The touchstone for resolving this case is the principle Justice Jackson articulated in Prince v. Massachusetts. As he said, \"Limitations which of necessity bound religious freedom begin to operate whenever activities begin to affect or collide with the liberties of others or of the public. Adherence to that principle is what makes possible the harmonious functioning of a society like ours, in which people of every faith live and work side by side.\"",

  "No, not ­­",
  "No. But here's how we look at it. At its core ­­",
  "Individuals.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, that's right.",
  "I understood Justice Alito to be asking me not about the corporate form, but about the ­­ the activity. And when you have an individual, you have an individual. It's a person.",
  "That's ­­",
  "That's correct.",
  "Certainly.",
  "And I did try to answer it, yes. But I ­­ but let me say, I think the relevant question here is what did Congress think it was doing in 1993? And I think the answer to that has to be in ­­ you know, we understand the Dictionary Act provides a broad definition of person, but the Dictionary Act doesn't define exercise religion. And the operative statutory language is exercise ­­ person's exercise of religion. And so you can't look to the Dictionary Act to define that. But Congress told you where to look. It told you to look to the pre­Smith case law ­­",
  "­­ to define that.",
  "Yes. But it ­­ but the difference there was to say it didn't want courts to get involved in the entangling enterprise of deciding what was a central belief versus what was ­­",
  "Well, I think it ­­ it said something more precise than that, which was that it was to be interpreted not to be confined only to central religious tenets.",
  "Yes, includes any exercise of religion, but it doesn't define what that is. It just says you don't draw a line between centrality and something that may ­­",
  "Right. And it ­­ but with respect to what exercise religion means, it said don't draw lines between centrality and non­centrality. It didn't go beyond that and tell you what it means. And what RFRA tells you to look to is pre­Smith case law. And in the entire history of this country, there is not a single case in which a for­profit corporation was granted an exemption on ­­",
  "Well, Lee ­­",
  "Well, Lee was certainly a case in which a for­profit enterprise was denied an exemption. Braunfeld was such a case. Gallagher was such a case.",
  "Right. There is not a single case ­­",
  "­­ holding that. Except that in Lee, it was critical to the Court's analysis that the ­­ that the ­­ that Mr. Lee and his business had chosen to enter the commercial sphere.",
  "Right. Well, let me ­­ I do want to move to the compelling interest analysis, but if I could make one point in response to Your Honor's question, that the Court's got to decide what person ­­ a person's exercise of religion means. And that ­­ it seems to me that it would be such a vast expansion of what Congress must ­­ could have thought it was doing in 1993, when it enacted RFRA, to say that for­profit corporations can make claims for religious exemptions to any laws of general application that they want to challenge. I do ­­ you know, Mr. Clement says, well, you don't have to worry about anything other than small, tightly­knit corporations like the one at issue here. I take the point of the appeal of a situation like this one. But the way in which he suggests that you will be able to distinguish this case from a case in which a large corporation comes in or a public company comes in, is that you will have more grounds to question the sincerity of the claim. But that raises exactly the kinds of entanglement concerns that this Court has always said you should try to avoid.",
  "But even with respect to these companies, Your Honor, what are you going to do if there's a dispute between ­­ let's say there are three shareholders ­­ a dispute between two in the majority and one in the minority? You're going to have to get yourself involved ­­ the courts will have to get themselves involved in all kinds of ­­",
  "And then ­­ and the minority shareholder will say, well, this is ­­ under state law, this is an act of oppression and this is ­­",
  "Yes. We think those are correct and that this situation is different.",
  "No, not that the corporation has a race, but that corporations can bring those claims. But you're not interpreting ­­ in that situation, all you're interpreting is the word \"person\" in a statute, not exercise of religion, which is what makes it different here.",
  "Yes, but only \"person.\"",
  "That's correct, but not exercise of religion. That's the difference. But let me, if I could, we think that part of the problem here and the reason we make the argument we do at the threshold about why you ought not recognize claims under RFRA for for­profit corporations is that they are going to predictively give rise to the kinds of issues you have in this case in which the exemption is going to impose a burden on third parties or extinguish rights of third parties, employees or others, and that that ­­ that really can't be what Congress was thinking about. But even if you ­­",
  "And I understand, but if Your Honor disagrees with me ­­ if the Court doesn't agree with this position at the threshold, the same considerations with respect to the harms of third parties definitely play into the compelling­interest analysis. In fact, under RFRA, the standard, the precise standard of the statute says the government must meet is that it must show that the application of the law to the particular parties here, Conestoga and Hobby Lobby, is in furtherance of the government's compelling interest. That's the test. So the question here is whether having Hobby Lobby and Conestoga provide this coverage is in furtherance of the government's interests in ensuring that this kind of preventive service coverage is available and, in particular, the contraceptive coverage that's included within it.",
  "It is part of our argument, absolutely. And ­­ but it ­­ but there is in addition to that, much more ­­",
  "Well, I think it has been examined, Your Honor, is my recollection.",
  "But ­­ but with respect to ­­ but with respect to the ­­ there is a particularized interest here in that what we are talking about is a question of whether 14,000 employees and their families get access to this contraceptive coverage.",
  "So let me ­­ let me go to that ­­",
  "And, Your Honor, I do think that it was appropriate for the agency, in exercising its delegated authority here, to take into account the special solicitude that under our constitutional order churches receive. And it's important to understand, and I want to walk through the ­­ this question of exemptions very carefully because I think there's a lot of confusion here that needs to be cleared up, that all that the ­­ all that the government has done is say that churches, because of that special solicitude, which the Court recognized in Hosanna­Tabor, churches get an exemption. The nonprofit religious organizations don't get an exemption. There's an accommodation there provided, but that accommodation results in the employees receiving access to this ­­ to the contraceptive coverage, so that doesn't diminish the government's compelling interest. The Tenth Circuit and my friends on the other side have relied on this idea that employers with fewer than 50 employees are somehow exempt.",
  "Well, with respect to ­­ as I said, with respect to the churches, it was the special solicitude that churches receive under our Constitution under the First Amendment. But with respect ­­ now with respect to the employers 50 and under, it's just not right to say that there's any kind of an exemption. If they offer health insurance, they're subject to exactly the same per­employee, per­day penalty as larger corporations, exactly the same risk of Labor Department enforcement, exactly the same risk of an ERISA suit by the plan beneficiaries. There is no possible way to look at the statutory scheme and conclude there is an exemption there.",
  "Yes. Let me talk about the grandfathered plans.",
  "I ­­ I can't give you a precise figure as to ­­ there's a clear downward trajectory. There's significant movement downward every year in the numbers. There's every reason to think that's going to continue. I can't give you a precise time when that is going to be ­­",
  "I ­­ I can't give you a representation of exactly how low that number is going to go and exactly how long it's going to take. But I think what you're talking about is a period in which that number is going to go to a very, very low level over a several year period.",
  "No. I don't that's right, Your Honor. And I think ­­ let's ­­ let's look at this, if we could, in toto. That with respect to grandfathering, it's to be expected that employers and insurance companies are going to make decisions that trigger the loss of that so­called grandfathered status under the ­­ under the governing regulation.",
  "Well, the ­­ the question would be whether there's a compelling interest in compliance with these requirements. And I ­­ I'd like to make two points in response to Your Honor's question. First with respect to this issue of delay, which I think, Mr. Chief Justice, your question raised, and my friend on the other side has put a lot of weight on, I'd refer the Court to the ADA. I don't think anybody would doubt that the Americans with Disabilities Act advances interest of the highest order. But when Congress enacted that, it put a two­year delay on the applicability of the discrimination provision.",
  "No. No, Your Honor. There's an even longer delay with respect to those kinds of provisions, but it's just a basic prohibition of discrimination two­year delay, and no one would doubt there's a compelling interest here. And with ­­ and take ­­ take Title VII. My friends on the other side have said, well, this is different because there's so many more people who are going to not have this coverage under the grandfathered plan. But with respect to Title VII, of course, it's still the case that ­­ that employers with 15 or fewer people are not subject to that law, and that's 80 percent of the employers in the country. And if you run the math, that's ­­ it's at least 80 percent ­­ that's ­­ it's going to be somewhere between 10 and 22 million people who are not within the coverage. No one would say that because the coverage is incomplete in that respect, that Title VII ­­ enforcing Title VII doesn't advance ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, the way in which it's implemented is a decision that the agency has made, that's true. But even with respect to the preventive services, I don't think anyone would say that there's not a compelling interest in advancing colorectal cancer screening and immunizations and the things that the preventive services provisions provide in addition to contraceptive coverage. I just think this is a compelling interest under any understanding of the term.",
  "Yes. They did argue ­­ I will point out, for the first time at the podium this morning ­­ that a less restrictive means would be to extend the accommodation that currently exists ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "The answer ­­ I think there are two answers to it. Assuming it's before the Court ­­ and I'm going to answer your honest question directly, but I do want to make a prefatory point here, which is that under the law, under Ashcroft v. ACLU, for example, the burden on the government is to show that proposed less restrictive alternatives are not equally effective. If they don't propose it, we don't have a burden to refute it. Having said that, we can refute it. Now, there are two ­­ and there are two ways. The first is, they claim that they don't think that the accommodation is a less restrictive means, I take it, because ­­ or they haven't raised it before today, because they believe that RFRA would require exemptions to that too, such that if you were ­­ if you were to provide the accommodation in which the insurance company comes in and provides the contraception if the employer signs the form, they would say that that ­­ signing the form also makes them complicit in the central activity, and that therefore RFRA provides an exemption there, too. And of course the test is whether the proposed alternative advances the government's interests as effectively. And if it is going to be subject to exactly the same RFRA objections by exactly the same class of people asking for it, it's not going to serve the government's interest as effectively because the RFRA exemption will result in no coverage there. The second point being that ­­",
  "Well, whether they sign the piece of paper or not, if they make the RFRA claim there, which they have with respect to that accommodation, it will result in it being less effective in terms of accomplishing the compelling interest. In addition ­­",
  "You'll have to ask them. I don't think they have. But they have studiously avoided arguing this as a less restrictive alternative, and I take it it's because their theory, at least, would lead one to the conclusion you would have to provide a RFRA objection. But now the ­­ yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The second point is that you're talking about a very open­ended increase in the cost to the government. Now, we don't know how much that cost would be. The reason is because, since this wasn't litigated in the lower courts, there's not a record on it. So I can't tell you what that ­­ what that increased cost is going to be, but it could be quite considerable.",
  "Well, to the contrary. And two points to make about that. First, of course the ­­ one of the methods of contraception they object to here is the IUD. And that is by far and away the method of contraception that is most effective, but has the highest upfront cost and creates precisely the kind of cost barrier that the preventive services provision is trying to break down.",
  "It is for the insurance company, but for the woman who is going to not get the benefit of the statute if the exemption is granted ­­",
  "Well, so, in other words, if they haven't raised a RFRA objection to the alternative, but that ­­ but as I said, you know, the logic of their position is that you would get a RFRA objection. It can't be ­­",
  "Don't worry.",
  "On that point, I think that question plugs into our view of what the substantial burden test requires, that their view of substantial burden is if you have a sincere religious belief and there is any law with a meaningful penalty that imposes on you pressure to do something inconsistent with your belief, then you may pass the substantial burden test. I think the problem with that test as they formulate it, is that under the two hypotheticals that you just gave, Justice Breyer, you've got a substantial burden in those situations, because if you don't pay the tax you can go to jail, for example. And so we think the substantial burden analysis has got to be more strenuous than that. It's got to incorporate principles of attenuation and proximate cause, and that when you think about this case where the requirement is to purchase insurance which enables actions by others, that you're really closer to the tax situation than to imposing a direct obligation to act. So that's how we would think about that issue. But now, with respect to ­­",
  "It's true that it's a difficult question. But it isn't ­­",
  "No, but I do think the problem, Justice Alito, is that this Court has recognized, and certainly the courts of appeals have recognized, that there is a difference. You accept the sincerity of the belief, but the Court still has to make a judgment of its own about what constitutes a substantial burden, or otherwise, for example, the tax thing would be a substantial burden. Or we cited a D.C. Circuit case in which prisoners objected to giving DNA samples and the court said: We accept the sincerity of that belief, but it's up to us to decide whether that's a actually substantial burden. In the Bowen case in this Court, the Court accepted the sincerity of the belief that the use of the child's Social Security number would offend religious belief and commitments, but said they still had to make a judgment about whether that was a substantial burden. So it does have to be, with all due respect, part of the analysis.",
  "I don't think ­­",
  "It didn't grant an exemption to any nonreligious organizations, Justice Kennedy. It granted an exemption to churches, and that was it. With respect to religious nonprofits, it constructed an accommodation, but the accommodation delivers the contraceptive coverage to the employees of the nonprofits. It just does it through an indirect means. But there is no diminution of the ­­ there's no basis for questioning the government's interest with respect to that accommodation because the employees get the coverage, just as they would ­­",
  "Well, that's exactly why I think you can't look to that as a less restrictive ­­ that accommodation, extending that accommodation to for­profit corporations. As a less restrictive alternative. Precisely because it's being hotly litigated whether RFRA will require exemptions to that, as well.",
  "Well, I think ­­ I think what Justice Kennedy ­­ I took Justice Kennedy to be asking me, Mr. Chief Justice, was whether the government's choice to provide that accommodation reflected a judgment on the part of the government that this was something less than a compelling interest, and I don't think that inference is possible, because the government was trying to use that accommodation to ensure that the contraceptives were delivered. So, with all due respect, I don't think there is an inconsistency there. And I ­­ and I do think, if I could, with respect to this issue of whether there are exemptions that defeat a compelling interest, that I submit would be a very dangerous principle for this Court to adopt in the form that my friends on the other side have offered it, because not only would you then be in a position where it would be very hard to see how Title VII enforcement could be justified by compelling interest in response to a RFRA objection, ADA enforcement, FMLA enforcement, all kinds of things. And I do think ­­",
  "Well, I think ­­ with all due respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think you could claim a RFRA exemption from Title VII. And the problem here would be that ­­ and I think one of the things that's significant about the position that my friends on the other side are taking here, is that with respect to exemptions, for example, from the Title VII requirement against discrimination on the basis of religion and hiring, Congress made a quite clear judgment to provide a very narrow exemption: Churches and religious educational institutions and religious associations, and that's it. Nobody else can claim an exemption under Title VII.",
  "But I think the further question, Your Honor, is whether you would interpret RFRA in a manner where you would essentially obliterate that carefully crafted ­­ or what Congress meant to do was to obliterate that carefully crafted exemption and instead say that every for­profit corporation could make a request like that.",
  "Well, with all due respect, Your Honor, I think you could make the same argument either way in this case, that the question here is what Congress thought it was doing in 1993, and we don't think, given the long history and the fact that not only do you have no case in which a for­profit corporation ever had a successful ­­",
  "In addition, if you look at the history of exemptions and accommodations in our legislation, State and Federal legislation may extend to churches and religious nonprofits, and that's ­­ and individuals. And that's where the line has been drawn in our legislation historically. There just is nothing in our current ­­",
  "No. I think, as you said, the law now ­­ the law now is to the contrary.",
  "Well, I think that ­­ you know, I don't think that that's ­­ I think it would depend on the law and it would depend on the entity. It certainly wouldn't be true, I think, for religious nonprofits. It certainly wouldn't be true for a church.",
  "Well, I think that if it were for a for­profit corporation and if such a law like that were enacted, then you're right, under our theory that the for­profit corporation wouldn't have an ability to sue. But there is no law like that on the books. In fact, the law is the opposite.",
  "That makes a requirement of the kind that Justice Kennedy hypothesized. The law is the opposite.",
  "That requires for­profit corporations to provide abortions.",
  "It is their sincere belief and we don't question that. But I will say, and I do think this is important and I say it with all respect, that that is how they ­­ that is the judgment that they make. It is not the judgment that Federal law or State law reflects. Federal law and State law which does ­­ which do preclude funding for abortions don't consider these particular forms of contraception to be abortion. With all due respect, I would say that I think that, you know, we've got about 2 million women who rely on the IUD as a method of birth control in this country. I don't think they think they are engaged in abortion in doing that. It is their belief. It's sincere. We respect it. But it isn't a belief that we think is reflected in Federal or State law or our traditions of where that line is drawn. And so ­­ and I do think that that is what makes this a difficult case. I agree. And if you disagree with our position at the threshold that corporations ­­ that even though you have a situation, and we acknowledge you can have situations, in which a tightly knit group of ­­ a small group of tightly knit individuals own and operate a corporation where there is appeal to that, to the argument that they ought to recognize a claim of exercising religion in those circumstances. The problem, I would submit, is with the implications of doing it, the implications for entanglement and making the judgments when you move past that group, the administrability problems, and the problems of inviting the kinds of claims that are predictably going to impose harms on third parties.",
  "Well, I'm not sure they couldn't raise a First Amendment claim, Justice Alito. I think if you had a targeted law like that, that targeted a specific religious practice, that ­­ I don't think it is our position that they couldn't make a free exercise claim in that circumstance and so ­­",
  "Right. Well, I think if it were targeted only at the practices of the ­­ the kosher and halal practices, then I think you would have an issue of whether it's a targeted law or not. But even if it is ­­",
  "Well, I think in that circumstance, you would have, I think, an ability for customers to bring suit. I think you might recognize third party standing on behalf of the corporation ­­ on the corporations, on behalf of customers. So a suit like that could be brought. But even if you disagree with me at the threshold, even if you disagree with us with respect to the kinds of risks that we think you will be inviting if you hold that for­profit corporations can bring these claims, when you get to the compelling interest analysis, the rights of the third party employees are at center stage here. And that's ­­ I think that's the point of critical importance in thinking about this case. And I think, frankly, the point that has been just left on the sidelines by my friends on the other side. The consequence of holding here that the RFRA exemption applies is not a situation like ones in which this Court under the Free Exercise Clause or under RFRA have recognized exemptions in the past. Those have always been situations where it's a relationship between the individual and the government and granting the exemption might result in the government not being able to enforce the law with respect to the individual, but ­­",
  "Well, I think our response is what the Court said in Part 3 of the Lee opinion, which is that once you make a choice to go into the commercial sphere, which you certainly do when you incorporate as a for­profit corporation, you are making a choice to live by the rules that govern you and your competitors in the commercial sphere. But even if you disagree with me about that, what I'd like to leave the Court with, is what I think is the most important point here, is that if this exemption were granted, it will be the first time under the Free Exercise Clause or under RFRA in which this Court or any court has held that an employer may take ­­ may be granted an exemption that extinguishes statutorily­guaranteed benefits of fundamental importance. Lee came to exactly the opposite conclusion with respect to Social Security benefits, that you ­­ that it was imperative that the employee's interest be protected. And that is the fundamental problem with the position that my friends on the other side raise here, that they leave the third­party employees entirely out of the equation.",
  "No.",
  "No, we don't think that. We don't ­­ we're not drawing a line between non­profits and profits.",
  "No. No. Religious non­profits get an accommodation in which their employees get the contraception. But we are not drawing a line between for­profit and profit.",
  "The ­­",
  "Well, as I've said a couple of times, they haven't asked for that until this morning. But the fundamental point here is that you would be extinguishing statutorily­guaranteed health benefits of fundamental importance to these employees, and that is something that this Court has never done. And I submit that Congress can't have thought it was authorizing it when it enacted RFRA in 1993. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An abstract idea does not become patent­eligible merely by tacking on an instruction to use a computer to carry it out. A computer makes a difference under Section 101 when it imposes a meaningful limit on the patent claim. That occurs when the claim is directed at improvement in computing technology or an innovation that uses computing technology to improve other technological functions. That's the test that we believe is most faithful to this Court's precedents in Bilski and Mayo. It keeps patents within their traditional and appropriate domain and it is capable of being administered consistently by Courts and by PTO examiners.",
  "Yeah, with ­­ let me address software patents first because that, I think, is obviously a significant question. And it's just not correct to say that our approach would make software patenting ineligible. Any software patent that improves the functioning of the computer technology is eligible. Any software patent that improves ­­ that is used to improve another technology is eligible. For example, the patent in the ­­ in the Diehr case is one in which ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "Well, I ­­",
  "Well, I ­­ I think ­­ well, they ­­ they ­­ there's a process being and ­­ and one can think of software patents as process patents. And I think that's why my friends on the other side are saying the sky is falling because they ­­ they are interpreting what we're saying about that when a computer makes ­­ when a computer's involvement makes something eligible under 101, it's calling those into question, and it doesn't.",
  "Well, I think you can ­­ I think the answer to that question is no, not necessarily. You can decide it by saying that ­­ that Bilski answers the question of whether this is an abstract idea, because this form of hedging is really no different than the form of hedging as a conceptual matter at issue in Bilski. And then Mayo answers the question of whether the use of a computer in this case adds enough to the abstract idea beyond conventional steps, because here all we have, after all, is just conventional use of computing technology, no computer innovation, such that you don't qualify under 101. You could take that approach. But it is important to the United States that we ­­ and to our patent examiners that we get some clarity, if we can. I think the clarity could come from the test that I propose, which I want to reiterate ­­",
  "I don't think there's a yes or no answer to that question.",
  "If there is a genuine innovation in the functioning of the computer ­­",
  "­­ such that business processes ­­",
  "Yeah, that ­­",
  "That is generally the line we're drawing. Frankly ­­",
  "I do want ­­",
  "Sure. About ­­ let me go to Bilski there in that I do think, while ­­ while certainly the Court held that the term \"process\" got a natural construction which could include business methods, it seems to me that that's not all the Court said in Bilski. The Court also said that it was claimed by the patent, that you would have found it to be patent eligible. And I ­­ I would submit for the Court that the key point here, I think, is that now, given where the Court ­­ what the Court has held in Bilski, given what it's held in Mayo, the abstract ideas exception is really the only tool left to deal with what I ­­ what I think I fairly read Bilski as saying is a significant problem, the proliferation of patents of business methods.",
  "I ­­ I think it's going to be difficult for me to do that. I think, for example, if you had a business method, a process for additional security point­of­sale credit card transactions using particular encryption technology, that might well be patent eligible. It's a technology that it makes conduct of business more efficient or effective. But there is a technological link here, and we do think that's critical to our ­­ to our point of view with respect to the case. And I ­­ and I do think, remember, that when we say something is not patent eligible, we're not saying they can't do it. We're saying they can't monopolize it. And the concern in a situation like this one is that if this is patent eligible, it's hard to see why, for example, the first person who came up with a frequent flier program wouldn't have been able to claim a patent there, because, after all, that's a business method for improving customer loyalty implemented on a computer.",
  "I take ­­ I take the point, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the key is that they are all directed to answering the question of whether the innovation that is claimed and is an innovation in either, A, the improvement of a computer's functioning or, B, the use of computer technology to improve the functioning of another technological process, and a case like Diehr would be in the latter category. And so I do think that that's the key benchmark. That's the baseline. That's the test that we do think can be applied clearly and consistently by the courts or the PTO. And it avoids the risk of things like frequent flier programs or the Oakland A's money ball methods for evaluating the contributions in individual baseball players make or any one of a host of other things that our intuitions tell us just don't belong in the patent system. That's the ­­ drawing that line keeps them out; not drawing that line lets them in. And with all due respect, I don't think that the novelty and nonobviousness filters at 102 and 103 really deal with that problem effectively, because when you get to nonobviousness in 103, for example, you'll be asking a different question. If you take the frequent flier program, you would say, well, is this innovation in building consumer loyalty something that would have been obvious to somebody who runs an airline? It's totally divorced from the question of technology at that point and, therefore, I don't think you're going to get the screen that you need to get in order for the patent system to be confined to its traditional and appropriate scope. If there are no further questions, thank you.",
  "We would define abstract ­­ an abstract concept as a claim that is not directed to a concrete innovation in technology, science, or the industrial arts. So it's the ­­ it's abstract in the sense that it is not a concrete innovation in the traditional realm of patent law. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Power Act expressly authorizes FERC to regulate the process that sets wholesale rates for electricity, and that is exactly what FERC's wholesale demand response rules do. Demand response is a resource that is bid into the wholesale auction, and the wholesale market operators that run those actions rely on the bids to balance wholesale supply and demand, to set wholesale rates, and they particularly rely on those bids in periods of peak demand to avoid price spikes and to avoid blackouts and brownouts.",
  "So I ­­ I have several answers to that, Justice Kennedy. First, we completely agree that what ­­ any action that FERC takes at the wholesale level in some sense is going to affect the retail market. All things equal, if FERC sets ­­ FERC will set a higher wholesale rate, there is going to be a higher retail price. But that can't be a basis ­­ those kinds of effects can't be a basis, for denying FERC's jurisdiction. And the case I would particularly point Your Honor to is the Mississippi Power case. Now, there was a case in which what FERC did was conclude that a utility could recover at wholesale its investment in a nuclear power plant. And what the Court held in Mississippi Power was that that had the effect of denying the State regulator the ability to deny that utility recovery of those costs in the retail rates, even though under State law they would have been imprudent costs and not recoverable. That was a very direct effect on the exercise of State regulatory jurisdiction, which you do not have here, by the way, so I think a fortiori, this is certainly permissible under the rationale of Mississippi Power.",
  "So ­­ I think three points to be made in response to that argument, Justice Scalia. First, the ­­ the authority that's exclusively reserved to States by Section 824(b) of ­­ of the Federal Power Act is the authority over retail sales. Every retail sale that occurs in the regime in the ­­ in FERC's ­­ under FERC's wholesale demand response regime is a retail sale that will occur at the rate that the State regulator has set, and under the terms and conditions that the State regulator has set, every single sale that occurs that is true about. Second, what they have said is that this changes the effective rate. But what I would say in response to that, Your Honor, is that if I go out and buy a Ferrari for $100,000, everybody thinks that the price of the Ferrari is $100,000. Nobody thinks that the price of the Ferrari is actually $107,000 because I'm foregoing the $7,000 tax credit I can get if I bought an electric car. The rate is what it is. It's $100,000. And here, the rate is what it is. And third, the point I would make, it seems to me, it's a very odd argument to say that what FERC's rules do here is increase the retail price. What FERC's rules do is drive the retail price down by driving the wholesale price down by very considerable amounts in peak periods. This is ­­ this is a system that results in lower rates for retail consumption.",
  "Those ­­",
  "I think that would be a harder case than this one because all of the conduct that FERC regulates here occurs in the wholesale market. All of it. The ­­ this is about what bids can be accepted into the wholesale market, what ­­",
  "I ­­ I think this is a more straightforward case, because all of the conduct that FERC regulates occurs in the wholesale market, all of the actors are regulated in their role in the wholesale market, and FERC's purpose in this situation is to achieve lower wholesale rates and to allow and to prevent ­­ allow wholesale operators to prevent blackouts and brownouts in their ­­",
  "And I guess there's an additional point to be made in response to that, Your Honor, is that ­­ the ­­ here, of course, what FERC is doing is saying, here are the rules by which the wholesale market is going to operate, and if you come into the wholesale market, these are the rules that will apply to you. But ultimately it remains up to the States because FERC takes State law as it finds it here, whether citizens of the State can go into the wholesale market. They can only go into the wholesale market if FERC ­­ if States agree that they can go into the wholesale market. So it's very difficult to see that ­­",
  "Well, I think FERC certainly has that authority in the course of deciding what's a just and reasonable practice. And, in fact, I believe that that's what the Court held in New York v. FERC with respect to FERC's decision not to regulate the ­­ the bundled element of transmission there because it was concerned about jurisdictional overlaps. And there FERC didn't exercise its regulatory authority at all. And so it's a fortiori ­­",
  "Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, that that's not an argument that goes to FERC's jurisdiction. That may be an argument, although no one has made it in this case, that if FERC believes that this practice is ­­ that this practice is required to have a just and reasonable wholesale rate, that ­­ that FERC can't then let States opt out. But, again, that seems to me to be a merits issue, not a jurisdictional issue. And ­­ and again, I think it's ­­ it's just incorrect under this Court's holding in FERC v. ­­",
  "No, Your Honor ­­ I know ­­",
  "I appreciate that, that Your Honor dissented in New York v. FERC on a ground very much like that. But the Court held that that was a legitimate exercise of FERC's authority to decide what just and reasonable practices were, to take that jurisdictional overlap into account. And that's all FERC has done here. It seems to me quite clear that that is, under the logic of New York v. FERC, permissible exercise of ­­ of FERC's authority. And so in a situation, it seems to me, in which what you've got is FERC taking State law as it finds it, you really can't say that this is a impermissible interference or a power grab or any intrusion into State authority because the States ultimately make the decision. I ­­ in fact, I think the Federalism argument is upside down here. This is a situation in which what you have is a FERC rule that really is a strong version of cooperative Federalism. What FERC is saying here is that this is policy that we think works, we think brings about billions of dollars in consumer benefits by lowering wholesale rates.",
  "Yes, well, my friend has ­­ my friend has used that term, but I think ­­",
  "It's wrong as a matter of history ­­ as a matter of history. It's wrong as a matter of law. This ­­ this idea of wholesale demand response was not FERC's idea. FERC didn't impose it on the market, Justice Kennedy. This is a practice that grew up organically out of the private actions of market participants once the wholesale markets were deregulated. It's exactly the kind of innovative private market conduct that you would hope that deregulation would bring about. And the ­­ the private actors, the wholesale market operators, brought that idea to FERC as early as 1999.",
  "So I'm very familiar with that case, Your Honor.",
  "And this case is completely different. And in ­­ in fact, I think, you know, when ­­",
  "Sure. I think that the ­­ that bridge was crossed in New York v. FERC. It seems to me in New York v. FERC held that that ­­ that that deregulation, that deregulatory impulse was within the authority of FERC, and that there's nothing in the statutory text that precludes it. And I do think that's a key point here, that what we're talking about here at the end of the day is FERC's authority, which this ­­ which comes down to what the statute says. And what the statute says, in Section 824(e), is that FERC has authority over practices that affect rates in ­­ wholesale rates. And there's just no doubt given that all of the practices FERC is regulating occur in the wholesale auction. They're all embedded in the wholesale auction.",
  "I think ­­ I think the limiting principle has worked quite well in D.C. Circuit for years now is that the effects have to be direct. And it's a limiting principle akin to the kind of limiting principle ­­ common sense limiting principle that the Court has used in the ERISA preemption contracts with respect to relating to. And with respect to direct effects, what I would say is when you ­­ what you're talking about is regulation of conduct that occurs in the auction itself, participation in the auction, the rates that are charge ­­ that are ­­ the ­­ the bids, the nature of bids that can be accepted at the auction, the use of those bids to balance wholesale supply and demand, payment of the bidders at a rate that FERC prescribes, and recoupment of that payment in the wholesale market, all in the wholesale market that you've got as direct an effect as you can have. And we're quite comfortable with the Court drawing a line that would exclude the kinds of examples ­­ the hypotheticals that the D.C. Circuit came up regulating steel, regulating ­­ regulating inputs into electric generation. We don't think FERC's authority goes anywhere near that far. It ­­ but when you're talking about conduct that occurs in the wholesale auction in the wholesale market, it's just at the core of the practices affecting jurisdiction that the statute ­­",
  "No, the ­­ what the conduct ­­ that ­­ that's ­­ that is ­­ it is an indirect effect of the conduct that FERC regulates by market participants, the wholesale market operators and the ­­ and the participants in the wholesale auction. But that's an effect. The conduct that FERC regulates all occurs in that auction. It creates that incentive, yes it does. But all of the conduct is in that auction. It's clearly within the text of 824(e)(a). And there is no text that unambiguously ­­",
  "That ­­ that ­­ that's correct, Justice Sotomayor. And if I ­­ I would like to make one point and then reserve the balance of my time, if I could. And the one point is this: There is no statutory text that unambiguously denies FERC this authority that it's exercising here over this wholesale conduct. And given that, Chevron requires that the Court uphold FERC's authority here. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice: Starting on the jurisdictional issue with text, my friend pointed to Section 824(b), which you can find at 1(a) of the appendix to our brief. What it says is not that FERC shall have jurisdiction over sales of electricity at wholesale. It says the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to sales of electricity at wholesale. One of those provisions is 824(e)(a), which says FERC shall have jurisdiction over practices affecting wholesale rates. So we're within the plain terms of the statute, and there is no statutory text that plainly forecloses FERC's exercise of jurisdiction. And my friend, in 30 minutes, didn't even try to identify one. So in terms of applying Chevron, there's no doubt that ­­ that FERC's interpretation has to be upheld. With respect to the Wal­Mart example that my friend identifies, I think it shows why his argument about hermetically­sealed­off retail and wholesale spheres really has nothing to do with the real world. In the real world today, large customers can buy directly. They can do it through contract, and they can also go into the wholesale market auctions and buy, if their States permit it, and that does happen in the real world. And this is really no different because demand response entities that want to come in and participate can only do so if their State law allows them to do so. So it's no different than what's been going on in the real world for quite a long time. Third, with respect to the load­serving entities, the ­­ the utilities, my friend says, well, don't worry about it; they'll do all the demand response. It will work great. FERC addressed that. It addressed it directly. It found that load­serving entities don't have sufficient incentives to engage in demand response. And it's obvious why they don't, because they cannibalize their own profits. The higher cost they have, the higher their rate of return profits are going to be generated. They will do it under commands from State regulatory agencies to do it, but they'll do it grudgingly. And what FERC said is you want people to come in who have a real profit motive to do it, and that'll incent the LSEs to get in there and try to get a piece of the action rather than letting it go to somebody else. But FERC addressed that issue specifically. Now, the idea that demand response can't work, the State­level demand response, retail demand response can't work where wholesale demand response is operating, you know, again, the real world just contradicts that. We have 24 States in which this is going on. And if this were a problem, you'd expect to see in this administrative proceeding some evidence that it was a problem, and there is zero evidence. You look at all these briefs; there isn't a citation to anything in the administrative record that suggests that the Federal and State programs can't work in harmony. And FERC made a finding that they can work in harmony. Now, with respect ­­ just one point on arbitrary and capricious, and I'd like to sum up. I think if you're going to look at one thing in terms of the concern you've raised, Justice Kennedy, I would look at page 223 of the Appendix to the petition ­­ of our petition, and what you will see right there is FERC directly identifying the problem that my friend spent the last few minutes of his argument on, and then going on to say ­­ and then going on to explain in great detail for several pages why that critique is wrong, and citing in particular the paragraph of Dr. Khan's declaration where Dr. Khan is responding to the specific critiques that my friend made. So it ­­ it certainly meets the threshold test of ­­ of ­­ of an adequate explanation for a decision. Now, if I could sum up, I think this is what this case comes down to. On one side of the scale, you've got a practice that saves billion ­­ that has saved billions of dollars in wholesale costs and will save billions of dollars, and it's an effective tool against blackouts and brownouts, and that nobody has shown in the real world does any harm. You have a statutory provision that gives FERC specific authority to regulate this practice. You have no statutory provision precluding it. You have Chevron in case there's any doubt. And you ­­ and you have, really, a strong cooperative Federalism program here in which States have the ­­ States are masters of their own fate. Whether ­­ whether customers in a State participate or not is up to the State. If the State thinks this is not a good policy, the State can say it doesn't operate in our State. On the other side of the scale, what you've got is an argument that all those benefits have to be extinguished, and ­­ and no argument in the record that there was any harm from this program. You have no clear statutory text for bidding FERC from engaging in this regulatory practice. And my friend used the phrase \"one size fits all.\" Well, I ­­ I suggest that really what we've got here on the other side is a faux Federalism argument. Their argument is the one size fits all. There are lots of States out there that want their consumers, want their citizens to participate in this because they think it's good policy and it's completely harmonious with their regulation. But what my friend's argument does is wipe that out and say, no, it's one size fits all, and then what's ­­ and that one size that fits all is that nobody can participate, not even the 24 States that want to do it. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to make a point about the compelling­interest inquiry in light of what this Court said previously in Fisher, and then I'd like to make point about the process aspect of the narrow­tailoring inquiry in light of what this Court said in Fisher, which I believe Justice Kennedy will address your concerns about whether race is determinative here. And then I'd like to move on to what I think this case comes down to, which is whether the University has made a sufficient showing of need to consider race in ­­ in its process. But before I make any of those points, Mr. Chief Justice, I ­­ I can provide some specific detail in response to the question you asked earlier related to the parents­involved point. Here are the numbers. With respect to African­American students admitted through the holistic part of the program, in 2004, which was the last year before race was expressly considered, that number was 141 admitted through that number. And that was the high­water mark, really, of the period of ­­ of holistic review without race.",
  "Correct. This is just the holistic numbers. That number then moves up to 176 the following year, to 220 the year after, and to 262 in 2007. So the number of holistic admissions almost doubles, and that results in ­­",
  "Right.",
  "You're right ­­ you're right that you can't tell for sure, but you do have a pretty good benchmark, I think, given that you have a number of years without considering race where 141 was the high­water mark. And so I do ­­",
  "Right.",
  "Well, it went ­­ before they started considering race, it went up and down, frankly. But 141 was the high­water mark. There wasn't a consistent trajectory in those numbers.",
  "It's ­­ or I guess what I'd say about that, Your Honor, is that in Grutter, what the Court specifically held was that the University is allowed to make those kinds of judgments in seeking to advance multiple objectives to maintain an academic environment of excellence, and to diversify the student body, both.",
  "Well, the ­­ the SAT scores are about the same. I'm not sure ­­",
  "But I guess ­­",
  "So I ­­ I'm not sure what the answer to that is, Your Honor, but this all goes to the compelling­interest inquiry, and let me focus on that. What the ­­ what the Court said last time around is to satisfy the compelling­interest inquiry, the University has got to articulate a reasoned, principled explanation for its decision to consider the educational benefits of diversity in a matter that this Court has found to be constitutional and substantial. The University of Texas has met that standard, has articulated exactly the same educational benefits of diversity at exactly the same level of specificity that this Court held constituted a compelling interest in the Grutter case at page 330. It's exactly the same. And the ­­ the principal argument that my friend Mr. Rein makes in challenging that is, well, actually a lot of that is post hoc rationalization, in particular, the effort to find whether you call it qualitative diversity, diversity within diversity is all post hoc rationalization, that is simply not so. If you look at page 1 of the Supplemental Joint Appendix, the first page of the 2004 Proposal, the University specifically says that what it's trying to accomplish is to create a diversity of perspectives among minority students. It says it again at page 28 in that proposal. The Director of Admissions Declaration, page 43 of the Joint Appendix, says it ­­ it says it throughout. So that there's no ­­ there's just no argument that it's a post hoc rationalization.",
  "Well ­­",
  "What I think about that is that the ­­ the Court, I think, made a prediction in ­­ in Grutter that that would hopefully be the case.",
  "I think ­­",
  "I think the University's always ­­",
  "No. I ­­ I ­­ I think the universities do make progress on this, and I think you do get to a point where you create a virtuous cycle. And ­­ and I think it does work, and I think that there's ­­ there's ­­ and ­­ and I think there's ample reason to ­­ to believe that it does work. And I think the key point here with respect to compelling interests is that this really is ­­ in ­­ in terms of having the educational benefits diversity, that's in the heartland of what the Court has said, is the area in which the University's expertise and experience deserves deference. Now, if I could go to the process point, with respect to ­­",
  "Yeah ­­",
  "Yeah. I think ­­ I believe that's the affidavit from the director of admissions. And it is highly relevant, and there is other information. In the latter part of our brief, we documented it. We think ­­ you know, our view, we argued for affirmance. We think it's sufficient. But if there is doubt, I do think the additional kind of information that might be developed in this case would be to look at the kinds of questions that the Chief Justice was actually asking about, how did the ­­ how has the program worked in practice over the period of time in which it's been implemented. And I think that would be additional relevant information that might help make the judgment. If I could go to the process point, and then I will return to the need point. Process ­­ what the Court said last time around in this case was that the Court had to ensure itself without deference that the process provided for individualized consideration and that race did not predominate. Again, the University of Texas' plan has every one of what the Court in Grutter at page 334 said were the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan. No quota. Everybody competes against everybody else. No automatic award of points. Modest factor. And in addition ­­ and this goes to your question, Justice Kennedy, about whether there is an argument here that race is determinative ­­ Texas is different from the University of Michigan's law school plan in every one of the four ways that Your Honor identified as ­­ as being potentially troublesome and making race determinative. Unlike in Michigan, in Texas the percentage of African­American and Hispanics admitted does not mirror the percentage who applied. It's different. Unlike Texas, the number ­­ excuse me. Unlike Michigan, the number in Texas of ­­ of admissions fluctuates year over year. It's not the same every year. Unlike in Michigan, the bulk of Hispanic and African­American students admitted don't come from a small subset of the pool that's admitted after most are admitted based on grades. And unlike in Michigan, the ­­ there ­­ the admissions officers don't monitor the process all the way along, which would, as Your Honor suggested, perhaps create the risk that race would become determinative in latter States' admissions. None of that is true here. So ­­ so I think with respect to ­­",
  "So ­­",
  "So I think ­­ I was trying to address process, and I ­­ and I'll go right now to need, which I think is ­­ is ­­ I really do think that you're right, Mr. Chief Justice. That's what the case comes down to. And I will answer your question directly, but I first want to make a point about how you don't ­­ how you shouldn't do it. And you shouldn't do it the way the Petitioner has suggested you should do it. What the Petitioner has said is that the ­­ in order to ­­ in order to assess need, and the ­­ and the only way to meet ­­ meet the need portion of the strict­scrutiny analysis, is for the University to set a, quote, \"demographic goal.\" That's the Petitioner's language. And then test whether or not they've made that goal.",
  "And so ­­",
  "So the ­­ the ­­ and the reason, of course, that that's no good is that that's just a Catch­22.",
  "So ­­ so here's how you should do it, and we've ­­ we've laid it out in our brief: We think that the approach ­­ we think that approach is always going to be fatal in fact because, if they don't ­­ they ­­ they fail strict scrutiny if they ­­",
  "I ­­ I promise you I'm going to answer it. I just think these points are important. Then ­­ and so the ­­ with respect, we think our approach is faithful to Fisher because it's not always fatal in fact. What we say is that it's not an ­­ a critical mass, numerical kind of analysis. We say that what you do is you start with the University's articulation of the educational benefits it's trying to achieve. You require the University to state in concrete terms what success will look like. You then evaluate the evidence and analysis that the University relied on in order to make the judgment that it isn't where it needs to be and there ­­ and needs to consider race ­­",
  "Yes. And so in the kinds of ­­",
  "And ­­ and you ­­ and so the kind ­­ you would look for concrete evidence. You know, well ­­ well­done classroom studies. Well­designed surveys of student attitudes and faculty attitudes. Graduation and retention rates. Are racial incidents going up and down ­­ up or down on ­­ on campus in frequency? You ­­ you know, there could be a whole list of them. But you would look at those. You would look at ­­ you would look at those. You would look at the University's analysis of those, and then you'd make a judgment whether the University has substantiated its case. And the burden, of course, is on the University. They've got to come in and convince you that they've substantiated their case that they need to consider race ­­",
  "Well, I ­­ I think what ­­",
  "Sure. I think that they can ­­ and ­­ and as happened in Grutter, I think they have ­­ the ­­ the interests that they rely on have to be the interests that they contemporaneously identified when they adopted the program. I don't think there's an issue here on that. But I think the evidence can include evidence of how things are working in practice. For example, if they adopt a system and it does result in improvement, that does seem highly relevant and ­­ and consistent with what the Court held in Grutter was appropriate evidence.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "It certainly wouldn't be adequate by itself. It might be probative evidence in combination with other probative evidence. But ­­ you know, but the ­­ the question of classroom composition is hard evidence. And at some level, demographics are hard evidence too, Mr. Chief Justice. When you're talking about the African­American population at the University of Texas in ­­ in Austin, you're talking about a population of 3 or 400 kids in a class of 6,000, I think the ­­ the idea that there is a material risk of racial isolation in that situation is quite strong. The idea that there is a material chance that lots and lots of students are going to go ­­",
  "It ­­ it ­­ it ­­",
  "It might well ­­",
  "It might well make a significant difference. And if I could, in the time I have remaining, I'd like to just try to refocus the Court on the importance of what's at stake here. As we told you in our brief, our military leaders believe that it is imperative that we have officer corps that are not only diverse but capable of leading a diverse military, not only for effectiveness but for the very legitimacy of sending our troops into harm's way.",
  "No, I don't. Not at all. But I ­­",
  "Here's what I think about that, Justice Alito: I think that we want to make sure ­­ and this military example is only one of the important interests here. But with respect to that, we want to make sure, not just that there are strong African­American and Hispanic candidates in that ROTC program, but that everybody who graduates from the ROTC program, University of Texas ­­ white, black, Asian, Hispanic ­­ everybody knows how to lead effectively in a ­­ in a diverse environment in which they're going to be leading diverse troops. That's the interest. And you can't achieve that ­­",
  "No. I ­­ I think with respect to the University of Texas in particular. But I ­­ I'm also ­­ you know, what the Court is going to say in this case obviously is going to apply to ­­ eventually to every university in the country. And this is an important interest for the United States generally, that when you think about what's at stake here, that the ­­ the interest in ensuring that we have military officers who can lead a diverse military force is critical. The interest in having law enforcement officers who are not just diverse but who can operate effectively within every racial and ethnic community in highly charged situations is critically important. Corporate America has told you that having a ­­ a ­­ a workforce that is able to function effectively in diverse ­­ in diverse situations is critical. And what I would just say in conclusion is that these are the considered judgments of people who actually have the responsibility to ensure that the vital functions of the government protecting the country with the military and with law enforcement and the vital functions of commerce ­­ these are the people who actually have to make sure that those functions are carried out. And this is their considered judgment, and I submit it's ­­ it's worth considerable weight in your analysis. Thank you.",
  "Oh, I'm sorry.",
  "So I ­­ I would point Your Honor specifically to the declaration at pages 483a and 484 ­­ and 484a of the Joint Appendix of the admissions director, in which he explains the way race is considered in the University of Texas system. And that explanation says expressly, at page 483, that race is considered in exactly the same manner, and given exactly the same consideration as every other special circumstance's factor that the university considers as part of its holistic review. That ­­ I think that shows you that actually you know more about the way this program works than you did about the program that you affirmed in Grutter, and you have assurance based on that, and nothing in the record contradicts it that that's the way it operates.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin by summarizing the three fundamental reasons why Abood should be reaffirmed. First, in the four decades that Abood has been the law, this Court's jurisprudence in the area of ­­ of employment relations, First Amendment jurisprudence in the area of employment relations has converged with Abood in a way that fortifies its foundations and does not erode them, because what those cases have recognized is when the government is acting as employer managing the workforce, it should receive reasonableness review in order to give it the latitude comparable to that of a private employer to manage its workforce, and not exacting scrutiny that applies when government is a sovereign regulating the citizens. Second, in those four decades, more than 20 States have enacted and enforced laws that allow the public employers in those States to have the same latitude that Congress gave private employers to decide, based on workplace needs and local conditions, whether agency fee requirements will help them achieve the purposes for which they ­­ for which they adopt collective bargaining. And the reliance goes far deeper than those 20 State laws and the thousands of contracts affecting millions of people that are based on those laws. In those States, the agency fee requirement has worked its way, woven its way into the fabric of the relation between workers and management and the public's fear. In those States, the unions have taken on such obligations as training and the like, funded by agency fees that make the workplace more effective for management, as well as more effective for employees. And if you were to take those away, you're going to disrupt those long­term relationships that have developed over time, and the expectations that have developed over time, and you're going to replace them with a different kind of a situation in which the union is going to have a different set of incentives, trying to ­­ trying to ensure that the maximum number of people are willing to pay union fees. And the way that the unions are likely to try to do that is through trying to convince employees that you ­­ that they need the union because otherwise management is going to do them harm. And I do think that that's a significant problem here for public employer perspective now, in a time of budgetary constraints, when difficult decisions have to be made and cuts have to be made. It's of great benefit to the employer, to the government as employer, to have the union participate in those judgments so that they are perceived as fair as the ­­ by the workforce, and so that the union then, in effect, vouches for management with the workforce and prevents disruption. So I do think the reliance interests go very deep here. And then the third point I would make is that we're talking about overruling a precedent of 40 years' standing. There need to be ­­ needs to be a showing of changed circumstances, it seems to me. Now, with respect to the question of ­­ of the role that agency fee ­­ the role that agency fees play in the process, I think it is quite important, and this goes to a point you raised, Justice Scalia. Abood never said, and no case since Abood has ever said, that agency fees are necessary to union survival. Abood couldn't have said that, because when Abood ruled as it did, Taft­Hartley had been on the books for decades. And so with respect to the private sector, what Congress had said with respect to the private sector is that employers get to choose. Employees get to decide whether the agency fee will help them achieve their workplace goals. And what the Court said in Abood was that public employers ought to have the same kind of choice to respond to workplace needs and local conditions that prior employee ­­",
  "I ­­ I respectfully disagree with that as a technical matter. I think Abood did cite Pickering. And if one looks at the briefs in Abood, the parties on both sides were arguing Pickering. But beyond that, I think ­­",
  "No. But I think it shares ­­ what I said at the outset, Mr. Chief Justice, is I think the key point: That this Court's First Amendment law in the public employment context has, over time, converged with Abood, in that the cases generally have recognized that when government is acting as employer, it has interests that, if government were acting as sovereign regulating the citizenry, wouldn't suffice to justify conditions on speech.",
  "Let me take ­­",
  "Yeah.",
  "Yes.",
  "I can't ­­",
  "I ­­ I can't think of one, specifically.",
  "I can't think of one, but that goes right to the difference, right to the difference between government acting as employer, managing the workplace, and government acting as sovereign, regulating the citizenry. In the latter situation, what this Court's cases would say is that that is not government acting to manage the workplace; that is government leveraging its ­­ its control over the employee, acting as sovereign, affecting that person in his role as citizen, and that would get exacting scrutiny. And that ­­ so that ­­ I think that's the key. We're not arguing that Abood applies of its own terms. We're arguing that there's an insight that underlays Abood, and it underlays Garcetti, and frankly, it underlays the political affiliation cases as well. Because if you look at those, what those cases all say, contrary to what my friends say, is that when government can show the political affiliation is a reasonable requirement for the effective performance of the job in question, that that affiliation requirement can be upheld. That, again, is not exacting scrutiny; it's reasonableness. Every case lines up along that axis. And so ­­ and I ­­ I think that's the key point about Pickering. And if I could, I just want to address a couple other points.",
  "No. What I'm saying is that it occurs in the context of the ­­ the collective bargaining relationship, which is a ­­ which is ­­ it has to be subject to a different set of constitutional standards. It has to be; because, think about it. With respect to collective bargaining, there's a specialized channel of communication that the government sets up. The government controls who can speak, when the discussion's going to occur, and what topics can be discussed.",
  "But I guess what I would say about that, Justice Scalia, what I read this Court's cases as saying in the employee speech context, in the employee petitioning context, in the political affiliation context, is that you ­­ yes, it's not wholly free of First Amendment scrutiny. But recognizing the government's interests as employer and prerogatives as employer, you apply reasonableness review and not the exacting scrutiny that applies when government is regulating as a sovereign regulator.",
  "Yes. Certainly, certainly. That's why ­­ that's why I think there was no doubt in Garcetti that the speech was not a matter of public concern. And I could have said the same thing in Borough of Duryea and any number of these courts' other cases. That's not the ­­ that's not the distinction the Court has drawn. The distinction the Court has drawn is between government acting as employer managing the workforce, and the government as sovereign regulating the citizenry. And I respectfully submit that that ­­ that that distinction applies with equal force here, and especially given the stare decisis considerations that ­­ that ought to govern this Court's decision in this context that that is more than sufficient to uphold, to reaffirm Abood. Because as I said, what this Court's cases have recognized through all the public employer context is the same principle for which Abood stands.",
  "May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?",
  "What I would say about that, Justice Sotomayor, is that in this context, the subsidy goes to the process of contract formation and contract administration within that collective bargaining context that I described earlier, that of necessity, a different First Amendment standard has to apply to. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The effects of the Texas law at issue in this case are much more extreme than those of any abortion law that this Court has considered since Casey. This law closes most abortion facilities in the State, puts extreme stress on the few facilities that remain open, and exponentially increases the obstacles confronting women who seek abortions in the State. And it does all of that on the basis of a medical justification that cannot withstand any meaningful scrutiny that the American Medical Association has told you is groundless and that the district court found will actually operate in practice to increase health risks to women and not decrease.",
  "No, I ­­ I don't think it is true about every provision in the regulations, Justice Alito.",
  "Yes.",
  "So I ­­ I agree with the premise of Your Honor's question. There are some parts of the regulation that I think, operating alone, wouldn't have the substantial obstacle effect. In fact, some parts of the regulation actually restate and reauthorize regulations that were already on the books. And so I suppose one could say that with respect to that set of regulations, that the district court could have severed them under the severability clause. One could say that. Of course, they're already in the preexisting regulations ­­",
  "So I ­­ I don't want to state an opinion one way or the other about that. But I do want to ­­ what I ­­ but I think ­­ getting to the point of Your Honor's question, I think the problem the district court confronted here, and I think the reason the district court acted reasonably, despite the presence of the severability clause ­­ and the severability clause provides an instruction that ­­ that every provision, every clause, every word, every application, every individual should be severed. And the problem is ­­ the problem with the kind that the Court noted, I think, in the Ayotte case, for a court trying to apply that, the court's got to go in and decide which collection of the many, many requirements there ought to stand and which shouldn't, and it's ­­ it's going to be invading ­­",
  "­­ the State's regulatory problems.",
  "So ­­",
  "I ­­ I think some could have been, if the Court believes a remand is appropriate for the ­­ for the remedy to be more carefully tailored in the way that the Court did in the Ayotte case. We think that would be appropriate. But we do think that the basic point remains that this is a substantial obstacle. And I would like to address two points that arose during Petitioners' argument. First, closures, and then, capacity. With respect to closures, here's where I think the record will show you taking the ASC requirement first. The 13 ­­ there's a stipulation, JA 183, that all ­­ all clinics that weren't already closed as a result of the admitting­privilege requirement would ­­ would not be able to meet the ASC requirements; and therefore, could not ­­ would have to cease operations. Justice Kagan noted they did cease operation during the period in which the law was in State. There's evidence in the record with respect to the seven clinics that are operated by Whole Woman's Health that they ­­ that it was physically impossible to meet the ASC construction requirements because it couldn't fit on the real estate footprint that they had; they couldn't meet them. There's expert testimony in the record from Dr. Layne­Farrar, the economist, that the cost of retrofitting these clinics to meet the requirements would be between 1.6 and 2.3 million dollars, which would be prohibitive; that the cost of building a new facility would be at least 3.5 million dollars, which would be prohibitive; and that the additional operating cost of an ASC would be between 600,00 and a million dollars a year more. So I think with respect to those, there's ample evidence. With respect to the ­­ with respect to the admitting­privileges requirement, we know that 11 of the 20 clinics that closed between the date when the law was enacted and the effective date of the admitting­privileges requirement closed on the date that that requirement became effective. Seems to me the only reasonable inference you can draw with respect to those 11 is that that law caused the closure. With respect to the others, I don't think there's evidence with respect to each one, but with respect to several, there is evidence that they closed in advance of the effective date, because they were otherwise going to have to pay a licensing fee to stay open for another year, which they knew they were not. And they knew they weren't going to be able to stay open, and they didn't want to flush the money away. So I think there's ample evidence in the record with respect to causation. Now, with respect to capacity, I really think this is key, because I do think this is the locus of the substantial obstacle problem here. With respect to capacity, before this law took ­­ took effect, there were approximately 65 to 70,000 abortions a year annually. The ASC clinics that will be able to remain open ­­ the ASC facilities that will be able to remain open performed about 14,000 a year. That's what the record tells you. It's Dr. Grossman's expert testimony. It's in the JA from pages 225 to 259.",
  "20 percent. So they'd have to increase four­ or five­fold in a very short period of time with the ­­ against the backdrop of having to meet the problems that the admitting­privileges requirement causes. Now, I understand that the Fifth Circuit said that was ipse dixit, but with all due respect, that's not binding on you and it's just wrong. And if you look at the expert testimony at the JA pages I identified, you'll see that what Dr. Grossman said first was something that is just common sense, that these clinics aren't going to be ­­ these facilities aren't going to be able to increase by four or five times. And second, he didn't just rely on common sense. He looked at the period of time between when the admitting­privileges requirement resulted in the closure of 20 clinics. He looked at that period of time, and he studied the number of abortions that occurred at the remaining ASC facilities during that period of time. And one would expect, given that half the facilities in the State closed, that there would be a substantial increase ­­",
  "You know, I ­­ I apologize, Justice Kennedy. I haven't given that question thought, and I'm loathe to opine on that without having given it thought. But I do think ­­",
  "But ­­ but I do think, as I said, with respect to the capacity problem, the key thing here is that when, in addition to these ASC clinics not providing more abortions once half the clinics in the State closed, you had ­­ and this is, again, in Dr. Grossman's testimony ­­ significant increases in the overall number of abortions, particularly in the parts of the State that were far away from the major cities, the northern ­­",
  "Well, I think ­­",
  "­­ I think you have expert testimony in that regard.",
  "Well, it is. It's common sense that you can't ­­",
  "But beyond that, as I said, Justice Alito, they studied the period of time in which half the clinics in the State were closed. And you would expect that those clinics ­­ that the additional ASCs can handle the ­­ the capacity, they would have, and they didn't.",
  "Yes.",
  "In ­­ in the short time I have remaining, I'd like to finish with one point, if I could. I think, ultimately, the question before you is whether the right here is going to retain real substance, and whether the balance ­­ whether the balance struck in Casey still holds. If that right still does retain real substance, then this law cannot stand. The burdens it imposes, the obstacles, are far beyond anything that this Court has countenanced. And the justification for it is far weaker than anything that this Court has countenanced. It is an undue burden. It is the definition of an undue burden. And, Mr. Chief Justice, you ­­ in response to your question, undue means excessive or unwarranted. Could be excessive or unwarranted as compared to the ­­ the obstacle it imposes, certainly. But also, as compared to its need.",
  "Well, I think it's actually in the interest of government to look at it the way that we're suggesting it ought to be looked at. And I ­­ if I ­­ you know, if could take two minutes to explain why.",
  "And I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that is because, you know, it is one thing to say that you're going to impose a requirement that does work as much as to be the kind of obstacle that this requirement ­­ that these requirements do, when you have justification that's frankly flimsy and the American Medical Association has told you was groundless. But if ­­ if the government were able to come in ­­ if it were us or if it were State ­­ were able to come in and say, well, actually, this requirement is going to make a difference in saving hundreds of lives, that might be a burden that you would think would be acceptable, given the medical benefit. That's why we think the ­­ the test that makes sense, the best understanding of undue burden, the understanding of undue burden that works best for the government is the one we're suggesting. But I think whichever way you look at that, whether you look at it our way or whether you look at it as two separate inquiries, this law, HB2, can't pass it, for the reasons I said. And I think, therefore, that if you do find that this law is upheld, what you will be saying is that this right really only exists in theory and not in fact, going forward, and that the commitments that this Court made in Casey will not have been kept. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The accommodation that Petitioners challenge in this case strikes precisely the sensible balance between religious liberty and compelling governmental interests that Congress sought when it enacted RFRA. As this Court recognized in Hobby Lobby, the accommodation seeks to respect the religious liberty of Petitioners by exempting them from the contraceptive ­­ contraceptive requirement, and to respect the interest of Petitioners' employees ­­",
  "We do not concede there's a substantial burden, Justice Kennedy. We ­­ we concede that the religious belief is sincere. We're not questioning sincerity of the belief, but we don't think that in a case in which the ­­ an ­­ when a question is this, when a religious objection is made to the independent arrangements of the government makes with third parties to fill a regulatory gap created by granting an exemption from a ­­ a generally applicable rule, that that qualifies as ­­",
  "No, we do not.",
  "So, look, I'm ­­ I'm happy to discuss the substantial burden further, but I do want to go to what I think is the critical point on the question of how RFRA scrutiny applies, if it does apply, and it's this: Mr. Francisco spent a lot of time talking about the various alternatives that the government might be able to use instead of the accommodation, and I think there's a real problem with every single one of them in that every single one of them defeats the very purpose for which Congress imposed the preventive services requirement, not just with respect to contraception, but with respect to all preventive services. And the point here, and I think you can see this, if you look at the relevant statutory provision, which you can find at Page 4(a) of the appendix to our brief, which is the preventive services ­­ preventive services provision, the point here of this provision is that a group health plan, i.e., the health plan that covers people through their employer, or individual health insurance coverage, i.e., the kind of coverage that's sold on the Exchanges, shall include cost free all of the preventive services. The whole point of this provision, the whole point of it, was to ensure that people who got health insurance would get the preventive services as part of their regular care from their regular doctor with no barriers.",
  "Yes, I understand that, Your Honor. But assuming for the moment ­­ and I'm happy to discuss substantial burden further ­­ but assuming for the moment that we are in RFRA scrutiny because there is a substantial burden, the point I'm making here, and I do think this is critical, is that the ­­ none of these options that the Petitioners have identified going out on the Exchange and buying a separate individual policy, a contraceptive coverage only policy, Title X, Medicare, Medicaid, with respect to every one of them, you'd have to change the law to make them even eligible here. But even if you could change the law, every single one of them creates the very problem that Congress was trying to solve in this provision because it would require setting up a one­off jerry­rigged separate channel to get contraceptive coverage.",
  "I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice. I understand that that's their position. Let me engage with you on the question of whether that constitutes a substantial burden. We think that it doesn't constitute a substantial burden because the way that this accommodation is structured, although you're quite right, it seeks from the perspective of the employee to ensure that the employee gets the protection that Congress designed, that from the perspective of the employer, that this is provided through a separate program.",
  "No. We're saying that the judgment about complicity is up to you, but that there is an objective limit that RFRA recognizes on the scope of what is a cognizable burden, that that was true in the pre­Smith case law before RFRA, and it was recognized in Lyng and in Bowen, and those are cases in which there was no doubt ­­",
  "Well, as I said, Your Honor, if RFRA scrutiny applies, then this certainly is the least restrictive alternative.",
  "It has precisely the problem. It's not a less restrictive alternative because it has precisely the problem Congress was trying to overcome in the preventive services provision.",
  "No, Your Honor.",
  "Yes, of course.",
  "For the very reason that the employee has to go out and get a separate policy, even in the world that doesn't exist now, because those policies can't be sold on Exchanges now ­­",
  "But even in that hypothetical world, that is not equally effective at achieving the government's interest, because the whole point of this provision is that you get this care from your regular doctor as part of your regular health care without any barriers, including any co­pay barriers. And I think ­­ think about ­­ consider this, please, from the perspective of the woman employee. She has a health plan from her employer. She goes to ­­ she goes to her doctor, her regular doctor. She may have a medical condition that makes pregnancy a danger for her. She may be one of the women, and this is about 15 percent of all prescribed contraception, who needs contraception to treat a medical condition, or maybe she just wants the contraception that's appropriate for her. What happens under this ­­ under Petitioners' regime is the doctor has to say to her ­­ her regular doctor has to say to her, Sorry, I can't help you. It's not just that you don't get paid ­­ the prescription paid for, it's not just that he can't write the prescription, he can't counsel or educate the patient.",
  "Because it wouldn't be her regular doctor. She'd have to go out and buy the separate plan, find a doctor who is willing to take the separate plan, assuming ­­ assuming, of course, that there are insurance companies willing to sell these separate ­­",
  "But the whole point here, Justice Alito, is that Congress wanted to eliminate ­­ even what were perceived by most of the small barriers, like a 5 or $10 co­pay, because the medical experts said that even though small barriers ­­ even when you're getting it as part of your regular coverage, even those small barriers work as a sufficient disincentive that many fewer people use contraception than would otherwise, and that ­­ and the barrier ­­ and the system that Your Honor is positing, imposes a significantly greater barrier even in a ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "So grandfathered plans, let's talk about them. As I do ­­ and I will answer Your Honor's question directly, but I do think the broader context matters here. This is a transitional device. The number of people who are in grandfathered plans has dropped by 50 percent. There is no reason to think it's not going to continue to drop, and if it does continue to drop, at the pace of the last four years, we'll be at zero very soon.",
  "Your Honor, when Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, it made ­­ it didn't impose an immediate requirement that every building be retrofitted so that access to the disabled was possible. What it said was, in that context, that where it's feasible to do so, buildings shall retrofit, and then new buildings shall have these access requirements. No one would say that the government lacks a compelling interest in enforcing the Americans with Disabilities Act because Congress decided on a transitional system. This was a big program. There were reliance interests. Congress decided on transition. It understood that this number was going to drop dramatically over time. You want ­­ a good place to know why it's going to drop dramatically over time, look at the declaration from the Dioceses of Pittsburgh at page 86 of the Joint Appendix where they say, we are sticking with our grandfathered plan now because we don't want to trigger the contraceptive coverage requirement, but it's costing us a fortune. We have to change. And that's the reality, and that's why it's going to go down. And with respect to contraception itself, Your Honor, the grandfathered plan says the ­­ the Institute of Medicine and its study, which is in the record, said that contraceptive coverage is standard practice now. And we cited a study that said 86 percent of all plans have contraceptive coverage. So most of these women are going to have contraceptive coverage. Now, they are not going to have it cost free, and that's the difference. But the idea that ­­",
  "No. But what I'm saying, Your Honor, is that this is ­­ unlike the exemption for small employees under Title VII, which exempts 17 million people from these fundamental protections against race and gender and religious discrimination, and does so permanently, this is a transitional device where over time you're going to get down to a situation where virtually nobody has ­­ is in the situation, being in a grandfathered plan, and most of them are getting some form of contraceptive coverage anyway. So I don't think it undermines a compelling interest one bit.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, that's ­­",
  "I think that is the essence of our position on substantial burden, Your Honor, and I believe that trying to answer Justice Breyer's question about where that comes from, I believe it comes from Lyng and Bowen, which both recognize that there is an objective limit in Lung. For example, the Court said that the ­­ it did not doubt that the ­­ the government actions were going to have a devastating impact on a religious exercise of the ­­",
  "I would agree with you to this limited extent, Mr. Chief Justice, that that's the context in which the government action occurs here, that the fact that the ­­ there is this relationship between Petitioners and their employees is the occasion for government acting. But there is two points that are critical, I think, and go to why we shouldn't consider this to be a cognizable burden. And the first one is that what we are doing when we act here is trying to make an alternative arrangement that comes as close as we can to ensuring that the employees who may not share the Petitioner's religious beliefs get what the law entitles them to while at the same time ensuring that the employer does not have any legal obligation to pay for the coverage, to provide the coverage in any way. I mean, I think that the ­­ the practical features of this are critical. The employer cannot be charged for the co­pay, even insurance ­­ insurance plan, self­insured, either way, cannot be charged. The insurance company or third­party administrator has got to use separate segregated funds. It's got to provide separate segregated notices. In many instances, it provides a separate insurance card to the employees for this part of the coverage. So what ­­ so in that respect, it is an independent arrangement with third parties. And the ­­ we may ­­",
  "Right.",
  "I think it is one fair understanding of the case. We think that ­­",
  "Let me put it this way, Mr. Chief Justice. We would be content if the Court were to conclude that with respect to substantial burden, it could assume a substantial burden but that the government has satisfied its burden under RFRA to show a compelling interest, and that this is the least restricted means of achieving ­­",
  "No, we are not giving up on it, because we do think ­­ but we do think the discussion this morning is suggestive that this is a hard question, and it is important to us. And that's why we're fighting on it and not giving up on it.",
  "We are not urging you to state a comprehensive standard here that tells ­­",
  "I think ­­ I think we're urging a more incremental approach that recognizes that the principles articulated in Lyng and Bowen apply in a situation where the government is acting ­­ making arrangements with third parties in order to fill a regulatory gap that the ­­ that has been created by the government granting an exemption to a religious entity.",
  "Yes. We think that would trigger RFRA, and it would be a substantial burden. The difference is that in that situation, you're actually on their premises. And in this situation ­­ and trying to get back to what I was discussing with you, Mr. Chief Justice ­­ Aetna is a ­­ is a different entity from Petitioners. Blue Cross is a different entity from Petitioners. The government makes its arrangements with Aetna or with Blue Cross, and we make arrangements with Aetna and with Blue Cross and other insurance companies and TPAs to provide contraceptive coverage to other third parties, the employees.",
  "I don't think that's quite right, Justice Alito. I think there's been some confusion on that on the Petitioner's side. There are two separate notices that operate here on the self­insured plan. The first is the notice that the employer provides to the government. That's an ERISA plan document, but what that ­­ what ­­ the legal effect of that document is to exempt the employer from any obligation to provide contraceptive coverage. There is a second document, a different document, that the government then sends to the third­party administrator. That document is the document that has a legal effect that creates the obligation on the part of the third­party administrator to provide the coverage. So it is not the case that the document that comes to us is an authorizing document. That's an exempting document.",
  "So I ­­",
  "Well, I think ­­",
  "Well, it's not just that it's like intangible property. The ­­ the plaintiffs really have a set of rules, and the third­party administrator becomes ­­ for purpose of administering this, it becomes the plan administrator, the sole plan administrator, for this portion of the plan. But even if one thought that there was ­­ that ­­ that this did create a legally sufficient reason to find a substantial burden for ­­ for third­party administrators, it's not true about the situation with insurance companies. It's not true about church plans. And so then it seems to me the question is whether switching from having a self­insured third­party administrator situation to an insurance company situation would ­­ whether this would be a substantial burden.",
  "Yes. And then ­­ and then the government makes an arrangement with the insurance company that operates in parallel to that plan. And so ­­ but ­­ but it isn't through that plan. It's in parallel to that plan. So I think there's a significant difference there, but ­­",
  "So this gets to the question of the church exemption, Your Honor. And let me try to explain that. I think it's helpful to understand how it came about. The church ­­ initially HHS decided that it would create an exemption for churches. And then ­­ and there were some back­and­forth, regulatory proceedings. Petitioners participated in that, created the exemption for churches. And then the religious nonprofits came in and said, well, the exemption ought to be extended to us. The government made a judgment that as a categorical matter, it wasn't willing to extend the exemption to all religious nonprofits, as was requested, but it, instead, would use this accommodation, which we thought was the best way that we could both protect their religious liberty and ­­",
  "But ­­",
  "The reason we drew the line is because we think ­­ and I think Professor Laycock's brief is quite instructive on this point ­­ is that while there ­­ no line is perfect, and I'm sure this line isn't perfect, and there's going to be some overlap between entities that maybe you think of ­­ or look closer to being on one side of the line than the other. But the line is a valid line. And it's a valid line largely for the reasons Justice Kennedy identified earlier, because in that category of religious nonprofits may be some entities, like the one Your Honor has identified, that appear very close to entities that have an exemption. But there are also going to be lots of other entities whose connection to that core religious mission is much more attenuated ­­",
  "And so I ­­ I think we could, Your Honor, yes, under ­­ I think under ­­ I think we would ­­ it would be an appropriate accommodation, and I think if we had the same compelling interest, and we'd make the same narrowly tailored means argument. But we have constrained ourselves. We've tried to be especially careful with houses of worship. And that's a normal thing that governments do with respect to houses of worship.",
  "Right. And let me try to walk through this carefully, because I do think it's important. They have identified three. First is grandfathered plans. We've had a lengthy discussion about that. I think I've tried to show you that that ­­ I don't think you can argue that that exemption undermines the government's compelling interest. They claim that there is an exemption for employers who have fewer than 50 employees, but that's just wrong. In fact, there's no reason to think that virtually anybody in the ­­ in that category of employees of those small employers isn't getting contraceptive coverage as part of their regular health care from the regular doctors. And let me explain why that is. There is no exemption from the contraceptive requirement for that group. Proof of it is that several Petitioners are in that group of fewer than 50 employees, and they're asking for the ­­ and they're asking for the ­­ and they're ­­ and they've raised the RFRA claim here. So ­­ and that's because when employers in that group provide coverage, they have to meet the contraceptive coverage requirements so the employees get the coverage from their regular doctor as part of their regular health plan. Then also, if your employer is not providing you coverage in that group, then you go on an Exchange, and then you purchase a policy on the Exchange. And that policy provides you with contraceptive coverage as part of your regular health plan from your regular doctor, or you ­­ you ­­ if you are eligible, you apply for Medicaid. And Medicaid gives you contraceptive coverage as part of your regular health plan from your regular doctor.",
  "No. Because in that circumstance, Your Honor, the only option that that employee has is to buy an individual policy on the Exchange. And that individual policy will contain the contraceptive coverage from your regular doctor as part of your regular health care. The difference is with ­­ when somebody works for a grandfathered plan, for example, in that category, or for a church, the ­­ those people are already getting insurance. And ­­ and so for them, there ­­ it is an obstacle because you're forcing them to purchase a second insurance policy. And ­­ and that really becomes a financial penalty for them, because part of their compensation is, of course, the health insurance they're getting from their regular doctors.",
  "So, Your Honor, I think the answer to that is that they're not subsidizing it, because the way in which this plan is structured, the way in which the accommodation is structured, is that they are not to ­­ employers are not to bear any financial burden for the contraceptive coverage that has to be provided without charging the employer, and funds have to be segregated, and all activity has to be segregated. So there ­­ it's ­­ it's quite carefully designed to avoid the existence of any subsidy with respect to them. And then ­­ and so we talked about ­­",
  "Well, because they have to sign up for a second plan and pay for a second plan, Your Honor. And that's precisely the kind of obstacle that Congress is trying to insure did not exist when it passed the Preventive Services provision of this statute. The whole idea here is to ensure that these employees get the health care, get this covered, get this care from their regular doctor as part of their regular health care without these added obstacles and the need to go out and sign up for another plan and then find the doctors who are going to provide coverage under that plan. All of those are precisely the kinds of obstacles that Congress was trying to eliminate because all the ­­",

  "Yes. Every policy sold on the Exchanges ­­",
  "Well, except for that one.",
  "But that's a ­­",
  "You couldn't do it under current law, Your Honor.",
  "But in this circumstance, I think, you don't need to get to that question of whether there is an obligation to change current law because even if you did have a second contraceptive­only policy available on an Exchange, that would be precisely the kind of barrier that Congress is trying to eliminate. You have two policies instead of one policy. That creates the disincentives. A lot of women employees, I'm certain, will reach the conclusion that, well, you know, I've got this coverage over here ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "Right.",

But even if it were, it presents the same problem of creating the obstacle which creates the inertia problem, which undermines the compelling interest, which is not just the compelling interest of the Institute of Medicine and HHS, but if Congress itself ­­ because the whole point of the statutory provision here is that this is supposed to be part of your ­­",

  "Well, I don't ­­ I don't think that it would address the problem, Justice Alito, because it would ­­",
  "Right. I think that's exactly the point here, is that the ­­ the woman employee ­­ and I do, and I try to ­­",
  "The difference is this: It's not just about filling out paperwork; that if you're a woman employee, you go to your regular doctor, you say you have a medical condition ­­ I ­­ that puts me at risk of being pregnant, or I just want contraceptive coverage, or I need contraception to treat a medical condition. And the way this works now, if ­­ if the RFRA exemption is granted here, is that the doctor has to say I cannot help you with that.",
  "The ­­ I understand the interest to be avoiding complicity in what they consider to be sin. We take that very seriously, but ­­",
  "I think RFRA cuts, in this situation, quite decisively in favor of the government here because the interests are compelling. And the ­­ and as we've tried to explain, none of the alternatives that the Petitioners have proposed have come anywhere close to being equally effective in ensuring that women get this coverage. And so ­­ and the obstacles that ­­ that you get told by your regular doctor, I can't help you, I can't even counsel you about this. And ­­ and numerous other Petitioners have filed declarations saying that our ­­ our insurance will not cover even any counseling about contraception. So you've got to go out and find another doctor. And then you've got ­­ and ­­ and you've got to find a way to pay for that doctor, and then you've got to find a way to pay for the contraceptive coverage. It's a whole host of very serious obstacles. It's not just about signing a form. And that gets to the heart of the problem here.",
  "Well, that would ­­",
  "Well, that would be a happenstance. Somebody's got to offer that separate plan, and that separate plan has got to ­­ and then the doctor that she goes to as a regular doctor has to be the same ­­ has to be under the same plan. There's no reason to think that she could get that, and ­­",
  "All right. I think what we've tried to ­­ the ­­ the way I've tried to explain that, Your Honor, is that we have tried ­­ and I think the Court recognized this in Hobby Lobby, that the goal of this is to exempt the employer from providing the contraceptive coverage, to exempt them and to provide it as separate means through separate funds without their involvement, and therefore, it's not hijacking. What I'd like to do, if I could, I want to make one point about the ­­",
  "When you're hired by one of the religious organizations, you get a brochure or a package with all your insurance coverage and, you know, everything it is. And where would the contraceptive services be listed? It won't be in that brochure, it can't be in that brochure, there's got to be a separate communication from the insurance company to the employee telling the employee you're getting this separately from us. That's how it works. Now, there ­­",
  "So I think that that raises all the problems identified.",
  "No. Two policies instead of one. You have got to pay for that policy.",
  "Well, I think ­­ I think if it's a separate policy, you're going to have to apply and pay separately. There is a whole separate regime. I do want to make one point about the notice, because my friend on the other side raised the idea of notice, that it's not just about us using the plan, but the notice they provide. That notice argument, I think, can't constitute a substantial burden because it's entirely derivative of the objection to us setting up this third­party arrangement. And I ­­ I think Mr. Clement told you that this morning because he said if government didn't take this step of providing the coverage, we would be happy to provide any information they want on a form. And so I think that ­­ what that tells you is that the objection here, the focus of the objection, is the ­­ is the arrangement to provide the separate coverage and not the notice, per se; that on its own terms, it's unobjectionable.",
  "No, we don't think so. If I could, just in closing, what I'd ask this Court to do is to weigh the alternatives that have been put before you here on this case. On the one side, you've got a serious, thoughtful effort to respect Petitioners' religious beliefs by creating a system that allows them to exempt themselves from the requirement in a straightforward manner and that protects the fundamental rights and liberties and dignity of the ­­ of their employees, many of whom may not share their religious beliefs about contraception. On the other side of the scale, what you've got is a demand that those rights or those employees who may not share Petitioners' beliefs be extinguished ­­ extinguished until such time as Congress creates and enacts a different program that will require a separate one­off jerry­rigged channel for them to provide and obtain contraceptive coverage that will impose precisely the burdens that Congress said in the relevant statutory provision are unacceptable for all preventive services.",
  "What I would say to that, Your Honor, is that, I think, essentially what eight court of appeals have said, which is that RFRA requires a sensible balance. A sensible balance is essential in a pluralistic society like ours, in which people of every faith on earth live and work side by side, and the government has got to administer rules that are fair to everyone. The accommodation ­­ the accommodation achieves that balance. Petitioners' position is very, very far from that balance and, therefore, the court of appeals should be affirmed. Thank you."
