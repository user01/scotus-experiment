  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As this Court made clear in West v. Sullivan, the Government -- when the Government appropriates funds to establish a Government program it is entitled, within quite broad limits, to define the scope of that program.",
  "There are limits, and the principal --",
  "The only situation in which this Court has struck down a Government funding restriction on viewpoint grounds was in the Rosenberger case, and in that case, what the Court held is, there the university had made funds available to encourage a broad diversity of private expression and had created what this Court there termed a public forum and reiterated in the NEA case that --",
  "Well, Congress did not establish the Legal Services Corporation and the program under it as a public forum. For purposes of forum analysis the question is whether the Legal Services Corporation is a forum. That is the program, because that was the program in the Rosenberger case. It was the precise expression or activity that was funded by, in that case, the university's activities, and it -- what Congress did in the Legal Services Act was to provide for the furnishing of a particular professional service, just like in Rust, the particular professional service that is not the full expression of ideas of the sort that has been covered by this Court's free speech cases, it is a professional service in which there are submissions made to a body, either administrative or judicial body, under structural, procedural and substantive --",
  "It is, but as this Court said in the Walters case and the Yorkline case, the First Amendment really doesn't add anything to what has been the traditional source of constitutional guidance in that area, which has been the Due Process Clause.",
  "With all respect --",
  "But there are many situations in our legal system in which Congress has enacted laws that favor one litigant over another, one sort of claim over another, the furnishing --",
  "No. I think what Congress did here was say that a lawyer may not take on that case to begin with. In other words --",
  "Well, any speech that would happen in a courtroom first of all is not the lawyer's own self-expression. The lawyer is advancing arguments on behalf of a client, and not as a public forum with a free debate. The lawyer is making arguments that have legal consequences.",
  "The Government is not the client, but what the Government is, is, it is the Government that established the program and, as this Court held in Rust, that when the Government establishes a program, it is entitled to encourage certain activities and not others, and --",
  "In Forbes it is possible to think of what was going on there as a debate, and classically a debate among candidates about political issues. We have never thought in our legal system of a courtroom or lawyers as engaging in a public policy or political debate. They are --",
  "No, but once the matter has been reduced out of the lobbying or the political sphere into the litigation sphere, we have a set of procedural and substantive rules that have legal consequences. When a complaint is filed in court, the other party must respond and the court will enter a judgment.",
  "If I could just go back to the Rust case, what the Court said there, and it is very similar, because it had to do with the furnishing of particular services, and particular types of expression were not permitted under that program.",
  "No, it was -- I -- it was not --",
  "I don't think that's a fair characterization of the program in Rust, and in fact the respondents in this case concede that the Government was not the speaker. What the Government was doing was paying for counselors to exercise their professional judgment in their interactions with clients. That did not lead to a one-directional urging for every person who walked in the door to have family planning. It was counseling to help the client come to her own conclusion as to what the result was. It was professional services, professional judgments just like this one is, and what the Court said --",
  "-- some types of services are outside the scope of the program, and that's exactly what Congress said here.",
  "If I could make two responses to that. First of all, in Rust itself, the Court recognized that the matching funds that were required under Title X were also subject to the restrictions, and that's in footnote 5 of the Rust decision. But beyond that, what the Legal Services Corporation provided for here is exactly what was provided for in Rust, which was allowing the recipient to set up a separate entity to engage in the activities that could not be engaged in by the recipient itself. The LSC regulations were patterned directly after the regulations in Rust, and --",
  "The -- it would -- the matter would have to be presented by the counterpart organization. Now, if the -- if the lawyer involved was a part-time lawyer with the Legal Services-funded recipient, and worked separately for the other entity, and there was the requisite separation of functions, yes, that lawyer could present the arguments, assuming that the separation requirements were met in the other program. But that -- what the Legal Services Corporation did here is consistent with the Regan decision, with League of Women Voters, and most significantly with Rust, in providing for that private expression. But of course, that's to allow for the recipient's private expression, the association's private expression. Here, I think it's also important to bear in mind that the vast majority of the funds, non-LSC funds that are received, are also public funds, the IOLTA funds, the State funds, so we're not talking about an entity that has a large amount of private funds of the sort a typical private association would have.",
  "This fund does -- this restriction does apply to State funds.",
  "Yes. The statute does it. I would like to reserve the balance of my time, if I may.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. It's important to bear in mind that what we have here is what type -- is a question concerning what type of professional services is the Government going to pay for under a Government program which is neither a regulation nor is it a funding restriction that affects private expression of the sort that was involved in NEA. It is funding professional services. I also take substantial issue with respondent's claim that all that Rust covers is Government speech. As the Chief Justice pointed out, Rust itself did not say that, and this Court's subsequent cases have not said that. In the Rosenberger case, for example, in addition to the passage the Chief Justice quoted about using private persons to deliver a message pertaining to the Government's own program, on page 630 -- or 834, the Court further said, it does not follow from the Government speaking -- where the Government itself speaks, that it does not follow that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the university does not itself speak, or subsidized transmittal of a message that it favors, but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers. The dichotomy that was created in Rosenberger was one where the Government is subsidizing essentially a forum where the Government gives money to a forum and asks the private speakers to have at it with one another for the benefit of the public at large, which is different from subsidizing a message the Government favors. Here, although the Legal Services lawyer opposing a State agency may not be advancing the Government's speech, the Government has decided that when it comes to a challenge of a State welfare regulation, that is not a message that the Government favors within the meaning of Rust. And again, NEA and the Wisconsin case last term did not suggest that Rust was limited to situations where it is the Government's own speech. One way in which this case raises even less of a First Amendment question than Rust is the fact that in Rust the doctor was not even permitted to advise the client where other services could be obtained. Under this program, the Legal Services lawyer, if he or she identifies a possible challenge to a statute or regulation, may tell the client that, may refer the client to another agency, to a pro bono list. Every LSC recipient is required to have a private attorney involved in the program with a list of attorneys to whom cases may be referred, so there is no gagging of communications at all. Even though there's no attorney-client relationship, the LSC fund recipient can refer the client. Also, in the context of litigation, to the extent the courtroom is a forum, it's a forum that exists independent of the Legal Services Corporation. What the Legal Services Corporation does is decide what sorts of cases are going to be funded, and there isn't enough money to go around. Congress had to decide how those moneys should be allocated. Lawyers do this all the time. Legal Services recipients do this all the time, in terms of setting their own priorities. With respect to issues concerning challenging the Government's position, one need look no further than sovereign immunity on the State level to the Eleventh Amendment to recognize that there are many situations in which the Government may decline to allow challenges in court to its own positions and, by the same token, Congress could certainly choose not to -- could repeal the Equal Access to Justice Act and not provide attorney's fees to people who want to sue the Government, even though it may provide attorney's fees for suits against private parties. And as we point out in our brief, Congress has provided differential standards for the award of attorney's fees, favoring plaintiffs in certain types of cases like environmental cases or civil rights cases, but not favoring the defendants in those cases. As Justice Scalia pointed out, all litigation has two sides, and in one respect could be viewed as viewpoint, but this Court has never analyzed regulations on attorney conduct or the attorney-client relationship in that way. Also, with respect to the argument that this is an anti-Government -- a prohibition against anti-Government speech, this is -- there's not a monolithic Government here. This statute prohibits an LSC recipient from taking on a case where what she would be doing would be challenging a State regulation as being in violation of Federal law. In other words, it would be a situation where the lawyer might even be trying to vindicate, in her view, what Federal law says on the subject, but still the client is not, or the attorney is not permitted to take that on. Congress could reasonably determine in the allocation of scarce resources that that was a better allocation of the resources.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the naturalization clause of the United States Constitution commits to Congress the plenary power inherent in the sovereignty of every nation to determine which aliens will be granted United States citizenship. As this Court said in the Ginsburg case, no alien has the slightest right to naturalization unless all statutory requirements are complied with.",
  "With respect to that, I think this Court's decision in Wong Kim Ark is dispositive. There the Court traced the history of United States citizenship with reference to the common law of England prior to the adoption of the Constitution, and in that case the Court pointed out that at common law, in order to be a citizen at common law, it was necessary for the person to be born in England. The citizenship conferred on people who were born abroad to British subjects was conferred only by statute. In other words, it was not regarded historically in England as a fundamental --",
  "Yes, I'm not disputing that. The point I'm making is that this Court held in Wong Kim Ark and also held in Rogers v. Bellei that the conferral of citizenship on someone born abroad to a United States citizen is encompassed in the naturalization clause, and the important thing about Wong Kim Ark is the Court distinguished persons born to U.S. citizens abroad not on the ground that that was a more fundamental form of citizenship, but if anything, a less fundamental form of citizenship.",
  "No, once --",
  "Once the person is a citizen, of course, then that citizen, like every other citizen, is entitled to all the rights of a citizen under the United States Constitution. But the question here is who will be entitled to enter the citizenship of the United States to begin with, and in that respect we think this case is identical to -- at least as strong as Fiallo versus Bell, and, if anything, stronger, because it is not merely the question of who will be entitled to physically enter the United States, but who will be regarded as a member of our society on a permanent basis. Citizenship is essentially irreversible. An alien can be expelled. A citizen is a permanent member of the community.",
  "Oh, absolutely. No, I didn't mean to suggest -- yes. It's absolutely clear that a naturalized citizen can have his naturalization revoked. For example, if it was procured by fraud, but the other important -- and this was significant in Rogers v. Bellei, which had to do with the constitutionality of a condition subsequent for a citizen, a person who was born abroad to United States citizens. In that case, it was the parallel provision here in 1401 (g) until, I believe, it was 1978, someone in that situation had -- the child had to reside in the United States for some period of time after birth in order to establish the requisite connection with the United States, and that was challenged on the ground that the person having been declared a citizen at birth, there could not be a condition subsequent to perfecting it. And this Court upheld that provision in Rogers v. Bellei, and importantly, it did so by distinguishing the children of U.S. parents born abroad from those who are born in the United States with the suggestion that Congress has greater latitude with respect to the naturalization of those persons than it does to others, precisely because they are not encompassed by the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment refers to citizens who are born or naturalized in the United States, and the Court pointed out that persons who are born to United States citizens abroad do not fall within that description and therefore are not citizens for Fourteenth Amendment purposes.",
  "I'm sorry, I do not know the totals. I think the statistics that were cited in this Court's opinion in Miller v. Albright suggest that the pool is probably larger for the U.S. citizen, children of U.S. citizen fathers rather than mothers, which I think, by the way --",
  "I think that's true. And one point I wanted to make, Justice, an aside here, that goes, that would go critically to the question of remedy in this case. If we were --",
  "Well, I think there is probably a wide variation of the fact pattern. I took the question to mean --",
  "Well, I took the question to be identifying the father who is --",
  "Right, right, and even --",
  "It may or may not, but if the possibility of citizenship was available to people who had no prior assumption that they had any claim to United States citizenship, it is valuable enough in the world community that we would expect people to look for it.",
  "In many cases that is correct. I would like to go back to the point about Fiallo v. Bell because, as I said, I do believe this case is controlled by Fiallo v. Bell, if anything, the reasons for the deference to congressional powers are stronger here than they were in Fiallo v. Bell.",
  "Absolutely. Once a person is a citizen, they are a member of our national community and entitled to all of the rights of any other citizen.",
  "There would have to be, certainly as a statutory matter and perhaps as a constitutional matter, some defect in the original naturalization or the original --",
  "No, but that's why I think the prospect -- I mean, I suppose if in a situation like this the child was recognized as a U.S. citizen on the ground that the parent was a U.S. citizen and then it turned out that the parent was not a U.S. citizen after all, then the child's citizenship could be revoked on the ground that it was fraudulently or improperly procured, so it would be a situation with a factual predicate for the grant of citizenship in the first place.",
  "I would think --",
  "I believe that if the question ever arose of the denaturalization of someone who was born abroad to United States citizens, the same standards would apply to anyone who was naturalized in the United States and therefore is a Fourteenth Amendment citizen, and I believe the standard for denaturalization is clear and convincing evidence. I'm not sure of that, but I believe that's correct.",
  "I will. In fact, with respect to Fiallo, we think that all of the reasons why deference to the political branches in this area applied to immigration in Fiallo apply equally here, first of all in Fiallo itself, the Court lumped together immigration and naturalization at page 79, I believe it's 792 of its opinion, in describing Congress' plenary powers. And also first of all a reason why Fiallo applies is it's a question of who is going to enter our society. Certainly the children or parents in Fiallo were seeking to come into the United States with the hope eventually of being citizens. In Fiallo it was a two-step task. Here it's a one-step, but we don't think that the analysis in Fiallo should change on that. And therefore deciding who should be a citizen is also an aspect of who is an alien. They are flip side to the same question. And Congress has plenary power to control which aliens will be entitled to enter the United States. Third, it's intimately tied up with foreign relations, and again this is a point that was made in Fiallo itself. There the Court rejected the proposition at page 730 that the concerns about foreign relations only have to do with situations where there are grave threats to the national security or the general welfare of the United States. The Court said it had never deferred to the branches depending upon whether there was some threat of that nature or some more individualized determination as to who will be entitled to enter the United States.",
  "Well, again, that may depend. I mean, if you have a child born abroad to two U.S. citizen parents, that may be true, it may not be true, depending on the country.",
  "Yes, there are countries that go both ways, but what --",
  "That is true, and of course someone declared to be a citizen under this statute may also be a citizen of someplace else as well. There are questions of dual nationality that can arise.",
  "That is the justification for the shorter residency requirement because that is apt to be true in many cases, but the broader point --",
  "They are certainly not just as great. There may be an isolated country here and there where the problem would arise, but your question and Justice Ginsburg's questions highlight another reason for deference to Congress in that area, and that is that Congress has to strive to make the laws of this nation with respect to immigration and naturalization respond or make sense vis-a-vis the laws of not just one other nation, but many, many other nations.",
  "It would be subject to judicial review, and under the facially legitimate bona fide standard of Kleindienst v. Mandel and Fiallo, it would be necessary to ask what Congress was up to in a situation like that, so we are not suggesting that there is --",
  "Given the developments of equal protection under the law in this country, this Court might well conclude that it would not be facially legitimate for Congress simply to decide to go back to as you described it, the bad old days where all rights were thought to derive from the father or the husband. So we are not suggesting that. But this law, this law is fundamentally different from the situation that you are positing. This law --",
  "The standard that the Court applied in Fiallo v. Bell was that -- was the facially legitimate standard drawn from Kleindienst v. Mandel. The law is subject to scrutiny, and whatever rationale is posited has to be regarded by this Court as legitimate.",
  "I believe the Wauchope decision that struck down the provision that you're referring to, the pre-1934 decision, if I'm remembering correctly, the Ninth Circuit decision I believe invalidated it under that standard.",
  "We believe it could because fundamentally what this is about is trying to put fathers of children born out of wedlock abroad in a position where they can do the same thing that a mother can in order to put them on an equal plane with women. It is not a product of trying to discriminate. It is a product of trying to put men or fathers in a position where they can do the same thing that mothers can do. And let me explain why --",
  "Well, if I may explain what, as we understand it, is going on here precisely, and that is that Congress made a judgment that it wanted, while the child is still a minor, for there to be established a legal, formal recognized relationship between parent and child. After the child is no longer a minor, at that point the child is an adult and can seek citizenship in his own right. In this very case, petitioner Nguyen could have applied for citizenship in his own right after he became an adult and did not do so. The idea is that under these naturalization -- this naturalization provision, while one is still a child, one is under the care of the parent. After adulthood, that's not so. So what Congress was focusing on was not just biological paternity, but a recognized formal relationship that outside people could look at and say, yes, that is a father-child or mother-child relationship.",
  "We believe that -- let me start by explaining what the situation is for married parents. When you have a child born to married parents, you have a legal relationship with mother and father at the moment of birth. With the mother by virtue of the birth and with the father by virtue of the marriage to the mother. That marriage legitimates the child and establishes a legal father-child relationship. Where you do not have married children, there is no lawful relationship -- or legal relationship between man and woman, that in turn creates a legal relationship between father and child. Something else needs to be done. In the case of the mother, the mother's relationship to the child, the legal relationship is established at the moment of birth in the same way as it is for a married mother. The mother's name will typically be on a birth certificate or, at the very least, the birth will be witnessed by all present. There will not be any question, just to the biological maternity --",
  "Well, it's not a differential standard. With all respect, it is an attempt by Congress to equalize two situations that start out quite unequal because, as I described, at the moment of birth the mother has a legal relationship with the child, that is true in the United States. It is true virtually throughout the world. The child is born to the mother, the mother has custody as a legal matter, and before that child can be taken away from the mother, the mother would have to give it up, relinquish rights, legal rights, or they would have to be taken away from her. In the case of the father that is not true until paternity is established in some formal or legal way, and all that Congress has done here is said that that has to be done before the age of 18, and as this Court's --",
  "Yes.",
  "Right. Prior to 1986 the only way that that legal relationship could be established with respect to the child who was born out of wedlock was by legitimization, and --",
  "Because Congress --",
  "Because Congress decided that derivative citizenship from a U.S. citizen should only apply while the child is, in fact, a child. You have the formal legal relationship which can then be a springboard for a practical relationship between parent and child, but not only that, citizenship itself is a formal relationship between the citizen and the country, and Congress could reasonably conclude that in order to recognize a formal legal relationship between a child in the United States, a central element of that, the relationship of the child to parent should have a comparable formality and recognition so that it is recognized by the father and child and by those looking at that relationship as not just a biological relationship, perhaps even a deep biological relationship, but a lawful, formal recognized one that the rest of the world and this country can look to, because citizenship, in fact, carries rights and responsibilities on behalf of both the citizen and the nation, rights of protection, rights of duties to serve in the Armed Forces, and Congress could reasonably decide that it is not sufficient that out there somewhere during a child's minority there was someone who was a biological parent. It is necessary that the formal legal relationship be regarded as in existence during the minority.",
  "Well, one of the things that Congress is aiming at is the existence of the legal relationship by 18. That's set forth explicitly in the statute.",
  "That is correct, unless and until the father's paternity is formally established.",
  "It's not entirely gone because while DNA -- it's important not to focus solely on the domestic situation in the United States in looking at this law, and that goes both with respect to assumptions about proving paternity and assumptions about what the law is or ought to be. The other nations in the world are not necessarily living under the same availability of medical care, the same --",
  "That's true, but the age 18 --",
  "Yes, although the age 18 would help to deter some fraudulent claims, but that's not our principal submission here. Our principal submission is that the recognition of the legal relationship is itself a legitimate interest, and in this respect we think this case is very similar --",
  "Well, Congress could reasonably conclude that with respect to mothers, and this is true of both mothers in wedlock and out of wedlock, that the legal relationship is established at the moment of birth. This Court pointed that out Lalli decision and pointed it out -- we quoted page 34 of our brief from this Court's decision in Lehr v. Robertson which we think is very instructive. There the Court said the mother carries and bears the child. In this sense her parental relationship is clear. The validity of the father's parental claims must be gauged by other measures. And again this is not just proof.",
  "But if Congress could conclude that in virtually every case that requirement is satisfied at the moment of birth, it would be unnecessary to require the mother to go through that, and in fact if that sort of requirement would be imposed now there could be all sorts of children of U.S. citizen mothers who would never have taken a step like that.",
  "Yes.",
  "On the remedy --",
  "There is a severability clause, but we think the proper remedy would be to sever 1409 and put the ball in Congress' court to decide how to deal with this particular problem. We think that's true for several reasons. For one thing, if this Court were to broadly declare that a whole new category of persons were United States citizens there may be some question as to whether Congress could undo that. That, coupled with the point that this Court made in Ginsberg and Pangilinan that it's questionable whether a court can ever declare someone to be a citizen when Congress has not so declared, we think way powerfully in the direction of striking section 1409 and letting Congress decide what is the proper remedy in the situation.",
  "Because in our view the admission to citizenship is so central to the formation of our society and -- our society under the Constitution that it is fundamentally different, and this Court says --",
  "Right, and in the situations you're describing, you're describing situations that arise wholly in the domestic context. Here we have --",
  "I'm not aware whether a bill was introduced. I did want to point out one further, one last thing on the question of remedy. If one thing is clear from 1940 until 1986, it is Congress did not want U.S. citizenship to pass solely by virtue of mere biological paternity. Congress insisted on something more in 1940 and 1952 and 1986, in 1952. In all of those situations, Congress moved to make things easier for U.S. citizen fathers to transmit citizenship. From 1952 to 1986, only legitimization, which often meant marrying the mother, was adequate. In 1986 Congress tried to ease things to make it easier for U.S. citizen fathers to put themselves in the same position as U.S. citizen mothers, by providing for the acknowledgment of the child in writing so that it would not be necessary to resort to the varying state laws regarding legitimization or elsewhere. The last point I would like to make with respect to -- two other points. One, this is a transaction that occurred abroad, not in the United States. It involved one alien and one U.S. citizen. This is not a situation in which the heightened scrutiny under our Constitution would ordinarily be thought to apply because of a solely domestic setting, but I should point out that --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress in the exercise of its plenary authority over immigration enacted section 1231(a)(6) in 196 -- 1996 to afford the Attorney General the authority to detain dangerous criminal aliens beyond the 90-day removal period if they cannot be removed to their countries of nationality or to some other country during that 90-day period. That enactment was the culmination of measures beginning in 1988 by which Congress sought to address what had become the serious problem of criminal aliens within the United States. It was enacted against a background of information in 1996 in particular, about both the high rate of recidivism among criminal aliens as well as the very high rate of flight among aliens who are released.",
  "Yes.",
  "It does not, no, but what I -- the important element, though, is that future dangerousness is a legitimate basis on which to detain someone. Under this Court's civil commitment cases, and this does not remotely resemble civil commitment because it's an exercise of Congress' plenary power over immigration, but one of the bases on which someone may be civilly committed is their potential dangerousness. Now, the Court --",
  "No. That's --",
  "No, it is in this important respect, and I think this is a critical factor to understanding this case. What the Court said in Hendricks, for example, is that in the civil commitment cases the Court has said it's dangerousness plus some other factor, such as mental illness. Here we have a critical other factor, in addition to dangerousness, and that is that both Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas in this case had had their right to remain in this country extinguished.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "In our submission the detention of the aliens is reasonably related to the basis for detention, as long as there is a basis for concern about threat to the community and removal.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "It is not clear now.",
  "Well --",
  "That, and in addition, because of the potential for dangerousness to the community.",
  "Well --",
  "I'd like to answer that in two respects. I do not believe there is any reasonable time limitation within the statute. On the other hand, it depends what you mean, what could be comprehended within the determination of reasonableness. I mean, for example --",
  "Well, in this case the attorney --",
  "Yes.",
  "The Attorney General has implemented this statute in a way -- maybe the Attorney General had broader authority to detain someone permanently without ever releasing someone, but the constitutional question before the court, and the statutory question for that matter, has to be analyzed in terms of what the Attorney General did in the exercise of his discretion in establishing a review procedure under which the alien is subject to periodic review to determine whether he is either dangerous or a risk of flight.",
  "I do not agree with it in this respect. We do not believe it is for the courts to determine whether, at least in the first instance and without a high degree of deference to the Attorney General as to whether there is another country to whom the alien might conceivably be returned in the future.",
  "I'm not. I\"m not.",
  "That is our position, but I would like to say something about the two aliens in this case, just to show that we're not even near that position. Contrary to Mr. Zadvydas's counsel's position that nothing has been done with respect to him recently, we point out at page 48, footnote 22 of our brief, facts have happened after the letter that he referred to that Mr. Zadvydas wrote to the Lithuanian consulate. As we point out in that brief, the INS twice last summer called Mr. Zadvydas in for an appointment, after he asked that that appointment be postponed, so it could be explained to him what information the INS had obtained from the Lithuanian consulate as to what information would be necessary to apply to Lithuania for citizenship based on the Lithuanian citizenship of his parents. On both instances, he did not show up for the appointment, so he is not cooperating with the known procedures for submission of documents that Lithuania has identified as germane to the question of whether he would be granted citizenship.",
  "It is, but the important purpose of the detention here is to protect the community as a prophylactic matter, not simply to take measures against someone after the fact. Now, having said that, under the regulations that I've described, even before the formal regulations went in place in December, up to 50 percent of the people who were reviewed under the interim procedures that were in place were released during that period of time, so these regulations do afford a periodic opportunity --",
  "I'm not -- well, all of them, or almost all of them in the sense that they were convicted of a crime. Most of the people detained in this category have a criminal history, maybe a few who do not, but the two aliens before the Court right now were convicted of a crime in which they had all of the procedures to which they were entitled in determining that, and this Court has said --",
  "They have, but as this Court pointed out in the Jones case, which was discussed in Foucha, it is permissible for a State to presume continuing dangerousness from the conviction of a crime, and the fact that someone has served a criminal sentence does not remove the inference of continuing dangerousness.",
  "Oh, I think there are several. I think the Mezei case does.",
  "But it is our submission that once an alien has been ordered removed from the country, as both of the aliens here have been -- not only have they had a criminal conviction, with all the protection that affords, but they have -- are subject to final orders of removal under an administrative process in which that had be proven by clear and convincing evidence. The procedures are unquestioned in this case. The consequence of the final order of removal --",
  "There's not, and if I may explain why, there is no difference from the point of view of the status or the interests of the alien, there is no difference with respect to the sovereign powers of the United States, and there is no difference --",
  "I'm speaking of the legal status of the alien, and the third is with respect to the interests of the United States. With respect to the status of the alien, it's important to consider the consequences of a final order of removal. It is not simply an order of removal. It also terminates the person's status as a lawful, permanent resident.",
  "If I may, this does not rest on a legal fiction. The first thing I would like to point out is, just to finish the -- because this is important to answering the question -- to finish the consequences of a final order of removal, the first thing it does, as I mentioned, is, it terminates the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence --",
  "-- which is defined as a privilege of being lawfully admitted, such status not having changed, and as we point out in our brief --",
  "Right, but then the further consequence is, under 1182(a)(9) of the act, the alien is inadmissible for 10 years, or, in the case of an aggravated felon like these, for 20 years, so that --",
  "So that person is --",
  "But what I -- the point I'm trying to make is, in terms of his legal status he is in exactly the same legal status under the laws Congress has passed to protect this Nation as someone who is at the border, someone who has no rights --",
  "No, it does not, but the important thing about -- the important thing to consider if you look at someone like Mezei, who was here for 25 years, and went abroad for I think 19 months before he came back in, the Court said that he was an arriving alien, even though he had a long time in this country, but the important point is that Mezei was about procedure, and what the Court was relying on in the so-called entry fiction there was the fact that it was the Court sustained the authority of the Attorney General to keep him excluded on the basis of classified evidence that was never shown to the alien. Even Justice Jackson in his dissent in Mezei rejected the notion that there was a substantive due process problem with detaining Mezei --",
  "And here --",
  "No -- and the other part of Mezei, that was the part of Mezei that depended on the entry fiction, but the other part of Mezei is, he had no liberty interest to be at large in the United States, and our point is that that liberty interest to be at large in the United States was extinguished by the final order of removal.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Absolutely --",
  "Not at all. I --",
  "That was exactly the point I was going to make. One could make the same point here with respect to the removal of an alien who was previously here, and whose right to remain here has been extinguished. The United States would not do this, but one way to remove the alien from the United States would be to put him on a boat, or to insist that he find a county and, unless he finds a country he will be detained here.",
  "There's not a precedent, put this -- put that way, but if I may respond, the basis for the removal order in this case were criminal convictions, in which the aliens' criminal trials --",
  "But --",
  "No, but you said where the basis for the detention is not preceded by any criminal trial. Here, there was a criminal trial.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, with all respect, the criminal conviction in this case, in both of these cases and in the great majority of cases in which people are being detained, plays a critical role in their continued detention. This was something that the Court found to be a permissible factor in both Foucha and in -- and particularly in Jones, where the Court said that there could be a presumption of continuing dangerousness subject to rebuttal by the individual, which is exactly what we have here.",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay.",
  "Several. The first is Fong Yue Ting, which says --",
  "Fong, F-o-n-g, Yue, I think it is, Y-u-e, Ting, T-i-n-g, which says that Congress' power over -- power to expel aliens, in other words to deport them, is the same and is as absolute as Congress' power to exclude aliens, and we've set out the relevant quote in our brief in the Zadvydas case, which I believe is at pages 37 and 38. So I think that is an important constitutional basis for the point I was making earlier, that once someone's right to remain here is extinguished, and he's put back in that status, it is proper to equate them to Mezei. The next line of cases that I would point to are cases, in particular, that -- civil commitment cases, where the Court has, I think, contemplated that there could be subsequent determinations following on a presumption coming out of a criminal conviction of continuing dangerousness.",
  "No, but it seems to me another important point that the Court has said with respect to aliens, and this, I can't remember the case in particular, but the Court has said on a number of occasions that Congress can commit the determination of immigration matters to the executive branch, and have determinations made --",
  "Well, I --",
  "I believe that's correct.",
  "No, but with respect to its fundamental point that the Congress --",
  "Precisely.",
  "That is exactly --",
  "That is --",
  "Right, and the point is that 1231(a)(6), enacted pursuant to Congress' plenary power, vests the release authority in the discretion of the Attorney General, and so it would be odd in that --",
  "There is habeas corpus review. We do not challenge the right of an alien who is held subject to the Attorney General's authority under the statute to seek habeas corpus challenging the constitutionality of the detention, so if there is an argument --",
  "Well, if there is constitutional review of the individualized determination, it would only be along the lines of what the Supreme -- of what this Court said in Carlson and reiterated in Flores, which would be whether the Attorney General's determination was arbitrary.",
  "That is correct.",
  "Right, and those --",
  "That is right, so -- and the important point is for these purposes --",
  "We're certainly not saying there is no access to habeas corpus, to challenge the constitutionality of the detention.",
  "I think you are correct the alien will, under our submission, lose at least, or in the exceptional case, in that circumstance, but that's because Congress has vested in the Attorney General the delicate question of deciding when an alien should be released and not. This -- in this area, like in so many areas of immigration, this is intimately tied up with foreign relations. As we point in our briefs, with respect to Mr. Ma, for example, we are engaged in negotiations with Southeast Asian countries --",
  "We believe there is not, that under 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) of title VIII it bars judicial review of anything, any determinations that are committed to the discretion of the Attorney General.",
  "Administrative process is good enough, and the first and basic point is the one that Justice Scalia said, which is that the most important ingredient of liberty interests at stake here was extinguished, the right to be at large in the United States was extinguished in the administrative deportation proceeding --",
  "-- subject to judicial review if the alien chose it, and the aliens in this case did not seek to challenge the extinguishment of their liberty interests.",
  "I take it to be that there's no liberty interest, is my --",
  "But that I think cannot --",
  "That, I think, cannot be correct, at least if one looks at Wong Wing, which prohibited the service -- imprisonment and hard labor for someone who was in the United States. It is no part of our submission that an alien who is illegally present, or who has been paroled into the United States in a case like Mezei, is not a person for purposes of protection independent of the immigration laws, but it's quite a different matter to say that the Due Process Clause was somehow intended to limit Congress' plenary power to protect the United States, and the safety of the United States. One other point that I'd like to make, because it's important to bear in mind, protecting the safety of the citizens of the United States and the community is not ancillary to, or simply incidental to an immigration consequence. It is part of the whole point of removal of the aliens in this situation, that they were, as Justice Scalia pointed out, essentially in this country conditioned upon their compliance with our laws. They broke our laws, they committed crimes, and they -- and committed crimes that demonstrate that they present a danger to the community.",
  "Well, it is very likely to factor in to another country's calculus of how willing they will be to take someone back whether that person is in custody or not, because -- the Court pointed out in Mezei that Congress could reasonably conclude that when an alien such as Mezei arrives at our borders, that person is no more our problem than the other country s. With respect to an alien and his own country of nationality, his liberty is that country's responsibility, not ours, rather than ours.",
  "That's --",
  "It goes beyond the excludable class, because if a foreign dictator realized that he could cause the release into this country at large of nationals of that country simply by refusing to take people back --",
  "But that status has been extinguished, and they have no right to remain here, and they do have a right under international law to --",
  "Maybe not dumping in the first instance, but what the refusal to take someone back -- and we -- for example, with respect to Cuba we have a number of people who have come to Cuba and are here lawfully who we want to remove from our midst, not simply those who were foisted upon us under the Mariel boat lift, and if we have a foreign dictator --",
  "Well, it's we don't want them any more, and it is your responsibility to take him back, and the pressures on that other country, not simply from the United States Government but from the alien himself, from human rights groups, from his family, are much greater for that other country to take him back when he's in detention.",
  "That's --",
  "That is correct, as we've seen --",
  "That is correct, as we're seeing --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Well, it depends on -- a lot of the aliens here are not released. I mean, they had previously to report --",
  "The Attorney General -- first of all, questions such as this we think are committed to the discretion of the Attorney General. As we point out in our brief, the Attorney General in issuing the final regulations in December pointed out that INS had commissioned a study of other methods for supervision of aliens who might safely be released to see if there's some middle ground, half-way houses and things like that, and the notice points out that the INS is going to be expanding that program to see whether there are alternatives, but --",
  "No. The aliens in this case are certainly not seeking house arrest. They are seeking being released under some degree of supervision, but they are --",
  "Yes. We certainly think it would give the Attorney General the authority to insist that the person be released into a program, a half-way house or a drug treatment program, and that also is pointed out in the preamble to the new regulations, but we don't believe --",
  "It could be, but the questions of exactly what form of custody to keep an alien in, are mixed up with the broader responsibilities of the Attorney General under laws passed by Congress to administer the immigration laws in terms of what facilities someone should be kept in while they're being detained.",
  "I'm not sure of all of them, but there are periodic reporting requirements and not leaving the jurisdiction.",
  "What the Attorney General has concluded is, for people who do not pose a threat to the community -- reporting requirements are not going to stop someone from being a threat to the community. They may guard against flight, but they are a far more inadequate protection against danger to the community.",
  "Yes, but the important -- the balance of interest is completely different with respect to a citizen and an alien who not only --",
  "Because under Salerno, for example, the Court said that an individual's interest in liberty can be outweighed by important governmental interests. There is a compelling interest in protecting the safety of the community, but where the liberty interest that is going to be --",
  "But the countervailing liberty interest is far, far less, to the extent the alien has any remaining liberty interest, because his right to be at large in the United States has been extinguished.",
  "There is not. As we say, we're not challenging --",
  "Well, as we say, we're not challenging the ability for habeas corpus review. If that was an issue, the proper disposition would be to allow --",
  "Well, if there was going to be judicial review, it would be along the lines of Carlson, which is whether the Attorney General has exercised that power arbitrarily. We think there probably might be a constitutional component to that to the extent the Court concludes that there is any residual liberty interest at all. That would be the proper way to address this, not to attack as a substantive due process matter, which is all that's here.",
  "Yes.",
  "Under Carlson --",
  "Yes. I think under Carlson there was review of those individualized custody determinations.",
  "No, that is absolutely correct, but the -- again, coming back to the central issue in this case, all that is at issue here is whether the Attorney General's detention pursuant to expressed statutory authority is reasonably related to the goals that have been advanced, and as long as the person was found by the Attorney General to be dangerous or a flight risk, the detention is reasonably related, and that detention is subject to periodic, automatic review by the Attorney General every year, and in intervening periods the alien can request a review of his status by presenting changed material circumstances. In that situation, we think that is a very reasonable response on behalf of the two political branches about how to deal with the severe problem of dangerous criminal aliens in our midst. It is an inherent part of the sovereignty of every nation to protect itself against aliens who that nation does not believe should be in its presence for purposes of national sovereignty, national security, but also the safety of the populace of that country, and that is what Congress and the Attorney General are responding to. Safety is not simply a question to be addressed by the States. When it comes to aliens in this country, it is Congress' responsibility, not that of the States, or in addition to that of the States, to protect the populace of the United States against the presence of dangerous criminal aliens in the United States, and that is what has been done here on the basis of a criminal prosecution and administrative procedures that unquestionably satisfied due process, and the only remaining -- in terms of giving Congress an interest with respect to aliens, it is the equivalent of a State's interest with respect to the mentally ill. In that situation, it is directly parallel to the interests of a State. When does a State come in and intervene with respect to the liberty interest of an individual? With respect to civil commitment, it is in the context of mental illness which gives the State a right to come in and look after the individual and protect the individual and the State. With respect to aliens, it is Congress' plenary power. That has been satisfied. That has been permanently extinguished, that liberty interest. All that remains, then, is the question of dangerousness, and, as this Court has held in the civil commitment cases, a State may place on the alien the burden of showing that he is no longer dangerous at the end of a particular period. There have been no questions here about the statutory authority of the Attorney General to detain the aliens, but we think it is clear that the Attorney General has that authority conferred by Congress.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1996, in two separate statutes, Congress fundamentally restructured the Nation's immigration laws. There are amendments of general applicability, and also ones specifically dealing with criminal aliens to ensure that criminal aliens were expeditiously removed from the United States. Briefly, the three amendments of general applicability that are most relevant to these two cases this morning are Congress's elimination of deportation and exclusion proceedings, and replacing them with a single proceeding called removal. Secondly, Congress repealed the prior 1182(c) under which petitioners here seek relief, and replaced it with a new proceeding, or form of discretionary relief called cancellation of removal, and third, Congress reenacted, or enacted a new judicial review provision which channeled judicial review, if it's to be had at all, to the courts of appeals. The two amendments specifically dealing with criminal aliens that are relevant here is that Congress not only repealed the prior 1182(c), but rendered aggravated felons and in some cases other criminal aliens altogether ineligible for cancellation of removal, and secondly, Congress provided in section 1252(a)(2)(C) of the Act that no court, which includes both the court of appeals and the district court, shall have jurisdiction to remove -- to review an order of removal entered against an alien who had committed one of the specified criminal offenses. The theory was that an alien, just like a citizen, would have full access to the courts to contest the criminal conviction in the criminal proceedings, both direct review and collateral attack, but once that was done, the validity of the conviction was established, and therefore, with respect to access to the courts, there was really no further need to test the central basis on which the alien was to be removed.",
  "Unless and until the criminal conviction was set aside, it would be a conviction on which the removal order could be based.",
  "I wouldn't think that would be true, but I think typically what would happen is the immigration judge would stay the removal proceedings. I think that happens. I'm aware of some cases where that has happened. What the alien should do is --",
  "There would be, I think, probably -- I'm not certain about that, but there may be access to the court to stay the removal. Ordinarily you couldn't go to the court of appeals on the direct --",
  "No, I meant the -- I meant the review in the immigration proceedings going to the court of appeals. I'm not certain which avenue --",
  "Right. There is -- if the claim was -- if the alien was in a position that the substantive ground for removal may be invalid, and that's -- not the eligibility for discretionary relief, but the substantive ground of removal may be invalid because there's an ongoing collateral attack, then I -- my assumption is that some court -- first of all, I think the immigration court would stop it, or the BIA could prevent the proceedings from going forward, either one, or the Attorney General, but failing that, I'm confident that some court would probably have review. I'm not sure whether -- perhaps the collateral review court, although I'm not sure why that would be so, because it could be a State collateral proceeding that the alien was trying to have his conviction, State court conviction set aside in, and I wouldn't think that court would have any authority to enjoin a removal under Federal immigration law, so it may be that the alien could apply to the district director and perhaps --",
  "-- seek a stay of removal in that way.",
  "Sure. The immigration judge would have the authority to stay the proceedings. That was the answer that I --",
  "-- thought I was giving. But the more fundamental point is, the alien wouldn't be removed until there was a final order of removal entered against him by the BIA. If at that point the alien was saying, wait a minute, I'm seeking to have my criminal conviction set aside, don't execute the order of removal, while there may be an invalidity here, the alien could seek a stay of removal in the court of appeals, could move to reopen the proceedings --",
  "The court of appeals would not be required to issue a stay of removal, but if it was the first -- I was just addressing the question of power, not whether it should be --",
  "That is --",
  "Right, no, absolutely, and I think as a general rule there would be no question. I was just addressing there might, in an extreme case, be some cases --",
  "There's a fundamental difference between the case I think you were positing and this one. That case had to do with the substantive ground for removability. In other words, is the person removable for having committed an aggravated felony? Here, the question is quite different. As counsel for petitioners has said, petitioners concede that they are removable. The only question here is whether the Attorney General properly denied --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, the last step was taken. There was a final order of removal entered against the aliens.",
  "Right. If I could just give two responses to that. The preclusion of review under 1252(a)(2)(C), which was set out at 106(a) of our certiorari petition, it refers to an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in certain sections of the Act. The word removable doesn't stand alone there. It is removable by reason of having committed an offense. It is identifying the aliens who --",
  "Well, I think this would only --",
  "Well, it's identifying the subset of aliens against whom a final order has been entered, to whom this preclusion of review applies, and it's --",
  "Well, this was a preclusion of review that was obviously intended to accomplish something, and petitioners --",
  "That is not governed by paragraph (C). That is governed by the preceding paragraph, 1252(a)(2)(B) on the same page, which independently bars any judgment regarding the granting of relief under certain specified sections, or any other decision that is vested in the discretion of the Attorney General, so that category of decisions that are -- that petitioners are conceding is not even addressed by this provision. This provision must mean something else, and we think it quite clearly encompasses denial of discretionary relief by the Attorney General, whether that denial is based on an exercise of discretion or the Attorney General's determination that Congress has not conferred on him the power to exercise discretion. In either event, the alien has been denied relief that Congress has specified is discretionary, and as that --",
  "Because they --",
  "Well, The Attorney General certainly has jurisdiction to decide whether to grant discretionary relief. The Attorney General can decide that on a variety of factors, including the Attorney General's understanding of the statute, just as a discretionary determination to exercise prosecutorial discretion not to bring an administrative proceeding that was before this Court in Food and Nutrition Workers you could decide, the agency could decide not to bring the case because they didn't think the equities warranted it, or because of an interpretation of the statute. That interpretation may be wrong, but when something -- when Congress intends to vest something in the discretion of an administrative officer, that includes legal issues that may bear on the exercise of discretion --",
  "No, what Congress has done is vest in the Attorney General of the United States the responsibility for interpreting and administering the immigration laws, and in section 1103, that this Court relied upon in the Ageri-Ageri case, this Court said that the Attorney General's interpretation of the immigration laws is controlling. Congress -- in other words, what Congress did with respect to the question at issue here was to vest the final determination whether to grant discretionary relief in the Attorney General, whether that is based on an interpretation of the statute, or the exercise of discretion, or sometimes a combination of the two.",
  "Well, in Accardi, as Justice Scalia pointed out, it's difficult to figure out exactly on what basis jurisdiction was exercised in Accardi. The Supreme Court -- this Court --",
  "Well, one thing to bear in mind is that the petitioner in Accardi argued the case in terms of a due process violation. What was alleged there was that the Attorney General had engaged in prejudgment and had deliberately subverted an administrative scheme for adjudicating discretionary applications, and the petitioner argued that that was a violation of due process. Now, this Court subsequently has said in the University of Missouri, in 435 U.S., that Accardi did not state a rule of constitutional law binding on the States, so in light of subsequent understandings of what Accardi stood for, it would seem odd that if it didn't state a fundamental rule of constitutional law that is binding on the States, that it would nonetheless be the sort of thing that Congress would be compelled to provide judicial review of under the immigration laws. I wanted to respond to two statutory questions, and then perhaps explore this point further. Petitioners have relied on the Foti and Chadha cases with respect to the final order of removal being contingent upon the exercise of discretion, in those cases suspension of deportation. That -- the Court explored that, though, solely for purposes of deciding which court would, as a statutory matter, have jurisdiction over the particular claim there, and what the Court said is, sensibly it only -- it makes sense for suspension of deportation claims to be heard in the courts of appeals because the Attorney General has chosen to adjudicate applications for suspension of deportation together with the substantive basis for deportation in one single proceeding. But the Court made pretty clear in Foti that the Attorney General was not required to do that, and it would have been equally consistent with the Act for the Attorney General to determine whether to grant relief to particular aliens outside of the affirmative removal proceeding as a matter of discretion, maybe on a sort of certiorari jurisdiction to the Attorney General to decide at the close of the case whether to do that or not, and that remains the case under the current law. Nothing in the Act requires that the Attorney General adjudicate an application for 1182(c) relief, or for cancellation of removal before entering a final order of removal. The regulations provide that method of adjudication, but nothing in the Act does, and the question, I think, for purposes of whether judicial review is compelled is whether there is a statutory right, because after all, Congress has plenary power over immigration, over the jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts, and broad power over the fashioning of the writ of habeas corpus, as this Court said in Felker, and Congress could legitimately decide if there is not a statutory right to have an application for cancellation or 1182(c) relief adjudicated in a particular --",
  "Well, but in this respect, what -- with respect to whether the person is an alien, and with respect to whether he is removable --",
  "-- by reason of having committed an offense. A reviewing court has to decide those questions in deciding whether the statutory preclusion --",
  "For the reasons that I said, that -- for the reason that I said, is that the Act does not require that. All 1182(c) said is the Attorney General may admit an alien. It doesn't say anything about what proceeding that will be held in.",
  "Well, whether or not there would be -- whether or not there would be a review of a constitutional claim we think would be a different matter. For example, in Chadha, Chadha was a constitutional challenge to the statute governing suspension of deportation. It may be that Congress would have intended that a constitutional challenge to the statute under which the Attorney General was granting or denying --",
  "Well, the -- all the Act says is that the Attorney General may admit an alien and, with that sort of discretionary grant of authority, this Court has said in cases like Jay v. Boyd, and maybe five terms ago, I think it was, in the Yang case, that that is like the power of pardon. It's a power of dispensation. It is a power of the Attorney General to relieve an alien of the admitted consequences of an order of removal, to lift the consequence of removal and allow the alien to remain here. It is a matter of grace, in no sense a matter of right.",
  "Well, not every situation in which someone, an administrator officer has been afforded a right to exercise discretion, is there judicial review of that. I mean, this Court has on a number of occasions, like Heikkila v. Cheney, and like Food and Nutrition Workers, and with respect to the census, an issue of major magnitude, this Court held that there was no review of statutory questions or discretionary issues in that situation.",
  "Yes.",
  "-- to the pardon power. I assume we wouldn't review the President's refusal to exercise the pardon power for abuse of discretion.",
  "Absolutely, and this isn't to say that the Attorney General may not -- or the President at some point may decline to exercise the pardon power for a reason that would be thought contrary to law, but that doesn't mean that the possibility of getting a pardon, or in this case a discretionary dispensation from removal, gives right to a personal right that the Constitution requires Congress to provide access to the courts to litigate. And Congress enacted IIRIRA against the background of great frustration with the inability of the system to remove criminal aliens from the United States, and because of the potential for criminal aliens to tie up the courts in trying to stave off the removal. This is an example of this in this very case, that these aliens unquestionably are removal -- removable, have conceded it, and yet we are litigating a number of years later on the question of whether the --",
  "That is true, because again, what Congress has done has granted a discretionary authority to the Attorney General to decide whether to dispense with removal or not, and let me --",
  "Well, again, going back to the language of paragraph (c), there are two different clauses. One says, review any final order, so that's the passage that deals with there having been an order entered, and then it says, against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense. That is simply identifying which aliens, which ground of removal triggers the preclusion of review --",
  "No, the question --",
  "Well, I --",
  "Well, but again, I -- removable does not stand alone. It says, removable by reason of having committed the offense. I think it does no more than identify the -- if I could mention one other thing. The word removable is defined in the Act, but for -- this is in 8 U.S.C. 1229a(e)(2), which is not reproduced in the papers, but since the question was raised, it is part of the provision that deals with removal proceedings, and it says -- now, again, it says in this section, meaning the section dealing with removal, and the next section, which deals with cancellation of removal, the statute says, the term removable means, in the case of an alien who hasn't been admitted, that the alien is inadmissable under 1182 of the Act, or, in the case of an alien admitted to the United States, such as the aliens here, that the alien is deportable under section 1227 of this title. In other words, the term is meant to identify the substantive ground on removal that --",
  "But a --",
  "But the paragraph (c) goes on to identify the specific statutory provisions that it is referring to, and they are all substantive grounds of removal. They are not --",
  "That's true. I mean, as you pointed out, read expansively it could go to any question that might be thought to call into question the propriety of the Attorney General's action.",
  "But it separately addresses that in the preceding line by saying, review of a final order, and then it's which final order, so I think it's already -- I think Congress has already spoken to that question. I --",
  "Well, I suppose there could be -- we don't think it would fail, but I mean -- we don't think it would succeed, but if there were some argument that it would be constitutionally impermissible to apply a ground of deportation to conduct that arose before the statute was passed, or that there was some sort of equal protection violation in singling out one ground of removal over another in providing a ground for removal, that could be a constitutional challenge to the statute under which the person is being ordered removed.",
  "They have not made a constitutional --",
  "We -- I think not. I think that the -- I think the only thing that could be done would be to challenge the constitutional ground of removal. Congress -- as we point out in our brief, the one thing that is clear from the legislative background of the passage of IIRIRA and AEDPA is that Congress wanted to expeditiously remove criminal aliens from the United States, and it regarded the entry of the judgment of conviction as a sufficient ground for doing so. It did not want to provide -- first, in our view, we believe Congress eliminated discretionary grounds for removal, but it surely would not have intended to have litigation over that.",
  "It is, but it wouldn't be at all surprising that in the climate in which Congress acted, what Congress wanted to do was to vest the final determination on questions such as that in the Attorney General. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the Attorney General could have just decided, taking into account the recent legislative enactment, simply, even if the Act applied, to say, I'm not granting relief to anyone whom Congress has identified as an unworthy to remain here, and there's no question that that would be a permissible exercise of discretion, which shows that it can't be a fundamental right --",
  "Well, this Court held in the Lopez case --",
  "Well, this is a statute -- again, looking at the statute, in which Congress has given the power to the Attorney General, but unlike, for example, the asylum provision, the asylum provision says in section 208, the Attorney General shall establish a procedure for aliens to file applications for asylum, meaning that the Attorney General has to at least be in a position to receive an application and do something with it. There is no such provision in this Act that requires the Attorney General to receive and consider a particular application for relief from deportation, just as there is nothing to require the President to actually entertain and pass upon an application for a pardon, and this Court said in Jay v. Boyd that this relief is to be regarded much as the application for a pardon to the President of the United States. One final point I want to make clear is that, whatever else may be true with respect to judicial review, the court of appeals was certainly wrong to say that judicial review would be in the district court. It would stand this Act on its head to suggest that criminal aliens whom Congress wanted to remove from the country with particular emphasis would be able to go to the district courts, get a level of review there, go to the court of appeals, and then perhaps to this Court.",
  "Well, there's no requirement that Congress, in order to channel all review to a court of appeals, has to specifically mention 2241, but --",
  "Congress did two things before IIRIRA was enacted in section 401(e), in a provision called, Elimination of Habeas Corpus, Congress repealed the prior provision for habeas corpus relief and secondly, in the provision enacted here, it channeled all review to the courts of appeals.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. In this case, there are questions both of jurisdiction and of the merits of whether the Attorney General reasonably construed the act to conclude that petitioner in this case, oh, excuse me, respondent in this case is ineligible for discretionary relief under the repeal of 1182(c). I do want to make sure that I'm able to address the merits question, but I did have a few things that I wanted to address with respect to habeas corpus and the constitutional question here. One recent decision of this Court which I think is instructive on the question of when, what sorts of claims Congress must make a judicial forum available to, is the Court's decision two terms ago in American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee v. Reno in which the Court concluded that a constitutional claim of selective enforcement was not a judicially cognizable defense to a final order of removal, and in our view, if Congress could provide under the immigration laws that that sort of claim does not give right to a personal right to have a final order of removal set aside, then it follows a fortiori that Congress is not required to provide a judicial forum for a failure by the Attorney General to grant discretionary relief from removal that is purely statutory in form and particularly here where the objection is a non-constitutional objection to the failure to grant discretionary relief.",
  "If it is an application for discretionary --.",
  "If the claim is that I am not subject to deportation or removal because the statute doesn't apply, that is subject to judicial review under this statute and we think that the suspension of habeas corpus clause probably does require that a court be available to entertain a claim that the person who is subject to removal is not an alien and is not subject to removal because in those cases, we will assume, this certainly for purposes of this case, the executive would be acting beyond any authority granted to the Attorney General.",
  "Oh yes, no, yes, no, I'm sorry. I was going to the constitutional claims that the statutory judicial review procedures are inadequate because they don't cover more things. No, you certainly - -",
  "Right. That's absolutely right. We think that the statute provides for judicial review of the two fundamental points at issue in a removal proceeding. Is the person an alien and is the person subject to removal? The statute provides for that. The Zipper clause that this Court referred to in the AADC v. Reno provides that all questions of law and fact, including statutory interpretation and constitutional interpretation can be heard only on judicial review of a final order of removal in the Court of Appeals.",
  "Do you mean, in the current law or the prior law?",
  "The current law. No, it's a substitute for, an expedited, a substitute for a court of appeals review. People in that category, their orders of removal are reviewed only in the district courts, not in the courts of appeal.",
  "In the prior law, it was frankly unclear to what extent habeas overlapped with court of appeals review, and this was I think part of the problem. Some courts have held that in habeas the alien could not get review of the merits of the deportation order but could just challenge the detention. Some courts have allowed some review of the deportation order, which, of course, would have provided for duplicative review in the courts of appeals and the district courts.",
  "No, I think the reason under the new law was one of expedition , to not have two stops in the court but only one petition for review in the courts of appeals.",
  "It wasn't? I'm sorry.",
  "Well, as we explain in our brief, the provision in the INA was necessary to preserve that habeas corpus because the prior act was worded, the judicial review is in the courts of appeals under the Hobbs Act except, and as this Court said in Stone there were a series of exceptions that follow that, one of which was the specific exception for district court habeas. Now, whether one views that exception as itself a grant of habeas or a preservation of habeas under 2241, we think is essentially irrelevant. In either event, the expressed exception to seek, to preserve that was necessary and to our knowledge no court held --",
  "1105(a)(10).",
  "Some courts said it was 2241. Some said it was 1105(a). Some courts didn't explain it and there was really no reason to. In our view, probably the best way to look at it is that 1105(a) preserved general habeas jurisdiction but you could look at 1105(a) as a specific grant, but in either event, it was an expressexception to what otherwise would have been an exclusive court of appeals jurisdiction which the legislative history we set out in our brief of the 61 Act shows that Congress was aware that habeas corpus would have been precluded if the statute had been permitted toward - to be worded that way. I also want to just briefly just touch on the notion that there is an unconstitutional suspension of habeas corpus if the Act operates in the way that we describe. And we think that that is clearly not correct. As this Court said in Felker, first of all, habeas corpus is available only insofar as it's provided by law. The courts are not free at large to address that question and the Court also reiterated in Felker that Congress, that it's essentially up to Congress, at least in the first instance, to exercise the judgment as to what the scope of the writ should be. Beyond that, in this context we think that's especially so because Congress has plenary power over immigration and has to be able to balance the need for access to the courts against, in this situation, what Congress saw to be a critical need for expeditious removal of criminal aliens who have already had a chance to test their criminal convictions. And finally, this Court has also said that Congress, deference is owed to Congress with respect to what due process procedures are appropriate for people generally, and again, that's something where deference we think is especially appropriate in the immigration context. For all of these reasons, we think Congress's judgment as to what sorts of things should be subject to review and what should not is due extraordinary deference by this, by this Court. And, in particular, we do not believe that Congress is required to provide for judicial review of a power that it has granted in the discretion of the Attorney General. This is not worded as a personal right of the alien, much less a personal right that is so fundamental that an alien should have access to courts, must have access to courts, to litigate it. Congress should not be put to the choice or put in the all or nothing position of granting discretionary powers to the Attorney General only at the cost of buying into a system of judicial review. As this Court said in AADC v. Reno, there are a number of discretionary determinations the Attorney General makes all the time with respect to whether to institute proceedings in the first place, whether to drop them along the way, whether to perhaps not execute the order of removal at the end of the day. Those are all discretionary and surely Congress is not required to provide for judicial review of that. Congress could conclude that this should be regarded in the same way.",
  "Well, the Attorney General has the authority not to execute an order of removal if there was - -",
  "Well, there's certainly a general rule that final orders of removal will be carried out because that's what Congress had in mind, but Congress--",
  "I, I can't represent that every, that every case has been brought but one of the things to bear in mind is that when Congress passed IIRIRA and expanded the definition of aggravated felony, it made that definition applicable to offenses that occurred before 1996 and in INS's view, that meant that Congress wanted INS to do something about people who had previously committed offenses and may not have been aggravated felons before. So, the general thrust of the INS's enforcement efforts has been that but I certainly can't represent that it would never decline to remove someone. And the fact that in Accardi again an unexplained decision, this power may well once have been exercised should not prevent Congress from revisiting the question, revisiting the question of how discretionary relief should be thought of in saying for these purposes, it is constitutionally equivalent to the sort of discretion to institute proceedings in the first place that was unreviewable in AADC v. Reno even for constitutional grounds and has been held unreviewable in other situations as well. Now, to the merits of the question.",
  "Well, it's, the fact that it's not judicially reviewable doesn't make it lawless. There are, there are either formal standards as --",
  "I don't, I don't, I don't believe there are and this Court pointed out in AADC v. Reno that there were internal guidelines for the exercise of that discretion in the past and the INS --",
  "I am not aware of, but Congress could reasonably conclude that the statutory provisions for cancellation of removal sets up a similar, or allows the Attorney General to set up a similar regime but doesn't in the process require judicial review of that in the courts. If I could turn to the merits question of whether the Attorney General reasonably determined that the repeal of 1182(c) does not provide a basis for relief in this case. First of all, Congress specifically addressed the temporal applicability of all of Title III- A of IIRIRA of which this repeal is a part in Section 309 of the act. In 309(a) Congress specified what it called a Title III-A effective date, which was six months after IIRIRA was enacted, the delay obviously being put in place to allow the Attorney General to set up the new procedures. And then Congress, in 309(c) specified what is the operative event for applying that effective date.",
  "What it said was that for people in exclusion or deportation proceedings, note not removal proceedings, an exclusion or a deportation proceedings as of the Title III effective date, the amendments made by Title III shall not apply but instead, the prior law, the INA as in effect prior to Title III-A shall apply. It follows for people like the petitioner here, excuse me, the respondent here, who was put in removal proceedings after the Title III-A effective date that Congress intended that the Title III-A provisions would be applied and Congress enacted them as a package. As I mentioned, it eliminated deportation and exclusion and replaced it with removal. It repealed specifically 1182(c) and replaced it with cancellation of removal and it provided a new system of judicial review.",
  "Well, with respect to the notice point, Congress specifically made the definition of aggravated felony applicable to offenses that occurred before that enactment and that includes situations in which someone might be rendered removable.",
  "Well, several things. First of all, we don't think it's technical. We think the statutory specification of an effective date and what events that effective date attaches to couldn't be clearer from looking at Section 309 of the Act. Congress identified the commencement of proceedings as the operative event and that makes sense because what cancellation of removal as it's now called is something that is a forgiveness of a ground of removal. It's something that only arises after the removal proceedings have been brought. So, we think the statutory answer is clear. With respect to fairness, it depends. Congress is looking at fairness from a broader perspective. It was looking at fairness from the perspective of a large number of criminal aliens in this country who had not obeyed our laws and it wanted to do something about it and Congress also, and importantly, concluded, made the judgment that the Executive Branch was granting far too many applications for discretionary relief under 1182(c). What Congress did here spoke to the Attorney General. It did not speak to any supposed rights of individual aliens. It was responding to what it regarded as excessive, and even referred to as abuse of the power that was granted by the Attorney General and they wanted to take that away, and they wanted to take that away now. The only effective way they could do that was to stop now. It wouldn't have made any sense to grandfather in people who may have committed crimes 10 or 20 years ago if what they wanted to do was to stop the Executive Branch from granting too many applications. At the close of our reply brief, we had citations to a colloquy between Senator Abraham and Senator Hatch and if you read that colloquy, it responds directly to your point, Justice Breyer. We don't set it out at length. But, importantly, in IIRIRA Congress actually drew back a little bit on the disqualification for discretionary relief. Under AEDPA the disqualification under 1182(c) for criminal aliens was broader. In IIRIRA for a permanent resident alien, Congress confined it to aggravated felony.",
  "But what Senator Hatch said as in explaining one of the reasons for having done this was that in the category that Congress allowed to get relief under cancellation of removal, which was a category that was barred under AEDPA, those might have included people who committed their crimes a long time ago and those were the minor crimes that Congress identified as saying those people should be eligible not for 1182 --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "He was referring to any crime that might have been a long time ago. Well, that's the important thing. But even then, what Congress, what he explained is that Congress made them eligible for cancellation of removal. He didn't say that Congress had somehow carried forward 1182(c) relief, which, as we point out, was expressly repealed in Section 304(b) of IIRIRA, and it was repealed because it had been replaced with the provision for the cancellation of removal which Congress intended to be applied as part of a package dealing with the institution of removal proceedings and then the cancellation of removal proceedings. Congress did not intend a hybrid sort of thing where discretionary relief from inadmissibility could somehow be applied in the proceeding where that didn't even make sense. But beyond the statutory answer to the question that we think Congress supplied in Section 309, this change in the law is not retroactive within the meaning of this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence and there are a variety of ways in which that could be understood but they all point in the same direction. And I would like to identify them because they're different ways of coming at them. First of all, this Court has said in Lopez-Mendoza and most recently again in the AADC case that the enforcement of the immigration laws is inherently prospective. It looks to the question of whether aliens will be permitted to remain in the United States in the future, whereas the Court said in AADC, deportation is necessary in order to bring to an end an ongoing violation of the law. And the reason why this is so is that part of the justification for Congress's plenary power over immigration is as this Court said in the Harisiades case, that Congress has to take into account the contemporaneous policies with respect to aliens. It has to decide at any particular moment in time who that is an alien in this country should be permitted to remain and who should not. Removal is not punishment or regulation of past conduct. It is a determination of who should be permitted to stay in the United States in the future. Another point that can be made about 1182(c) and Congress's repeal of it is that it operates much like the repeal of the authority to grant injunctive relief. When the Attorney General grants, under the prior law, granted 1182(c) relief, it was essentially an injunction against carrying out an order of deportation. Well, this Court has made clear than when Congress most recently in Miller v. French that when Congress changes the authority for granting prospective relief, that that change in the authority for granting prospective relief has to be applied by the Courts at the time that it is applied, that it arises. Another point is that this statute speaks to the power of the Attorney General not to any rights of the alien. This provision has never been worded as a right of the alien. It is again an act of grace or like a pardon as this Court has said. And this Court has made clear in its retroactivity jurisprudence and in Kansas v. Hendricks, for example, even in considering the ex post facto clause, that a statute is not retroactive simply because it arises in a case that is based on antecedent conduct. You have to look to see whether it is punishment or a penalty for the past conduct or whether what's going on is simply regulating someone's current ability and in Kansas v. Hendricks it was a current ability to be at large. The statute, though, was triggered on the basis of prior conviction.",
  "I don't think so. I don't believe it would. It does not attach new legal consequences in the sense relevant to retroactivity analysis.",
  "Well, for example, if there is an enhanced penalty provision for a second offense based on having committed a prior offense, that's not considered to be retroactive under ex post facto.",
  "It is, well, it's not a legal consequence of a guilty plea. This statute does not regulate past criminal conduct and it much less regulates guilty pleas. It provides deciding whether somebody will currently remain in the country on the basis of their past conduct. A guilty plea is not primary conduct of the sort that sometimes gives rise to retroactivity analysis in other settings.",
  "It has not added the consequence to a guilty plea. It may have undermined the alien's expectation but this Court made clear in Landgraf that a law that affects someone's pre-existing expectations does not itself give rise to retroactivity analysis. There's not the slightest suggestion in this act that Congress intended the application of the various provisions to turn on whether someone pleaded guilty to the offense or did not. If I could reserve the balance - -",
  "Every court of appeals that has looked at that question has concluded that this statute does not raise retroactivity concerns on that basis because it goes to the prospective --",
  "Not in the sense used in this Court's retroactivity analysis because again this is a situation that looks to current status --",
  "I rely on the discussion in Landgraf and --",
  "In direct. This is not regulating criminal conduct. This is regulating status in the United States.",
  "It has undermined expectations but we do not believe it is attaching new legal consequences in the relevant sense.",
  "Not in that sense. In AADC v. Reno, again, the Court said that immigration law is prospective and retroactivity analysis we think just doesn't apply for that reason.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Order 888 fully respects and, indeed, complements State regulatory jurisdiction over the transmission -- excuse me -- over the sale of electric energy. Some States have chosen to maintain the traditional monopoly system for the delivery of power to retail customers. In that situation, there is no separate transmission service, and the customer pays a single rate that includes all of the utility's costs, basically calculated by that utility and regulated by the State, for the generation, the transmission, and the distribution of power to the local customer. Order 888 does not affect those traditional monopoly arrangements. Other States, however -- now about half the States -- have decided to take a different path, which is to separate out the transmission service and -- and introduce competition in the purchase of electric power at retail. In that system, the retail customer has the right to purchase the power not simply from the utility that previously had the monopoly control, but from a broad variety of utilities. In that situation, that power might have to be generated, purchased and transmitted from out of State or in State by another utility. In that situation, it is necessary for there to be access to the transmission facilities to move the power from the generation place to the place of -- of retail delivery. In that situation, there is now a new transmission service that did not exist in 1935 when the Federal Power Act was passed.",
  "The sale -- the sale of the transmission, yes.",
  "But what it does not -- what it does not include is the retail sale.",
  "Well --",
  "But -- but that is what it says I believe because electric energy is the commodity. And the transmission -- it's the transmission of the commodity, to use your words, or the wholesale interstate commerce of the commodity. In both cases, the electric energy is the commodity. And what FERC can regulate is two different things. As Justice O'Connor pointed out, these are two separate and independent grants of jurisdiction to FERC. One is wholesale sales of -- of the commodity, and the other is the transmission of the commodity. Now, it's true in this case, this case turns primarily on rights of access, physical access, to the transmission capacity. But a necessary part of regulating access is also regulating the rates because different qualities of -- of access, rights of access -- you could have firm or non-firm power. Those different rights of access necessarily would -- would cost more or less. A utility would charge more for -- for a firm power than -- than non-firm power. And that -- so, in that situation, the rates being charged for the access are essentially inseparable from setting the rules of the road. So, it seems to us not -- not feasible as a practical matter and not textually the natural reading of the act to say that somehow FERC does not have authority to regulate the costs -- or excuse me -- the price on which interstate transmission will be sold. And I think it was Justice Ginsburg also pointed out that the clause of the statute that saves power to the -- authority to the State says that the provisions of this subchapter affirmatively grant the power to FERC --",
  "I'm sorry. This is (b)(1) on page 2 of New York's brief.",
  "(B)(1), yes. It says, but except as provided in paragraph (2), shall not apply to any other sale of electric energy. It does not say, does not apply to the transmission or the sale of transmission or matters having to do with transmission. And it's also important in --",
  "Well, yes, but -- but for example, in setting a wholesale cost -- or excuse me -- a wholesale rate, FERC could take into account the costs of transmission --",
  "-- in setting a wholesale rate, just as the State could.",
  "Either one. It has authority over the transmission. But that's -- what I just said is parallel to the way it would work for the State. The State, in setting a retail rate -- as Mr. Cohen explained, the State in setting a retail rate, would have to take into account all of the costs that are components of that retail rate. That could be the cost of the electric energy, the commodity, and it would also include, importantly, the cost of the transmission service.",
  "Yes, absolutely. And I didn't mean to say anything else. All I'm -- all I'm saying is that as part of -- one component of the wholesale rates includes the cost of transmitting the electric energy at wholesale. So, if it is setting a -- a wholesale rate, it has to include that as part of it.",
  "No. If I could -- if I could answer that. First of all, quite aside from whether it -- it -- FERC would have the power under the wholesale sales clause, it would unquestionably, we think, have the power under the transmission clause, which I said is a -- is a --",
  "But -- well, it's -- it's an independent grant of authority. And -- and for FERC's authority in this area to be complete, especially in these days of interconnected grids, it's -- it's necessary that -- that FERC have the ability to regulate all aspects of access to the grid, which as I said, is not just technical problems of scheduling but also what the costs of different -- different quality of access to the grid will be. But the other point I wanted to make -- and this -- this ties in, I think, to a -- a misconception of Attleboro and Pennsylvania Gas, which is the background against which Congress acted, that I -- that I would like to address here. States, in setting retail rates, have the authority -- and I was saying this before -- have the authority to take into account all of the costs that the utilities serving retail customers may incur. And in the monopoly situation, the -- the State will regulate the -- will take into account the generation costs, the transmission costs, and the -- and the retail delivery costs and come up with a rate. And in -- in the Pennsylvania Gas case, this Court held that a State, consistent with the Interstate Commerce Clause, could regulate the retail rates of natural gas that were -- that were paid by retail customers at the end line of the distribution system for the cost of natural gas. And the Court rejected the argument that because that gas had moved interstate, that the State had no power to regulate the delivery to the retail customer. But in so holding, the Court didn't say that the States could regulate interstate commerce. What they said was that the States could regulate the local distribution, even though it had an incidental effect on interstate commerce. So, the rates that were left to the States, under Attleboro and under Pennsylvania Gas, were the ability to actually regulate the rates that the local utility is going to charge to the local customer, but it -- the Court did not say that the States had affirmative authority to directly regulate the interstate transmission itself.",
  "Absolutely. We think that FERC's --",
  "Well, there are two different things, and I think it was maybe you who put the question. There's -- or maybe Justice Breyer. What Enron is seeking here is to have an existing regulation on open access, all comers, anytime, anywhere to -- for retail -- excuse me -- to have a -- a pricing provision under an open access regime applied to the -- the transmission component even in the monopoly State. That -- that is -- that would be a significant change in the way that retail rates for bundled sales have been handled.",
  "Right. And -- and as --",
  "We don't just concede, we affirmatively assert that we do have authority. And -- and, for example, in the Northern States --",
  "Not in that respect, no, because I think that all -- with respect to this order --",
  "Well, let me -- let me just modify that in one respect. What Enron was seeking here was essentially to have FERC regulate the transmission component of a retail sale while it remained bundled. FERC did not disclaim the authority in an appropriate case to order the unbundling of -- of that service --",
  "And the court of -- and what the -- the court of appeals analysis in this case essentially looked at the -- at the transaction --",
  "Yes. And in the -- in the Northern States Power case, that is discussed in the -- in the briefs, it -- it addresses the question of curtailment. Under the open access tariffs, a -- a utility is required to curtail all service in a nondiscriminatory manner. And in -- in FERC's view that meant that a -- a utility having control over transmission capacity had -- would have had to curtail all service -- all transmission for retail on a nondiscriminatory basis. And that --",
  "I believe FERC does.",
  "I believe FERC does. I mean, that's essentially what FERC ultimately did in the natural gas area.",
  "But -- but let me be clear. That would be a -- that would be a -- a major change in the way that utility regulation has happened. And what -- what FERC has done is leave to the States the decision as to whether to maintain the traditional --",
  "To order -- to order unbundling.",
  "That -- that may well have been an implicit understanding of FERC, but if you look at the order, it actually never says that. And the court of appeals opinion, in affirming the -- the FERC order, simply says that it -- that FERC's characterization of a bundled transaction is within the -- the realm of its discretion. What the court of appeals said is you could look at the bundled transaction as being primarily a -- a retail sale, and that has traditionally been subject to State regulation. Or you could look at it as including that -- the transmission component, and that would be subject to FERC regulation. But FERC made a -- FERC made a permissible --",
  "The commission in this --",
  "I cannot speak for FERC on that question because FERC did not address that in this order. All FERC said was it was not going to order the unbundling, and -- and all it was doing was -- was regulating the transmission component where there is unbundling.",
  "Well, there are really two points about FERC's power here -- authority here that I would -- would like to separate. One is the -- the power -- the authority of the sort Justice Kennedy was asking, where -- where a utility is -- is reserving its load for bundled retail in a way that frustrates the ability of someone like Enron to pass through its power to another State. That would -- that would be, in effect, imposing an obstacle, like cutting the line, that is frustrating the ability of FERC to regulate the -- the aspects of transmission that New York, I think, concedes that FERC has. I think in that situation -- and that's like the Louisiana Power & Gas case. I think in that situation, FERC unquestionably has the authority to prevent any --",
  "It did properly defer because the predicate is that there is a single transaction. The -- the transmission service has not been separated out of the one bundled transaction.",
  "Yes. That -- and that -- that is I think all that FERC said. I would like to modify the first point, which is I am not -- I'm not affirmatively asserting at this point that FERC has the jurisdiction to order unbundling. I don't see anything in the act that prevents it, and under the --",
  "Assuming that FERC has this authority. As I stated, it didn't disclaim it, but FERC in this order did not -- did not stress that.",
  "I'm -- I see nothing in the act, in the parallel provisions of the Natural Gas Act --",
  "But the rest of the question is: when it is sold together with electric energy in a single bundled transaction. And that is -- and that is the transaction. That is the transaction that --",
  "Yes.",
  "In that circumstance.",
  "Yes.",
  "Even -- even under Order 888 -- what Order 888 does is decline to extend the plenary rate -- the plenary jurisdiction of Order 888 itself over the transmission component of bundled sales.",
  "Right.",
  "As long as they -- as long as they are -- as long as the State hasn't unbundled it, the utility has not unbundled it, and FERC has not exercised whatever authority it would have to unbundle it --",
  "Even though they are in the grid.",
  "But -- but let me -- let me make clear. This does not mean -- this does not mean, with respect to Justice Breyer's question, that even -- even though FERC did not impose that requirement across the board by imposing the -- the separate rate component requirement on bundled retail transmission, if a utility exercises its authority in a way that disadvantages, that discriminates the matters that are within FERC's jurisdiction, FERC can -- can act to eliminate that discrimination, which is what FERC -- the position FERC took in the NSP --",
  "Right. The -- the statute leaves the retail rates. But again --",
  "Yes. No, you're correct. But -- but again, what -- what --",
  "In the -- in the clause in 201(b) that you were referring to, shall not apply to any other sale of electric energy. That is leaving to the States the authority to set the rates for the retail sale of electric energy, which is essentially what was left to them under the Pennsylvania Gas case as -- as a matter of the Interstate Commerce Clause.",
  "I think what is no power is where the transaction remains bundled, FERC may characterize that in the same way that it has always been treated, as -- as a single retail rate, and that FERC cannot require, as long as the transaction remains bundled, that be -- that a separate cost component for retail transmission be stated.",
  "Yes, but -- but I don't have to say -- it depends by what you mean by must because --",
  "-- the court of appeals did not say that was the only way to read the statute. The court of appeals said the agency could have --",
  "This is a Chevron point. Where you -- where you have a -- where you have a bundled transaction, what the court of appeals said is that FERC could have looked at the bundled transaction as being primarily a retail sale over which the States are -- are -- their jurisdiction is preserved under the clause I just mentioned. Or FERC has plenary jurisdiction over the transmission and it would be possible to look at that and say that the -- that the transmission component of the bundled sale does come under FERC's jurisdiction. What the court of appeals said is that it was -- and this is on page 35a of the -- of the petition appendix, Enron's petition appendix -- FERC's decision to characterize bundled transmissions as part of retail sales, subject to State jurisdiction, therefore, represents a statutorily permissible policy choice. In other words, it's the characterization of the bundled sale.",
  "As a Chevron matter, FERC has -- has concluded -- has construed the statute not to authorize it to -- under Chevron, the -- the agency could go either way.",
  "But -- but FERC has now construed the statute, in a statutorily permissible way, that does not give it jurisdiction over the transmission component of bundled retail sales.",
  "Right, as long as the transaction remains bundled. But what we -- what we fundamentally have in 25 States is that 25 States have provided for the unbundling and created a separate transmission service, transmission of power in interstate commerce, which the States could not have regulated in 1935. They couldn't have regulated a separate transmission service. All they were allowed to do was regulate the local retail rate, which --",
  "No. I think -- I think FERC would have great authority in deciding how to identify discrimination and how to deal with it. I wanted to mention one last point with respect to New York's claim -- desire to protect its -- its retail customers, and particularly those in dire needs. Nothing -- this tariff -- and I'd point the Court to pages 772 to 775 of the joint appendix. Utilities are allowed to set curtailment priorities under their tariffs, and therefore, they could protect retail customers, they could protect hospitals, that sort of thing. It's just that when you have curtailment, the utility has to curtail in a nondiscriminatory way. It can't favor its own transmission at retail to hospitals and discriminate against another supplier of electric power to hospitals. In other words, it has -- it can have -- it can have priorities based on the -- the need for the power, but it can't discriminate against suppliers of the power. And that is the whole point --",
  "Well, there may well be limitations on that because, among other things, the act preserves to the States the authority over local distribution systems and over retail rates. The sense of that, I think, is to preserve the general State police power over the way power is being delivered to the ultimate customer. That's what this act was really leaving to the States. But in any -- any event, FERC did not seek to upset the priorities for power --",
  "I think if it finds discrimination, it has to order appropriate relief. It wouldn't necessarily be relief under Order -- Order 888. There may well be other -- other measures that could be taken.",
  "The -- if they -- if a utility -- such utility is connected to the grid, it cannot transmit --",
  "I'm informed by FERC that there are virtually none anymore, and that -- that while the act does preserve intrastate transmission to the -- to the States, there's virtually none that isn't connected to the grid. And if it is connected to the grid, as the commission said in the Florida Power case, because of the electromagnetic connection of all generators and all users to the grid, it is -- anything put onto the grid is necessarily in interstate commerce. So, Congress -- the limitations Congress placed on FERC's power come elsewhere in preserving the power over the ultimate retail rates and the local distribution to the -- to the local utilities, and -- and the State regulation. But the transmission, the control over that critical interstate grid, is left to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Now, there's also in Texas, the Texas -- a portion of Texas is not connected to the interstate grid, and that would -- that would remain --",
  "I would say it is not regulating transmission, and I -- and I think that that is what the Court said in -- in Pennsylvania -- in Pennsylvania Gas. It's regulating the retail sale that may have an incidental effect on interstate transmission, but it is not directly regulating the transmission itself. And we think the Commerce Clause then and the Federal Power Act now wouldn't allow it.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act does not prohibit the common classroom practice of one student grading another student's paper, or other common classroom and teaching practices. FERPA regulates the records maintained by an institution, not the homework and classwork of students. Congress did not intend for FERPA to intrude into the day-to-day activities of hundreds of thousands of classrooms across the Nation, or the way in which teachers conduct the educational process in those classrooms, or the way in which students interact with each other.",
  "It addresses the grade book, in our view, by including it -- we think ordinarily it would come within the sole possession exception in the act. Now, I think it's important to recognize that even a grade book -- there may be no one uniform practice about the way a grade book is handled. It could be that a particular school would regard the grade book as an official school record from the outset, where the principal always has access to it, and the teacher is really maintaining a record on behalf of the institution in keeping the grade book. You could have other school systems in which the grade book is essentially used by and for the future as a memory jog, and all that she ever discloses to the front office is the semester grade. In that event, we think that the grade book would fall within the sole possession exception, so that this is one of the things about FERPA, is that it addresses the situation in which actual record- keeping practices may vary, or let me change that, actual pedagogical practices may vary widely from school district to school district, and that's why we think importantly this act did not enter the classroom by addressing the way teachers handle papers, give feedback to students, have students grade each other's --",
  "I think under the position we've espoused here, that would not be a violation of the act. FPCO has taken the position in the past that it would be. I think it would depend, though, or may depend on the way in which the grades were assembled. I think if the teacher or professor, let's say, in college, the only grades probably ever, ever assembled or marked down for a college course may be the final exam grade. The professor may have a grade sheet, a roster in which the professor marks down the grade for everyone in that class and sends it to the registrar, and from that list puts a list of final grades for the course. I think at that point, the fact that the grades would be derived from something that would be regarded as an institutional record, in that instance I think the posting of the grades may well be a violation.",
  "If it's posted -- and this may sound technical, but this is where the two categories we think intersect. If a grade is divulged from the paper, he takes the grade book and puts A or B or C on the paper, we don't think that the student work itself is an institutional record, and it's not --",
  "That's exactly true, and there are analogous situations in which that's true, for instance the attorney-client privilege, that the attorney can't disclose something that he's learned from the client, but that doesn't mean that the same information in the possession of the client is privileged.",
  "Yes.",
  "No. Quite aside from the issue in this case, this statute contains an exception for what's called directory information, which includes common information about a student, the fact of their attendance, et cetera, and that includes honors awarded to a student. That information can be released. The school district or higher education institution has to announce a policy.",
  "All that is strictly presented in this case is the practice of one student grading another's paper before the teacher has gotten the papers themselves or entered them in the grade book.",
  "There's no educational record maintained by the school.",
  "Well, whether it's maintained is part of the definition of educational record. An educational record is a record or document containing information directly related to the student that is maintained by the school and, in our view, maintained in that situation means maintained as an institutional record, and we think that the act generally draws a distinction between the institutional records and the classroom records of the teacher, and I --",
  "We do not have a position on that. That was not presented in the petition and therefore we did not address it in our brief, and under this Court's Air Couriers decision, the existence of a cause of action is not jurisdictional and may be assumed. We -- I would point out, though, that the ability of the Department of Education to cut off funds is not the sort of factor that has in other situations been thought to be sufficient to preclude a 1983 cause of action. In Blessing v. Freestone and other cases, this Court has said that that is a different sort of remedy and does not preclude a private right of action.",
  "Well --",
  "Two different questions. One is whether it covers the student's work, and we think that that --",
  "That that's not covered. By teacher's records, if you mean the grade book, yes, we think that that would fall under the -- or, what we commonly call grade book, some way in which the teacher keeps track of the student's progress during the marking period or --",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's probably true, but it's -- one thing to bear in mind here is, this act was passed in one form early in 1974. Some difficulties were identified, and it was amended and revised and elaborated upon later in 1974, and there is a description by Senators Pell and Buckley describing the original version of the act, in which they indicated that personal records were not the sort of thing that was intended to be included, because the act then used the definition of official records that were intended to be for school use, and they said that these informal notes, and I think teacher notes would be include din that, were not intended to be included in the act to begin with. So I think that there is a way in which that gives emphasis to something that may well have been excluded anyway, but they do fall within the coverage of the act, because the act was revised to meet some concerns that had been raised by local school districts. I did want to point out two things in response to Justice Kennedy's question. This act does not require a school district to retain any records. It may destroy records at any time. It only addresses rights of parents while the records are actually retained. The other point is, we don't think that there is anything talismanic about the duration --",
  "If a request is made for them they have to be retained until the request is resolved, a request to inspect them, but if the parent or student, adult student has not requested it, nothing in this act requires the school district to keep them. We don't think that duration is dispositive. We think because the act was designed -- we point this out at pages 20 and 21 of our brief, and page 23 of our brief -- was intended to reach records that the school was going to be -- use to make decisions about the student in an institutional way, institutional decisions about the student, which we think are different from what goes on in the classroom in the day-to-day learning experience, and so we think that that could include records, or some materials that are kept by a principal that wouldn't necessarily go into the permanent record, but would be part of the school's overall supervision of the student for that school year, so we do not think that the duration of the period is dispositive. Having said that, what gave rise to this act was concerns about the sorts of things that were in the permanent institutional records of the student, the sorts of things that would follow the student, or that law enforcement officers or probation officers or others would have free access to when parents did not, and there was concern that there might be irrelevant information, or inaccurate or anecdotal information in records that would make a real difference in the child's life, and that's what this act is directed towards.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The claim is made here that the section 4-10 of the Illinois HMO act conflicts with section 502(a). In considering that claim, it's important to focus on the language of exactly what 502(a) addresses, and it is set out on page 2 of the petition. 502(a) is empowered --",
  "Of the petition, yes. It's entitled, \"Persons Empowered to Bring a Civil Action,\" and then it itemizes -- it then continues, a civil action may be brought by various persons, and then it goes on to describe the judicial relief that may be granted, awarded in a suit under section 502(a). In other words, the preemptive scope of section 502(a) has to do with causes of action, civil suits in court, and the judicial relief that may be awarded in court, and that is precisely the formulation that the Court used in Pilot Life itself. At the conclusion of the Court's opinion in Pilot Life, the Court said in distinguishing Metropolitan Life, the Court said the Court in Metropolitan Life had no occasion to consider the question presented in this case, whether Congress might clearly express through 502(a) an intention that Federal, the Federal remedy provided by that provision displaced State causes of action, and that's what the question was about in UNUM. Here, section 4 -- excuse me, in Pilot Life. Here, section 4-10 of the Illinois HMO statute does not provide a State cause of action in court, and it does not provide any remedy or relief beyond what's available under the plan itself.",
  "I don't think that's the way it --",
  "I don't think that's the ordinary understanding of what a cause of action is. A cause of action is ordinarily regarded as something that you would enforce directly in court.",
  "Well, I -- my point is, that's what section 502(a) addresses, and the analysis in Pilot Life was, what does 502(a) displace, and it's -- another important feature of Pilot Life is, the Court went through the various remedies that section 502(a) provides, and tellingly discussed this Court's decision in Russell in which the Court held that punitive damages were not available in a suit against a fiduciary based on claims processing, and the Court said it was not going to allow a State cause of action to displace Congress' judgment about damage remedies to allow and not to allow, or have --",
  "Yes, and if it also did not provide for relief beyond that was available in the plan itself.",
  "I think that would not be preempted. In fact, most States -- in this case, Illinois has not tightly regulated the form in which the independent review will occur, and that's consistent with the fact that these are highly judgmental medical judgments that medical professionals are looking at.",
  "I think the analysis there would be one of exhaustion of remedies under the plan, including those required --",
  "Yes, it could be excused, and the Department of Labor's regulations, and they --",
  "There would be a preemption, but the Department of Labor has addressed that under its claims processing regulations. Section 503 provides for a fair administrative processing of claims, and a separate --",
  "Right. It does not stand as an obstacle. Another point that the Court stressed in Pilot Life was that the Congress struck a balance between the prompt and fair processing of claims and suits in court. Well, but arbitration and independent review, measures adopted by State insurance laws of this sort, are precisely designed to facilitate the prompt and fair and expeditious processing of claims without having to go to court, so it --",
  "Nothing in section 502 -- and this Court made this clear in Firestone -- specifies the standard of review. The Court therefore looked to background principles of law there, in trust law. The Court here might look to background principles of arbitration law, and also to the terms of the plan. State law, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, might well be able to say that that sort of provision for deference to the plan administrator's interpretation of the plan should not be given. That would be a classic regulation of State insurance law. I want to mention one other point about the characterization of Pilot Life, and that is this Court's decision in UNUM. The Court there said, whatever the merits of UNUM's view of section 502(a)'s preemptive force, the issue is not implicated here. The Court then went on to say why, because Ward sued under 502(a)(1)(B) itself to recover benefits it was not a displacement of the Federal remedy, it was an invocation of the Federal remedy to recover benefits, and the Court said in that cause of action, the notice prejudice rule of California insurance law supplied the rule of decision. So, too, here, in the cause of action under section 502(a)(1)(B) the State Illinois HMO law supplies the rule of decision, a procedure for an independent reviewer to give a quick, prompt review of the claim, and that independent reviewer's decision is -- then supplies the rule of decision that the HMO must comply with, and that is then subject to review in Federal court. The claimant's right to go to court is not frustrated. He can seek review of the arbitrator's decision, or, as we point out in our brief, he can bypass this procedure altogether and can go directly to court, and so 502(a)(1)(B) confers rights on claimants, not on plans. Nothing in the HMO act stands as an obstacle to the claimant's ability to go directly to court. Another important point about UNUM is, the Court made clear that the processing of claims under an insurance policy, it is an integral part of that insurance policy, but at the same time States may regulate the process by which claims are adjudicated, and that is precisely what the State has done in this case. It has provided a familiar mechanism. 40 States now have provided for this external sort of review, and it is common in insurance and medical practice to provide by second opinions by physicians, so what has been provided here is a very familiar sort of approach. One other point about section 502, it's patterned after section 301 of the LMRA, an arbitration preceding judicial review is a very familiar aspect of judicial review under section 301. Section 301 itself does not provide for any particular standard of review. You can have de novo breach of contract suits, as in the Bowen v. Postal Service case we mentioned in our brief, or highly deferential standards of review where the particular issue has been committed to an arbitrable process. 502 has the same flexibility. It can have a direct de novo cause of action, as the Court contemplated in Firestone, or, where the parties' underlying agreement or contract provides for a separate resolution process, there is deference to that process under section 502.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It has long been a fundamental requirement of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that a new drug may not be marketed unless it has first been found by the Food and Drug Administration to be safe and effective for its intended use. Congress concluded that the protection of the public health requires that safety and effectiveness be rigorously established by scientifically valid studies rather than the impressions of individual doctors, and also that persons who promote and distribute new drugs should be the ones to undertake the studies necessary to establish their safety effectiveness. In 1997, Congress carved out a narrow exception to the new drug approval and certain other requirements of the Food and Drug Act for certain compounding by pharmacists. The exemption is addressed to what is often referred to as extemporaneous compounding. That is, compounding undertaken in response to a physician's prescription based on the idiosyncratic needs of a particular patient. Such compounding is typically based on an existing relationship among the pharmacist, physician, and patient. Congress provided in section 353(a), which it enacted in 1997, that the exemptions from the new drug approval and other requirements of the act would be limited, and available only in circumstances that conformed to extemporaneous compounding by pharmacists.",
  "Well, I -- it's based on the relationship.",
  "Typically an existing relationship in the sense that the need for compounding often arises where there may be a commercially available product that maybe the physician has prescribed, but it might -- or would have otherwise prescribed, but it might contain an ingredient to which the patient is allergic, or it may come in a dosage that would be inappropriate for a child or an older person, and therefore the physician and the pharmacist would consult and say, the pharmacist would be asked, could you modify this in some way, or develop the same drug without the ingredient, so --",
  "Yes.",
  "No, it is -- and the record in the case, the materials submitted in the district court, confirm exactly what you say. This is far different from that sort of situation. They're engaging in conduct that is essentially indistinguishable from that of any manufacturer or producer of drug products that is governed by the manufacturing --",
  "And that's exactly what Congress has done. If I --",
  "Well, if I could explain, the ban on advertising is one of the conditions that confine the exemption to traditional extemporaneous compounding. The others are, for example, that it has to be on the basis of an unsolicited prescription, that the drug can't be prepared in advance of the prescription except in --",
  "That condition is essential to protecting the integrity of the new drug approval process, for this reason. The general rule under this act is that the introduction of any new drug in interstate commerce must conform with the prior approval requirements of the Food and Drug Act. This is a narrow exception from that, but what Congress had to do was draw the line between what is extemporaneous compounding and what is not.",
  "Well, I -- first of all, we think that the court of appeals really misunderstood what the governmental interest here -- the -- is here. The governmental interest, again, is maintaining the integrity of the Government approval process and making sure that those who hold themselves out as marketers and distributors of new drugs comply with those requirements in the same way that any other manufacturer must do. The mixing together of ingredients --",
  "But that's not really the basic point behind this. Again, no one, whether he holds a pharmacist's license, a physician's license, or not, may manufacture and market drugs in this economy without going through the prior approval requirement, and --",
  "I think that's a very important point. There is nothing distinctive about a pharmacist putting together ingredients to produce a new drug as compared with a traditional manufacturer.",
  "But what distinguishes it is that Congress carved out a narrow exception, is the existence of this relationship between the pharmacist, among the pharmacist, the physician, and the patient.",
  "Well --",
  "It -- what it equates with is the marketing of products in the economy, and this is not the only situation under the Food and Drug Act where the advertising that someone does is what triggers regulation. This Court last term in the Buckman decision addressed a very analogous situation, and if I could explain why it's analogous, I think it would be instructive here. There, the Court pointed out that the FDA is faced with competing considerations. On the one hand there is a rigorous premarket approval process for, in that case, devices, which is very analogous to the rigorous new drug approval process for drugs, but the Court at the same time recognized that it is permissible for physicians to prescribe for off-label uses, physicians, but if a manufacturer of the drug advertises the product for a use that is not on the label, that is prohibited. What someone cannot do is market in the economy a drug for an intended use that is not on the label, because in that situation, as here, Congress was trying to draw the line between marketing of drugs and protection of profession --",
  "Yes, but --",
  "Well, what it is, it's an equation of advertising with what triggers the, in that case the prior approval process and in this case the prior approval process. When someone holds himself out as producing and distributing drugs, then it is fair to make that person, like every other manufacturer that distributes drugs in the national economy comply.",
  "The FDA had taken the position for quite a while before the 1997 amendments of at least two decades that pharmacy compounding, at least if it included such an indicia of manufacturing as advertising, or large volumes, a number of things that take it out of traditional pharmacy compounding, extemporaneous, and put it into the basically predetermined or planned marketing of a product, that's the line Congress is trying to draw.",
  "It would be producing a new drug within the meaning of the new drug provisions of the act, it would have been prior to 1997. The position that FDA -- FDA formalized its enforcement policy in 1992 to say that compounding that occurs in the normal course, the ordinary course of the practice of pharmacy, extemporaneous compounding that you've described to dilute a commercially available product, or to extract an ingredient from it, that would be all right, but when the pharmacist stepped out of that role and behaved in ways that a regular producer of drugs subject to the act behaves, then the person is subject to the prior approval, good manufacturing practices requirements of the act, because again, in terms of function, putting together different ingredients to produce a product, whether it's a manufacturer, or whether it is someone with a pharmacy license doing it, that doesn't matter, and the important public health considerations --",
  "Several things in response to that. First of all, the new drug provisions of the act are directed at single incidents of introducing a new drug into interstate commerce, or a single incident of receiving this branded drug in interstate commerce, so the act applies irrespective of the volume. Now, obviously the magnitude of the public health problem expands as more and more people are affected, but advertising, along with the other conditions Congress put in the act, were a pretty good indication of trying to draw a distinction between traditional pharmacy and what the FDA",
  "No, it's based on the undertaking by the person who is producing, who is trying to put the drug out on the market. It's really a difference between offering services and offering drugs.",
  "Well, it would certainly lead to those consequences. My point is, though, that the line Congress drew is not at a particular volume. It looked at the traditional operation of the act, which prohibits individual instances of introducing drugs --",
  "No, I -- well, with all respect, what the pharmacist can do is advertise his services, his professional services, and what the act does -- this exemption in the act does is, respect that professional service and the relationship that grows out of that professional service.",
  "Yes.",
  "But what that does is conform to the line Congress was trying to draw. It allows the advertising of the services, but it does not allow the advertising and therefore the attempt to develop a market for a particular product, or drug. Again, the Federal act is concerned with promoting drugs, not services, so when you hold yourself out as someone who says, I will sell drugs -- and if you look at the record in this case, the plaintiffs have advertising that lists a whole variety of drugs available for infertility, for cancer, for things like that. They are behaving just like any manufacturer, any -- just like exactly the sorts of persons that the new drug approval and the good manufacturing practice provisions of the act were designed to reach. I want to go back to Justice Kennedy, because I would like to extrapolate a little bit on your answer to him. I thought, is this the -- what the Congress is after is, it's simply a matter of volume, and you said no, so I said, well, what is it? Now, in my own mind what I thought is, it's the direction where the demand comes from. There might be children, and there are, who find it very difficult to swallow pills and who are undergoing chemotherapy, and therefore there must be a way of adjusting that pill. Now, with some medicines, maybe there's one child out of a million. With others, maybe there's one out of 10. Both cases you want the demands for the special drug to flow from the doctor, through the patient, to the pharmacist, and what you don't want is it to flow from the pharmacist to the patient to the doctor back to the pharmacist.",
  "That's exactly right.",
  "That's exactly right, and that's exactly what the FDA was referring to and others have referred to as extemporaneous compounding. It arises out of the relationship, so Congress -- in carving out this exemption, Congress was doing a number of things. It was looking at the --",
  "The -- it doesn't prohibit the availability of the advertising services, which can include, we can prepare a product to remove something to which a patient may be allergic. We can compound a product --",
  "Well, but it -- what it can do, though, is advertise in general terms that it can remove, or it can produce a product that is like a commercial one, but while removing ingredients to which the person may be allergic, or dilute a dosage. That is enough to get the critical information --",
  "Yes, and I think the most critical thing that tells us that is the new drug approval provisions of the Food and Drug Act itself, which Congress enacted in 1938 and strengthened in 1962 precisely to reach the conduct of people developing new drugs and advertising and promoting drugs that have not been shown to be safe and effective to individuals or to the public at large. It is the act of --",
  "Well --",
  "But the new drug approval provisions of the Food and Drug Act rest on the premise that the judgment of the individual physician is not sufficient. That is the very purpose of requiring prior approval and requiring the person who wants to --",
  "That's one variation, but again, if you look at the record in this case, there are products that have been compounded that don't resemble that at all. What they are, are people holding themselves out as pharmacists who really see themselves as developing new cures, not just tinkering with an existing product, but putting --",
  "That's correct.",
  "Yes. Well, not -- it would revert to the situation before, in which this would be absolutely prohibited.",
  "And FDA would have the discretion, and again it's not just mass marketing, it is the situation, as Justice Breyer described, of where the demand comes from, and -- but more fundamentally, the act rests on the notion that it is fair to require people who hold themselves out and who attempt to develop and exploit a market to go through the new drug approval requirements.",
  "Well, you make an important point, because Congress looked at this problem in 1997 and, as the committee reports we quote show, it consulted broadly about this and arrived at a consensus about exactly where this dividing line should be between extemporaneous traditional compounding and the traditional kind of promotion of new drugs that the act was directed to.",
  "This case --",
  "Well --",
  "The Central Hudson doctrine that this Court has developed for evaluating restrictions on commercial speech, its virtue is that it allows the recognition of these very real problems that regulatory agencies face. Again, it's exactly the sort of balance the Court was addressing in Buckman last term between respecting the integrity and creating incentives for producers to go through the new drug approval process on the one hand, but respecting professional services, existing relationships on the other, and under the Central Hudson analysis, as we explain in our brief, we think this statute easily passes muster, maintaining the integrity of the new drug approval process, and maintaining incentives for manufacturers to go through it is clearly, in our view, a substantial governmental interest.",
  "No, I -- again, the new drug approval process of the act rests on the premises that doctors themselves cannot make independent judgments about the safety and effectiveness of products, and that is -- that was a very firm understanding of Congress when it passed the new drug approval process.",
  "But the paradigm that the act was directed to is where there is an approved new drug product, or an approved product on the market, and what the pharmacist is being asked to do is tinker with it a little bit by diluting it, by something on that order, to make it -- to adjust it but not be in the business of developing new cures, or advertising new cures for existing diseases.",
  "The volume restriction is on the aggregate number of compounded drugs.",
  "But a drug that --",
  "A drug-by-drug volume restriction would be extraordinarily difficult to administer, with thousands and thousands of pharmacies across the country, and having to keep track of particular patient's names --",
  "Again, Congress, we think, was entitled to look at the conduct of the pharmacist and take the pharmacist at his word. If he stops being a pharmacist --",
  "Well, under --",
  "Because the restrictions on volume is directed at the overall character of the pharmacist. The restriction on the solicitation and advertising of a particular product is exactly what the Food and Drug Act is directed at, which is the promotion of a new drug, not just a volume, but a new drug, and Congress was specifically concerned about that as well. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, what Congress was trying to do here was to make sure that the narrow exemption that it intended did not swallow the critical general rule that new drugs have to be submitted to prior approval. The question of volume limitations has been raised. The act contains an aggregate volume limitation but, as I mentioned, individual drug-by-drug volume limitations would be very difficult to administer, and Congress was not required to go down that path, but an additional point about that is that if you look -- if you add up a couple of prescriptions by each pharmacy, Nation- wide you will be talking about a pretty large volume of a new drug, which is precisely the sort of thing that should be submitted to the FDA for prior approval. The act does not just prohibit manufacturing new drugs, it prohibits the introduction in interstate commerce of new drugs. It isn't just focused on large volumes, it's focused on individual instances. So are the misbranding and adulteration provisions of the act. The line Congress drew here that includes solicitation and advertising among the conditions was not invented in 1997. In case law it goes all the way back to 1978 in the Cedars case we mentioned in the brief, where the Court there was trying to define the scope of the express exemption for pharmacy in registration and inspections, and among the factors it says when someone steps out of the traditional pharmacy role was, do they engage in promotion of the product. The definition also appears in the Model Rules of Good Pharmacy Practice of the State of the National Association of State Boards of Pharmacy, which says that pharmacists should not solicit or advertise compounded drugs. All of this represents a general understanding that compounding by pharmacists has to be contemporaneous and responsive --",
  "That's what he is supposed --",
  "The pharmacist holds himself out as having pharmacy services and expertise, and that's where the promotion of the consultation and the professional relationship --",
  "No. The pharmacist can advertise that he engages in the pharmacy services.",
  "He has to ask. Under respondent's theory, a pharmacist, someone holding a pharmacist license presumably could promote Laetrile, or could promote Prozac and advertise it to the market at large, and Congress certainly did not expect that sort of thing.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In each year's annual Appropriations Act, Congress has prohibited the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms from investigating or acting upon applications for discretionary relief from firearms disabilities under 18 U.S.C. 925(c.) The court of appeals held that, in the face of that statutory bar, a Federal district court could itself grant respondent relief from firearms disabilities. That holding is contrary to fundamental principles of judicial review of agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act. Under the APA --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. An appropriations law is, for purposes of Congress's lawmaking authority, no different from any other sort of law.",
  "Yes. Now, what the Court has said is that if a subsequent appropriations statute is said to repeal or suspend the application of a prior law, that intention has to be made clear, but here we think that there's no question that the annual Appropriations Act is clear. There's nothing implied about what Congress did here. There is an express prohibition against ATF either investigating or acting upon applications for relief.",
  "Yes. I mean, effectively. It's a suspension -- it's an annual -- a suspension for a period of 1 year.",
  "Yes, absolutely. Congress could certainly do that.",
  "Yes. So what we have here is an express prohibition against ATF exercising the power that Congress conferred on it. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, the only power a court has in judicial review of agency action is to review what the agency did, and it may only set aside the agency action if the agency action is arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law.",
  "Well, I think there would be a question about that. As I recall, there was, and I think it still may be true that courts may grant applications for naturalization, but the court I believe concluded that there was at least an implicit adversarial process in the sense that the Government could appear on the other side of the case and oppose it, but I think you raise a very good point in terms of what would be the traditional way that something like this would be accomplished, and that is that it would be natural, and this is what Congress did in 925(c), to confer this authority on the executive branch, and it did it in very broad and general terms and then provided that a person whose application is denied may file a petition in district court for judicial review of such denial. In other words, under 925(c) it is the denial by the ATF, not the application itself, that is the subject of judicial review.",
  "We think it is not. As we explained in our brief, we believe the word denial in that context means a denial on the merits, and this is what a number of the courts of appeals that have looked at the question have held, and what Congress said in the Appropriations Act is that ATF is barred from even acting upon the application. In other words, it can't either grant or deny the application for relief, and therefore the predicate for judicial review under 925(c) is missing. We're not saying that there is no judicial review at all. The general provisions of the APA remain available and, under 5 U.S.C. 703, the avenue for judicial review, or the form of the judicial review is either the special statutory review procedure, in this case 925(c), or in the absence of that or its inadequacy, then another appropriate form, in other words, the general provisions of the APA. But once again, the power of a court under the general provisions of the APA is simply to review the agency's action and to set it aside if contrary to law, and here the action was not contrary to law, it was compelled by law. The most direct avenue that respondent could have challenged the agency's approach in this case, its failure to act, was under section 706(1), which provides for a court in reviewing agency action to set aside agency action that is -- or excuse me, to compel agency action that is unreasonably delayed or unlawfully withheld; and, again, there was nothing unlawful about ATF's withholding of a decision on respondent's application for relief, because Congress compelled that withholding.",
  "Yes. Yes, we have. It is the position of the United States that foreign convictions are covered by the act. Now, that is not before the Court. The -- in fact, below respondent conceded that a foreign conviction is a proper predicate under 922(g)(1), and the Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to reach that question. It wasn't presented in the petition and it's not before this Court. Indeed, the question of whether a foreign conviction would be a proper predicate is something that would be raised under 922(g) in a prosecution. As we point out in our brief, there is a circuit conflict on that question, but that conflict has arisen in cases, criminal prosecutions brought under 922(g), and that would be the proper place to begin to make that claim. Neither the general provisions of the APA nor 925(c) provides someone who is wondering whether he may or may not be covered by a provision of the Federal criminal laws to bring a declaratory judgment against the United States to determine whether conduct he hopes to engage in would be covered by a particular criminal statute. So even though it -- it isn't before this Court, but we also believe that this would not be the proper avenue in which to raise such a claim in any event. Respondent has argued that what is going on here is an implied repeal of the judicial review provisions or the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to act in a case such as this and, as I've said, there's nothing implied. What Congress did was expressly bar ATF, and it otherwise left the court's authority unaffected. 925(c) remains in effect. It's just that, by virtue of Congress's prohibiting ATF from acting on applications for relief, there is no denial which could be the predicate for review under that, under that special statutory review procedure.",
  "I think that's the better reading of the statute.",
  "Again, the -- our position is not that Congress amended the judicial review provision of 925(c). What it did was prohibit ATF from acting. 925(c)'s judicial review procedure is still in effect. The question is whether the -- whether Congress's directive to ATF not to even act upon applications for relief constitutes a denial and, as I say, ATF is barred from either granting or denying relief, and I would refer the Court also to the general definition of agency action under the APA, which we cite in our brief. This is 5 U.S.C. 551(13). It defines agency action as an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent, or the denial thereof, or a failure to act. So under the APA, which is the general statute governing traditional review of agency action, Congress itself has defined a denial of relief as something different from a failure to act, and I think there's every reason to look at 925(c)'s reference to a denial as being consistent, rather than inconsistent with the general definitions that Congress has applied under the APA. I would also add, though, that it doesn't matter, that even if the ATF's decision were viewed as a denial within the meaning of 925(c), the general APA standards for reviewing that denial still apply. As we point out in our brief, this Court's decision in Zurko and the prior decision in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers both make clear that, even where you do have a special statutory review procedure that establishes the form for judicial review, the nature and character, as the Court said in Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, of that judicial review is defined by the general provisions of the APA, section 706; and again, under those provisions the court can only set aside agency action that is contrary to law; and again, here, the ATF's action was compelled by law, not contrary to it. So whichever avenue this suit was thought to have been brought under, there was no basis for the district court to grant relief at all, and we also think that that is entirely consistent with the Congress's purposes in enacting the appropriations bar. The legislative history which respondent has produced as an appendix to his brief explains that Congress had become concerned about the inherently subjective nature of the inquiry that ATF was undertaking, and the severe consequences that could result if ATF had made a mistake, and also that Congress believed that the money that was being spent for that purpose, $4 million a year for 40 positions at ATF, would be better served --",
  "Well, what it decided to do is to proceed on an annual basis. It would -- which means it could be subject to revision each year. It was a practical compromise. The Third Circuit explained in Pontarelli that the same people who were supporting a permanent repeal in 1992 were also the movants for the annual appropriations rider on the theory that it accomplished essentially the same thing on an annual basis.",
  "It's in the provision for ATF.",
  "I think not, for there is another sentence in the appropriations provision for ATF which says that no money may be spent to transfer functions from ATF to another department or agency, and I think the reference to agency in that provision would probably include other provisions -- or excuse me, other agencies within the Department of the Treasury, and the Secretary of the Treasury personally couldn't be expected to act on applications like this. The Secretary, as this Court pointed out in the Dunne decision, has --",
  "It says, no funds shall be spent -- I believe it says, under this act, to transfer functions to another agency within ATF.",
  "Well, the clear import of what Congress directed is, the function shall not be transferred. That was clearly what Congress was driving at.",
  "Right, but the Secretary -- first of all, as Congress well knew when it passed this appropriations rider, the Secretary has delegated the authority for acting on these applications to ATF. That is the legal framework against which --",
  "Perhaps he -- I mean, he presumably could, but the proper avenue for a respondent to pursue in that situation would be to request ATF -- or excuse me, the Secretary to revoke the regulation that produced the delegation, and then if the Secretary declined to do that, to seek review of that under the APA on an arbitrary and capricious standard. Respondent has not pursued that avenue, and we think it would manifestly not be arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to withdraw that delegation and take on that function himself with all the other functions that are before the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to the Nation's economy and banking and all those other matters, and in particular it would not be arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to decline to do that in the face of the appropriations bar that Congress has enacted, with the -- again, with the clear understanding that it didn't want these applications to be acted on administratively, but in any event --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Yes, that --",
  "Excuse me. That's correct, but it would -- but even the admission or acceptance of additional evidence would be in aid of the APA review, which is, again, of the agency's decision. A court receiving evidence is not unheard of under the APA, even under the arbitrary and capricious standard. As this Court pointed out in Overton Park, occasionally there will be situations in which additional evidence or an explanation from the agency could be received in judicial review, but that's only supplemental of the record that was before the agency.",
  "The question before the Court would be whether it was arbitrary and capricious or unlawful, and again, it wasn't unlawful because Congress compelled it. Congress compelled the Secretary or ATF not to act on the application. Now, whether or not that's called a denial, the bottom line, the failure to afford any relief, was compelled by Congress, so the agency could not set -- or, excuse me, the court could not set that aside. Looked at another way, the only relevant evidence that would be introduced in court would be evidence of the fact that respondent had applied during a time when the statutory bar on ATF's action was pending. That is the only relevant evidence that --",
  "It would. It would violate this statute. The order, whatever they might have read on their own time the order would be taken in their official capacity, and the -- and --",
  "It would still be a -- the second --",
  "It says expend funds, but it means to act -- but it says, to -- it is directed to the actions of the ATF in its official capacity. Only an official act of ATF could relieve someone from firearms disabilities.",
  "That's correct, and --",
  "They are paid for the office, not for the work that they are performing, nor could the Secretary direct ATF to grant it, because again he would be directing an unlawful act. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the argument that the Secretary could have granted relief was never raised below in this case. It was not raised in the court of appeals, it wasn't raised in the brief in opp, it was raised for the first time in respondent's brief, and again if -- we think the proper avenue for that would be a suit to the -- suing the Secretary under the APA or --",
  "Well, I -- first of all, I think it is wrong. It would be a different disposition of the judgment, but with respect --",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "There's -- first of all, let me make another point which I think goes very much to the Secretary's authority. We point out on page 4 and 5 of our reply brief general principles of appropriations law that are really a particular application of the general principle that the specific governs the general, and under appropriations law, when Congress appropriates a pot of money for a particular task, that's all that can be spent for that task. Money can't be drawn from some other pot to perform that task. We think that principle should apply a fortiori, or at least it's a reasonable interpretation for the Secretary to make, that when Congress has prohibited the expenditure of any funds by the agency to whom the Secretary has delegated that authority, that Congress did not expect money to be drawn from some other pot. That is a general principle of appropriations law. At the very least, the Secretary should be given the opportunity --",
  "There are a number of Comptroller General opinions that we cite at the bottom of page 4 of our reply brief, and it's against principles like that that agencies always act in deciding how they're going to spend money. But if this argument was going to be made, the right disposition would be to present it to the Secretary, so the Secretary can construe this statute, just like all the other statutes that need to be administered, and the way to do that --",
  "Well, at the very least it would not be arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to decline to withdraw the delegation. That, we think, is the question that would arise in that situation, because the Secretary now may not act on these applications. He -- the ATF acts under the general direction of the Secretary, but if the Secretary directed ATF to grant one of these applications, he would be directing an illegal act. He would have to withdraw the delegation. He hasn't been asked by respondent to do that, which would require a petition for rulemaking. The Secretary, in deciding whether to take this power back to himself, could at the very least take into account what Congress has said about not wanting these applications to be acted upon by ATF, and also the reasons the Congress gave, which is that this is a very subjective undertaking, with high risk, and Congress decided, we don't want this function being performed because of the potential consequences. We want this money to be used for other purposes in fighting crime. All of that would make it entirely reasonable for the Secretary not to take on this function himself. The other important point to notice is that --",
  "I was just going to",
  "He does not -- nothing in the statute says that the Secretary must act on applications. It says the Secretary may grant relief. It does not require him to grant relief, and the Secretary could very easily withhold action, which is, after all, what Congress required ATF to do.",
  "Yes, very much so. It's -- it's, or, as the Court said four or five terms ago in the Yang case that we cite in our brief with respect to relief from deportation, it is exactly like the pardon power, and it's written in very broad terms. It establishes several preconditions, whether the person would be dangerous to the public safety, and whether granting it would not be contrary to the public interest, and even then the Secretary is not required to grant relief. This is a very broad discretionary power, and I think it ties into what Justice Ginsburg was asking earlier, wouldn't this be an extraordinary power to give to the Federal district courts. Indeed it would, because the question is not just whether the person might be dangerous, but whether granting relief would be contrary to the public interest. That's not the sort of determination a court can make in the first instance. It's something that Congress has assigned to the Secretary. In this case, even if respondent is correct that he wouldn't be dangerous, it doesn't follow that restoration of firearms abilities would be consistent with the public interest. That's a judgment that Congress invested in the Secretary, not in the courts, and as Justice Kennedy pointed out, ATF could not investigate an application for relief in connection with a judicial proceeding any more than it could in an administrative proceeding. The ATF agent who testified in this case was one of respondent's witnesses. He was not called by the Government.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Well, that would be -- we did not object, the Government did not object in the district court to his testifying. He was just testifying as to what he had looked up in the records, but an investigation involves far more than that. In fact, the AUSA in this case cross-examined Mr. Bean and a couple of other witnesses, but that's far short of the investigation that Congress expected ATF to undertake when it was performing these functions, and that it did undertake, which involved an investigation of the crime, neighbors, not just the people whom respondent has put forward, but ATF would go out and develop its own independent leads. None of that capability exists when the Government is responding to an application filed in court. So for these reasons we think it is --",
  "Yes.",
  "I do believe it's -- it is broad enough. I think the Secretary -- all it says is, the Secretary may grant relief. I think the Secretary could decide, and in fact the regulations, 144(d) has some categorical exclusions that the Secretary had adopted but the district court in this case ignored. Even -- we think the court couldn't act at all, but it even ignored the standards that the Secretary had adopted in the public interest to implement what would be a public interest standard under the statute. The district court ignored them, so we think that the Secretary could make a categorical determination not to grant relief.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: In 1987, the Secretary of the Interior, at the request of the Navajo Nation and Peabody Coal Company, approved a package of lease amendments to two outstanding leases between the parties. With respect to the lease principally at issue here, Lease number 8580, the amendments increased the royalty to be paid by Peabody from 37-and-a-half cents per ton to 12-and-a-half percent of the value of the coal, a more than six-fold increase in the amount of the royalty. That new royalty level was the same as the standard royalty on Federal coal leases, and it was well in excess of the then regulatory minimum that the Secretary had prescribed for what a tribe and a coal company could agree to, which was then only 10 cents per ton. The package of lease amendments also contained numerous other provisions that were of benefit to the tribe, including amendments to the other lease, that more -- that approximately doubled the amount of the royalty and a substantial increase in payments for water use at the mines. The Secretary's approval of the lease package in 1987 fully complied with the Mineral Leasing Act and the regulations that the Secretary has prescribed to govern her approval of lease agreements under that act. Because there was no violation of any act of Congress or regulation of an executive department, much less one that could fairly be interpreted as mandating the payment of damages by the Government, there is no cause of action in this case under the Tucker Act. The Court --",
  "It was unfortunate, Justice O'Connor.",
  "I think there -- it -- first of all, I --",
  "Not -- not on that basis.",
  "There's a -- there's a suit by the tribe against Peabody, but -- but the -- as a remedy against the United States, the only suit would be conceivably an APA action. I -- I should point out that there was no regulation or statute that barred that communication at the time.",
  "No. No, it was not.",
  "Right. I'm -- I'm not --",
  "Right.",
  "There was not and there was --",
  "There was not and there was not in the Secretary's regulations at the time. I did not mean to imply --",
  "No.",
  "No. There's --",
  "No. No, there's -- there's not. And -- and I didn't mean to imply that an APA suit would be successful. All I meant to say is that that would be the avenue in which to test that because an argument that that was a -- that that was a violation would be essentially --",
  "Of -- of some -- some standard of procedure of fairness -- procedural fairness I suppose that a court would impose. Again, we don't think that a court could do that. I -- I simply wanted to say that if --",
  "But that is -- that is not something, first of all, that -- that appears in a statute or regulation, and under Vermont Yankee, which I think came after those D.C. Circuit decisions, it wouldn't be proper for a court to impose that on a -- onto an agency. In any event, there was no restriction here.",
  "That's -- that's correct. And we --",
  "We don't think there's any legal standard, but even if there were, that sort of thing is not something that would mandate the payment of -- of damages for a violation.",
  "To -- or to set aside the -- the Secretary's subsequent approval of the lease or -- or something of that nature.",
  "The lease --",
  "We -- we are. The -- the tribe and the -- and the Peabody are still operating under that same lease. It was amended in 1987. This was 3 years after the -- the communication that -- that you're referring to.",
  "There has not. And -- and as I -- as I pointed out, there are numerous aspects of the lease package that was approved in -- in 1987 that are advantageous to the -- to the tribe.",
  "It -- well, the -- this Court in 1985 in the Kerr-McGee case upheld the right of the Navajo tribe to impose taxes, but that's without the Secretary's approval. And these lease agreement -- the lease amendments in 1987 were negotiated and arrived at in -- in the context of that decision. Now, the -- the tribe has waived its right to collect taxes with respect to coal that goes to the -- a generating station in -- in Arizona. The rest of the coal, though, is subject to the -- to the tax. There's an overall cap on that.",
  "No --",
  "It did not -- it did not breach a legal fiduciary obligation. There is a -- there is a sense in which everything that the Secretary of the Interior does or, for that matter, everything the United States Government does with respect to Indians is -- is of a fiduciary nature in a moral sense. In a political sense --",
  "Well, but -- but it's important to look at the context in which this communication occurred. The -- what -- what the -- what the Secretary was being asked to do or -- or what -- what the Interior Department was being asked to do was to make an adjustment under an existing -- a term of the existing lease that said that the royalty amount that was then prescribed, which was 37-and-a-half percent, was subject to a reasonable adjustment by the Secretary after the 20-year anniversary of the lease.",
  "I don't think that's clear at all because the -- Peabody Coal Company -- aside from this communication, Peabody Coal Company sent the letter to the Secretary of the Interior in early July of 1985 in -- in which the representative of Peabody said, it appears that the tribe believes that there's an imminent decision in its favor on appeal from the local BIA area directors setting the 20 percent rate.",
  "Well, yes. That was -- that was true. But that's a subordinate official in the Interior Department. The Secretary of the Interior -- as a matter of constitutional law, and as a matter of the regulations in effect at the time, the Secretary of the Interior had the authority to take control of any matter that was then pending in the Department. But my important -- the important point is that in that letter, Peabody Coal Company requested the Secretary to assume jurisdiction over the matter, and to either rule in its favor or, failing that, to -- to send the parties -- request the parties to negotiate further, which is exactly what happened.",
  "That letter -- that letter was -- a copy of that letter was sent to the Navajo Nation. And it -- it subsequently is clear that -- deposition testimony of Mr. Nelson, which is in the joint appendix in this case, makes it clear that he understood. He was -- he was a special assistant to the chairman of the Navajo Nation at the time. It makes it clear that -- that the Navajo Nation had understood that the Secretary preferred for them to go back to negotiate, which was a -- a perfectly reasonable response by the Secretary of the Interior in that situation. The -- the increase of the royalty rate from -- from approximately 1 percent or a little over 1 percent to 20 percent was unilateral by the area director. It -- there was not a -- input by -- by Peabody at that time, even though the area director communicated with --",
  "Yes. That -- that -- the -- the area director's increase of -- to 20 percent, an adjustment of 20 percent, was appealed by -- was appealed by Peabody and the utilities that -- that are served by Peabody. And that appeal was briefed to the Assistant Secretary, and it was pending. And then in -- in July that was -- that area director's decision was in 1984. The briefing was, I think, about 6 months later, and then in July of 1985, the -- is -- is when the Secretary requested the Assistant Secretary to put off deciding this and have the parties negotiate. And they reached a tentative agreement within -- within a month. It was --",
  "The -- the Secretary could have overruled that. The -- the Secretary under the -- under the governing regulations that we quote in our brief the Secretary retained the authority to overrule any decision by -- by the Assistant Secretary.",
  "No. I believe that could have still been subject to the Secretary's determination. What -- what the Navajo Nation could have done, if it did not want to continue with negotiations, was to request that the matter be transferred from this informal appeals process to the Assistant Secretary to a formal appeals process which goes to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals.",
  "At that point the Secretary could have assumed jurisdiction of the matter from the IBIA under the same regulation I referred to. The Secretary always had it within his power to -- to take -- take cognizance of a case and not leave it with the -- with the board.",
  "There was a prohibition against ex parte contacts in that formal adjudication, but otherwise the Secretary retained the authority to -- to take the case.",
  "Well, there were two leases, and the Secretary's approval was required. But the reason was different for the two. In the -- under the lease principally at issue here, 8580 --",
  "-- the -- the lease itself had a clause that said that the royalty was subject to a reasonable adjustment",
  "-- by the Secretary.",
  "As to that, we believe that there could be no claim under the Tucker Act for the -- for the fundamental reason that that is not a -- a duty that is prescribed by an act of Congress, or a regulation under the Tucker Act.",
  "It -- it may well have and that was not -- that was not addressed. The basis of the claim here was --",
  "-- that the Secretary had -- had a duty under the lease.",
  "No. There's -- in -- in our view there is no duty under this statute to maximize returns to the tribe.",
  "I don't know that I would call it ministerial, but -- but the statute is -- is rather bare in its terms. It just says that the -- that the tribe, through its council -- and this is -- this is a statute of general application -- may -- with the approval of the Secretary -- lease its land for coal purposes. What the -- what the preconditions for the Secretary to give his approval are then and now is a matter for the Secretary to flesh out by regulations.",
  "I think it would be fair to say that -- that there is -- that there is a -- as I said, a general moral and political duty.",
  "Surely. Surely, and again we're not -- we're -- we quite agree that as -- that as a matter of what -- what judgment should -- should inform the Secretary in her approval of the lease.",
  "Well --",
  "Yes, but I meant --",
  "That -- that's true. Here there is --",
  "Well, that -- let me answer it this way. The Secretary -- as I said, I believe it's up to the Secretary to decide how to flesh out the regime for her approval of leases and she has done this in the regulations including, importantly, now and at the time this lease was -- lease amendments were approved, a minimum royalty amount. At the time, it was just 10 cents per ton. Now, it's 12-and-a-half percent, which is the standard rate of --",
  "No.",
  "Well, no. And it's important to understand why -- why I -- I think that's not correct the way the Secretary's regulations are written. This act has a number of goals, one of which is revenue for the tribe, but another is tribal self- determination, and this is clear from the legislative history of the Indian Mineral Leasing Act as described in 1938 and described by this Court in its Cotton Petroleum decision. So the -- the point is that it is up to the tribe to enter into agreements subject to approval by the Secretary.",
  "Well, the -- the -- it's actually something of a hybrid I -- I believe. And what the Secretary has chosen to impose on herself, which is not the same thing as to whether it's -- it's legally enforceable, is a set of regulations that would govern the way in which she approves a lease. And with respect to -- again, with respect to royalty, there is a specific regulation that says 12-and-a-half percent. What -- the way the Secretary has -- has accommodated these competing goals is that there is a -- a minimum set of standards to which any agreement between a tribe and a lessee enter into, any -- a set of standards that must be satisfied. Beyond that -- beyond those -- satisfaction of those standards, it is up to the tribe and the -- and the lessee --",
  "Right.",
  "Well --",
  "But it's -- it's not just like Mitchell II.",
  "And I -- and I think the important difference is in Mitchell II the Court recited a number of specific statutory duties -- statutory and regulatory duties that were directed at assuring a particular amount of income for the tribe under the circumstances. Fair market value for a right-of-way. Sustained yield management of -- of timber harvest. Specific statutory directives to take into account the financial needs of the beneficiaries whose allotments were going to be logged off.",
  "I -- I -- I don't think so. I mean, again, there may be -- there may be a tort action. The -- the Tucker Act does not cover the entire universe --",
  "But the --",
  "Well, no, because we -- we think that there was -- that the Secretary's approval of the -- of the lease amendments in 1987 satisfied a duty of reasonable prudence. The standard that was articulated in the documents presented to the Secretary for approval was -- was whether the lease package could be regarded as a reasonable exercise of -- of business judgment. This was set forward --",
  "Well, several things. The -- the termite example is different, first of all, in that it has an immediate physical impact on the -- on the trees -- the substance of the trust. What you're describing is a procedural -- is -- is at bottom a procedural --",
  "Well, the -- the -- secondly, the -- there is no indication that the substance of the communications was any different from the -- from what the tribe knew anyway, which was that Peabody had requested the Secretary not to act and to allow the parties to return to negotiations. But beyond that, when they -- then the -- this -- this -- these are all things that happened in 1984 and 1985. That was superseded by the parties' lease agreement in 1987. In 1987, as part of the lease agreement that was submitted to the Secretary and that the Navajo Nation requested that the Secretary approve, the area director's decision that initially established a 20 percent rate unilaterally was vacated and Peabody's appeal was dismissed. That wiped the slate clean for everything that happened up until then. The question then is what is -- was the 1987 lease amendment package proper? And under Mitchell, as we see it, unless there is a violation of a specific statutory or regulatory provision in the approval of the lease, there cannot be a claim for money damages under the Tucker Act. And --",
  "Right.",
  "Yes. In -- in 1987, what the parties presented to the Secretary was not a proposal to adjust the royalty under the -- Article VI of the existing lease. It was a set of new amendments that, among other things, superseded that clause of the lease and put in place another dispute resolution mechanism for adjusting the royalties in the future. As part of that, the -- the controversy with respect to the 1985 -- 1984 to 1985 adjustment was -- was eliminated. But that 1987 package provided well in excess of the minimum royalty rate both for the 8580 lease and also the other lease with -- for the Navajo with respect to coal it owned jointly with the Hopi Tribe. And that satisfied the specific regulatory standard that the Secretary had prescribed for deciding when she would approve lease agreements.",
  "No, I don't think it does because it -- the fiduciary -- the important discussion in Mitchell II of the fiduciary responsibility had to do with whether the specific statutory or regulatory duty -- which is prong one -- could in turn be fairly interpreted to requirement -- require the payment of compensation. That's where the fiduciary obligation comes in. But this case fails at the first step because there is no specific statutory or regulatory provision that was violated. There's no need to get to the second step in the analysis on that theory. And this specificity requirement was reflected in Testan and Sheehan, both of which were decided prior to -- to Mitchell. Both say that there has to be a right granted with specificity. It's also confirmed by things that have happened since then. That's the way the Federal Circuit in the Brown and Pawnee decisions that we -- that were cited in the decision below looked at Mitchell -- Mitchell II. There had to be a specific provision that was violated. And that's also entirely consistent with last year's decision in the Gonzaga case under -- under the very parallel situation of 1983 where the Court said there has to be a -- a right granted with specificity -- an entitlement granted with specificity -- where the question is whether a -- a -- another Federal statute gives rise to a cause of action under a general cause of action creating a statute, in that case 1983. But we think the analysis is directly parallel. If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens. First, with several factual points. The tribe did know the substance of -- of what had happened with respect to Secretary Hodel. As I pointed out earlier, Mr. Nelson's deposition, which is excerpted in the joint appendix, makes clear that the tribe had learned, he said, from Washington that -- that it was requested there that they go back to negotiations. And also I would call the Court's attention to page 2370 of the appendix, which are notes of the negotiating session -- first negotiating session that occurred after that on August 30th, 1985. It's a note in which Chairman Zah of the Nation acknowledges that Secretary Hodel apparently wanted them to go back and try to reach an agreement. So it's clear that the parties entered into these negotiations with a full understanding of -- of what the Secretary's preferred course was. Secondly, I think it's -- it's completely not true that Secretary Hodel directed a subordinate to lie to the Navajo Nation. The -- on page 117 of the joint appendix, there's a copy of the directive that -- or the -- the memorandum that Secretary Hodel sent to the Assistant Secretary about this. And he makes four very significant points entirely reasonable under the circumstances. He -- he referred to the fact that affirming the decision outright unilaterally might lead to prolonged litigation, during which the -- Peabody might well put the -- the royalties into escrow and the tribe wouldn't get them. It would impair the future ongoing contractual relationship between the parties. Peabody has a huge presence on the reservation, and it was obviously beneficial for the parties to resolve this peaceably and not just this isolated royalty increase under this one lease, but a whole host of issues that were -- that were facing the two parties: taxation, payment for water, other -- other leases in which there was a significant increase. And those other leases, by the way, did not have an adjustment clause. So the tribe here got the benefit not only of an increase on this lease, but an increase on a lease that did not have an adjustment clause. And Secretary Hodel then said it would be preferable to allow the parties to negotiate, and then importantly at the end, he said, I haven't reached a final decision on the merits of the appeal. I just think it would be better if the parties went back and negotiated. And since, as Justice Scalia pointed out, this was a lease provision that was -- protected both parties, what is reasonable for both parties, it was certainly an appropriate resolution of that for the Secretary to say -- in the normal situation where you have a -- a disagreement, or differing views under a lease, to send the parties back and seek to have them negotiate. Also, I would point out on page 125 of the joint appendix, there's a letter from Mr. Vollmann in which he points out that the Secretary is aware of each party's concerns about the settlement, again making it clear that -- that the Department in Washington was aware of the state of affairs out there. So the only -- the only -- aside from all of that, the claims about the negotiations that preceded the 1987 lease amendments are essentially procedural or tort claims, or claims about improper regulation of -- of a negotiating process. They aren't the sort of money- mandating statutory or -- first of all, there's no claim -- no -- no identification of a statutory or regulatory provision that -- that specifically regulates this and was violated. But in any event, just like the Due Process Clause that this Court held in Testan is not money-mandating, the same is true here as well.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Department of Health & Human Services has articulated a position on two issues that are directly relevant to this case, and those positions are set forth in the letter to the State Medicaid directors that is set forth in an appendix to our brief at page, I believe it's page 45a it begins. The first of those --",

  "There are two problems with the -- with the State program under this Medicaid director's letter that the Secretary sent out. The first is that it's the position of the department that a plan such as this, which imposes a prior approval requirement for Medicaid patients, if the drug manufacturer does not pay rebates with respect to sales to non-Medicaid patients, that sort of change is a material change in the State's plan which requires the approval of a plan amendment. There is a regulation that we cite in our brief at page 28, and quote, that requires that, and that, by the way, I think could be the -- the mechanism effectively for a prior jurisdiction sort of approach.",
  "Well, it's -- the -- the -- we have cited this regulation in our brief, and the -- and under Allens v. Robbins the Secretary's, or the -- the Secretary's interpretation's set forth in the brief. It's also set forth in the Medicaid director's letter.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, if I could just answer that and then move to the second question, because I think it's related, the regulation identifies what -- that material changes in the plan have to be submitted for an amendment. The Secretary's enforcement authority comes from a different source, which is in 42 U.S.C. 1396c, which allows the Secretary to cut off funds in whole or in part if a State is operating under a plan that requires an amendment because of those changes, so -- but I --",
  "I think it was -- it's entirely reasonable -- first of all, that's a matter of enforcement discretion under Heckler v. Cheney, and at least for the time being, why this -- while this case is under -- is under submission, the Secretary has not -- has not proceeded.",
  "Well, in going forward, I mean, the Secretary issued this Medicaid director's letter in September, after the Court had granted review --",
  "-- because this was an area that required attention. Going forward, we -- we expect that -- that States will submit their proposals to the Secretary as plan amendments --",
  "Well, here's the way I think that it could proceed.",
  "I -- I think the procedural posture of this case would allow that, and let me explain why. The Secretary's second position in this case, which I wanted to also make sure I articulated, which was that a -- that a proposed, or a plan such as this, which provides for rebates for non-Medicaid patients, still must serve some Medicaid purpose. In the district court, when the district court entered what is only a preliminary injunction at this stage, at page 71 of the petition appendix, the district court pointed out that the State had not argued that its proposal served any Medicaid purpose. As the preliminary injunction was entered, it was entered on that premise. The court of appeals then speculated that perhaps it does serve a Medicaid purpose, but looking back at when the preliminary injunction was entered, it was entered on the premise that it served none, and we think, and the Secretary believes that a plan must at least serve some Medicaid purpose.",
  "If -- on the proper showing. The rationale --",
  "Yes. The rationale adopted by the district court was the rationale that some --",
  "That's -- but we believe that the purpose that has been advanced does not save this statute. The purpose that has been advanced and was identified by the court of appeals was a purpose that some people who were close to being Medicaid-eligible will be forced to spend more on drugs, may become Medicaid-eligible, and therefore cost the Medicaid program more money. That's a Medicaid-related purpose. The problem is, the State statute is not tailored to people who are close to the poverty line.",
  "Yes. What --",
  "Yes.",
  "If the Court reversed the court of appeals decision, in effect affirmed the district court's injunction, which was entered on the basis that the plan serves no Medicaid-related purpose, the State program would be enjoined. At that point the State of Maine could submit the program to the Secretary of Health & Human Services along with any justifications for the plan, such as those -- there are two additional ones that have been raised in its brief in this Court for the first time, and we think that's how it should play out. This is a -- right now, the case presents a very narrow issue on a preliminary injunction.",
  "We don't think it would be a hearing in the district court. We believe it should be submitted to the Secretary, because a plan amendment is required, but we do believe that -- that the petitioner has made a sufficient showing based on the, on what the district court said, that this plan, that Maine had offered no justification, no Medicaid justification for the plan.",
  "We -- we do. The legislative history of the prior approval position --",
  "No, and also there are two other provisions of the act which we think are relevant, on the one hand, a(19), which talks about the best interests of the patients, but on the other hand, a(30) -- this is 1396a(30)(A), which says that a State plan must provide for methods of payment that advance efficiency and economy in the Medicaid program. We think both of those speak to interests within the Medicaid program and require in the prior approval process, as well as in the administration of the plan generally, weighing the interests of the Medicaid beneficiaries against the broader institutional interests of the Medicaid program. If there was no Medicaid-related purpose requirement at all, then a State could impose a prior approval requirement if the drug company contributes money to the art museum or to the State highway program. We think that under this Court's decision in Dublino, the State must be pursuing a purpose in common with the Federal Government, a Medicaid-related purpose. What -- what the scope --",
  "Well, ripe for this Court's review, but we now -- we now believe that, given that the director's letter that was sent out in September, that there is a basis, there's an articulation of the Secretary's position both on plan amendments and the requirement of a Medicaid-related purpose that -- that this Court could properly dispose of the case in the narrow -- in the narrow way I suggested which, of course, would also obviate any requirement to consider the Commerce Clause question. Things have evolved in the Secretary's evaluation of this and, as Justice O'Connor, I think pointed out, the Secretary has since approved a Michigan plan amendment under this same general approach.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The California statute at issue here is not a statute of general application that happens to have an incidental impact on foreign Nations, foreign countries, or foreign transactions. It is a statute that is written exclusively and specifically with respect to a category of foreign insurance transactions occurring in foreign countries between foreign companies and foreign nationals more than 50 years ago, and it concerns a subject matter, the settlement of claims arising out of international conflict, that has -- has always been understood by this Court to be the responsibility of the national Government, as reflected most recently in Dames & Moore.",
  "But disclosure is a form of regulation. This is true, this is obvious from our securities laws, it is -- it is evident from this Court's decision in the BMW case of several years back, where the Court -- which had to do with disclosure, and the Court said that one State may not try to enforce its policies with respect to the disclosure of information in other States, and we think that --",
  "Under blue sky laws, under the, I believe it's the Hall decision, the Court said that a State could require disclosures -- with respect to in-State transactions it could require disclosures about issuance of securities out of State that are related to in-State transactions. We have no in-State transaction here. California has claimed two possible connections to the State to justify this statute. The first is that the companies, the insurance companies, certain insurance companies do business in California. Those are not the ones that issued these policies, but they do business in California. Under this Court's decisions, I think most notably the Connecticut General case that is cited in the petitioner's brief, is a case where the Court said the fact that insurance companies do business in the State is not a sufficient basis for a State in that case to tax transactions, insurance policies that are entered into outside of that State, so it's clear that the fact that certain insurance companies do business in the State does not give California a right to regulate through disclosure transactions and policies that happened outside the State and, a fortiori, that's true with respect to foreign transactions. The other interest that California has been -- has asserted, which I think Justice Stevens referred to, is the fact that some number, a very small percentage of Holocaust survivors are in California, and with respect to that, this Court's decision in Shutts make, and other decisions make clear that moving to the forum State an adjudicatory jurisdiction is not a sufficient nexus, or -- or legislative jurisdiction is not a sufficient nexus for a State. What we have here, again, is one State of the Union trying to establish its own foreign policy, in the words of the Zschernig suit --",
  "Yes. This, in our view, is -- is a violation of the Constitution. We think that the -- that the longstanding efforts by the National Government to work out cooperative agreements with Germany and -- and other countries in Europe arising out of the Holocaust underscores vividly why this is a matter of national concern, but we would be making the same argument irrespective of that. The -- the structure of our Constitution assigns to the National Government the resolution of foreign policy issues, and this is a -- this is a very major and longstanding foreign policy issue about how foreign countries should resolve claims about their own nationals. These policies were issued to European nationals. It may be that there are beneficiaries or policyholders in California now, but this is -- this is exclusively a matter for the National Government --",
  "Not, not directly, but -- but we do think that the executive agreement manifests the executive branch's policy with respect to the resolution of Holocaust era claims, and there are, I think, two principal conflicts with respect to the United States policy. One is the one, and I want to underscore this, the one that was mentioned with respect to the -- to the lists. ICHEIC is establishing essentially a registry, the very thing that California wants to do, but in a much narrower sense that has been negotiated specifically to avoid conflict between German privacy laws and -- and United States law, and what -- what -- through this matching exercise and through use of various lists of -- of Holocaust survivor organizations, Jewish organizations, and census lists in Germany will be putting together a pretty comprehensive list of Holocaust survivors and insurance policies issued in Germany to disclose in a way that German authorities believe that list will not violate German privacy laws. The California statute, Germany takes the firm position would violate German -- German privacy laws. The other conflict is the whole thrust of the United States policy has been voluntary and cooperative, not mandatory and regulatory.",
  "Well, but the best efforts was, it will use its best efforts with State and local governments, in other words in direct communications, and -- and Assistant Secretary -- Secretary Eizenstat and others communicated --",
  "But this -- this agreement says that -- says two things, that it would be in the interest of the -- this is on page 155a of the -- of the petition appendix, that it would be in the interest of the two countries for the foundation to be the exclusive remedy for the forum of the resolution of claims, and on page 156a the agreement provides for the resolution of claims through ICHEIC and supplemental procedures to be developed through ICHEIC, which includes the development of this -- of this list.",
  "No. Those -- that did not involve State regulation, that involved private lawsuits, and there was a settlement which the United States encouraged. Again, this was part of the overall approach of the United States Government.",
  "Right, and if -- if --",
  "Right, and if -- if there are sufficient adjudicatory connections to the United States, that would be fine. I wanted to mention --",
  "Well, if the, if the -- if the defendant was doing business in the United States, if a -- if a suitable class action --",
  "It wasn't -- it wasn't entirely, but there was a settlement there. Some of these issues were not definitively resolved.",
  "I don't --",
  "I -- I don't believe so.",
  "I don't -- I don't believe so specifically, but that was early in the -- in the -- in this settlement effort. I want to make two important points about the United States, the -- the Constitution's assignment of responsibility. The Constitution assigns responsibility to the National Government for foreign relations and foreign commerce because any retaliation or any adverse impact will be felt by the Nation as a whole, not by the State that -- that triggers it, and this is a point that the Court has made in Japan Lines and numerous cases over the years, and this case illustrates that, because what is going on here is complicating. It is an impediment with our relations with European countries at a very sensitive time, and you have one State who -- that is not participating in all of those other efforts and doesn't have to balance the -- the insult that might arise from a statute like this against all of the other issues that are on the United States' plate in dealing with foreign Governments at a particular time. This is the very reason, that the States don't have enough information and the full responsibility and the National Government has to look out for the interests of the Nation as a whole, why one State may not thrust itself into foreign policy like this. The due process and foreign commerce arguments are very complementary of that because they impose independent limitations on a State thrusting its regulatory power outside of not only its own borders but in this case outside the Nation's borders to, again, regulate through disclosure information about insurance policies in other countries. The very fact that Germany and California insurance regulations generally maintain privacy of insurance information shows that questions of privacy and disclosure are matters of regulation.",
  "May I -- may I answer? Yes, that would present a different question. We don't think that California could require this blanket disclosure. I think under international comity analysis, under this Court's decision in Aerospaciale, there may be some ability for the State to request certain relevant information --",
  "-- to investigate the suitability.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit held in this case that the United States Postal Service may be sued for treble damages under the Federal antitrust laws. The court of appeals fundamentally erred in this holding. Throughout the nation's history, postal operations have been carried out by the United States Government itself, pursuant to the express authorization in article I of the Constitution, for Congress to establish post offices and post roads. As this Court explained in the Council of Greenburgh case about 20 years ago, the furnishing of postal services has historically been regarded as a sovereign function, indeed a sovereign necessity, to promote intercourse among the states and bind the nation together. Such functions of the United States Government are not regulated by the antitrust laws. Indeed, more than 60 years ago, in the Cooper Corporation case, this Court held that the United States is not a person for purposes of the antitrust laws. Although the precise question before the Court in that case was whether the United States could sue as a plaintiff under section 7 of the Sherman Act, the Court noted that the same word, person, is used to describe who may be held liable as a defendant, either in a civil action or in a criminal prosecution.",
  "Well, I - I think that there are no instrumentalities that are constituent parts of the United States Government itself that could - that could be held liable. The word instrumentality is used in a - in a somewhat vague sense, elastic sense, and I think it would be necessary to look at the particular statute to see how much of a governmental character a particular entity has.",
  "It - it - it did, but the - the court of appeals was wrong on that. First of all, after the - the court of - after the - this Court's Cooper decision, a number of lower court decisions have held, beginning with the D.C. Circuit's decision in the Sea- Land case involving the Alaska Railroad, that agencies of the United States or instrumentalities just like the United States itself is not a person subject to the antitrust laws. The Ninth Circuit didn't -",
  "Well, the - the - it was - the Court regarded it as an - as an instrumentality, and in fact the - the Court there recognized that the railroad and the officials of the Government responsible for supervising the railroad could be sued under the APA, and that, therefore, there had been a waiver of sovereign immunity to that extent, and to the extent of allowing injunctive relief. So the - the Court certainly focused on the question that the Alaska Railroad and those responsible for managing it were part of the United States Government.",
  "It may not have been contested, but it - but it - the Court certainly addressed that question and then went on to hold that as an instrumentality of the United States, the - the railroad was not subject to suit under the antitrust law.",
  "It is not. It - it - Congress specifically accepted it that there's - in section 410 of the act, there's a very detailed enumeration of the provisions that Congress did want and did not want to be - the Postal Service to be subject to. But the - the important point for present purposes is that in 1970, when Congress enacted the Postal Reorganization Act, it carried forward the essential governmental character of the Postal Service, just as it had been up until that point. In fact, section 101(a) of the act says that the United States - and I quote - the United States Postal Service shall be operated as a basic and fundamental service provided to the people by the Government of the United States. And then it says, the Postal Service shall have as its basic function the obligation to provide postal services to bind the nation together.",
  "In - in a - in a limited sense. Congress -",
  "No, I - I -",
  "In the - in the description of - of how the Postal Service was to be operated carrying forward, the - the Congress repeatedly referred to the Postal Service as - as a governmental function, a public service to be operated in a business-like way. But what Congress meant by that was to insulate the Postal Service from the prior political interference that had come up by imposing the duty on Congress to repeatedly raise rates and - and address services.",
  "Not - but by -",
  "No. By - by no means insulate it from the Government. The Postal Service - the governors of the Postal Service are denominated officers of the United States, so the people responsible for the Postal Service are officers of the United States.",
  "They're removable for cause.",
  "Yes, but - but certainly the other independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and agencies like that are part of the United States Government performing a governmental function.",
  "Actually, in the - in the text of the act itself, there - there is - there is not an express directive that the Postal Service will be operated like a commercial entity. What Congress had in mind was to - was to rationalize the internal operations of the Postal Service, but it did not change any of the fundamental ways in which the Postal Service operated. It - it maintained the postal monopoly, which, under the private express statutes, about 80 percent of the revenues of the Postal Service are - are protected by the private express -",
  "It is not a person within the meaning of the antitrust laws.",
  "That is not a - that is not a new feature of the - of the Postal Service. As we point out in our reply brief, quoting this Court's decision in the Emergency Fleet Corporation case, there the Court pointed out, with respect to the Post Office, it said the Post Office has since 1872 competed with bankers through money orders, it competed with savings and loan association through savings accounts, which the Postal Service operated -",
  "I - I'm not sure about that. The Postal Service itself would not be - would not be liable, and I - and I think if the - I guess it depends on what one means by a - by a conspiracy as well, because if the - the Postal Service has brought authority in procurement, for example, to - it's exempt from some of the Federal procurement statutes, but Congress granted it the authority to have its own procurement arrangements. So if the - if - if a - if the Postmaster General decides on a particular procurement methodology that - that was alleged to be anti-competitive, I don't think that could be fairly characterized as a conspiracy, even -",
  "It is, it is, and that has - that has not been changed, and the Court discussed that in the California Board of Regents case and other - and other decisions of this Court. Really, the - all the Ninth Circuit relied upon in - in this case was the presence of a sue-and-be-sued clause in the Postal Reorganization Act, which simply says that the Postal Service may sue and be sued in its official name. There is a - there is virtually no discussion of that provision in the legislative history of the act, and the Ninth Circuit essentially said that because the Postal Service may sue - may be sued in its official name, therefore, it has - its sovereign character has been cast off and it can be sued just like a private party. That - that analysis is in direct conflict with this Court's decision in FDIC v. Meyer, where the Court reversed a similar determination with respect to the FDIC, saying that the Ninth Circuit had conflated what are two analytically distinct questions. The first is whether there is a waiver of sovereign immunity. We do not dispute that there is a waiver of sovereign immunity here under the sue-and-be-sued clause. But the - the second and critical question here is whether the - the substantive law that the plaintiff relies upon provides an avenue for relief. In this case, that is the antitrust laws, and Congress has never amended the antitrust laws to make an agency or an entity of the United States Government liable. After the decision in Cooper - Cooper Corporation, Congress amended the Clayton Act to allow the United States to sue as a plaintiff if it's injured in its business or property, but it did not do that by changing the word person. It - it explicitly provided a cause of action for the United States as the United States, but it did not, as the D.C. Circuit pointed out in the Sea-Land case, amend the definition of person or otherwise make the United States or its constituent parts subject to the antitrust laws as a - as a defendant.",
  "That's part of the reorganization. There was a Post Office Department before that was part of the Cabinet, and what - what Congress wanted to do was to take the post - postal operations out of the Cabinet and put them under - under the Board of Governors, who are officers of the United States but not part of the Cabinet. And the - the phrase, establishment of the executive branch, is used with respect to other undeniably Federal agencies, as we point out in our - in our brief, the OPM, Office of Personnel Management, the Transportation Safety Board. And I - I think it's just intended to make clearer that the Postal Service was not to be under the President's direct control, and in fact there were proposals to make the Postal Service a corporation, and Congress emphatically rejected that. And instead, as President Nixon proposed in - in submitting a proposal to Congress, the Postal Service would be constituted as an agency like the SEC or NASA or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. All of those entities are - are performing quintessentially governmental functions that are not subject to the antitrust laws.",
  "Yes, yes, you do. And - and - it's - it's an important thing to - to be clear about in the Postal Reorganization Act. Pervasively throughout that statute, Congress treated the Postal Service as a governmental entity. The torts are subject to the Federal Tort Claims Act.",
  "Out of the - out of the Postal Service fund, but that is a fund in the Treasury. There's a separate provision -",
  "No - no, it's - no, it's not, but - but there are other - other situations in which appropriated funds from a particular agency are used to reimburse the judgment fund if there's a particular appropriation set aside for that purpose, so this is not a unique feature of - of the - of the Postal Act. But if I could also mention, torts are subject to suit against the United States, but with respect to contracts, Congress subjected the Postal Service to the Contract Disputes Act. The Court of Claims held almost 20 years ago, soon after the act was passed, that the United States itself could be sued under the Tucker Act based on a breach of contract with the Postal Service, because of the close connection between the Postal Service and the United States. The Postal Service could be sued in district court in its own name under the sue-and-be-sued clause for breach of contract, but the Court of Claims held that - that the United States itself can be sued, and therefore is responsible for the contracts of - of the Postal Service, and it -",
  "We - we believe it could. It would - it would be brought in its own name, but - but the United States - if the Postal Service, just like any other entity, purchased goods, for example, and was a victim of - of a - of a - of an antitrust violation, the United States would be able to sue and - and collect treble damages. That was the purpose of the Cooper Corporation case, where there was a procurement of tires by a number of different Federal agencies, and Congress authorized the United States to bring a suit to recover for the injuries sustained to Federal agencies generally in that situation.",
  "As a general rule, yes. There - before the Federal Tort Claims Act was passed though, it was assumed that tort claims could be brought against Federal entities that had sue-and-be-sued clauses, although a lot of those were private corporations that were instrumentalities, not - not Federal agencies. And also with respect -",
  "It's - it's been - it's unclear because back when they were first put in the - in the statutes, the - the separation of a - the existence of a waiver of sovereign immunity and the existence of a cause of action were - were not separated the way they are today. For example, under the - under the Tucker Act, a plaintiff can bring a breach of contract action against the United States, even though there's no statute that specifically provides a cause of action for breach of contract. It's thought that - that the reference to contracts in the Tucker Act is a sufficient basis for that, and we -",
  "It does, it does, and it has - it - it carries forward the power to investigate postal offenses, to - to - with appropriate authorization, to search the mails.",
  "I don't know that the question has arisen, but I - I would assume that a - a suit could be brought against the United States under the Tucker Act on the same theory that I mentioned with respect to a breach of contract by the Postal Service.",
  "They - they do, and that -",
  "Well, I - I think it's part of an overall pattern.",
  "Right. But it's part of an overall pattern. Congress does not lightly confer the right of eminent domain on - on Federal agencies, but it's part of a general pattern in which the United States - excuse me, in which Congress treated the Postal Service as a - as a governmental entity. I did want to point out one particular way that illustrates the - the way in which the antitrust laws are unsuitable here. The precise - this is - this is at bottom a routine - a routine procurement dispute. And as the Ninth Circuit held in this case, the plaintiffs here had a cause of action, in fact, brought one under the Administrative Disputes Resolution Act that is essentially a bid protest statute. And there are two features of that statute that are inconsistent with antitrust liability in this setting. First of all, Congress expressly provided that the standard of review in such an action is the arbitrary and capricious standard of the APA, meaning that the Postal Service, like any other Federal agency subject to that, has to have broad latitude -",
  "Well, except - except to this extent. In - in virtually every direction you turn, in looking on how - on how disputes involving the Postal Service are handled, you find a governmental dispute resolution mechanism, and that - this was the point about the -",
  "There's - there's express authorization for suing the United States for -",
  "Same - same thing. Where Congress has wanted to provide the United -",
  "There - there might be - there might be remedies under some of the statutes mentioned here. There - I mean, Congress has expressly subjected the United States to suit under the Lanham Act, under the copyright statute, under - under the trademark laws, under the patent laws, but - and - and then there are these procurement statutes that I mentioned that are applicable in this particular case. But in this case as well, Congress did not provide for treble damages. The only monetary relief a plaintiff could get in this procurement situation, as we point out in our brief under the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, is bid preparation costs, not treble damages.",
  "There would be an alternative remedies. Before the Contract Disputes Act was passed, the Postal Service could have been sued itself in its own name under the sue-and-be-sued clause, or in the Tuck - under the Tucker Act in the - in the Court of Claims. Now under the Contract Disputes Act, Congress has made that statute applicable to the Postal Service just as it has to other Federal entities.",
  "Yes. And there is specifically a Postal Service board of contract appeals, just there - as there is a board of contract appeals in - in other agencies.",
  "The way - the way Congress addressed that was to subject the Postal Service to the jurisdiction of the Postal Rate Commission, and all -",
  "Well, I would - I would - if the - a decision - it's a complicated mechanism the way the Postal Rate Commission interacts with the Postal Service, but there is a provision for judicial review. If the Postal Service enters a final decision after - after receiving the input from the Postal Rate Commission, there is a provision for judicial review of that - of determinations of -",
  "- rates and classifications.",
  "Under - under the Postal Reorganization Act, the provisions beginning in - in section 3601 of the act address rate-making and classification, and there are specific standards there that the Postal Rate Commission and the Postal Service must adhere to.",
  "They - they are designed to. The - the - the way the - the way the act operates, it specifies that each classification - first - two things: one, overall, the Postal Service rates are to be set at a rate so that they - the income will roughly equal expenditures. And then within each class, Congress has provided the direct and indirect costs of that class are to be allocated to it, along with some - an appropriate portion of the institutional costs, the things that are difficult to - to allocate to any one - any one class.",
  "Well, and - and it's not - over the long term, over the long term since the Postal Reorganization Act, I believe that the Postal Service is within about a billion dollars of breaking even. There are times when it is in a deficit. There are times when it is in a surplus, but the statutory goal is that it - that it be roughly equal balance between - between income and expenditures.",
  "Yes. That's true for letters, but not for parcel post.",
  "Yes. There's - there's an - the Postal Service adopted an exception to the private express statutes for urgent letters, which - which has allowed organizations like Federal Express to carry letters for urgent delivery. Absent that exception, they would - that practice would be prohibited by the - by the private express statutes. But the - the idea that the Postal Service competes with non-Federal entities is not new. As I - as I pointed out, the Postal Service began competing with money orders before the turn of the last century, for 50 years have had savings deposits with up to 4 million depositors that competed with savings associations, so and - and it's competed - it went into the parcel post business, the parcel delivery business in 1913 alongside of other businesses. So that - that sort of competition with private businesses has - has occurred since well before the Postal Reorganization Act, and nothing in the Postal Reorganization Act changes the way in which that should be regarded under the - under the antitrust laws. If the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Several points, Mr. Chief Justice. In addition to the other statutes that I've mentioned with respect to the right to sue, there are a number of other respects in which Congress has treated the Postal Service as a Federal entity. It's subject to their Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Inspector General Act, it's subject to the Federal sector OSHA regulations, and as this Court pointed out in the Loeffler decision, it's subject to the Federal sector Title VII prohibitions, not - it's not treated as a private corporation for purposes of Title VII. It is subject to the National Labor Relations Act, but this act was passed in 1970 before the Federal sector labor - labor management provisions came in in the Civil Service Reform Act, and as you pointed out, Justice Scalia, that's an express provision subjecting the Postal Service to something that otherwise applies to private entities, but in - but in virtually every other respect, Congress has specified that it would be subject to Federal law. And in section 409 of the act, with respect to judicial proceedings, Congress specified that the Postal Service would be - would be treated just like the United States, not just with respect to Tort Claims Act, but venue, removal jurisdiction, and representation by the Attorney General. But the - the most fundamental point, however, to be made is that this is not a situation in which Congress has created a new entity and launched, in that sense, that entity into a private commercial world. Here, Congress has carried forward the nation's tradition of treating postal services as sovereign functions performed by the Government of the United States. These are - these are - to the extent they're commercial functions and - and they are unusual commercial functions, the Constitution treats them as - as something of particular interest to the United States Government. I should point out that with respect to the postal services, all postal services are subject to the jurisdiction of the Postal Rate Commission, not just those that are subject to monopoly, that - that the Postal Service has monopoly control over, Justice Breyer. So even in those areas in which the Postal Service is subject to competition in - in parcel and express mail, for example, the Postal Service - the Postal Rate Commission - does have regulatory jurisdiction over those -",
  "It does not over greeting cards, but the non-postal functions of the Postal Service constitute less than 1 percent of the revenues of the - of the Postal Service. We're talking about a very minor aspect of the Postal Service's operations, and the affirmative authorization for the Postal Service to engage in that in section 404(7) of the act is cast in the same terms as the Postal Service's authorization to engage in all the other functions and they're really incidental.",
  "No, I think - I think it shows that - that - that the predominant character of the Postal Service is as it always has been, and these - these other services are really in most ways incidental to - to postal services like greeting cards and - and that sort of thing.",
  "This - this is - this is not - this is not that. This case is a - is an ordinary procurement dispute that - all Federal agencies engage in procurement and - and -",
  "And in procurement, and in procurement in particular, Congress has treated the Postal Service like all other - all other Federal agencies under the Contract Disputes Act, particularly with respect to the disputes at issue here. So in the end we believe that, as Justice O'Connor said, this is essentially a policy choice for Congress. If - if in the current climate the Postal Service is to be subject to the antitrust laws, notwithstanding the fact that it remains a governmental entity, that is a - that is a choice that Congress should make, whether these governmental activities should be regulated by treble damage actions, which was extremely unusual under - under Federal statutes. And where Congress has chosen to subject the United States to liability under statutes such as this, but not nearly as free-ranging in the patent laws, et cetera, it has done so expressly, and we think 30 years after the passage of the Postal Reorganization Act, that if the - if the Postal Service is now to be subject to the antitrust laws, that is something for Congress to do and not for the courts to try to divine from complete silence in the Postal Reorganization Act or its legislative history on that point. If there are no further questions.",
  "I - I'm not sure whether they - I - I don't know whether they sell biking gear. The fact that they - the fact that they use the Postal Service team in - in - in promoting Postal Service products, I think, doesn't say anything about whether they're subject -",
  "It's entirely possible.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 14 years ago in the Duro decision this Court held that under the state of Indian law, as it then stood, and Indian tribe could not prosecute an Indian who was not a member of that tribe. The Court recognized, though, that its decision might create a jurisdictional gap on many reservations, but the Court concluded that if the present jurisdictional regime proves insufficient to meet the needs of reservation law enforcement, the proper body to address that concern is Congress, which has plenary power over Indian affairs. Congress responded immediately to this Court's decision. It -- it conducted an extensive inquiry and heard hearings about the consequences of the Court's decision and heard strong expressions of concern by many Indian tribes, by the Federal Government, and by numerous States about the law enforcement vacuum that would be created over many misdemeanor offenses on Indian reservations. And there was widespread support for Congress to restore the power to Indian tribes to exercise their sovereign power to prosecute non-member Indians.",
  "I think the answer lies in -- in the longstanding jurisdictional regime on Indian reservations. Going back to 1817, the general Indian crimes statute has authorized prosecutions by the Federal Government over crimes committed by non-Indians, including misdemeanor crimes, and so there was not a jurisdictional void. The difficulty came -- the -- the most acute difficulty came from the fact that that statute, again since the earliest times, had -- has exempted crimes committed by one Indian against the person or property of another.",
  "Congress could have done so, but Congress, with the plenary power over Indian affairs, chose -- decided that the proper course or the most appropriate course was to have that jurisdiction exercised by the Indian tribes. And Congress heard considerable -- considerable evidence that that power had long, in fact, been exercised by Indian tribes over other Indians who were not members of the particular tribe.",
  "It -- generally, it has been understood to require a tribal affiliation. First of all, the definition under -- under the Indian Civil Rights Act for tribal power, Congress adopted the same meaning of Indian that is applied under the Federal criminal statutes for the purpose of having the two mesh completely.",
  "And under that, obviously, someone who is an enrolled -- formally enrolled member would be an Indian, but as this Court pointed out in footnote 7 of its Antelope decision, the -- that provision has not been construed to require that strictly, that ordinarily someone who is an Indian and has a tribal affiliation and is recognized by the tribe is also regarded as an Indian. In this case, though, we have a situation where someone who is an enrolled member of another tribe. So questions about the -- about the -- how the statute should be construed or applied in situations where there's not one -- someone who's formally a member are -- are not present in this case.",
  "Yes. Under this Court's decision, this --",
  "Yes. This Court's decision in Talton v. Mayes said that the Fifth Amendment did not apply to the exercise of powers by Indian tribes, and that's been understood to apply to --",
  "Well, it -- it may be, but -- but it's important to recognize what -- what Congress has also done here was to enact the Indian Civil Rights Act which extends to Indian tribes many of the requirements of the Bill of Rights.",
  "Not all of them, but Congress in 1968 examined the question of the -- of the rights of -- of Indians and others subject to tribal jurisdiction and -- and applied the -- the provisions of the -- of the Indian Civil Rights Act. So there -- the -- the --",
  "I don't -- I don't believe they are before the Court. What was before the -- those -- those questions go to what restraints are on the tribe itself when it's exercising its own power. That was not the basis of the court of appeals decision in this case. The court of appeals decision was really on the separate ground of what happens when you have, first, the tribe exercising its sovereign power and then the United States exercising power after that under the Double Jeopardy Clause.",
  "Well, I -- it depends what one means by delegation. The word delegation is -- is used in a variety of ways. I mean, for -- for example, it's common to speak of Congress delegating power to an executive agency to carry out a certain function, but when the executive agency does this, it's not exercising congressional power. It's exercising power that Congress in its plenary authority has -- has conferred on the executive branch to --",
  "-- to then execute those laws.",
  "Right. I -- I was using that by analogy to say that the word delegate is -- is often used, including in this Court's opinions I think, in a -- in a somewhat looser sense in terms of -- of authorizing someone else to act. But I think -- I think --",
  "Yes. And that's -- I think that's exactly what Congress did in the Indian Civil Rights Act. It -- it require -- and -- and this Court said in Wheeler and has said in numerous other decisions that Congress has plenary power over the exercise of a tribe's own sovereign powers. And what Congress did in the Indian Civil Rights Act was precisely to regulate that.",
  "Yes. I -- I think there -- there are several responses to that point. First of all, I think it matters a lot whether one views the limitations on tribal power as mandated by the Constitution or as a product of Federal common law. And in -- and --",
  "No. I -- I -- with respect, I don't think that's correct because I think if it -- if it is not -- if this conception is not constitutionally mandated, then Congress has the authority, the plenary authority, over Indian affairs to regulate, to modify tribal jurisdiction. And -- and in fact, I think that -- that --",
  "No. I -- I believe that's -- that's an expression of the dependency or a manifestation of the dependency, not in derogation of it, because dependent means that your ability to exercise authority -- in this case, the Indian tribe is always subject to the overriding powers of the Federal Government. And what this Court said precisely in the --",
  "But it -- if -- if one looks back at the Oliphant decision, what the Court there described its -- its undertaking was was essentially a -- a -- an articulation of what it called Indian law which is a -- a combination of judge-made law but against the backdrop of treaties and statutes. Those treaties and statutes are not themselves embodying constitutionally mandated rules. They are the product of the political branches. They sometimes don't answer precise questions, and this Court is required to articulate judicial principles as best it can against the backdrop of those principles. But because those principles themselves are traced to treaties and statutes, it must be up to -- Congress must have the authority to modify those rules, and that's consistent with its plenary power over Indian affairs. What this Court said in the Montana decision, which -- which has been identified as the path-marking decision over -- concerning jurisdiction over non-tribal members, was what tribes lost by virtue of their dependent status was the power independently to determine their external relations. This is not what we have here --",
  "No. No, it isn't --",
  "This is not a unilateral assertion of tribal power. This Court held in -- in Oliphant and Duro, by looking at the -- at the backdrop of -- of statutory enactments, that its power had been limited, but -- and the tribe did not unilaterally overcome that. What Congress did was lift the limits so that the tribe -- the tribe would then be authorized to exercise sovereign power that it previously had -- had had. And it's in that -- it's directly analogous to two important examples that I think are very instructive here. One is that Constitution itself in the Commerce Clause has been held to, of its own force, preempt State laws in the interstate commerce and also in the Indian Commerce Clause area. But Congress can, in the exercise of its authority over commerce under either one, lift those restrictions and authorize States to regulate in areas they otherwise could not do.",
  "No, but -- but the point is that in that situation, even when the Constitution itself has, as a matter of constitutional law, limited State authority, Congress can lift that. The other -- the other example --",
  "No. It's --",
  "No. It's --",
  "No. I'm -- I'm not speaking of Bill -- Bill of Rights provisions. I'm speaking of Congress' Article I power.",
  "Well, under -- under this Court's decision -- decisions, Congress has been authorized to allow States to regulate in areas it -- it would otherwise not be able to, and when it does so, it's exercising its own sovereign power, not power delegated by the Federal Government. The other -- the other instructive example is Public Law 280. Since the outset of the Constitution, really by the -- by carrying forward arrangements of -- in Indian law prior to the adoption of the Constitution, States have not been able to exercise jurisdiction over matters involving Indians in Indian country absent an affirmative authorization by Congress. In Public Law 280 Congress lifted those limitations and authorized tribes to exercise jurisdiction over Indians and others in Indian country.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Excuse me. Authorized States. And in doing so, those States are not exercising delegated Federal power. Congress lifted a barrier to the exercise by States of their own sovereign power to prosecute according to their laws.",
  "Yes.",
  "I -- I agree with your result. I -- I think conceptually what I would say is dependent defines the relationship between the tribe and the National Government --",
  "-- in this case Congress. And -- and Congress in the -- in the exercise of its superior sovereignty is -- is defining the contours of the dependent sovereign's authority. So it -- it is a manifestation of the dependent relationship.",
  "Yes. And --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. I -- I think that's right. And --",
  "Well, the -- this Court held in Wheeler that prosecution by an Indian tribe of a -- of a member of the tribe in that situation, followed by a prosecution by the Federal Government for what would -- the same conduct, was not the same offense because the ultimate authority to prosecute derived from different sources. And we think the same --",
  "Well, it -- I -- I think by inherent what the Court meant in both Oliphant and -- and in Duro was original sovereignty that has continued unlimited or unrestricted down to the present day. In other words, it -- it has been -- it has been allowed to continue, and in that sense it's inherent in being --",
  "Well, I -- I --",
  "If -- if we -- if we look at the reality of the nature of the prosecutions here, this was a prosecution brought by tribal officials in a tribally constituted court enforcing provisions of tribal law, not title 18, under a tribal constitution. That --",
  "Yes. I -- I believe the -- this Court's decision in -- in Oliphant says so in several respects. What the Court -- in several locations. What the Court said in Oliphant is that the -- the tribes necessarily lost their dependent -- excuse me -- by virtue of their dependent status, lost their ability to prosecute non-Indians except in a manner acceptable to Congress. So the -- the Court necessarily assumed that Congress could revest this authority in the Indian tribes.",
  "Well, several things. First of all, the -- the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment under this Court's decision in Talton probably would not apply of its own force to the tribe. But what does apply is the Indian Civil Rights Act. What -- Congress filled that void by -- by -- as a statutory matter requiring that certain rights be --",
  "Yes. I -- I think --",
  "I -- I think --",
  "I -- I think -- I think in asking a due process question, you might be asking -- a procedural due process question, you might be asking an equal protection type question.",
  "Right -- right to counsel is not -- is not expressly guaranteed by the Indian Civil Rights Act. If there is a particular prosecution that is found to violate fundamental fairness because of the absence of counsel, the Indian Civil Rights Act would -- would provide a vehicle for that argument.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, with -- first of all, with respect to members of tribes other than the prosecuting tribe, Congress in the exercise of its plenary authority over tribes we think certainly should have the power to regulate the relationship among tribes, tribes with each other, and relationships of tribes and their respective members with each other.",
  "That's what Congress has done here.",
  "No, it would not. And that's -- that is another -- there -- there are really two different questions. One, can someone be subjected to the jurisdiction of a court when he's not participating in the -- in the process there? And that happens all the time when people are prosecuted in another jurisdiction. There's a separate question of -- of what procedural protections would be afforded in such a trial, and that's where the Indian Civil Rights Act steps in.",
  "That's -- that's correct. In fact, it's a necessary -- he has to accept the validity of his -- of his prior prosecution and -- and leave it standing in order to --",
  "Right. That -- that's correct.",
  "Well, there -- there's I think another important point to be made about the nature of Congress' powers in this area. To say that an Indian tribe could only prosecute a non-member -- a non-member Indian through the exercise of delegated Federal power would itself be a -- a substantial constitutional anomaly. I think it's important to -- to consider the scope of Congress' plenary powers within the framework of the structure of the Constitution itself. The --",
  "No, I -- I --",
  "I did not -- I did not mean to say -- to say that. I mean, first of all, I think Oliphant contemplates that. What rights would attach is -- is a separate question. But I -- but I do think that there is a distinct authority for Congress to regulate or to permit a tribe to exercise jurisdiction over members of other tribes. This is a power that has historically been left to tribes by the Federal statutory regime in Indian country since 1817 down to the present time. There is still an exception --",
  "But -- no. That has continued up to the present time. There is still an exception in the statutory regime for tribes to --",
  "I -- I believe it is. In -- in Duro itself, the Court said that citizenship does not detract from Congress' plenary power over Indian affairs. The -- the last point I wanted to make and then I would like to reserve the --",
  "No. Here we're talking about -- this case involves non-member Indians, and as I said, the ability of Congress to regulate relationships between tribes and -- and their members would seem to be at the core of the power. And as this Court has said in its federalism cases, it would be a -- a mixing of sovereignty to regard the States as mere agents of the Federal Government. They are separate sovereigns, and we think the same is true --",
  "That's --",
  "But again, in our -- in our view, the dependency describes Congress' power to regulate and limit and prescribe the rights available in tribal courts. If I may reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The first point I'd like to make is that this case only involves the question of whether Congress can authorize tribes to exercise jurisdiction over Indians who are members of other tribes or affiliated with other tribes, not non-member Indians. And that -- that point is significant because it calls into -- into play additional powers that Congress has in this area particularly defining the attributes of membership in a tribe. Congress has -- among those attributes are the eligibility for special benefits, educational benefits, health benefits, housing benefits. So someone from another tribe --",
  "I -- I think -- I think it would -- yes, it would be. Someone always would have the -- the ability to disavow his -- his Indian affiliation. I think that would be an important part of it. But -- so what Congress has done here is simply to identify another attribute of membership or affiliation with a tribe, which is that if you're on another tribe's reservation, you will be subject to that tribe's criminal jurisdiction. And that is important to law and order on many reservations, as Congress itself realized when it enacted this statute in 1991.",
  "No. He could not -- I -- I think he -- as long as he was affiliated at the time of the conduct, I think -- I think the -- the consequences would -- would flow from that.",
  "No. I -- I think -- I think Congress at least under the Necessary and Proper Clause could allow a tribe to maintain jurisdiction over something that happened while the person was tribally affiliated. The -- another fundamental point is the one that Justice Breyer mentioned is that there is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits, the places a limit in this situation on Congress' exercise of its plenary power over Indian affairs. And in fact, there's much in the Constitution that points to the contrary. The Constitution refers to the Indian tribes, and as this Court has said, that reference to tribes and to the treaty-making power recognizes tribes as sovereigns, not simply voluntary organizations, but in the Constitution itself recognizes them as sovereigns. And the Court has said that because of those powers and implicit from that is the power of Congress to exercise protective authority over Indian tribes. And here that protection includes protection of tribal -- tribes from crimes committed by other tribal members. In solving this serious law enforcement problem, Congress was entitled to be guided by the Constitution itself which recognizes the tribes as sovereign and to vest authority in them as sovereign rather than act in derogation of the Constitution by deeming the tribes to be agents of the Federal Government when a tribal prosecutor is bringing a prosecution under tribal law in -- in tribal court. And Congress could rationally reach this conclusion for another important reason, and that is the lesson in history. History is very important in Indian affairs, and Congress throughout history, since 1817 under a jurisdictional regime that remains in effect, has left to tribes the power to exercise jurisdiction over members of other tribes, as this Court said in United States v. Rodgers where it construed the Indian against Indian exception as intended to allow tribe matters not -- and it expressly said, not only with -- with their own tribe but other tribes, to be left to the tribe.",
  "A title 18 offense?",
  "I -- I think that --",
  "That -- that would -- that -- that might present a -- a separate problem, but if the -- because there -- it might be the same offense.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals held that respondents could bring this suit under the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge the Bureau of Land Management's ongoing management of vast tracts of public land in Utah divorced from any specifically identifiable agency action that BLM had taken or that BLM was obligated to take but had not. The court of appeals relied on section 706(1) of the APA which authorizes a court to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed. The court of appeals decision is contrary to the text of 706(1) which is limited to compelling agency action, not ongoing agency conduct. It is contrary to the roots of 706(1) in mandamus, which has historically been limited to the performance -- compelling the performance of what this Court termed in its seminal Kendall decision precise and definite acts. It is contrary to the APA's generally applicable limitation of judicial review to final agency action, not the sort of evaluation and planning activities at issue here.",

The plan itself was final agency action, but the Court said it was not ripe for judicial review because it did not have any immediate consequences on the behavior -- behavior of persons. But the court of appeals in this case allowed 706(1) to be used to compel certain conduct that is certainly not -- probably not even agency action, but certainly not final agency action, for example, monitoring. Some of these plans contemplated that -- that BLM personnel would -- would go out and monitor various activities, not surprisingly in -- in the vast tracts of land, and the court said that that could be compelled under 706(1).",
  "It --",
  "No. Well, the -- the latter one you mentioned, the -- is -- is the monitoring activity that I was -- that I was referring to. And there -- there -- the -- the land management plan -- or excuse me -- a -­ an off-road vehicle plan for the Henry Mountain area identified a particular area as something -- an -- an area of possible concern that BLM was expected to monitor.

The court of appeals relied on a statutory provision. And that statutory provision is inapplicable here. What that statutory provision means is that any future site-specific activities that BLM authorizes have to be consistent with general standards in the plan, but it -- but it does -- in other words, the standards set the outer boundaries for what will happen in the future.",

  "No. With respect to monitoring -­",

With respect to monitoring, yes, but if they obligated themselves to, say, within -- within 1 year we shall issue an order closing the back 40,000 acres to off-road vehicle use and we intend that to be a binding obligation, enforceable by private parties, that would be enforceable because the order closing the area would be final agency action.

  "Because monitoring itself is not final agency action. It has no -- it carries no legal consequences.",

And if I could call the Court's attention to page 159 of the joint appendix which sets out the relevant portion of the San Rafael land management plan, at the top of page 159 it describes -- there's a heading to a chart that then follows. And that heading is Management Objective. And then there's table 19 which sets -- which is entitled Anticipated Implementation and Monitoring of Plan Decisions. And then it lists a number of pages of management objectives that BLM intends to carry out. And the particular one at issue here is on page 162 about halfway down the page, rather cryptically referring to apply ORV designations, document through an ORV implementation plan. Within 1 year is the schedule. That is not the sort of itemization that could be thought to give rise to a legally binding duty.

It would a traditional view of agency action. The defect -- a principal defect in this case is that the plaintiffs have asked and the Tenth Circuit has ordered the district court in the first instance to hold a trial about general activities on the ground not divorced -- not -- not tied to any specific agency action or decision based on an administrative record.

They could go into court and say that a -- that the denial of a -- of our request to close the area entirely will -- will cause the agency not to meet that legal standard. Now, if there was not already an order that had been issued, as there was there, then what -- then the proper procedure would be for the parties to present their request to the agency in the first instance so that the agency can pass on the question of whether to close it or not.",

And then finally the logic of 706(2), as we explain in the Attorney General's memorandum, which this Court has given deference to, particularly the Safeway Stores case, explains that the authority of a court to compel an agency to get on with it and to issue final agency action is essentially derivative of its ultimate authority to review the final agency action when it's issued on the basis of the record.

  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. We think that this case is really controlled by Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, which really was the mirror image of this case. It was a situation in which plaintiffs sought to challenge again conduct of BLM on a programmatic basis, saying that BLM, with respect to vast tracts of land, had not taken action that -- that the plaintiffs thought it should take. And this Court held that, no, such a suit must focus on not only agency action, discrete action, but final agency action, and you can't bring about wholesale change in an agency program under 706(2). It follows, we think, a fortiori under 706(1) that that cannot be done because 706(1) is essentially ancillary to 706(2). It is designed to require the agency to disgorge final agency action if it has a legal obligation to do it so that once that final agency action is issued, it can be reviewed under the central provision of the APA, section 706(2). 706(1) is limited to compelling that sort of action and putting the courts in the position where they can then review final agency action in the way the Administrative Procedure Act contemplates, which is on the basis of the agency's decision, the agency's finding of fact, its application of law and policy to fact and its rationale. So this is not just a matter of form. We think that the difference between the lawsuit that plaintiffs have brought and the lawsuit that the APA contemplates is critical to the relationship between agencies and courts under the APA and under the separation of powers under the Constitution. Plaintiffs' vision would put the courts in the position in the first instance of finding whether there's been compliance with the statutory standards. Our view and the way the APA requires is to submit a request for a particular order or regulation, let the agency act, and then review that discrete controversy. All three of the claims in this case that the plaintiffs have brought would reflect a radical departure from that view. The first is to compel compliance with a general statutory standard to manage lands in a particular way. Management is not agency action. It's like a program, which this Court said in Lujan could not be reviewed. The claim to require NEPA statements is independent, not tied to any proposed major Federal action. They're claiming an ongoing duty to update NEPA programs. And with respect to the land management program -- plans, no court has ever held since FLPMA was enacted and these plans have been utilized that they impose on BLM a duty owed to members of the public to comply with schedules, tentative, anticipated schedules, as this document says, of what will be carried out in the future. This is not just a question of standing and zone of interest which private people might be able to sue. It's more fundamental than that. These plans do not impose any duties owed to any member of the public because they are designed for internal management by the agency. We are in no way saying that what BLM does is beyond judicial review, but the plaintiffs are required to follow the right procedures.",

  "It -- what the -- what the respondents did not do was wait for BLM to respond, and in fact, in March of 2000, before the PI hearing was even held in this case, BLM issued a closure order that closed six out of those seven orders and left -- areas and left one of them open. And SUWA never challenged that. Justice O'Connor, you referred to pictures in the -- in the joint appendix. And it's important to bear in mind that those are pictures of areas outside the wilderness area that are open under the relevant land use plans to off-road vehicle usage. So there are no restrictions on their use there.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In February of 2001, an international arbitration panel, convened under the North American Free Trade Agreement, concluded that the United States' continuation of a blanket ban or a moratorium on the operation of Mexican domiciled commercial carriers beyond the border zone in the United States violated NAFTA. excuse me -- his intention to comply with the arbitration decision by invoking power specifically vested in him by Congress to lift the moratorium in order to comply with an international trade agreement. And the President in fact did lift the moratorium in November of 2002. In this case, the Ninth Circuit held that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, an agency in the Department of Transportation that is limited to a -- a safety mandate, was required to conduct an elaborate and complex environmental analysis of the President's foreign trade and foreign policy decision before it could enter or issue procedural safety regulations that were necessary to implement the President's decision. The Ninth Circuit set aside the procedural regulations on that ground and thereby prevented the agency from granting certification to carriers that under the President's decision were eligible to receive it. The Ninth Circuit's decision is incorrect and it has frustrated the President's ability to comply with Congress and the President, the two entities whose joint action brought about the lifting of the moratorium, are not subject to either NEPA or the provisions of the Clean Air Act that respondents rely on to require an environmental analysis. Accordingly, the agency acted entirely reasonably in choosing to take the President's action as a given, including any increased traffic or trade that might occur as a result of the President's decision and to, instead, focus its own environmental analysis on the effects of its own procedural regulations. FMCA's government -- governing statute requires it to grant registration to any carrier that is willing and able to comply with applicable safety, safety fitness, and financial responsibility requirements. The agency has no authority to deny operating permission to a carrier, foreign or domestic, based on environmental concerns or foreign trade concerns. It has no authority to countermand the President's decision or to refuse to issue the regulations that were necessary to implement the President's decision.",
  "There was. And -- and soon thereafter, the -- the moratorium was imposed in 1982 originally, but it conferred on the President the power to lift the moratorium, and an agreement was arrived at soon thereafter with Canada. So since the early '80's, enter. retained in effect by the President through subsequent actions into the '90's. In the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States included a reservation to a complete opening of the border for transporter operations by carriers subject to a phase-out, initially a phase-out that would allow carriers from Mexico to operate in any of the border States -- that was 3 years after the agreement was signed -- and then by the year 2000, to allow the carriers to operate anywhere in the United States. The President decided not to go forward with that because of concerns about whether the safety regulatory regime in Mexico was sufficient to prepare the Mexican carriers to come into the United States. So that is the reason why it was held up. And -- and the basis of the NAFTA arbitration panel's decision was that a blanket prohibition on that ground was not -- was -- was not permissible under NAFTA and that the United States had to consider applications from Mexican carriers on a case-by-case basis. It could adopt special procedures to ensure that the carriers who would be permitted to come in under the President's lifting of the moratorium would satisfy the substantive safety standards. And that is the set of regulations that are at issue here. But it's important to recognize that these are not substantive safety standards. The substance -- the standards that -- that Mexican carriers, like -- like other foreign and domestic carriers in the United States have to comply with, are -- have already been in place. All that we are talking about here are essentially procedural or administrative regulations.",

  "That's correct.",
  "That's -- that's correct. It's part of the context in which the agency is operating, but it would be presumptuous of the agency to take upon itself a -- a determination to evaluate or to second guess effectively the President's determination.",
  "Two things I'd like to say about that. The first one is that the -- that respondents' claim in this case and the Ninth Circuit's holding in this case are not premised on the sort of tinkering with the application and monitoring rules that -- that you may be referring to. The -- the premise of the Ninth Circuit's decision was that -- that the President's lifting of the moratorium was foreseeable and therefore FMCSA had to Mexican trucks should be permitted to come in at all.",
  "Right.",

It projected -- it projected increases in traffic or -- or increases in trade that might -- might result or discussed that. So that's really what the cumulative impact analysis requires is to -- for the agency to put its own action in context. But where the agency's own action is marginal, which is the case here, it can be expected -- these are basically administrative undertakings by the agency, application forms, and -- and on-site inspections. That contribute so marginally to environmental impacts, the rule -- the general rule of reason under -- under NEPA does not require an agency to, for -- for example, conduct a -- a nationwide study of Clean Air Act possible effects of Mexican trucks in order to determine that its own contribution is going to be minimal. And -- and what -- what -- as I mentioned, the agency's contribution here arises simply from developing an application form, a -- a preapproval analysis, on-site analysis, of -- of the carrier in Mexico in most cases, or inspections. And the only real contribution to emissions that any of that would have are the -- are the roadside inspections where the engine might be -- will be idling a little bit while the truck is inspected and the agency fully evaluated its contribution to increased emissions for that and concluded that they would be negligible, looked at in that way.

  "I don't know that this Court has ever specifically addressed it, but I think that's been the common understanding. And I think it follows in this case from the exemption of the President from -- from NEPA at all. And the -- I -- I mentioned before that section 350 serves to confine the agency's discretion here. And assessment was all that was necessary and a full-blown environmental impact statement was not required is reinforced in this case by the -- by decisions of a number of courts of appeals that have said that where an agency does not have discretion, it does not have to prepare an environmental impact statement because the purposes of NEPA are really to inform the agency's own decision-making process and to inform the public so it can participate in the agency's decision-making process. Where the agency essentially has no discretion about whether to -- to go forward, as the agency here did not, then to require a full-blown environmental impact statement of -- of clean air issues, which are exceedingly complex, before the agency would go -- could go forward would not further the purposes of -- of NEPA and would only serve, in fact, to slow down the process of complying with NAFTA.",
  "Yes, yes. NEPA imposes no substantive requirement. But -- but in this case there was really a need for expedition, and it's -- and that's -- that's made evident here by the fact that the statute that authorized the President to lift the moratorium provided for the President to give notice and allow public comment for that, but allowed him to waive that where expeditious action was required. And when the President looked at the moratorium in November of 2002, he specifically invoked that provision, dispensed with further opportunity for public comment because he determined that expeditious action was required. It's very much like this Court's decision in although here it's a subordinate Federal agency rather than a State, but the result is to interfere with the ability of the President to respond promptly to an international disagreement that had arisen out of a foreign trade agreement. I did want to spend just a moment on the Clean conclusion on that we think follows directly from the conclusion on NEPA. promulgated in 1993, respondent doesn't challenge them here, and the D.C.

But even so, we can -- we can mitigate that tiny impact, and it's in that context where the agency says, we can try to screen out the dirtier trucks. And there's a reference to environment. It's unclear what it means, but I think two pages later the court identifies that there could be leaks from a truck that would be identified during an inspection they could turn over to environmental people from the State. So it's focused on a very narrow question, whether -- whether the inspections would -- would increase the emissions.

If it were otherwise, the integrity of the Nation's borders and its security would be at the mercy of a foreign power who might choose to foist aliens onto our country or to the self-help efforts of aliens who might leave another country coming to our shores.

  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Souter, you're exactly right in terms of why the statutory construction or statutory application of the terms in Zadvydas does not control here. The Court's starting point -- again back to page 682 of its opinion, it says, we deal here with aliens who were admitted. The way the Court dealt in the opinion was a matter of statutory construction, and it did it by reading into the statute a reasonable time limitation. What is reasonable for aliens who -- who have been admitted and are subject to what were called deportation is different from aliens who were stopped at the border. And in fact, in the -- in the Court's statutory analysis, it looked to the point that in the Witkovitz jurisdictional statement referring to Congress' constitutional doubts about detention of more than 6 months, those were constitutional doubts about people who were being deported after having been allowed to be here. There has never -­",
  "It -- with respect -- with respect, it has not. And -- and if I could -- if I could explain this. This -- going back to Mezei, this Court held and in fact rejected a very similar argument. The rationale of the court of appeals in Mezei was that deportable aliens are subject to an express, not an implied, 6-month limitation. And the court of appeals said the aliens in that -- the alien in that case, once he couldn't be removed to another country, should be released because the purpose of keeping him to return him to another country was no longer being served. This Court rejected that argument, even though there was a statutory express limitation of 6 months for deportable aliens, held that an alien who had been on Ellis Island for 2 years did not have to be released. In reliance on that decision, Congress passed the parole statute to leave the release in -- excuse me -­ Mezei was after it, but the -- the executive branch has relied on that rationale. The Cuban review regulations that are at issue here have been in place for 15 years under the parole statute. As Congress well knew, when it acted in 1996, the -- this program was the subject of many hearings in Congress. There were cases -- the Barrera case out of the Ninth Circuit sustained a 10-year detention of a Mariel Cuban. It is implausible to believe in 1996, when Congress enacted IIRIRA, that it intended to cut back on the longstanding power of the executive branch to prevent hordes of aliens from coming into our country and to impose an arbitrary 6-month limitation. I -- I think there's no argument that if an alien is detained before removal proceedings are begun, that there is no 6-month limitation. His release is entirely up to the Attorney General under the parole regulations. It's -- it's implausible to believe that once Congress actually enters a formal order of exclusion or now removal against an alien, the person is no longer in an ambiguous situation, the executive branch says you're not eligible, that suddenly that person who has been formerly found not eligible, would be subject to a 6­ month limitation that did not apply up until '96 and doesn't even apply until these -- to these aliens until removal proceedings have been begun. So the right way to look at this statute as what's a reasonable time under 1231(a)(6) has to take into account that historic background of the United States being able to protect its borders. And there is no indication whatsoever that Congress intended to overrule this longstanding program for Mariel Cubans, which has operated, as I said, for 15 years.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted the Beef Promotion and Research Act in 1985 in the midst of a serious depression in the beef industry. The beef industry found itself unable to respond to that situation through the promotion of its products. Congress responded to that situation by establishing a government program of promotion, research, and consumer information. In the Beef Act, Congress prescribed the central message for advertising under the Act, Congress established a government body, the Beef Board, to administer and implement the program, and it placed the program under the control of a Cabinet officer, the Secretary of Agriculture.",

But the important point about what you've just asked is that any concerns about the tag line in the advertising does not go to the constitutionality of the statute or the beef order.

  "Thank you, Justice Stevens. Mr. Tribe has conceded that if this program were financed by a system of excise taxes that went into the general Treasury, and Congress then paid -- provided the exact same amount of money to produce the exact same ads, that there would be no constitutional problem. And, in our view, the First Amendment simply does not regulate the details of government fundraising, the details of government accounting, and the details of government bookkeeping in that manner. The First Amendment is -­",
  "Right, and -­",
  "Right, and the Court -- the Court superceded those decisions in cases like Carmichael Coal and Storaasli Company and cases like that, where the Court said excise taxes can be imposed. As long as there is a public welfare justification, they can be spent. And it would be an odd result to have the First Amendment drive the way the government arranges a system like this. After all -- and Professor Tribe said it would be different if the cattlemen's Beef Board were gotten rid of. It actually -- the principal point here is the Secretary controls the speech. Whatever the cattlemen's Beef Board does -- and that is a government entity -- the Secretary controls the speech. So that -- this is not some jury- rigged system; this is a system of governmental control. Congress has prescribed the message, and the Secretary carries it out. It's important to recall that many federal excise taxes go into dedicated trust funds -- for highways, for other functions like that. And out of that dedicated trust fund, there may be money expended on highway safety. So the fact that it's dedicated really should not matter. And this case is completely different from cases like Keller. In Keller, the state bar was not appointed by the -- by the government, there was no governmental supervision of what it did, and the government certainly did not approve the messages in favor of nuclear freezes, et cetera. This is different in all the critical ways that make this a program of government speech. And, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, to strike down this program would have drastic consequences. There are many, many agricultural promotion programs like this. There are 13 at the national level. This program has been in existence since 1988. One billion dollars has been collected, and promotions have been conducted under it. These promotional programs go back to the '50s, and even -- and even earlier. And there are many programs on the state levels, as the amicus brief filed by the states in this case shows. This Court would be striking down a lot to hold that this commonsense way of approaching things is unconstitutional. It's also important to recognize that the ultimate beneficiary of the advertising is the consumer. Yes, it affects the industry, but it's the consumer. And the very first finding that Congress made in the Beef Act is, beef and beef products are basic foods that are a valuable part of the human diet. When the -- when the -­ because of the collective-action problem in this industry, that it cannot organize to advertise, that basic message is not getting to consumers. So this -- the justifications for this, to the extent one thinks of it in terms of the commercial speech, it is squarely within the ultimate purposes of the commerce speech doctrine, which is to correctly market failure with respect to advertising in order to get information to consumers.",
  "Justice O'Connor, and may it please the Court: The reasons why this Court has applied the rational basis standard to review economic legislation of the sort involved here go to the heart of the role of courts in our democratic society. Legislatures, not courts, are elected to enact the laws, and courts, therefore, do not substitute their judgment for the economic wisdom of legislation for that of the legislature. And courts typically lack the fact-finding ability and expertise of legislatures, especially to make the sort of predictive judgments that the Ninth Circuit relied upon in this case. These fundamental principles about the role of courts in our society would be greatly undermined if a plaintiff could simply -- could obtain heightened scrutiny of legislation by simply recasting his claim as a takings claim. And therefore, it's not surprising that this notion doesn't find support in the Just Compensation Clause. When the government affirmatively exercises the power of eminent domain to take property, the requirement that compensation be paid doesn't rest on the proposition that the legislation is ineffective. To the contrary, the taking presupposes that the -- that the action will -- will further a legitimate governmental purpose or at least that the legislature could have rationally so concluded. Any inquiry into the legitimacy of the governmental purpose or whether it will be served, instead, arises under the Public Use Clause, not whether there is a taking. And if those purposes are not served or the legislature could not rationally so conclude, it is not a public use and it's invalid and it should be enjoined, the consequences not to trigger the payment of -- of compensation. And the -- the same analytical approach applies for regulatory takings. In deciding whether there is a regulatory taking, this Court has developed tests to look to see whether the nature of the government's restrictions are essentially the functional equivalent of the exercise of the power of eminent domain or appropriation. And that -- that the Court has done by looking principally at the impact on the property owner, not the rationality of what the legislature has done. That has not been part of it. For example, in the Lucas case, the -- the test for finding a taking is whether all economic value has been destroyed. Or in the physical appropriation cases, the Court has said that's such a fundamental interference burden on the landowner that there is a per se taking. And similarly under the Penn Central test, the central inquiry is on the economic impact and the interference with investment-backed expectations, things that look to the impact on the -- on the landowner.",
  "That's -- that's correct, although I -- although I should say --",
  "Right. No. That -- that's correct. And I think that's -- that's the difference. If something doesn't -- if the legislature couldn't rationally conclude that -- that the measure will -- will serve a legitimate governmental purpose, it's invalid and -- and therefore not a taking. It's improper governmental action.",
  "Well, in -- in fact, the point you made that it has not actually affected the outcome I think is an important consideration for this Court. And -- and now that the Court is focusing on the question of whether this really does logically fit into the Just Compensation Clause jurisprudence, I -- I think it -- I think it's important to consider that the Court has not actually ever struck down a measure under the Just Compensation Clause outside the exactions situation which present the different consequence of -- of a physical appropriation. The Court has not ever actually struck down a statute on -- on that basis. But with respect to that language, it -- it arose in Agins. There was a little bit of discussion along those lines in Penn Central, but in Agins, which most people see as -- as the origin of it, the Court, as was pointed out, relied upon Village of Euclid and upon Nectow, both of which were due process cases and both of which applied a rational basis test. And in fact, on pages 24 and 25 of our brief, we set out the quotations from Nectow and Euclid which show that the Court -- the Court there was using the notion of whether the measure will -- will further a substantial or has a substantial relation to the public health, really in contradistinction to something that is irrational.",
  "Excuse me?",
  "Moore?",
  "Right. Well, cases -- cases involving the -- the family unit I think -- I mean, those are -- those go beyond simply the question of the -- of regulating property. Those -- those get into -- those get into questions of -- of who's occupying -- who's occupying the house. But -- but in Village of Belle Terre, the -- the Court applied a rational basis test to the --",
  "No, not the number -- not the number of people.",
  "That case concerned --",
  "-- a family, the -- the question of interfering -- possible interference with a family unit. But in Village of Belle Terre, the Court applied a -- a rational basis test to a zoning ordinance that regulated unrelated people living in -- living in the same house. So the phrase, substantially advance, while it may have that ring to it, in fact its origins, when you look at page 25 of our brief, the -- the Court in Nectow explained the test as being a -- a court may not set aside the determination of public officers unless it's clear that it has no foundation in reason and is a mere arbitrary or irrational exercise, having no substantial relation to the public health. The Court was --",
  "Yes. I'm sorry. I misunderstood, if that was the question. We think it definitely should be eliminated, and the -- and the Court should say that it is applying the rational basis test. And I think it's instructive in the -- in the post-Agins era to look at the Keystone decision, both the dissent and the majority in that case. It was -- the Court was essentially unanimous that the -- that the taking provision of a clause does not authorize an inquiry into the efficacy of legislation. And in fact, on that point, the dissent quoted this Court's decision in Midkiff.",
  "Well, I -- yes, this -- this --",
  "But the Court applied a rational basis test in Pennell under the Due Process Clause and it would be odd to apply a -- a higher test. I mean, it would be a different question if there was a claim of -- of confiscation of the property, but Chevron has stipulated that it could not make out a taking claim on the basis of -- of its economic impact. So we're talking about a standalone inquiry into the efficacy of the legislation.",
  "Yes. Now I -- and that was the point --",
  "Right. No. I -- I didn't mean to say that -- that it should --",
  "-- be a rational basis test and therefore the Court would conclude it was a taking. In -- in the regulatory area, if the court -- if a taking is not made out on the basis of economic impact under -- under Penn Central or one of those tests, there's no taking. You don't get to the public use requirement then because that only kicks in if there is a taking. So it's the due process rational basis test that -- that would apply. And -- and as I said, I think Keystone, with -- with respect to applying a rational basis test on the efficacy question is -- is dispositive on that -- on that question. Now, the -- the Court did say you can look at the character of the governmental action, what -- what the government is doing as part of the Penn Central test, but not this sort of means-end efficacy question. And we do think it would be appropriate for the Court to jettison that. I would point out that throughout the course of history, the Court has sometimes used takings and due process kind of interchangeably. And we -- we quote, for example, the -- this Court's Rowan decision which refers to the plaintiff's constitutional claim as saying that the regulatory action violates the Fifth Amendment because it constitutes a taking without due process of law. I think sometimes the Court has used or parties have used those terms interchangeably, and that may well be what the Court was doing in Agins. And I think if you look at Penn Central where that phraseology was -- was used, the same is true where the Court was -- was relying upon the due process part of Goldblatt, and the Court put the word taking in -- in quotes, I think perhaps indicating that it was not looking at a literal taking.",

But, beyond that, just because -- if the Court concludes that the incidence of the tax is on the distributor, notwithstanding the Kansas Supreme Court's decision, the subject matter of the tax, the \"what is being taxed,\" is the sale or distribution, and that is a sale between the distributor and the retailer.

The court of appeals was wrong. RFRA carries forward the compelling- interest test, as set forth in prior Federal court decisions.",
  "Yes, a preliminary injunction.",

  "Well -­",
  "-- first of all, our principal submission is that Congress's designation in Schedule 1 is sufficient unto itself. But we also do include a further submission that, if the Court didn't disagree with that, that Congress's -- Congress, in Schedule 1, has said that any mixture containing any amount of a listed hallucinogenic substance is barred. And there's no question that this substance contains that. But if the Court was going to look beyond that to the facts of this case, there's also no question in this case that respondents' use of the substance produces the very effects that led Congress to put the substance on Schedule 1. So, to allow the -- to allow the substance to be used would be in direct derogation of Congress's judgment. The disagreement, such as there is, goes not to the -- not to that question. And that's on page 214(a) of the joint appendix -- or the petition appendix. The District Court specifically found that those effects are produced. Respondents' argument in the lower courts was essentially that those effects shouldn't matter, or that those effects should be ignored. But we think that that's inconsistent with Congress's judgment. So, my point is, if you go beyond the text of the statute, it shouldn't be for anything more than to -- for the Court to assure itself that the effects that caused Congress to list the subject, in fact, occur, and -­",

  "Well, the argument is not that the Controlled Substances Act is not subject to RFRA. It is subject to RFRA. But -- just as it was subject to the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause -- and, in this Court's pre-Smith cases, in which the Court -- at least Congress understood the Court to have been applying a compelling-interest test, the Court was applying that compelling-interest test to particular statutes under which individualized religious exemptions would not be feasible, and held, as a categorical matter, that they were not required. The Social Security Act, the tax code, the laws against polygamy, the Sunday closing laws, all are -- all of those are ones in which the Court had previously concluded that individualized exceptions were not appropriate.",

And even then, it is done to very strict -- pursuant to very strict controls that are really incompatible with sacramental use of a substance. There is a requirement of prescription, or dispensing by a physician under physician control, with recordkeeping -- identifying the dosage, the amount of the sacrament -- recordkeeping of the person who takes it. There is -- there is an incompatibility and potential entanglement problem in how to -- in trying to apply a system like that, even under Schedule 2.

  "Well, if I could go back to the way the Controlled Substances Act operates, it does not permit a rescheduling or use of a drug based on individualized determinations made by individual Federal District Courts making their own judgment about how serious the risk is. If a substance is going to be moved from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2, for example, to allow medical use, that is done through a centralized administrative determination involving coordination between the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General, in which expert opinions are gotten and a judgment is made, but the judgment is made only if there is an accepted medical use.

  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Respondent alleges in this Bivens action that petitioners, who were postal inspectors, caused him to be prosecuted in retaliation for activity protected by the First Amendment. In order to make out such a claim, however, respondent must establish that there was no probable cause for the prosecution. That is so for three mutually reinforcing reasons. First, that requirement accords with the deference this Court has consistently held in Armstrong and other cases must be given to the prosecutorial function because that function is core to the executive branch's operations and because prosecutorial decision- making is ill-suited to judicial second guessing. Second, that rule accords a -- an important objective screen and check against claims of retaliatory prosecution in order to guard against the chilling effect that would otherwise routinely arise from inquiry into the subjective motivations of those involved in the prosecutorial decisionmaking process. And third, that rule is deeply rooted in history. A claim of First Amendment retaliatory prosecution is but one species of a claim of malicious prosecution, and it has long been required that an essential element of a claim of malicious prosecution is that the plaintiff show an absence of probable cause for the prosecution.",
  "Well, I -- for several reasons. First of all, the -- the First Amendment -- the alleged First Amendment retaliation describes the malice, a form of the malice that would arise in --",
  "Well, to be sure, what renders it malice or wrongful is the First Amendment, but -- but the derivation of -- of the reason for why it's wrongful does not, I think, detract from the essential relevance of the tort of malicious prosecution. And if -- if I may add to that, the -- the reason why the -- the tort of malicious prosecution is highly relevant here is not simply because on the malice side of it, but also because it has long been recognized, beginning with Blackstone before the First Amendment and the Constitution were even adopted, that there are critical interests on the other side, not simply the defendant's interest in avoiding badly motivated prosecutions, but the important countervailing public interest of ensuring that wrongdoers are brought to justice and that those who have information about it will come forward. And -- and that was recognized by Blackstone early on and has been recognized consistent -- consistently by this Court in -- in many, many decisions, including recent cases of this Court involving immunity issues, which is what we have here, specifically recognizing that the tort of malicious prosecution is very instructive in deciding how rules should be applied when a Bivens action or a 1983 action is brought in the specific context of prosecution.",
  "Well, in -- in terms -- in terms of the responsibilities of the prosecutor, there --",
  "-- that -- that should not -- that should not be a -- a selection criterion in itself, but it --",
  "Well, I -- I would think ordinarily yes, but with this caveat. Unlike race which is never relevant to the prosecutorial decision- making process, there can often be a prosecution -- and this case is one of them -- in which you might have claims of public corruption. And -- and in fact, there was a guilty plea here on the part of a member of the Postal Service board of directors for receiving payments to -- for his activity on behalf of respondent's corporation and others. This -- this -- involving contracts for $250 million. This was a very, very important procurement by the Post Office Department and it is understandable that in connection with that prosecution, the prosecutors and the Postal Service investigators would look into issues of respondent's, or people in his behalf, approaching the Government.",
  "Well, there -- there are certain restrictions -- certainly restrictions on what the prosecutor may do, but several points about that. First of all, this is not a Bivens action against the prosecutor. The prosecutor is absolutely immune from suit. The prosecutor's decision-making process is -- is, in fact, as is the grand jury's, a -- a critical protection against malicious prosecution --",
  "Well, the -- the question is whether in that circumstance the -- the Bivens plaintiff, the criminal defendant, has a First Amendment right to be excused from prosecution or, after the prosecution is unsuccessful, to bring a civil action, whether he has a right not to have been prosecuted in those circumstances notwithstanding the existence of probable cause and the independent judgment by the prosecutor.",
  "He does -- he does not have a -- he does not have a First Amendment claim in those circumstances where there is probable cause for the violation. The --",
  "He does not have a First Amendment right not to be singled out in those circumstances.",
  "I would not. I -- I'm not -- I'm not endorsing the motivation. What I'm -- what I'm saying is what is --",
  "Right. I -- I'm not disputing that it -- that -- that a -- a prosecution should not be brought or should not be heard --",
  "I -- it is -- we certainly disagree with that with our proposition.",
  "For -- for purposes of our probable -- probable cause claim, yes.",
  "That -- that is true, but that, of course, was also true at common law for -- for malicious prosecution.",
  "At common law -- at common law, yes. As this Court has recognized in reformulating the common law principles of -- of immunity, the -- the public prosecutor now has absolute immunity under -- under these --",
  "-- under these Court's -- under this Court's decisions. But at common law, the prosecutor did have the protection of malicious prosecution, and as Justice Scalia observed in his concurring opinion in the Kalina decision, the elements of the tort of prosecution essentially had a built-in qualified immunity, and the probable cause requirement was essentially that. It afforded protection for the prosecutor. The -- the private citizen who -- who -- the complaining witness -- he could not be the subject of a suit for damages if -- if the charges were dismissed, not simply upon a showing -- it required more than simply a showing of malice. It required a showing of an absence of probable cause for reasons that are essentially identical to the qualified immunity and absolute immunity -- the -- the reasons for qualified and absolute immunity.",
  "But -- but on -- on the -- on the governmental interest side of the balance, the interests are exactly the same in both -- in both circumstances. And that is not to chill -- not -- not to create circumstances where people would hold back from coming forward with information of violations of the law because of fear that they would be sued and retaliated against afterward. And that hasn't changed now that we have public prosecutors. It's still critical.",
  "Well, at -- at common law on the tort of malicious prosecution, the indictment created a presumption because an indictment does have to depend upon probable cause, and under the -- under this Court's decision in Gerstein v. Pugh and other decisions, that can't be reexamined by the court in the prosecution. But at common law, the -- the indictment created a presumption that was subject to rebuttal by the -- by the civil plaintiff. There was some disagreement about what would be necessary, whether you would have to show fraud on the grand jury or whether you could just retry --",
  "Yes. We do not -- we do not think that the existence of the grand -- it has not been our position that the existence of the indictment is dispositive and cannot be challenged, but we do think it --",
  "We -- we think in a -- in a -- it would have to show by at least a preponderance of the evidence, maybe a clear showing, that there was not probable cause. And I think that also ties in to the -- to the standard for qualified immunity, which is could a reasonable person in those circumstances have believed that there was probable cause. I think, if the grand jury returns an indictment, that that should be pretty persuasive evidence but not compelling evidence -- I mean, not dispositive evidence that there was probable cause.",
  "Yes, clear evidence, and the Court stressed that it was a --",
  "Well, I -- I think several things may explain that. In Armstrong, that was a claim of selective prosecution that was brought --",
  "Based on race. That was one of the distinctions I was going to point to. And secondly --",
  "Well, as -- as this Court's decision in -- in Johnson, for example, shows, there -- distinctions based on race are subject to strict scrutiny no matter what the context, in that case even in the prison context, whereas First Amendment claims often take account of the context in which they are raised. For example, this Court in the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination case held that there would -- could be no claim at all of selective prosecution in the immigration context because of the important countervailing interest in enforcing the law.",
  "No.",
  "Well, no. The -- the other distinction -- and -- and I'm not sure if this goes to your point or not. The other distinction is that in Armstrong the claim was made in the criminal prosecution itself. Here, the claim is the civil action after the criminal prosecution is over with, and it's in that -- in that context especially that the analogy to malicious prosecution is very strong and why the element of -- that the person has to -- that the -- there has to have been a favorable termination for the -- for the plaintiff and there has to be a probable cause.",

  "Well, yes. I -- I am -- I am saying that --",
  "Oh -- oh, it does because the -- because the -- the first -- the existence of the First Amendment claim is what gives you the Bivens cause of action in the first place. So otherwise, there wouldn't be any Federal cause of action at all without -- without the First Amendment claim.",
  "No, because -- and -- and again, this -- this is -- this is because of the -- of the background of the common law tort of malicious prosecution, which strikes exactly the balance that I -- that I'm talking about.",
  "Well --",

  "No. My understanding from -- from reading the treatises on -- on malicious prosecution, for example, that there has been no watering down of the probable cause requirement because it is understood to be a critical check against --",

  "Yes.",

  "Yes. In -- in the summer of 1984, before there was even a consulting agreement, there was a series of conversations between Voss, the postal board -- board member, and respondent, including one for which there are notes in which Voss said I am working for you. There -- there was an -- there is an abundance of evidence involving Reedy who is -- no. I -- I know, but just in -- just in terms of -- just in terms of the sequence. There is evidence that Voss and Moore were good friends. Voss said that he had a close relationship with respondent, and when the contract was first being negotiated, Reedy acknowledged that Voss and Moore were good friends. They had a close relationship. They were not distant.",
  "Yes, although I -- I certainly do not want to leave the misimpression that -- and there is -- there is much more.",
  "That -- that -- you do not have -- you do not have to decide it, but I would certainly urge the Court not to proceed on the assumption or make any comments that there is because there were -- there were --",
  "Right, and that is their position. And that position accords -- yes, that is their position. And that accords no particular --",
  "What is very different is that this is the prosecutorial function. As this Court recognized in Armstrong, that is a core executive branch function and it is one that the courts are ill- suited to second-guess because a whole variety of determinations can enter into whether to prosecute somebody, whether they -- whether the particular conduct -- how culpable the person is, whether the conduct fits into the overall prosecutorial priorities, whether there will be cooperating witnesses, what -- what the office's resources are. There are a whole bunch of -- of judgments that courts are ill-suited to second-guess, and it would be very chilling if the prosecutor had to --",
  "Well -- oh, not -- we do not think there is strong evidence of retaliatory motive. And I -- I can -- can address that, but --",
  "-- but --",
  "We -- we think the more direct -- I don't think so for -- partly for the reason that I -- that I gave to Justice Breyer is that -- that that would not protect against discovery and -- and the sort of chilling inquiry that this Court has recognized in its immunity cases, and especially in the prosecutorial function where the prosecutor would be required to disclose. Even though the prosecutor is absolutely immune, the prosecutor's decision-making process and his communication with law enforcement agents would -- would be exposed for judicial scrutiny, public scrutiny in a way that could chill the prosecutorial function.",
  "Right.",
  "I don't think erroneous. It was allegedly maliciously motivated.",
  "I think that's a -- I think that's a very important point, and before a -- a court enters into that, in the end, unknowable question, maybe a court can -- can, in the end, determine probabilities, but before a court undertakes that, which requires looking not simply at the motivation of the -- of the law enforcement officers, but the prosecutor and -- and who knows whether the grand jury would have returned an indictment, and yet a court certainly couldn't be expected to inquire into that. Now, so we -- we think that that's another reason why the probable cause requirement is a critical gateway before a court is -- is going to enter into that determination. And all -- and it's important to remember it's not just proving the question of causation, but these are people who are several steps removed from the -- from the prosecutorial decision. And the -- and the personal liability would be visited on the law enforcement agents who were doing their job and cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office. This case was -- this case got attention at the highest levels of the U.S. Attorney's Office. The U.S. Attorney personally met with the -- the respondent -- lawyers for respondent.",
  "I -- I don't -- I don't think there's any reason to accept that because there's no factual determinations to that effect. There -- there are really just two snippets of evidence that are primarily relied upon by the court of appeals for the view that there was a retaliatory motive here. And they were -- they were really observations that the -- that the inspectors made to -- to show -- the first one was why the corporation should be indicted, not just -- not just Moore, but why the corporation should be indicted. And it was just an observation that the corporation, through its agents, was involved in a lot of activities and should be held accountable. It was not -- it was not evidence of a -- of a retaliatory motive, and there were subpoenas for -- for documents about political contributions. But let's remember that this was a case involving bribery of a public official, and it was -- it was understandable that the AUSA and the -- and the inspectors would -- would look to see whether there was money directed elsewhere. If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens. I'd like to respond to Justice Breyer's suggestion that this could all be solved by an application of the Harlow qualified immunity standard. With all respect, I don't think that that would really work at all because if -- if the point is that it would be unconstitutional to bring a prosecution only because of protected First Amendment activity, that could be taken as a given and still be enormous inquiry into what actually happened between the investigator and the prosecutor, what the real motivation was, what the prosecution's policies were. That is the concern we have for the post hoc inquiry into the process. And not only that, it isn't just the discovery. It's what -- what consequences this will have on law enforcement generally if police officers operate under the assumption that if the prosecution fails, they will be subject to civil liability, which is exactly what Blackstone said, as this Court quoted in Dinsman v. Wilkes. The reason for the rule is that it would be a very great discouragement to public justice if prosecutors, who have a tolerable ground of suspicion, were liable to be sued at law whenever their indictments miscarried.",
  "No, but -- but that included complaining witnesses. That -- that was what prosecutor meant at common -- at common law. And there's no reason to grope for some sort of screen because the common law furnishes it. The tort of malicious prosecution is what this Court relied upon in Heck v. Humphrey for the favorable termination rule, that you could not bring a 1983 suit unless the conviction had been set aside and the proceeding was terminated in favor of the plaintiff. That same tort, that tort of malicious prosecution, contains the probable cause requirement to guard against an objective screen, to guard against the very thing that Blackstone was worried about and that this Court noticed in -- in the Dinsman case. And that is, that it is important not to have law enforcement officers be chilled from the important function of furnishing information to prosecutors. And this Court's decision in Armstrong imposed an important objective test that you have to show that there's somebody similarly situated before you even inquire into prosecutorial motives. You have to show an objective factor that someone else was similarly situated. Respondent's position would offer no such -- no such protection.",
  "Because at -- at common law -- and I think this was an important insight. At common law, it was not even evidence of the absence of probable cause because a judgment of acquittal turns on the determination that a factfinder -- a reasonable fact finder could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had actually committed the crime. Probable cause is a very different standard, which is whether it would lead a reasonable, cautious, prudent person to believe that a crime had been committed. That is the --",
  "An acquittal does not --",
  "But -- but my -- my point was at common law, that the wisdom of the courts was that -- that that wasn't even evidence of a -- that should -- that -- that shouldn't allow the suit to go forward because it was a sufficient guard -- protection for the prosecutors.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Much of the work of public employees is performed by speaking or writing, and much of that work concerns matters of public interest. Under the Ninth Circuit's decision, public employees engaged in such work have at least a presumptive First Amendment right to perform their jobs as they see fit. That conclusion rests on a fundamentally mistaken view of the First Amendment. When the Government pays for somebody to do its work, it has an absolute right to control and direct the manner in which that work is performed. That is a basic rule of agency law, and insofar as Federal employees are structure. Article II of the Constitution gives the President the power and responsibility to take care that power, and effectuation of the principle of accountability that it embodies, requires that supervisors in the executive branch be able to control and direct the work of their subordinates. The First Amendment, which was adopted just a few years after the Constitution, was not meant to interpose the First Amendment in that relationship between supervisor and subordinate or otherwise to regulate the internal affairs of the executive branch. That is the function of civil service laws adopted by the legislature and internal executive branch directives taking into account the relative costs and benefits of certain types of regulation. And finally --",
  "Well, there would, no doubt, ethical rules. Under the Federal whistle-blower statute --",
  "-- there would --",
  "-- be a restriction.",
  "The First Amendment would not be the -- would not be the source of protection. Whether there would be some argument that, if the employee could not be fired, it would be an unconstitutional condition to require him to put his job at peril for committing a due process violation or something like that, whether there would be a claim like that, that would be a different matter. But the First Amendment --",
  "Because the First Amendment the performance of his duties.",
  "No. No, I was just suggesting there would have to be some unconstitutional condition. Well, the due process --",
  "My point is that the due process -- due process clause does address the conduct at question, which is the requirement that exculpatory material be turned over to the defendant. And so, the question is that the employee would be put in a position where he would -- where he would be instructed not to perform what he understood to be a constitutional violation. I think most civil service laws, most ethical rules, would take care of it. And, as I mentioned, the Federal whistle-blower statute, in 2302(b)(9), I think it is, has a provision that protects employees who refuse --",
  "-- to obey an order --",
  "I think that would be a huge problem, because it would effectively constitutionalize the day-to-day interactions between supervisors and subordinates within the Government, and put the Federal Courts in charge of overseeing that. Even if these cases might ultimately be disposed of on summary judgment, there would be discovery, there would be the where the -- where the Government is taking the position that the -- these actions were not even taken memorandum -- they say they had perfectly valid other reasons -- but this case exemplifies what the problem would be, is that the employee could identify something that he said or did in the course of his duties that involved speech and say, \"That's the reason that I was disciplined.\"",
  "Well, but in this case, if we look at what the Ninth Circuit said, for example, when it got to step two, it said that the employee could only be disciplined if the -- if the agency could show truth. But when somebody is actually carrying out his job duties --not engaged in outside activities that may duties themselves, the employer has a right to insist on more than that the employee not be disruptive or reckless; he has a right to insist that -- the employer has a right to insist that the employee affirmatively contribute to the work of the office and exercise good judgment. And the -- and the supervisor has to be in a position to make judgments about whether that judgment was good or not.",
  "I don't -- I don't think it -- I don't think it will, and certainly no more problems than the -- than this Court has wrestled with, and the lower courts have, in terms of what's a matter of public concern. I think it's a common inquiry to determine what a person's job duties are. And I think it's a very important place to have a clear line, just as there is a clear line with respect to matters of public concern.",
  "No, I think it would probably be inside the rule. I think -- I would think, particularly for a -- for an assistant DA to make a recommendation about the consequences of illegal conduct would be within his -- within his job duties. I also want to say that this Court's decision in Pickering, and in that line of cases, I think, fully support this, because, as this Court pointed out in Connick, this Court has repeatedly stated that the protection afforded by Pickering is for action taken as a citizen on matters of public concern. That \"as a citizen\" phrase was reiterated in virtually all of this Court's cases in the area. And the underlying principle is that --",
  "Yes. Yes, it does. But all the Court addressed in Givhan was the question of whether, if you take your concerns not publicly to the newspaper, but express them to the -- in that case, the protection. But the Court did not address the question of whether those comments were within the scope of the court's decision in Givhan indicates that they were not. She was an English teacher, and she was commenting to the principal about employment practices at the school. That would not have been within the scope of her employment. And then --",
  "I'm --",
  "It might be -- it might be closer to that, yes. I think, again, it would depend if she was -- if she was vice principal for administration or something, I think -- I think it clearly would. But the purpose of the Pickering line of cases is to protect employees when they go outside of their -- of their job, that they shouldn't be penalized for having taken a job to be able to participate in public affairs, as the Court put it in Pickering. That does not suggest that the -- that the employee brings the First Amendment into the job workplace and can use interactions with his supervisors, and to do so would constitutionalize, as I said, the day-to-day example, where somebody wrote a disposition memorandum in the course of --",
  "-- in the course of those activities.",
  "Well, if it's made publicly in the capacity as a citizen, assuming the public -- it isn't a speech that he's making in the course of his duties -- if he writes something to the press, he's speaking in his capacity as a citizen. That doesn't mean that it would be constitutionally protected; it simply means that you get to step two of the Pickering balancing, because he's not carrying --",
  "-- out the job duties.",
  "-- ordinarily in that --",
  "No, I mean --",
  "Two things about that. When he's saying it internally, he's doing his job. When he's going externally, he may be violating office policies.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In order for a State drug offense to be an aggravated felony under Section 1101(a)(43)(B) of the INA, two -- there are two requirements. The underlying conduct must be punishable under the Controlled Substances Act or one of the other specified Federal statutes, and it must be a felony. Because Petitioner's underlying conduct here was punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, and was a felony under State law, they are -- they were properly found to have committed aggravated felonies. That conclusion follows, not just from Section 924(c), but, more importantly, by the fact that what is relevant here is, What is the meaning of 1101(a)(43), which is the operative provision, which just happens to incorporate the definition of \"drug-trafficking crime\" from 924(c)? And there are three features of 1101(a)(43) with - -",
  "No. No. But -- no, but -- yes. No, it's --",
  "It's -- I'm sorry.",
  "It expressly incorporates it, yes. Yes. But the -- but the operative provision is section 1101(a)(43) of the INA, and there are three features of that that we think reinforce this conclusion. The first is that the consequences of aggravated felony status under the INA turn on whether one is convicted, not whether they have committed the crime, and that's true both with respect to the enhancement of sentences under 1326 and the -- and the immigration consequences. And we think it makes particular sense when you're talking about a conviction to look about how the -- to look at how the crime is treated under the jurisdiction of conviction.",
  "You do - -",
  "-- not need a conviction under Section 924 if you're bringing a prosecution under Section 924(c).",
  "You do not -- you do not need a conviction. But, in order -- the immigration consequences --",
  "-- have been --",
  "Right.",
  "No.",
  "Our point is not that 924(c) requires a conviction when it's in the Immigration Act, it's that the immigration consequences of that incorporation turn on whether someone was convicted of an aggravated felony.",
  "So --",
  "Well, the ground of deportation that refers to \"aggravated felony\" refers to someone who has been convicted of an aggravated felony. The ineligibility for cancellation of removal turns on whether someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony, and the enhanced penalties under Section 1326 for someone whose illegal reentry, following aggravated felony, is for a conviction for an aggravated felony. So, my point is that, under the INA, the consequences turn on conviction, and it makes sense to look at the jurisdiction of conviction -- here, State law -- to see whether it -- to look at the -- to determine the status of the crime. And since State law determines it to be a felony, that's the --",
  "-- proper place to look.",
  "No, we - -",
  "-- we think it does, for several reasons. First, with respect to the constitutional requirement, the uniformity provision applies to uniform rules of naturalization; that is, citizenship. This - - we're not talking about citizenship here, we're talking - - we're talking about the eligibility of aliens to remain in the country. Beyond that, even where the Uniformity Clause applies -- and there's, for example, a parallel Uniformity Clause for bankruptcy -- that's never been interpreted to mean that consequences of certain conduct under State law can have no impact on bankruptcy law, and that there can't be a variation. The State-law homestead exemption under the -- under the bankruptcy laws is a good example of that. But, going beyond that, with respect to the issue of uniformity generally, Congress has established uniform standards in Section 1101, either in terms of identifying the conduct in certain instances; in other instances, by identifying the minimum sentence that was actually imposed. In this case, we think, with respect to drug-trafficking crimes, it -- it's imposed a uniform standard, in terms of the length of the sentence; it has to be a felony. That's -- that is uniformity. But the -- to answer your point more directly, it is a principle throughout 1101(a)(43) that one looks to State law, not to -- not to a -- some supposed uniform standard of Federal law. And, for example, if you - - several subparagraphs -- and if you'll -- 1101(a)(43) is set out at page 12(a) of the appendix to our brief - - three subparagraphs -- (j), (q), and (t) -- refer to the sentence that may be imposed for a violation. Well, when you're talking about a State conviction, that's clearly referring to the sentence that may be imposed under State law for a conviction. Four other subparagraphs -- (f), (g), (r), and (s) -- turn on the sentence that was actually imposed. That means that -- in the case of a State crime, as we have here, that State law has to authorize the sentence, and that the State Court, applying State sentencing principles, has actually imposed a crime of -- for -- of at least 1 year. So, it is -- it is infused in Section 1101(a)(43) that, in fact, you do look to the consequences of an offense under State law.",
  "To my knowledge, we have not brought crime -- prosecutions under 924(c)(1), based on the circumstances you posit, but that's --",
  "-- but I don't think that that goes very far with respect to answering this question. For one thing, as this Court pointed out in the Gonzales decision, the requirement that there be a Federal crime, and, therefore, a Federal felony under 924(c)(2), comes from the language in 924(c)(1) that says that the crime must be subject to prosecution in a court of the United States. And this Court, in Gonzales, said it's that language that renders the -- renders it a requirement that it be a Federal crime. The definition of --",
  "It doesn't have to be --",
  "-- under 1101 --",
  "Right.",
  "Would have to - -",
  "-- in our view, it would have to constitute --",
  "-- it would have to be punishable under the Controlled Substances --",
  "-- Act.",
  "But the important point here is --",
  "But the question is not what 924(c)(2) means, standing alone or in the abstract; it's what it means, as incorporated into 1101(a)(43). And --",
  "-- there --",
  "Well, the Petitioner has conceded, as I understand it -- I heard Mr. Long, I think, concede -- that possession offenses can constitute aggravated felonies under this provision, that there is the recidivist possession, there is the possession of the date-rape drug, there is possession of 5 grams or more of cocaine. All of those are specified as being -- of being felonies under the -- under 940 -- or 844. But, beyond that, it's important to take into account that a lot of State statutes dealing with drugs do not -- are not patterned directly after the Federal statute, and there's no reason why Congress would have insisted that they do so in order for this statute to operate sensibly. And one notable example, for instance, is, when it comes to possession of a substantial amount of drugs, that that certainly would create a strong implication that the defendant was engaged in trafficking activities, or intended to. The Federal statute deals with that by making it a felony to possess with intent to distribute the drug. A number of States don't do that. They, instead, have graduated possession offenses, based on the quantity of drugs that the defendant is possessing; that above a certain quantity of drugs, it would be a felony. They're getting at the same problem, but they've come at it in a different way.",
  "Well, it would always be up to the jury to decide that. Now, in Mr. Lopez's case, he was -- he was initially charged with a series of offenses that went beyond the aiding and abetting of possession that he ultimately pleaded guilty to, but, as he testified in his -- in his immigration hearing, his aiding and abetting of possession was assisting someone in purchasing drugs, which was, itself, a trafficking element. And so, this shows that the way the State crimes are defined or applied are often getting at what Federal law --",
  "It probably would, but I think it's interesting that the version of 924(c) that was in effect prior to 1988 said exactly that. It said \"felony violation of Federal law.\"",
  "It was -- it was explicit.",
  "Well, but - -",
  "-- Congress - -",
  "But - -",
  "-- Congress did change it, in the 1988 Act, but it did it -- and this is significant -- it did it in connection with two changes in the immigration law. One is the enactment of the definition of \"aggravated felony,\" which, as I have explained, the definition of \"aggravated felony\" looks to State law, in a number of respects, in terms of the severity of the offense or the punishment actually imposed. That was one change. The other change that was made in the 1988 Act was to amend Section 1326 with respect to illegal reentries, and it did that by enhancing the penalty for conviction of any felony other than an aggravated felony, and an aggravated felony. And certainly the conviction of any felony includes State law offenses in this --",
  "It says -- yes, it says \"any felony.\" And that is our -- doing it -- and what --",
  "The conduct is - -",
  "-- punishable. The conduct is punishable, not - -",
  "I think not -- I think not used in that sense, but I think it's important -- it's important to look at the language, as a whole. It does not say \"punishable as a felony under\" --",
  "-- \"under the Controlled\" - -",
  "Well, no, I agree that the -- I -- in my view, the key to the case is in 1101(a)(43), because, if you look at the structure of 1101(a)(43) - - and this gets to the question you -- you said -- you mentioned that I had three reasons. One is that under the -- under the INA, the conviction consequences turn on the conviction of an aggravated felony, and it only makes sense to look at the jurisdiction of conviction to determine the nature of the crime, whether it's a felony.",
  "No. Under 924(c), you don't. But under the -- under the -- if you're bringing a Federal prosecution under 924(c), the term \"aggravated felony\" has no role in that determination. It is a -- it is a separate Federal crime. We're talking about, here, the consequences of -- the consequences of being an aggravated felon under 1101(a)(43) are, Where does the definition of \"aggravated felony\" apply? It only applies under the INA if someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony. You're only -- you're only subject to deportation for aggravated felony if you've been convicted, you're ineligible for cancellation or removal, you're subject to sentence enhancement. All those things follow on conviction. And we think it only makes sense to look to the jurisdiction of conviction. That is --",
  "That's correct.",
  "I don't think so at all. And for one -- for one thing -- as I've mentioned, the structure of the act, as a whole, of 1101(a)(43) -- and there are numerous subsections -- look to how the crime -- what the authorized punishment was, or look to how the person was actually sentenced under State law, not under Federal law.",
  "And I - -",
  "No -- I - -",

  "So - -",
  "Well, we think -- we think it is quite a -- we think it's a strong confirmation of the pattern in 1101(a)(43), that the statute looks to what happened in State Court, and the State punishment that was authorized there, and the express mention of that -- or --",

And that's what I understand Toledo-Flores to be arguing, is that if he applied for discretionary relief in the future, that it might -- it might matter, because his sentence might be reduced slightly. I should point out that in the District Court Toledo-Flores conceded that if he didn't get an eight- level sentence enhancement, he would get a four-level sentence enhancement, because this is at least a felony, within the meaning of the adjacent provision of the guidelines. That would result in a guideline range of 24 to 30 months. He would then have gotten 24 months, under that guideline range, the very same thing that he got here. And, under the guidelines at the time, a term of supervised release was mandatory. And a 1-year term of supervised release was mandatory in those circumstances. He would have gotten exactly the same term of supervised release if he had been -- if he had gotten only the four- level enhancement, rather than the eight-level enhancement. I also think that it is somewhat farfetched to think that, given the fact that Toledo-Flores had more than 12 illegal entries into the United States, and various State offenses, that the determination of whether the attorney general would actually grant discretionary relief would turn on a marginal difference in the sentence on that particular offense.",

  "If I may, I don't think there's any question that he knew in advance that this was about the Olympics. That's why he made the sign. And they were released to go out and watch the torch go by. He hasn't raised any question of notice or due process concerns.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 402(b) of the Clean Water Act provides that the Environmental Protection Agency shall approve an application by a State to administer its own NPDES program unless EPA finds that the state's program does not satisfy nine criteria that are addressed to whether the State has the legal authority under State law to carry forward with the program. There's no dispute in this case that Arizona's program satisfies those criteria. The Ninth Circuit nonetheless set aside EPA's approval of Arizona's program. The Ninth Circuit held that EPA could not approve Arizona's application unless it first insured that there would be in place under Arizona's administration protections equivalent to those that would be applicable under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act when EPA itself issues permits. That holding is inconsistent not only with Section 402(b)'s mandatory directive, it's also inconsistent with Section 7 of the ESA itself.",
  "Yes. That is our position, and that I think is clear from Section 402(b). It says that the administrator shall approve unless he finds that the state legal authority criteria are not satisfied. I should also point out that that's reinforced by 33 U.S.C. 1251(b), which expresses a strong preference for State protection of waters and in particular states that it's the policy of Congress that the states administer the NPDES program.",
  "Well, until 1993 when the vast majority -- by the time -- by that time the vast majority of transfers or approvals had already taken place. There had never been consultation, at least that we're aware of under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. EPA did consult with the wildlife agencies on six programs but after the Fifth Circuit -- from then until -- until this one, but after the Fifth Circuit's decision in the American Forestry case, EPA never tried to impose any obligations on a State under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. What it did is, EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service worked out between themselves certain arrangements by which EPA would look at endangered species considerations, but it never conditioned the approval of a State program after the Louisiana program struck down in the American Forestry decision in 1998, on the states having in place certain protections. And in fact, I think EPA would not characterize what it did even in the Louisiana programs as the sort of condition that the Fifth Circuit understood.",
  "Well, I'm -- there may be two different things that, referring to it. Section 7 imposes an obligation on Federal agencies in their own actions not to jeopardize -- or to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize a species. Ancillary to that, there is an obligation on Federal agencies to consult with the fish and wildlife agencies. As to the consultation obligation, as I mentioned, EPA has engaged in consultation from 1993 until - -",
  "Our position now is that it did not have to, but -- and more fundamentally our position is that because the transfer or the approval of the State application is mandatory if these nine legal authority criteria are satisfied, EPA could not withhold approval of - -",
  "Basically, yes. If in the end EPA could not disapprove the State's application, and since consultation is ancillary to the substantive obligation not to jeopardize - -",
  "The memorandum, the memorandum of agreement, is called for under EPA's regulations as really a procedural mechanism for the EPA and the State agency to work out the practicalities of the State's administering the program. They typically address such things as how the State agency will furnish EPA draft permits and that sort of thing, time limitations for EPA to look at, who to contact at the State agency. It's essentially procedural in order to facilitate EPA's continuing oversight role. It's not a vehicle for EPA to impose substantive obligations coming from other statutes.",
  "Because we think that would been consistent with Section 402(b), which requires, which requires the EPA to approve the transfer. Now, if a State agency chooses to cooperate with Fish and Wildlife Service or NOAA in the Department of Commerce with respect to species under its jurisdiction, that is all fine. And I should point out - -",
  "It's unconditional with respect in our view to actions that are within the agency's discretion or consequences that the agency will cause. But more fundamentally in response to your question, Section 7 imposes obligations only on Federal agencies, not on State agencies. Like 402(b), it is a federalism-sensitive - -",
  "Well, as to the latter, we don't believe that EPA can condition the transfer. But let me point out that in 2001 - -",
  "First of all, with respect to the Endangered Species Act, the memorandum of agreement that was entered into in 2001 between EPA and the two Federal wildlife services does furnish a way in which after the transfer EPA can take into account endangered species considerations within the scope of its - -",
  "No, that's not correct. Under Section 402(d) EPA has the authority to object to a State permit. And if the -- but to do so on, based on a determination that the State permit would not satisfy the guidelines and requirements of the Clean Water Act. So if - -",
  "With respect to water quality issues that might affect an endangered species, EPA takes the position -- and I think it's correct -- that EPA can object to a State permit where that permit would not comply with State water quality standards that are necessary to protect the endangered species.",
  "EPA doesn't need the State's agreement to object to a State permit. That is authority - -",
  "And I wanted to get to the further mechanisms that are in place under EPA regulations and the memorandum of agreement.",
  "Those regulations do not because they are procedural. Then what happens if the State agency does not respond to the concerns raised or does not remedy the concerns raised by Fish and Wildlife Service or NOAA, EPA is notified and EPA can then try to work it out with the State agency, or, failing that, EPA can object to the State permit if it does not satisfy the Clean Water Act standards. And again with respect to water quality, those standards are set at a level that is necessary to protect endangered species. So as far as water quality impacts are concerned, EPA retains complete control under its ability to object to the permit.",
  "It is. EPA - -",
  "Upland habitat, if it's water habitat, water quality standards. EPA has to approve State water quality standards. It consults with Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA in doing so to make sure endangered species would be protected by the water quality standards. And then each individual State permit is measured against those water quality standards to make sure they comply. So therefore, with respect to water quality, Fish and Wildlife Service agreed that the mechanisms I have just described would take care of any Endangered Species Act concerns.",
  "Yes, the 2001, February 22, 2001, agreement between EPA and - -",
  "That is correct. And some of the things I described were embodied in EPA regulations aside from the agreement, including an agreement that State agencies furnish draft permits to Fish and Wildlife Service and take into account comments that are received in return. Justice Scalia is correct that, that the impacts that would not be covered by this would be non-water quality-related impacts on upland habitat. But in our view that simply reflects the nature of the Clean Water Act and under 402(b) it is a Clean Water Act. It deals with water quality, and we do not believe that EPA is authorized to withhold the approval or condition the approval of a transfer of permitting authority to a State on the basis of what the State will do with respect to upland, upland habitat.",
  "Essentially, the Endangered Species -- there was a subsequent amendment to 402(b), but for these purposes -- but - -",
  "Because it is -- we do not think it repeals -- it's essentially a repeal by implication question.",
  "Beyond that, Section 7 of the ESA is a generally applicable statute, whereas Section 402(b) speaks specifically and comprehensively to the question of Federal approval of State programs. We also think this would be a particularly unlikely candidate for an exception to that because EPA's approval of the State program does not result in any immediate on-the-ground consequences. That would only happen - - or in-the-water consequences. That would only happen if after the transfer the State agency actually issued, issued a permit. So what we're talking about is - -",
  "Well, if I could go back to the point I was making earlier, that we think that the central thrust of the court of appeals' opinion and Respondent's position here is that EPA could not transfer the authority unless it and the State together replicated the sort of protections that were in place when EPA itself administered the Endangered Species Act. And as I said, that's inconsistent not only with 402(b), but with Congress's federalism-sensitive judgment, to impose the sort of substantive and procedural administrative requirements in Section 7 of the ESA only on Federal agencies, not on State agencies. And let me also stress that this does not mean that the rest of the ESA is inapplicable once a permitting program of the State is approved. The central provision of the ESA, the prohibition against taking endangered species act and other provisions against trading in them and importing, exporting, all those remain applicable. Those are the generally applicable provisions that prohibit the taking of endangered species.",
  "Well, I think it would require a statute by statute evaluation.",
  "But we think this one is particularly clear.",
  "Several, several responses to that. Those cross-references -- first of all, 402(b) looks only to whether the State has the legal report under State it law. Among other things, it requires a certification or determination by the attorney general of the State to establish that the State actually has the authority to administer. And the references to, cross-references to fish and wildlife that come from incorporating other provisions have to do with the setting of the standards or setting -- under section 302, which EPA has never invoked, setting certain supplementary effluent standards to protect fish and wildlife. Those are the standards. EPA does not evaluate the state's water quality standards in deciding whether the State has the legal authority under 402(b) to administer the program.",
  "I'm not sure. I don't think --",
  "There was, there was in the Louisiana memorandum of agreement that was involved in the Fifth Circuit's American Forestry decision, and it was that provision that the Fifth Circuit held was unlawful on two grounds. That, that memorandum of agreement basically said we're trying to do something analogous to Section 7 of the ESA when the State is administering the program; and the Fifth Circuit said that went beyond EPA's authority by conditioning the approval on the State putting in place a compensation arrangement.",
  "That's not correct, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg. What, after the Fifth Circuit's decision, EPA never tried to impose on a State an obligation to go forward in the same way that EPA, or even in a similar way that EPA would under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.",
  "They all provided what I've described to Justice Souter, that -- that the pre-existing ESA, EPA regulations require that draft permits be furnished to the, to Fish and Wildlife and to NOAA, and that they take into account the comments by Fish and Wildlife and NOAA. That doesn't come from the memorandum of agreement or -- or -- or EPA's memorandum of agreement with the states. That's something that comes from the regulations. Everything else - -",
  "Yes. And, and the biological, the memorandum of agreement in this case applies to all State-administered programs including those that were approved by EPA before 1993. This is a nationwide memorandum of agreement. And the basis - -",
  "No, it is -- no it is not. The memorandum of - -",
  "Yes. There, there's - -",
  "33 U.S.C. 1314(i) allows - - provides -- excuse me -- for EPA to establish guidelines, basic guidelines, minimum standards for State programs and -- part of that - -",
  "If, if the, if its refusal was based on an objection to things that are within the, within the legitimate scope of a memorandum of agreement. I think that - -",
  "Yeah. I -- I think -- I don't think EPA has ever confronted that. But I think it probably, it probably could be denied, but the regulations do not -- as I recall -- specifically condition the approval of the program on the memorandum of agreement.",
  "Yes. I would, I would hesitate to say that EPA could not -- could not insist on that, but it's important again to come back to the - -",
  "Because there's a separate authority for the, for the, for EPA to issue guidelines for minimum, minimum standards for State programs, but those have to do with -- with communications with EPA and sort of running a program. And it's not a vehicle as I said before for EPA to impose new substantive requirements outside the Clean Water Act on the State. And that's why if -- that's why if EPA insisted that a State enter into a memorandum of understanding that basically said we will, we will act like EPA does under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act under the administration of the program, I think the, I think the State agency would be entitled to decline to enter into that agreement. And again that's essentially what the Fifth Circuit held in the American Forestry case, and to what extent we agree with the American Forestry decision. If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice: First, with respect, stepping back and looking at the legal theory, we think that this case is really on all fours with the Public Citizen case. In fact, the court of appeals recognized that the operative regulation here, the definition of \"indirect effect,\" meaning something caused by the agency, is just like the one in Public Citizen. In Public Citizen this Court held that where an agency has a mandatory duty and does not have the ability to control subsequent events, that the agency cannot be regarded as the legal cause of whatever effects happen. That is exactly the case here. Section 402(b) mandates that EPA approve the State's application. EPA therefore, EPA's decision therefore is not the legal cause of any effects that might happen with respect to endangered species. I should point out that in this Court's decision in Sweet Home this Court in footnotes 9 and 13 read the other principal provision of the ESA, the take provision, to incorporation a proximate cause limitation. We think it follows that the jeopardize prohibition in Section 7 also incorporates a proximate cause or here legal cause restriction.",
  "There has been no challenge to that, so I'm not in a position to give a definitive answer. But I believe to the extent it would be discretionary that Section 7 may well kick in.",
  "No, because there was no challenge to that. There was no challenge to that aspect of it. This was a challenge to the transfer of authority, not ancillary matters addressed under the agreement. Also, footnote 18 of the court of appeals opinion makes clear that Respondents did not challenge anything to do with funding, which is an entirely separate administrative determination that there's a regulatory set of criteria for how funding gets distributed, it is not dependent on whether the State has NPDES authority. Section 106 of the Clean Water Act has a separate funding mechanism for Clean Water Act authority generally. So funding is simply not, it's simply not in the case.",
  "Yes, and in fact this Court's decision in Hill can't be understood in any other day because the Court went out of its way to say that, while Congress committee reports indicated, for the appropriations bills, indicated an expectation that the dam would be built, the Court emphasized the fact that there was no mandate in the appropriations statute itself. That would have been - -",
  "Yes. That part of the Court's decision would have been unnecessary.",
  "But there are few statutes like this, that say the agency shall unless certain things happen.",
  "There may be particular applications of the standard, but that did not deter this Court in Public Citizen, where the Court applied the same principle and said where the agency has a mandatory duty and no discretion it is not the legal cause. That's the general principle. If there are other cases where that general principle has to be applied, there will be time enough for that consideration to arise. Another important aspect of Hill is this Court quoted Representative Dingell, the sponsor of it, saying that agencies are to take actions within their power, which suggest that -- and we think it's clear through the history, as we recite in our brief at pages 27 and 28, from the text of the Act and from the evolution of Section 7, it was always understood to apply to situations where the agencies had the existing authority to take action, not to require them to countermand statutory directives the way the Department of Transportation could not countermand statutory directives in Public Citizen. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think it might be useful to begin by focusing on the consequences of Petitioner's argument that the PMA approval of an application does not result in requirements that are preemptive for purposes of the preemptive provision. Under Petitioner's view, the day after the FDA gave PMA approval to a particular device, State legislatures or State regulatory agencies could adopt laws or regulations that would direct the manufacturer to manufacture or design the product or to give labeling that would conflict with what the FDA had just approved. And we don't think that Congress could have intended in enacting the express preemption provision here to allow State regulatory agencies or, even more so, individual juries that could very within a State - -",
  "But we think that the express preemption provision embodies that very important conflict, or maybe in this context it is best to conceptualize it as field preemption, of the things that are included within the application that is submitted to the FDA and the labeling.",
  "Yes, that is -- that is definitely true.",
  "That's -- that's entirely correct, and if I could just elaborate on that - -",
  "Well, what I was going to say -- to elaborate on the point that I made, Petitioner concedes that if there is an FDA PMA requirement, the State may not impose its own PMA requirement; and that has to be correct, because in the State PMA approval, the State could withhold its approval unless the manufacturer changed the device or changed the labeling in some way to get it cleared through - -",
  "But it's important to understand why. Congress was not concerned about the PMA in the abstract or as a process; it was concerned about what the consequences of requiring the manufacturer to go through the PMA process were. And that was precisely because the result of the State PMA process could be to impose different requirements. The labeling should read differently - -",
  "-- the product should be differently.",
  "There is -- there is no express preemption clause there. One -- one possible explanation might be is that a -- that a device is a tangible concrete item, an item of commerce that is - - that has extensive design and planning and blueprints in a way that a drug doesn't quite have that same -- that same characteristic. I mean, like other -- like automobiles or something, that they have a tangible aspect and a long lead time in the design and manufacture. That may be one explanation for why Congress wanted to be especially firm about imposing preemption with respect to Federally approved devices.",
  "It was a different Congress.",
  "This was 1976 when we - -",
  "Right, and they were only addressing devices in that -- these were not general FDA amendments; they were addressing -- they were addressing the - -",
  "Well, the government filed a brief in -- in late 1997 taking a position that PMA approval did not -- did not have preemptive effect. That was issued together with FDA's issuance of a proposed rule to the same effect. FDA withdrew that proposed rule 7 months later. The government did not address this question again until 2004 in the brief you're referring to in the court of appeals. And due in large part to examining the very things that I've been talking about, that in FDA's judgment, which this Court in the Lohr case said was entitled to considerable deference, FDA recognized that there would be a serious undermining of FDA's approval authority and its balancing of the risks and benefits, if a State jury could reweigh those -- the balance that FDA had struck in the new Medical Device - -",
  "Yes. I mean, let me just clarify. If the -- if the -- there are incident reports that -- that a manufacturer is supposed to give to FDA. There is often a difficult judgment as to whether the injury that is associated with a device is some problem of the device or whether it's some problem --",
  "-- with what - -",
  "And it -- what I was going to say is it's possible that the labeling would be regarded as misleading for some reason. In that event, the manufacturer should apply to -- should submit what's called a supplemental PMA and request that the labeling be changed to clarify that.",
  "Ordinarily, yes. If there was -- if there was a very serious risk to health and safety - -",
  "In that event, FDA has variety of tools that it can take and so does the manufacturer. One of them is what's sometimes called a \"Dear Doctor\" letter, which is notification -- this is provided for under 360h(a) of the Act -- is a notification to physicians or other users of a product that there may be some previously unrecognized problem or misrepresentation or what could be misconstruction of the label.",
  "It would not subject it to State tort liability, no. If there was -- if there was a situation where the manufacturer knew of a serious problem and did not report it to it FDA, that could subject the manufacturer to criminal penalties with respect to FDA for either misrepresenting or withholding information. But that's really the Buckman -- this Court's Buckman decision, that that's the relationship between FDA and the manufacturer, and that's the incentive. I think someone asked about what incentives does the manufacturer has. The manufacturer has a powerful incentive because of the criminal penalties and other sanctions that can be taken by FDA if -- if the manufacturer does not report something to the FDA. Plus, manufacturers have an important reputational interest, that they don't want to be seen to be flouting possible problems.",
  "I -- if it was just -- I think that's a good point. If it was just a question of going through a duplicative State PMA process - -",
  "Right. Right. Right.",
  "And also I think the FDA regulations promulgated when this was put out, soon after the '76 amendments were passed, I think reinforced the conclusion that -- and, in fact, there was a regulation that specifically talks about the application of general adulteration standards in a way that might require a specific label change to be made by a manufacturer, and we think that's basically precisely this lawsuit. It's the application of general tort law that would require the manufacturer or a standard of care under common law that would say that what the manufacturer had done specifically approved by FDA was -- was improper as a matter of State law. We think that that is in the teeth of the preemption provision. I think Justice Alito asked the question about the issue of whether FDA focused or didn't focus on a particular aspect of the design. We don't think that a preemption test can really realistically turn on that. That would require extensive and intrusive inquiry into what FDA had done. We think that the best way to look at this is what the end product was; what was the application that was finally approved and the labeling associated with it, much like the filed rate doctrine. You look at what was put before the agency and what was approved, not what might have gone into -- into consideration.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The filing of a motion to reopen does not automatically suspend the obligation of an alien to leave the United States within the time that was specified in the Board's order granting permission to depart voluntarily. The grant of voluntary departure reflects an exchange of benefits between the government and the alien and Petitioner's automatic tolling rule would greatly subvert that reciprocal arrangement by giving the alien the unilateral and automatic ability to extend the substantive terms of the immigration relief the - -",
  "Well, let me make one - -",
  "Let me make one point clear at the outset. Petitioner's motion to reopen was not dismissed because he was not able to file one. It was denied because he was not eligible for the underlying substantive relief that he requested in this motion. Overstaying a voluntary departure period does not, for example, bar an alien from obtaining asylum or withholding of removal on a motion to reopen. It's only the particular substantive form of relief that he requested in his motion to reopen that is at issue, and that was denied.",
  "With all respect, that's not correct.",
  "Again, both prior to 1996 and after 1996 Congress specified that an alien who overstays the voluntary departure period is ineligible for three forms of discretionary relief. Now it's voluntary departure, cancellation or removal, or adjustment of status. That was true both beforehand and afterhand. Before 1996, there was no statutory limitation on the time for either a motion to reopen or voluntary departure. Congress was concerned about abuses on both of those fronts, and what it did in 1996 was to compress the voluntary departure time for 60 days because it was concerned about how long the agency was allowing agents -- aliens to remain in the country under orders of voluntary departure. And what it did with respect to motions to reopen was very modest. It just put in statutory form a limitation that the agency had put in place pursuant to a statutory directive to place time and number limitations on motions to reopen because of Congress's concern about abuse.",
  "Well - -",
  "Two responses to that. With respect to the voluntary departure, Congress anticipated that the alien was going to leave under the order of voluntary departure, not remain here. And prior to 1996, just to - -",
  "That regulation has been a fundamental part of motions to reopen going back at least until the 1960s.",
  "Yes. Yes, we do have. And that's part of the arrangement. The only thing -- and that regulation was repromulgated as part of General Motion to Reopen Regulation in 1995.",
  "No. Again, if I may, the - - what Congress had in mind with the deal of granting voluntary departure was it greatly constricted the time to leave. You have to leave in 60 days, and if you don't leave in 60 days, you're not going to get voluntary departure adjustment of status or cancellation or removal. It didn't affect the eligibility for other substantive relief that an alien might file for in a motion to reopen, such as asylum, such as if he has new evidence going to the ground of removal. But Congress was particularly concerned not to allow these three forms of discretionary relief to remain available. And so I think Congress necessarily would have been unconcerned about whether, if an alien did file a motion to reopen within that greatly constricted 60-day period -- in fact, in this case the Board gave 30 days - - Congress wasn't concerned about preserving the underlying substantive eligibility for those forms of discretionary relief, because it made that part of the deal, that alien was giving up if he left -- if he didn't leave the country, he was giving up that. Those were lesser order forms of relief that Congress was making available, but it did did not take away, for example, the right to apply for asylum or withholding.",
  "Because that had not been - - led to widespread litigation in the courts. This automatic tolling rule is -- was what we were fundamentally concerned about. In fact, we told the Court not to take the case at all because the new regulations were under consideration. But that particular provision -- issue has not generated that much litigation. This automatic tolling rule has, and more than - -",
  "But the Court rewrote the question presented so as not to -- not to address that, so I think it's not before the Court right here. But - - but beyond that, the deal, the arrangement -- the Attorney General has a lot of discretion how to implement the voluntary departure provision. In fact, he has the authority to eliminate voluntary departure for additional categories of people who are not eligible under the statute itself. So whether to - -",
  "The regulations do not provide for it, and it's inconsistent with the - -",
  "As far as I'm aware there is no regulation that prohibits it, but the order is a grant of voluntary departure, and the Board of Immigration Appeals order says you're granted permission to depart voluntarily within 30 days; if you do not, the following consequences flow from that. Nothing in the Board's order would allow the alien to avoid those consequences by saying on the 28th day, after all I don't want to do that. And this matter of implementing the voluntary departure agreement is part of a general scheme of a quid pro quo between the alien and the United States. The voluntary departure is granted under circumstances where the alien doesn't have that option. So unilaterally -- allowing the alien unilaterally to do that now is not provided for. Now, that doesn't -- that doesn't take away from the Attorney General's discretionary authority in implementing the Act to provide for that, which is what he has proposed in the new rule. But this case has to be decided under the - - under the rules that are now in effect.",

  "Your administrative appeals. You do not -- the statute has been amended to allow you to petition for review in a court if you leave the country.",
  "Yes. Which was a change from what was before this Court in Stone. In 1996 Congress amended the Act to allow an alien to continue to challenge the final removal order after he leaves the country in court.",
  "I believe -- I believe that's true unless - -",
  "I think that -- I think that would be correct unless -- I don't think this has ever come up that I'm aware of, about whether you could go to court from an immigration judge's decision where you've left the country and therefore can't appeal to the BIA.",
  "I just don't know the answer -- I just don't know the answer to that, because I'm not sure that scenario has come up, because usually, if somebody wants to contest, they're not going to leave the country before they have to, and if you appeal from the immigration judge to the Board of Immigration Appeals, that suspends the finality of the order of removal or the order of voluntary departure that the immigration judge has entered. So if you appeal -- if you want to stay in the country, all you have to do is file an automatic appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals and that suspends the finality of the departure time.",
  "Yes. Yes. You do.",
  "Yes. I'm sorry. I'm not - -",
  "If you appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, a motion to reopen arises only after the Board has issued a final order on your appeal. So if you appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, if the Board rejects your claim on the merit, and reinstates the voluntary departure period to allow you to enter again - -",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes. Until the - -",
  "With the immigration judge.",
  "I -- I suppose you could do that, but the -- but the appeal -- it would be like a motion to reopen in the district court while you've got an appeal to the -- to the BIA. I -- I think once the appeal goes to the Board -- this case involves motions to reopen filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals, not with the immigration judge, and so -- the alien here conceded his deportability, sought a continuance, and that was denied. He had no other substantive grounds of relief. He asked for voluntary departure. That was granted. He took an appeal to the BIA arguing he should have been granted a continuance; the Board affirmed; reinstated a 30-day departure period; and then he wanted to seek reopening. And one question that Justice Breyer asked about, what if reopening is denied would the automatic tolling rule continue? I suppose the alien could file a motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to reopen, and if you had an automatic tolling rule, it would -- it would last as long as it took the Board to act on the motion to reopen, which is -- which 60, 90, 120 days. In this past Fiscal Year the Board on motions to reopen resolved I think only about 55 percent of those within 90 days. The Board has a huge backlog, and we're talking -- and so we are talking about the very kind of abuse of the immigration system that this Court was concerned about - -",
  "That -- that's true. It has --",
  "Right, although - -",
  "No. It's not subject to the appeal as such but the Board procedures take account of developments that happen while the case is on appeal, which is that you can file with the Board while your appeal is pending and ask for a motion to remand on the ground that new evidence has come up. For example, in the case of adjustment of status, where -- the alien's wife has filed a petition for immediate relative status to let the alien get a visa, if while the case is pending on appeal that petition has been granted, then -- then it would -- then all the alien has to do is file a motion with the Board and say there is new information; please remand it back to the immigration judge. So a lot of times what has happened is -- maybe intervening things have happened but the alien doesn't do anything about it during the year that the appeal is pending with the Board of Immigration Appeals; then there is a final order and the alien rushes in with the -- with the new information at that point, where if you had only brought it to the attention of the Board while the appeal was pending, it could have been remanded.",
  "That -- that - -",
  "It's more than a few extra days.",
  "It's an automatic tolling period.",
  "Yes. That is correct and I -- and I think it's fair to say if you're talking about changed circumstances or new evidence that arises after the IJ has rendered his decision, that's a period that might be a year; it might be a year and a half. New developments or changed circumstances are far more likely to have happened during that period of time than they would during a 30-day period of voluntary departure that -- that the Board reinstates at the conclusion of the appeal. So an alien in this position who has been granted voluntary departure and knows that a motion to reopen may not be a realistic option, if he wants to seek adjustment of status or cancellation of removal, the solution to that is to be alert and attentive and file something with the Board, if there are in fact - -",
  "That would be -- that would be one -- as the Attorney General said in his proposed regulations, that would be one way to administer the program, but the Act does not compel that. The Act does not compel - -",
  "Yes. The alien is still subject to deportation.",
  "Yes, he could get -- he could get a stay of removal, and the same -- same thing is true here, if the -- if the alien remains in the country, his voluntary departure period expires, he could file for a stay of removal with the Board or he could file for a stay of removal with the court of appeals if he wants to file a petition.",
  "Right. Right. But -- but like any person, he could file a motion for a stay with the court of appeals to prevent his deportation.",
  "No, that -- that is correct.",
  "Well, as I say, the way that -- the Board's order grants him permission to voluntary depart and says the following consequences will attach if you do not. Nothing in the Board's order allows him to withdraw. It grants him that permission.",
  "Well, I think it probably forecloses it.",
  "Because it's the -- it's the content of the Board's order that -- that says you have 60 days to depart and if you do not, the following consequences attach.",
  "I -- I -- the statute and regulations just don't provide for it.",
  "He -- he requested it at the outset. The case has proceeded on the sense that that is -- that that is the arrangement, that -- that the reciprocal benefits and burdens that the Government and the alien have undertaken - -",
  "Yes, I - -",
  "Yes. I'm not standing here defending the contrary position as an overarching policy matter, because after all the Attorney General's proposed regulations provide for that. My - -",
  "As they are now drafted they would apply prospectively. But my only point is that voluntary departure and motions to reopen are administered under the statute and the regulations and the BIA orders that are entered under the current regulatory framework, which has a different sort of deal between the alien and the government in mind, and that --",
  "I think essentially -- I think essentially yes. I - -",
  "Yes. And I want to qualify my answer in a further respect -- that regulations with respect to voluntary departure being granted by the Board don't say anything like that. But I am informed by the executive office of immigration review that if the immigration judge grants voluntary departure and the alien appeals to the Board, the ordinary course would be for the Board to reinstate voluntary departure if it rejects the alien's appeal. But if on appeal the alien requests that voluntary departure not be reinstated once the Board's order is entered, then the Board will omit that from its final order of removal. But Petitioner here did not request on his appeal to the Board that the Board not reinstate a - - order a voluntary departure if it had affirmed on the merits. And so the Board went forward on the assumption that the alien had requested voluntary departure, entered an order on that assumption, and once it's entered, it's a final order that would require some amendment of the order, in order to -- in order to be changed under the current regime.",
  "No, it didn't.",
  "I think -- I think if the Court wants to get into the question of whether he could withdraw it, the proper thing for the Court to do would be to reject the Petitioner's argument that there is an automatic tolling rule, because that's fundamentally inconsistent with Congress' deliberate intention to impose a short deadline and not let the agency extend that, but to remand to the Board of Immigration Appeals for an explanation as to whether he could withdraw his request for voluntary departure. I don't think the Court should decide that question on its own. I think that should be remanded to the Board. If in the meantime the Attorney General issues regulations that provide for withdrawal of the request, maybe because his case would be back before the Board, those new regulations could be applied. But whether that -- the alien should be allowed to do that is fundamentally a question for the Attorney General in the first instance.",
  "It is - -",
  "No. It was elected before the immigration judge. That's where you request it. If the immigration judge rejects your arguments against removability, grants you voluntary departure - -",
  "You can. And you can get 120 days of time to depart. You can do that. People who don't want to contest the removability at all - -",
  "Right. In the contested cases, you would ask for that at the conclusion of the hearing before the immigration judge. That gets suspended if you appeal to the BIA because the order is not final. It doesn't become final until the Board of Immigration Appeals affirms.",
  "I do not. I asked that question, and I do not know the answer to that. I would like to come back to the fundamental automatic tolling rule that -- the fundamental inconsistency of that automatic tolling rule with what Congress did in 1996, because it shortened to 60 days the time limit in which an alien can depart. It also eliminated a prior exception that had been the law that allowed an exception to the consequences for somebody who overstayed even the much longer voluntary departure period for exceptional circumstances. Congress repealed that exception. Prior to 1996, the Board in the case we cite in our briefs called Matter of Shaar, held that if an alien is granted voluntary departure and files a motion to reopen, it rejected two arguments. One is that the filing of a motion to reopen was itself exceptional circumstances that eliminated the deadline. It rejected that. It also in an en banc decision rejected the automatic tolling rule that Petitioner is arguing for here under a situation in which Congress had granted a long time for aliens to voluntarily depart. We think it defies common sense to suggest that when Congress compressed the time to 60 days, it meant to at the same time reverse what the Board had done in Matter of Shaar and granted an automatic tolling rule, not even one under the control of the immigration authorities, but an automatic tolling rule as a matter of law simply by the unilateral act of filing a motion to reopen. And the Board in Matter of Shaar addressed all of those things. The Board of Immigration Appeals has filed, followed Matter of Shaar, in the intervening years since 1997 -- and importantly, I would like to point this out, too, when Petitioner sought a motion for reopening, he relied on a Board decision called Villarde, which recognized that in some circumstances an alien may file a motion to reopen to try to get adjustment of status if there has been intervening development with respect to an immediate relative petition filed by a spouse. The Board adopted that rule in this en banc published decision Villarde, but said one of the qualifications for being eligible for that relief is that you not be barred under Matter of Shaar, which means you not be barred by having overstayed your voluntary departure period. So, in the very procedure that Petitioner invoked in this case, there is a published Board decision post-1997 that relies on that -- that relies on that rationale, and the Board has followed that consistently. It is at the very least a reasonable interpretation of the act for the Attorney General not to allow the undermining of this tightened voluntary departure system by providing for reopening. I should also point out that this is not tolling in the normal sense. Tolling usually arises where a person has a claim and there is a statute of limitations for filing a claim before a forum. Petitioner here was already granted voluntary departure. The 60-day time limit is not a procedural statute of limitations. It is a limitation on substantive immigration relief. And we think it's particularly odd that the filing of a procedural motion to reopen would have the effect of changing the statutorily limited time in which an alien could voluntarily depart the United States.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in this case reasonably denied Respondent's request to modify the wholesale contracts that the purchasing power companies had entered into in 2000 and 2001. The Commission reasonably concluded that Respondents had not made the requisite showing under the Federal Power Act and under this Court's decisions in Mobile and Sierra that modification of the contracts was necessary in the public interest. In reaching that conclusion, FERC first drew on three factors that this Court had identified in Sierra and found that they were not satisfied. Thus, it found that Respondents had failed to show that the contracts would impose financial strain on the purchasing companies; that it would impose excessive burdens on the customers; or that they were unduly discriminatory. But FERC also looked - -",
  "That is -- that is correct, and FERC thought that perhaps the decision could be limited to the circumstances arising out of the California energy crisis in the years 2000- 2001, and that it could channel its concerns about contract stability through those other factors. But, nonetheless, FERC believes, as its decisions make clear and as our position in this Court makes clear, that the Ninth Circuit's reformulation of the Mobile-Sierra doctrine or interpretation of the act was incorrect. And, now that the Court has granted review, we urge affirmance of FERC's decision in this case.",
  "Well, two decisions of this Court and 50 years of intervening FERC, before that Federal Power Commission, practice.",
  "Right. That -- that is correct. I mean it, I think -- I took the question to be that it might give FERC broader flexibility, but at a very substantial cost to the stability of contracts, which was the underlying point that this Court stressed in its decision in Sierra: That the Federal Power Act, unlike -- and the Natural Gas Act, unlike the Interstate Commerce Act, contemplates that rates will be set by contract, or at least can be set by contract; and that therefore, like in most situations, a party to a contract cannot unilaterally walk away from that contract or insist upon its modification because it may become disadvantageous over time.",
  "No. I think -- I mean there are -- there are two interpretive questions here: When does the public interest standard identified in this Court's decisions in Mobile and Sierra apply? And then there is the further question of what is necessary to satisfy the public interest standard for modifying a contract. We think on both points the Commission's decision in this case reflects an interpretive judgment that the Court's decision, or the interpretation reflected in the Court's decision, in Sierra applies equally in the market-based rate system without any of the -- either of the two prerequisites that the Ninth Circuit formulated as a precondition to applying the public interest standard. And I would point the Court's attention, in the joint appendix in the Commission's decision, to joint appendix 1244 and 1245, repeated again at 1572 and 1573; and also the passage quoted in the Morgan Stanley brief at page 17, reflects a determination of what the Commission's longstanding policy has been that, contracts once entered into, their integrity must be protected and should not be lightly set aside. And also, the Commission specifically rejected at pages 1564 and 1565 of the joint appendix the prerequisites that the Ninth Circuit came up with in this case, that there must be an opportunity to determine whether the rates were within a zone of just and reasonableness at the time the contracts were entered into in order for Mobile and Sierra to apply. Under a market-based rate system, what FERC does is determine at the outset when an applicant applies for a market-based tariff whether that company has market power and if so, whether it's mitigated. Only in those circumstances is the company granted the authority to market -- to set prices by the market.",
  "Well, what the Commission determined in this case is that there was -- there was no manipulation or exercise of market power identified with respect to these specific contracts. And what the Commission decided was that the importance of the integrity of contracts in that circumstance required that the contract be maintained. If the Respondents had shown bad faith or something like that in the connection -- or fraud in connection with the formation of these particular contracts, that would have been quite a different matter. It's also important to note that the Commission found in this case that there was no dysfunction in the forward market, which is what we have here. What was going on is that there was dysfunction in the spot market in 2000, 2001 for a variety of reasons, some of them going to market fundamentals such as a shortage of generation capacity, a shortage of hydropower.",
  "No it can -- I'm sorry - -",
  "Once it has granted market-based rate authority, FERC can revoke that. And in fact, companies -- there is a triennial review of that - -",
  "Pardon?",
  "No. It would be revoked - -",
  "No, it wouldn't be retroactive. It would be from the date of the complaint that was filed.",
  "Yes. In that situation there is an important public interest in eliminating fraud.",
  "Or market manipulation.",
  "There are. And this is the point I was going to make - -",
  "Right. I was going to make that point in response to Justice Kennedy's question. If it turns out that subsequent evidence shows that a particular company has acquired market-based power, then FERC can revoke that authority on a going-forward basis to continue to sell on that basis. And in fact, companies are required to report any changes in their circumstances that might affect their market power, and there is a triennial review of that. But as long ago the market - -",
  "There was, and the Ninth Circuit found that in the Lockyer decision. But that is the sort of flaw and market oversight that should be addressed directly by FERC. It shouldn't be -- it shouldn't be addressed by collateral attacks on contracts that were entered into under the regulatory regime as it existed.",
  "No, that is certainly correct. I think the question, what concerned the Ninth Circuit -- actually, the Ninth Circuit wasn't addressing market power. It was addressing the possibility of market dysfunction.",
  "And we don't think it should, except to the extent the public interest standard is met.",
  "Yes. It could revoke the market-based power going forward. And with respect to manipulation, especially if there was manipulation affecting the particular contract, that would be a basis for finding that the public interest required the contract to be modified. If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "This is such a challenge, but what FERC has concluded is that the public interest standard has to be satisfied in that situation. FERC encouraged parties to go into the long-term market in order to diminish the market volatility and it would frustrate that encouragement of policy - -",
  "There was extensive staff studies and monitoring in subsequent decisions that are, that are shown and that are in the joint appendix, in April -- in January and April and June when FERC came up with its final program to mitigate the problems in the spot market.",
  "Yes. On page 1589 of the joint appendix the Commission said we've reviewed the staff reports findings in the 100-day discovery, which were discovery occurring in other proceedings, and found no evidence to support a finding of market manipulation that specifically affected the contracts at issue. It's important to recognize that there were two separate markets here. There was the spot market, which had struck in addition to all the weather and all those things, it had structural problems requiring the California investor-owned utilities to trade on the spot market, which contributed to the opportunities for the manipulation. The dysfunction and manipulation were tied together in that market, but there was -- the ALJ found that the long-term market was not dysfunctional. It was functioning, it operated as it should. Both parties - -",
  "FERC has great discretion in deciding how to apply the public interest standard. It's not necessary to find that they were absolutely separate. It's sufficient, though, to say that the problems in the two separate markets -- the situations in the two separate markets were very different. And in the long-term market, FERC concluded it was important to maintain the integrity of the contracts, indeed, under a market-based system, as Justice Alito said, more important now even than at the time of Mobile, because you can't have a functioning market based-rate system without confidence that contracts would be upheld. In that situation, as this Court suggested in Verizon, you had sophisticated buyers and sophisticated sellers dealing in a situation in which both knew that there was chaos in the spot market, that there was -- there were structural problems there, and that there were allegations of manipulation. But those allegations did not carry over to the, to the long-term market.",
  "Right.",
  "That's correct. But what - -",
  "That's correct. And what the Commission was basically saying is we are treating the long-term market situation differently. Some of these sellers may have been engaged in manipulation in the short-term market, but FERC was trying to draw a distinction between the spot market and moving forward and maintaining the integrity of markets in the long-term where both the buyers and the sellers were both buyers and sellers typically.",
  "That's correct. We don't think FERC should have to engage in a market-based evaluation of possible manipulation in order to hold two parties, two sophisticated parties to their bargain.",
  "The manipulation in the spot market, we think FERC properly concluded, did not have to be taken into account - -",
  "I think that's something that FERC would have to decide in this case. But I don't believe a claim of that sort has been made here. I believe the claim has - -",
  "I think that's the best way to read FERC's decision in this case. And I think that's - -",
  "Yes.",
  "That FERC -- our position is that FERC was not required in the public interest, which looks at the market as a whole not just the two parties to the contract, it looks to the consequences for the market as a whole in unraveling particular contracts because there might have been manipulation somewhere else. We think FERC, recognizing the importance of integrity of contracts, could decide that it was going to look no further than the particular contracts at issue in deciding whether there was market manipulation.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a sovereign government cannot be made a party to a case because of its immunity from suit, that fact must be given great weight in determining whether the suit nonetheless may proceed. That is true whether the absent sovereign is the United States, one of the 50 States, an Indian tribe or, as here, a foreign state.",
  "We believe it would be dispositive in most cases, we think, only if the sovereign's interests would be adequately protected by the judgment or in the rare case that we've identified in our brief where the sovereign's interests are adequately protected by another sovereign, in the case of an Indian tribe being protected by the United States. But other than that, or where the United States is in a case against a state, the United States being the national sovereign, there could be special circumstances, but we think as a whole, the -- as a general rule, sovereign immunity controls. And that's because sovereign immunity represents a fundamental policy judgment either rooted in the Constitution for the United States or the States, or judgments of the legislative branches that the sovereign should not be required to appear in court. A contrary rule allowing the suit to proceed would effectively undermine that rule of immunity and allow the sovereign's interest to be tried behind its back.",
  "I think that's probably correct if the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act governs the service of process under the Act, and if the - -",
  "Right. But if the sovereign -- if the foreign sovereign can't be sued, I think it's all the more -- I mean it can't even be reached -- it may be all the more reason why that interest should be given weight. We think the sovereign interest in this case is particularly compelling for reasons that have already been stated. The Government of the Philippines claims that it owns these assets. By contrast, the Respondents are unsecured judgment creditors. The Government of the Philippines claims it owns these, these assets, under a special Philippine statute dating to 1955 that declares ill-gotten gains gained toward -- during time in office, forfeit to the government, and it has a strong interest in having that dispute resolved in its own courts. As we explain in our brief, the United States strongly supports that position and that interest of the United States is strongly supported by the fact that it is a party to a mutual legal assistance treaty with the Philippines. Such treaties are common in this country. There is a comparable treaty between the Philippines and the Swiss Government which led to the repatriation from Switzerland to the Philippines of a large - -",
  "Because the Philippines - - excuse me. The Philippine National Bank is an escrow agent. It would have a conflict of interest in representing the interests of the Government of the Philippines with respect to its prior claim to the assets as against the Marcos estate. PNB is holding these assets in escrow pending the outcome of the very litigation we are talking about in the Philippines.",
  "That's true, but the interests of the Philippine Government in obtaining - - in having its interest confirmed that it owns these assets as of the time of the wrongdoing going back to 1972, that interest would not be advanced by PNB because PNB is holding them in escrow depending -- pending the outcome of that very dispute between the Marcoses and the Philippine Government and couldn't be expected to advance in this case the Government of the Philippines' interest or claim of ownership to those assets. One other international agreement I wanted to mention was the Convention Against Corruption, to which the United States is a party. And also there is a statute passed by Congress, 2467, that provides for forfeiture in the United States of assets that are deemed to be forfeited pursuant to a foreign proceeding. So international agreements - -",
  "We -- we don't have it yet, but that -- that reflects the important interest of having our courts stay their hands pending the outcome of the proceedings in the Philippines in which that would be determined.",
  "Well, what -- what the statute requires is that the foreign proceedings be in accordance with due process and that parties claiming an -- an interest in the property be entitled to be present. Again, the claimants here do not claim an interest in the property as an owner. They are unsecured judgment creditors of the -- of the Marcos estate, and it -- it might be useful to think about what is true in the reverse situation, in the forfeiture proceeding brought by the United States in U.S. courts against a criminal defendant, for example. An unsecured creditor of the -- of the defendant claiming the assets is typically found not even to have standing to intervene. But if it does intervene, it would not have a claim superior to that of the United States because it wouldn't be a bona fide purchaser of the assets, and it wouldn't be without knowledge of the illegal conduct.",
  "In -- in U.S. courts a secured creditor would get past the standing stage, but would not -- would not get past the bona fide purchaser for value without knowledge of the wrongdoing. In this case it has been clear since 1986, for example, that the Government of the Philippines has -- has been seeking the repatriation of Arelma and its assets.",
  "Well, I think it - -",
  "Well, I -- perhaps in an extreme case, but I -- first of all, I think the courts of the United States should be very reluctant to deem a foreign government's conduct inequitable in the sense that you're describing it. And I think, for the reasons Mr. Rothfeld said, repatriating these assets is an extremely complicated thing. But the Philippines Government sought these assets in -- beginning in 1986, obtained a freeze order in 1986, again in 1990. It got a final determination by the district attorney in Switzerland in 1995, confirmed by the federal court of Switzerland in 1997, that the assets could be returned. These assets, the shares, the Arelma shares, however, were not actually returned until 2000 by the Swiss Government.",
  "That was the preliminary injunction and I'm not sure what happened after that. But I did want -- the proceedings in Switzerland, I did want to make clear, because there was a suggestion that the Philippine Government was duplicitous by encouraging this suit and at the same time seeking the assets. But as I just pointed out. It has been clear since 1986 and through a whole series of proceedings in Switzerland and in the Philippines that the Government of the Philippines has been claiming all of the Marcos assets, specifically including the Arelma assets - -",
  "-- from the very beginning.",
  "I do not believe so. If we thought about an analogy at the United States, if the United States filed a brief in this Court saying that a former Government official could be sued, did not have qualified immunity and could be sued in his personal capacity, or didn't -- or could be sued individually and the Westfall Act did not protect him, that would in no way make -- be a representation by the United States that a judgment against that officer could be satisfied out of assets of the United States, including assets that the United States might be seeking to recover from -- from the defendant. And we think the Philippine Government is in essentially the same position. And a finding of liability in this case -- the judgment does constitute a finding of liability so that with respect to -- it would give these Respondents here the ability to go to Philippine court, to file a claim in the probate proceedings in the Philippines as these Respondents have done. So the judgment, even without being satisfied, serves the Respondents' interests to a great extent.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit's affirmance of a nationwide injunction in this case is contrary to bedrock principles of Article III standing, of the availability and scope of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act, and the granting of equitable relief. As this case was decided by the district court and as it comes to this Court, it involves a stand-alone challenge to two regulations that govern the procedures to be followed by the Forest Service in deciding whether to approve individual site-specific activities in national forests. The two regulations provide that site-specific actions that are excluded from either an environmental impact requirement or even an EA under NEPA are also not subject to special noticing and comment and administrative appeal provisions applicable to the Forest Service. The Ninth Circuit sustained the district court's nationwide injunction as to those procedural regulations standing alone, not as part of a challenge to a specific site-specific activity. The court did so, moreover, on the basis of an affidavit from one member of one of the organizations who could not begin to establish standing under this Court's decisions by showing an imminent injury by virtue of harm to a site-specific activity; and the Court affirmed the nationwide injunction applicable to all forests with respect to all projects listed in ten categories identified by the district court, including national forests and projects that don't even -- that are not even included within that one declarant's generalized interests in certain natural forests. For the multiple combination -- combination of multiple reasons, we think the Ninth Circuit's decision cannot stand. First, as with respect to standing, the one declaration on which both the district court and the court of appeals rely is the declaration of Mr. Bensman, which is reproduced in the petition appendix. And on page 70A and 71A are the only allegations of -- that go to injury at all with respect to the particular regulations at issue here from paragraph 15 on to -- the bottom of 71A on, those are allegations concerning other regulations that are no longer at issue.",
  "Congress has not specifically said that they may challenge - -",
  "Well, first of all, I don't think it could be lawyers. It has to be a party.",
  "I think there would be substantial doubt that Congress could do that, because let me explain why, and this goes to a point that Justice Scalia was making in the prior argument. Procedural wrong is not Article III injury. The injury in this case comes from the application of the regulation in a specific site-specific - -",
  "Well, if -- if Congress - -",
  "Well, if I could make, again, several points. Congress has not passed such a statute. And there may be room in particular situations for Congress to pass a special statute that would identify particular interests that could then be taken into account in terms of whether Article III standing would be established.",
  "No, I -- what I said, that would be a different question.",
  "Well, it might depend on a particular -- it might depend on a particular case. In the Whitman case the court says that the statutes providing for direct review of regulations eliminate prudential limitations on ripeness in that case, but they wouldn't eliminate the bedrock principle of standing. It would be necessary to show a threatened injury. Now, it - -",
  "Several answers if I may. In the declaration on which standing was based in this case, that claim is not made. And that is the only declaration that was made -- that was submitted before the district court entered its judgment. There was an argument made like that after, after the fact.",
  "Okay. Then - -",
  "It is conceivable in a particular case that a person who -- who claims to be injured by that could sue to prevent that injury, but it would not be a challenge to the regulation as regulation. It would be because specific, threatened, site-specific activities in which there would not be notice given in advance or there wouldn't be -- wouldn't be time, threatened to injure them. It would again be a challenge to the application - -",
  "And -- and -- and that may - - that may well be right, but that would be a separate question.",

First of all, the due process clause imposes limitations on agency action, but that doesn't mean that -- that somebody can go into court and challenge agency procedures as violative of the due process clause until there is a specific proceeding going on and -- and completed in which there has been a violation.",
  "There is no indication at all in the passage of that statute that Congress meant to confer a judicially enforceable right to obtain those without complying with the usual APA provisions for judicial review.",
  "No. You -- you would have to -- you would have to show a particular injury and - -",
  "That is -- that is correct. And -- and there is no indication at all that in this statute, which was just intended to modify the Forest Service's intent to change its internal decision-making processes -- and Congress wanted to restrict what - - what the Forest Service was going to do -- that it thereby meant to change the fundamental nature of the agency's own internal regulations which would not - -",
  "Well -- and the -- the Forest Service has -- has procedures for notifying people of - - of proposed projects that were in fact invoked in this case, and we point this out in our brief. There are really two separate types of procedures. One is the so-called Schedule Of Proposed Actions, which includes all the actions in which there would be a decision memo issued by the Forest Service, which includes at least all of the projects that respondents are claiming should be -- should be covered. That is published quarterly. It -- it is available on the web. It is also available in person. One of Respondents' declarants here on behalf of the Sierra Club says that by using that so-called SOPA, that schedule, he reviews every project in all 11 national forests in California. There is also, in addition to the SOPA -- and will submit comments when necessary. In addition to the SOPA, the Forest Service has what are called scoping regulations which -- in which every on-the-ground project is looked at to see whether it needs -- there needs to be NEPA compliance through an EA or an EIS, but also what is the nature of public participation that is required. In that scoping process the Forest Service, the -- the local personnel at the Forest Service, will look to see who is interested in the particular project. The way this works on the ground is an organization like the Sierra Club through its declarant in the -- in the joint appendix will have somebody monitoring this SOPA, the Schedule of Proposed Events, and will say: I see that you have a -- a certain project listed. I am interest in that. Please notify me when you are about to take action to thin this -- this area or restore this burned area. Please notify me. When that happens, the Forest Service then sends out a letter, a so-called scoping letter, asking for comments. So this is not a situation in which the -- the organizations of the declarants in this case have been excluded. To the contrary, these are all people who pay very, very close attention to what the Forest Service is doing. The one declarant on which the court of appeals relied for standing on page 71a of the -- of the petition appendix, he specifically refers -- the only specific projects he refers to are timber projects, and the injunction here goes much broader than timber projects -- but he said that for example, in the Allegheny National Forest they put out scoping comments for a series of 20 timber sales. He knew about those timber sales and he was able to comment on them. And the -- the declarants on whom the standing was based to challenge the Burnt Ridge Project, which is no longer in this case, in that case the Forest Service -- and this is in the administrative record -- sent out 1,300 letters to people who had expressed an interest in that project before it was undertaken. Mr. Marderosian, who also monitors forest projects - -",
  "Anyone -- anyone who claimed to have used that area could have brought suit. Some of the -- some of those -- some of the people -- people submit comments.",
  "Those were people who had expressed an interest in the -- in the project.",
  "And Mr. Marderosian submitted a 23-page comment to the Forest Service with respect to the Burnt Ridge Project, and that is the other declarant. These are people whose profession or avocation -- serious avocation is following the Forest Service. So this is not an instance in which -- in which notice is not generally furnished. I would like to make the same point I was making about standing in connection with the -- with the Administrative Procedure Act as well. Section 702 of the -- of the APA says that a person who is aggrieved by agency action is -- may seek judicial review thereof. The -- the agency action that is subject to judicial review has to be the agency action that causes the injury. The procedural regulation does not cause the injury. It is the on-the-ground activity, the site-specific decision -- the action, the agency action approving the site-specific action that causes the injury. That is what the person is entitled to judicial review on.",
  "It's -- it's -- it's by no means unenforceable. In the Burnt Ridge Project that was at issue in this -- in this case, the plaintiffs challenged the Burnt Ridge Project when it was completed on a number of grounds, that it was not properly categorically excluded from NEPA, that it didn't comply with the forest plan, but also that it had been approved without complying with the -- with the ARA appeals procedures.",
  "Yes. An injunction, a preliminary injunction was obtained, and tellingly, and I think this is also instructive for ripeness purposes, there was a PI issued but not because of a violation of the -- of the ARA; the district court concluded there was a likelihood of success on some of these other objections, substantive objections to the project, not procedural objections - -",
  "-- and enjoined it and then the Forest Service went through the project and the - - and the plaintiffs dropped their challenge.",
  "At some point that would begin to look like FOIA, yes. But - -",
  "But - -",
  "But - -",
  "I believe it -- I believe it probably does, unless you can show that there is an imminent - -",
  "Conceivably. But I -- what -- what I - -",
  "Congress has not done that here and this is why I wanted to shift to the APA, because this is subject to review under the general standards of the APA. Even if we can assume that there would be Article III standing to challenge a threatened -- a threatened, another one in a series of similar projects like off-road vehicle use or something which might occur before someone would be able to -- to -- to challenge it, that doesn't apply to timber projects and other things that take much longer to plan.",
  "No, I didn't say - -",
  "Right.",
  "I didn't -- I didn't -- I didn't mean to concede that there would be standing.",
  "No, because you are right. And here the agency's procedures allow somebody to request to be put on the mailing list about a particular project. And that's the way you make it -- make it known and in fact that happened here. And also the one declarant -- it's perhaps instructive, the only other kind of notice other than this sort of situation where a person says I want to be notified when a particular project is going -- is going to take place, the only other form of notice is publication in a local newspaper of record that each national forest has which shows that this is -- that this notice provision is localized with respect to people who are going to be aware of what's going on in the forest and who are following it. But the declarant Mr. Bensman, when -- for another purpose is noticing or is pointing out this publication requirement in a local newspaper, says that his organization doesn't want to subscribe to local newspapers, that would be too much of a burden for them to have to follow what is going on in newspapers. That's the -- that's the only kind of additional notice the statute ever provides for. The other kind of notice is the notice you get if you previously expressed an interest in the project, in which you basically demanded something along the FOIA lines that Justice Scalia was referring to. But again, back to -- back to the -- you call it ripeness, you call it the proper subject of judicial review as this Court said in National Wildlife Federation, based on section 702 of the APA, ordinarily a regulation may be challenged only when it has been reduced to manageable proportions by a concrete application of the regulation to the individual's particular circumstances. It's the application to the person's circumstances that gets challenged. In this context, it would be the application of the regulation that says there is no right of appeal in connection with the approval of a site-specific activity. If you think the project was approved in violation of the ARA because you weren't given a right -- after you got your notice you weren't given a right to appeal, then you could challenge that in court on the ground that it was approved without following the agency's procedures.",
  "Well, I don't think it is a purely legal issue. The Respondents concede that not all projects are subject to this statute, and the district court - -",
  "And that -- that's why it can't be purely a legal question. As soon as you -- and the district court acknowledged that environmentally insignificant projects are not covered by the act, and so that requires them an as-applied determination as to whether a particular type of project or even the particular project is one that is -- that is covered by the act. And not only that - -",
  "But -- but that doesn't answer where the line ought to be. And even if the government is wrong as to a particular project, that means the line has to be somewhere else. It may be that certain kinds of timber projects should be subject to appeal but that doesn't mean that some other road maintenance project should be subject to appeal. If I may reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Several points, Mr. Chief Justice. First, the Burnt Ridge Project illustrates the way that we think an issue like this should be resolved and shows why the sentence from National Wildlife Federation that you quoted, Mr. Chief Justice, disposes of the case, and that is that a regulation - - particularly a procedural regulation whose only relevance is in an agency proceeding for approving a site-specific activity -- that can only be challenged in connection with that site-specific activity. That's what the sentence in National Wildlife Federation was driving at; that is what Section 702 says; when you can challenge the agency action that aggrieves you and that is consistent with what the Court said in National Wildlife Federation, that a -- a court should intervene only when and to the extent that someone is harmed. This regulation can only harm someone in connection with - -",
  "He was talking about injunction. I was talking about - -",
  "-- ripeness under the APA but it ties in -- it ties into the injunctive relief if I just could address that for a moment. Injunctive relief is -- is discretionary and Section 702 of the APA says nothing in the statute limit a court's ability to deny relief on appropriate equitable grounds. And this is best illustrated by the -- suppose a regulation was challenged by the defendant in a criminal conviction and the plaintiff says the regulation is invalid on its face. The APA says set it aside, but surely the district court dismissing that indictment would not be setting aside the regulation on a nationwide basis. The effect of a declaratory judgment even one rendered in the course of dismissing an indictment, if you call that a declaration, is -- is governed by the law of judgments, not by -- not by a court reaching out and extending its ruling to people and forests and projects that are not before -- not before the Court. And the Burnt Ridge Project shows the way in which this could be challenged. A particular project where there was not an appeal, if someone wants to object to the project on that ground or any other ground, he -- he can challenge that project, and there may be other grounds on which that project might be invalid which is an additional reason not to anticipate a legal defect but to -- but to wait until it's applied. The final thing I wanted to say is about the claim of procedural injury and that this might be like FOIA or something like this. I think it's instructive that the -- that the ARA is not written in terms of conferring rights on individuals. It's a direction to the Forest Service to prepare a -- to establish an appeal mechanism, in other words, do what the agency normally does to establish procedures for administering things. There is certainly nothing in the text that suggests that it was intended to confer the extraordinary sort of right of immediate access to the court for purely procedural grounds. It was just meant to fine-tune the agency's own internal administrative procedures, which Section 706 of the APA makes clear can only be challenged in a challenge to the final agency action in which the procedures are applied.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State law duties on which Respondent's tort claims are based are pre-empted because they conflict with the FDA's determination that Phenergan injection is safe and effective under the conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling.",
  "The -- the FDA, to my knowledge, has never taken the position that -- that, as a general matter, a manufacturer may change a label without -- without the existence of new information that justifies a revision. The Respondents and the amici relied primarily on some snippets of rule-making proceedings and things like that in which FDA has referred to the existence of tort remedies. But we are not arguing for the proposition that tort remedies are -- are pre-empted as a general matter.",
  "As Mr. Waxman mentioned, if -- if the State standard was the same as the Federal standard, there wouldn't be any conflict. And, for example, if -- and not to mention the fact if there was adulteration of -- of the product or if the -- if the product in the box was not the same - -",
  "Well, the position we are arguing for here would not cover that situation, but - - but there could be a further situation of pre-emption, if I could just explain why. I think - -",
  "No. If you -- if you failed to provide it altogether, there would not be a -- a pre-emption defense if there were -- if your failure-to-warn claim was based on the new information that you didn't furnish. I was -- I was going to identify the situation where -- and this has come up in the anti - depressant drug situation, for example, where there is evolving information. There has been a rule- making petition, in fact several over the years, to the FDA to change the labeling to warn against -- to warn about the possibility of suicidal ideation. And FDA has rejected that even though it's -- it's new information arising after the drug was approved. If the information is brought to the FDA's attention and FDA rejects the proposed change, then you would you have conflict pre-emption again. But if the information was never brought to the FDA's attention in the first place, then -- then there would -- it would be not inconsistent with Federal law to have a tort suit based on that. If it's -- if it's been proposed and rejected, then you're back with a conflict.",
  "You would be authorized, but if FDA then rejects -- rejects the labeling - -",
  "I -- if -- if FDA has taken no action at all, then I think you -- you could be. I this it's very likely that FDA would have acted by the -- by the time that -- I mean, I suppose there could be a window in there before it was approved.",
  "If I could make two points about that: The first is, as I said, we are not arguing that there is pre-emption in a situation where there is new information that is not brought to FDA's attention. But the second point is that in the 2007 amendments to the Act, Congress recognized the difficulties with this and gave FDA important new enforcement tools and resources to go after the problem of things that arise after a drug is improved - - approved, that has given FDA the authority to direct a change in the label, which it did not have before. It has given the FDA the authority to order new clinical studies, and it has ordered FDA to set up a data system where it will get electronic notification of -- of adverse events. I -- I should point out in the -- in the one year since these amendments were passed, FDA has, I -- I think, in 21 instances ordered clinical trials. In four instances it has ordered a revision of labeling. It has hired 430 new employees in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to address the post-marketing situation.",
  "The risk -- the way FDA - - and this is set forth in the changes being affected regulation amendment that was - -",
  "But -- but - -",
  "As FDA explained in 2008, when it promulgated this regulation, it's been FDA's long-standing interpretation that only new information would justify a change.",
  "New information means new information about a risk that is greater in severity or frequency. If you have - -",
  "There is no claim -- there is no claim here that either of those -- in the record in this case, that either of those was true.",
  "That's a legal question not a factual. And it was argued to the Vermont - -",
  "It was argued to the Vermont Supreme Court, and I don't think -- I don't think that Respondent -- Respondent has noted that it wasn't raised, but I don't think it's argued that it's waived. And I think for the Court to fully address this situation, I think it would be good to take into account FDA's -- certainly going forward that is the regulatory regime - -",
  "Okay. If I could make just one further - -",
  "If I could make one further point about that. And that is the -- this act sets up a prior approval situation. In other words, Congress wanted the FDA to look at the drug in advance, balance -- against benefits as this Court said in Rutherford, and -- Brown & Williamson, strike a balance and approve it. It would be fundamentally inconsistent with a prior approval system to have a regime in which the very next day State law could require the manufacturer to change the very labeling that FDA has struck a balance - -",
  "Right.",
  "That's correct.",
  "No. The drug company says it's pre-empted, and the only escape hatch from the preemption is new information.",
  "It specifically addressed in the labeling that the FDA approved, and I think that's all that needs to be looked at in -- it's just as in Riegle, where the preemption turns on that device, in that case, and the labeling that was presented. Here the preemption turns on the labeling and the drug that was presented. And FDA regulations prohibit the change unless there is new information. If I could make one other point about Riegle. Riegle does contain an FDA -- an expressed preemption provision. But the reason why this Court found preemption in Riegle under that provision is very instructive here, because as Mr. Waxman pointed out, the premarket approval process in the two situations are essentially the same. And what you had on the one hand was Federal action having the force of law like under the file rate doctrine or some administrative determination having the force of law approving a license or -- or a drug, a legal prohibition against changing that without new information. And on the state side, you have a rule of law under the common law of torts imposing a different obligation. Those are squarely termed - -",
  "No -- no, you cannot. Any - - any change in the wording of -- of the label is a change that requires FDA approval unless it is - -",
  "When there is new information and even then, it has to be in the form of a new drug - - a supplemental drug application to the agency.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statutory text, context and background of section 1252(f)(2) all demonstrate that that section applies to orders granting a stay of removal pending a court of appeals decision on a petition for review. Indeed, if section 1252(f)(2) does not apply to such an order barring removal, it is difficult to see what function it would serve. Now, Petitioner's counsel has suggested that 1252(f)(2) must be directed to what I think had been referred to as fluke kind of district court orders, and couldn't really be directed at the situation that we have here. There are two very powerful responses to that, if I may make them both. The first is that subsection (f)(2), which appear on page 14a of our brief refers, it says no court shall enjoin the removal, et cetera, under this section, meaning that the provision is specifically directed to court orders that are entered as part of the proceedings on judicial review of final orders under section 1252. It's not -- it's not principally directed at collateral orders that might arise in some other class action or some other sort of suit.",
  "Well, I think there were two different types of examples that she gave, if I may. I think the first one was a situation where a Department of Homeland Security officer might have erroneously carried out an order of removal not realizing that there was a -- a stay entered.",
  "The -- the cited cases, we don't think, are examples of this. (F)(2) was not at issue in those -- in those cases. The question in several of them was whether the separate provision 1252(g), which this Court discussed in the American-Arab case, whether that applied, and there was at least one other case, it involved the transitional rules under which (f)(2) doesn't apply. But I think the more fundamental answer to your point was the second point that I was -- that I was going to make. There are -- there are three provisions of section 1252 that make unmistakably clear that Congress did not intend any challenge to a final order of removal, any form of judicial review which would include an injunction to take place outside of 1252 itself. And 1252(a)(1) provides the judicial review shall be pursuant to chapter 158 of -- and that's on page 1a of the brief -- shall be pursuant to chapter 158 of title 28, the Hobbs Judicial Review Act. And then (a)(5), which is on page 4a of our brief, says notwithstanding any other provision of law, a petition for review filed with an appropriate court is the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of the removal order. Unless there be any doubt, the last sentence the in that section says for purposes of this entire chapter. Any time there is a reference to judicial review, it refers to any sort of statutory or nonstatutory provision. So any time an alien would try to get an injunction in any form of judicial review, Congress has expressed barred it not only by this, but then also by subsection (b)(9).",
  "Yes, if I could. 1225(b)(1) governs the special -- what is called expedited removal. It's a special procedure, as you identified, for people essentially knocking at the door, and it has very limited review, as you suggested. Almost everything is unreviewable except possibility of asylum. But it's -- that is the only provision for district court review. It's the, shall we say, functional equivalent of a petition for review in the court of appeals and everybody else. Congress just decided to have two different -- two separate procedures, and I think for 1225(b)(1) it's really a carryover orders of exclusion prior to 1996.",
  "Yes, it does -- it does say -- it does say habeas, but (f) -- there is no suggestion that (f), either (1), which is general application, or (f)(2) in particular is limited to subsection (e). It -- it speaks of any injunction. And that is instructive because the term \"injunction\" is used in the Hobbs Judicial Review Act to describe an interlocutory order by a court of appeals on judicial review that suspends the enforcement of an agency order pending judicial review. And we quote the Hobbs Judicial Review Act in our brief. And as I mentioned before, that is very important to understand here, because Congress provided -- other than the habeas review for this special category, Justice Breyer, Congress provided that judicial review in the norm is in the court of appeals pursuant to the Hobbs Act. And if you look at the Hobbs Act provision for interlocutory stays, it refers to interlocutory relief as an injunction. It uses the word - -",
  "I think the habeas court would have the authority -- would have the authority to vacate just as -- just as a court of appeals would have the authority to vacate. But my basic point is that both of them are forms of judicial review. And if this heightened injunction standard applies to the form of judicial review that Congress has decided to leave in habeas, then there is no reason to imagine why Congress wouldn't want the same injunctive standard to apply to somebody who is seeking judicial review in the normal way, in the court of appeals, especially since Congress used the word \"injunction\" to describe this very sort of interlocutory relief under the Hobbs Judicial Review Act when -- when a person seeks judicial review in a -- in a court of appeals. And this conforms to the ordinary meaning of the word which is \"enjoin,\" which is to prohibited something, to require a party to abstain from carrying out an act. That's exactly what a stay of removal does.",
  "No, I think (f)(2) -- (f)(2) is -- is a necessary condition for granting relief. It doesn't -- it doesn't eliminate the requirement that an alien show -- show harm from the -- from the removal. It's -- it's a condition - -",
  "And that -- and that -- that -- that may well be. I think it may well be in the typical case. If I -- if I could just - -",
  "Well, as we understand the reference to clear and convincing evidence, and admittedly it's not entirely clear how Congress intended that standard to apply in this context. As we understand it it is -- it is a standard of review slightly more favorable to the alien than the substantial evidence review standard, which is what would apply -- one final - -",
  "Yes. But -- but in no event, even on review of the final order, is the court reviewing for a preponderance of the evidence; the court is reviewing the case on the administrative record under the substantial evidence test, in which case the court at final judgment cannot set aside the -- the agency order, except -- unless it finds that no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the order should stand. That's the substantial evidence test.",
  "That -- that is -- the court -- you are correct in the sense that the court is reviewing to see whether substantial evidence supports the IJ's determination by a preponderance of the evidence. But (f)(2) is written in terms of the sort of showing that the alien must make to the court, and - - and not -- not what he would have made to the IJ. And as -- and as we read it, as we try to apply the language in the context of a stay, we thing that means that the alien must show something a little bit short of -- of the substantial evidence, that no reasonable factfinder could find it, at least clear and convincing evidence that as -- that the IJ was incorrect or that the alien has a successful case.",
  "It -- it -- it ordinarily is. And that --and that's why the phrasing, as I was trying to discuss with Justice Souter, I think, is a little awkward. Another possible way to think about it, and this may be what Congress was really driving at, when it was -- when it was saying clear and convincing evidence, it really meant a clear and convincing showing; that the -- that the courts shouldn't take this too casually. As we point out in our brief, the Second Circuit has a standard that the alien just has to show more than a negligible likelihood of success on the merits to prevail. Well, that -- that's way below what even the traditional standard would be. So it's possible to read clear and convincing evidence as really driving at clear and convincing showing, which is language that is -- that is somewhat reminiscent of what this Court has said for preliminary injunctions generally.",
  "They're -- uh -- we do not have empirical data, and I wish we did, on the percentage, but they are -- in the Ninth Circuit in our experience -- again we don't have percentages, but they are granted quite frequently.",
  "Well, if -- if the courts actually applied that standard, there would at least be some improvement in the stay standards, but the courts sometimes apply a sliding scale, where they say if there is -- you know, a serious question and a showing -- a showing of substantial harm would be sufficient. Well, this Court has twice reaffirmed in the last term, in the last term - -",
  "And there are others.",
  "Well, it would be the court of appeals, not the district judge.",
  "But it -- we believe that that -- that 1252(f)(2) allows a court to take the time necessary to rule meaningfully on the stay application. We do not believe Congress intended to divest the court of the ability to rule on the merits. It has a substantive standard that the alien has to make a clear and convincing -- has to show by clear and convincing evidence. It presupposes that the alien has to make a showing; therefore it presupposes that the court must be able to evaluate that showing. We also believe that it presupposes that the government is permitted to respond to it. So we -- we do not object and have not objected in the lower courts to the courts taking sufficient time to -- to freeze the status quo by issuing a short stay if necessary to do that. Now, in the Eleventh Circuit, for example, which has operated under this heightened showing for some period of time, it tends to work out, because when a -- a -- a petition for review and stay application is granted, the court contacts the Office of Immigration Litigation which works with DHS to inform the court on how soon the order might be issued, and then the court's aware of how quickly it might act. So -- so it wouldn't often be necessary for the court to do it, but we did not challenge that authority.",
  "Well, I - -",
  "There are two responses. One, we -- we think it is necessarily implicit in the statutory framework that Congress would have wanted the court to be able to rule on the interlocutory injunction, but the -- but the second point I think that -- that reinforces this proposition, again, if you go back to the Hobbs Judicial Review Act, it has a provision not only for interlocutory injunctions, which is what we're really talking about here, but a provision for a temporary -- for a court to issue a temporary stay upon a showing of irreparable injury to allow the status quo to be maintained pending the court's ruling on the interlocutory injunction.",
  "Well, it may -- that may well be the right answer, is to read (b)(3)(B) - - (b)(3)(B)'s opening that -- which says a petition for review does not in itself stay the order -- is very similar to the language in the opening of 2349(b) which is the interlocutory injunctive language of the Hobbs Judicial Review Act. It says the mere filing of the petition doesn't stay or suspend the order. It says stay or suspend the order, and it says stay, and then it says but a court may -- I forget the precise language - - restrain or suspend the order reflecting pending judicial review; and it refers to that as an interlocutory injunction. But it says if the Petitioner shows that irreparable injury would occur before the court has a chance to rule even on the interlocutory injunction, it can issue what's called a temporary stay to maintain the status quo until it can look at the -- at the -- at the interim relief. Well, if -- if that -- if that background rule is not misplaced, that would allow for some separation of the sort of emergency motion for a stay, a hold fast sort of situation, for the court to be able to evaluate the merits. But when it gets to what the Hobbs Act refers to as an injunction, then (f)(2) kicks in, interlocutory injunction pending -- pending judicial review. So that would be -- that would be an underlying statutory basis for allowing the court to - - to issue a temporary order to allow the -- to allow the proceeding to go forward, but we think it should be done in a timely way. The Hobbs Judicial Review Act contemplates a rather casual, up to 60 days that such a temporary stay should remain in effect. We think in many cases under the immigration laws the court should be able to act on the stay application more quickly than that. I did want -- I did also want to stress the -- the policy purposes that Justice Kennedy raised in - - in an earlier question, and that is the -- the thrust - the whole thrust of the 1996 amendments to the Immigration Act was to expedite the removal of aliens, particularly criminal aliens, but not all -- but all aliens in fact. And Congress did several things when it did that. It repealed the prior provision where that said the mere filing of petition for review automatically stayed the removal unless the courts ordered -- ordered otherwise. And it also repealed the prior provision that said that the alien -- if the alien left the country, including -- that was construed to mean pursuant to deportation order, he could no longer challenge the removal order outside the country. Congress changed completely that and it said you had can now challenge the order of removal from outside the country, and it basically reversed the presumption with respect to whether - whether the filing of the petition for review stays -- stays the order of removal. Congress said, No, it does not unless the courts ordered otherwise.",
  "Well, (f)(1) is directed at -- in large part at programmatic challenges. It provides -- it prohibits courts from enjoining or restraining the operation of part 4 of the INA which - - which is the provision that deals with deportation, adjudication of deportation and exclusions and carrying out those orders, which by the way we think is the reason it says enjoin or restrain, because it's talking about programmatic type actions, and restrain -- the word restraint is sometimes used to be something in an absolute prohibition, just -- just to limit it, whereas on \"enjoin\" is necessary under (f)(2) because it - - because what is being enjoined or stayed is a vary discreet act. You can have an injunction barring removal or -- or you don't. But I -- I think a further answer to your question, Justice Ginsburg, is that (f)(2) says under this section, which means that it is obviously referring to court orders entered in the course of -- of removal proceedings under section 1252, and when a court finally gets to the merits in a petition for review in a court of appeals, the court if it decides that there is a flaw -- excuse me -- a legal flaw in the BIA or immigration judge's decision, it vacates the decision and -- and - - and remands. Injunctions are not necessary in that -- in that kind of review, so -",
  "No, no. The way -- the way I would understand it to operate is that the -- the alien would have to make a clear and convincing showing that he is entitled to have the motion to reopen granted. Because if the motion to reopen is granted, that vacates the final order of removal and therefore there is no longer a final order of removal pursuant to which the alien could be removed. And I did want to respond to your suggestion that maybe the standard should be more lenient with respect to motions to reopen. With respect, I think that's the opposite of what the rule should be, if anything; because the final -- the review of the final order of removal is the main show; and in that -- in that situation, the alien is actually challenging the order of removal. In a case like this where the order of removal was a long time ago, and the -- and the -- the alien sought judicial review of that and that was denied, the only thing before the court is the -- is the motion to reopen. And staying -- a judicial order staying the denial of a motion to reopen is meaningless. In order to get the relief preventing removal you need a stay of removal, which really effectively directs DHS - as we think it does in all cases -- directs DHS not to execute the order of removal that was -- t hat was already previously entered. And also the denial of a motion to reopen, especially like the one at issue in this case, where the question is whether the alien has shown -- has produced material evidence of changed circumstances, that is reviewed as this Court said in its decision in Abudu, under an abuse of discretion standard. So it would be very likely -- very unlike that an alien would prevail.",
  "Yes, we -- we believe it would.",
  "For -- for purposes of granting a stay, yes.",
  "Well, the Court granted the stay in connection with the -- with the granting of - - of certiorari in my case.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "If I -- yes. Well, he -- he did seek -- he did seek, the first time around he sought a remand for consideration of his adjustment of status application, but one of the requirements to be eligible for that is that a visa be available, and a visa was not then available, and nothing in the Act requires that deportation hearings be held up until a visa becomes available.",
  "But -- but Congress was quite explicit; it only wanted one -- one motion to reopen, except in the case of asylum or withholding of deportation. It wanted -- it wanted the proceedings to come to an end. And that's -- the circumstances of this case powerfully reinforce what Congress - -",
  "Yes.",
  "He could -- he could apply for an immigrant visa from abroad. Now there may be situations in which -- in which by virtue of having been removed, there is a bar to his getting that, but that is subject to waiver. So really what the alien's adjustment status in the United States is discretionary if there is a piece of available -- it is discretionary from abroad. All -- it's really a alternate venue provision, where the alien applies from abroad.",
  "I -- I think it would be analogous to what I was saying before, that the -- this Court like a court of appeals has the authority to -- to freeze the status quo while it can decide the pertinent legal issue, and the pertinent legal issue before this - -",
  "Well, as I explained, we do not -- we do not challenge the ability of a court to decided -- to freeze the status quo while ruling on the motion for stay.",
  "Well, but there's -- it's not two stages; it's three. The -- a stay of removal is, under the Hobbs Act terms, an interlocutory injunction. That can last -- judicial review in the Ninth Circuit can last four years, so if a stay is granted, you could have an interlocutory injunction in place for a long time. The temporary stay is just while the court is ruling, considering the interlocutory injunction.",
  "It feels like it.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Six years ago this Court rejected the Navajo Nation's claim for damages in connection with the same action that is before the Court here, the Secretary's approval of amendments to the tribe's mineral lease in the mid-1980s. The Court held there that in order for the United States to be held liable under the Tucker Act or the Indian Tucker Act, the claimant must specify at the threshold a specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescription that the government has allegedly violated. The Court found no warrant in any relevant statute or regulation to impose liability on the United States. In particular, the Court concluded that the approval of the royalty rates in the tribe's lease was governed by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, or IMLA. Looking at IMLA's framework, the Court held that there was no, quote, \"textual basis,\" close quote, in any pertinent statutory or regulatory provision that required the Secretary to insist that the tribe negotiate for a higher rate.",
  "But I think the way to look at it is what the Court said, that it found no warrant in any relevant statute or regulation, and it discussed not just IMLA but several other statutes which -- which did have to do with the economic -- excuse me -- the economic terms of leases, but - -",
  "-- didn't govern.",
  "Well - -",
  "Two things about that. The government's question presented was that the Court could not find the United States liable or -- was whether the Court could find the United States liable without finding a violation of IMLA. And therefore, the premise of the question was, without finding a violation of IMLA, the United States could not be liable, and the Court found no violation of IMLA. But beyond that, the tribe's principal submission in this Court was that the United States had control through a network of statutes, including the ones they rely on here. But the Court also itself on page 30 of its brief in that case identified the relevant statute as being IMLA and the other two that this Court discussed and the general introduction to the Rehabilitation Act. So I think the structure of the Court's opinion, looking at the way the tribe serves it up, the Court said there has to be a specific violation of a - - of a statutory regulatory prescription. The Court found that the relevant one was IMLA, and it found no violation. And therefore -- and the Court also said the tribe's claim, not simply arguments made in favor of the claim, must fail. But if the Court concludes that its prior decision did not absolutely foreclose the litigation, we think it's clear that the framework that this Court announced in -- or reaffirmed in Navajo 1 itself does foreclose the claim here. As I said, the Court concluded that IMLA is the statute that governs the approval of royalty terms in coal leases. On remand, the Federal Circuit relied on two other statutes addressing other subjects, the Surface Mining Reclamation and Control Act, which has to do with the regulation of environmental issues and matters that may arise in connection with a coal lease, and the Hopi-Navajo Rehabilitation Act of 1950, which set in motion a general governmental program to rehabilitate and improve the economic life of the Navajo and Hopi Indians. But neither of those statutes had anything to do with the approval of the economic terms of coal leases. That was governed by IMLA. So the fact that the Federal Circuit on remand held the United States liable on the basis of two statutes that have nothing to do with coal leasing, minus the statute that did have something to do with coal leasing, in our view shows how far the Federal Circuit has strayed from this Court's teachings. But beyond that, we think it's a fortiori that the court of appeals erred in its alternative holding, which was that the United States could be held liable on the basis of general common law principles. The Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act provide that the United States may be liable only for a violation of an act of Congress or a regulation. And it was for that reason that this Court stated in Navajo -- in the Navajo 1 case that there has to be a violation of a specific statutory or regulatory provision. Even as a general matter, under this Court's jurisprudence, there is only a very limited role for Federal common law, but that is especially so when what we are talking about here is liability for damages under a waiver of sovereign immunity, and the usual sovereign immunity principles have to cast considerable doubt on that. Only an act of Congress or a regulation adopted pursuant to congressionally conferred authority can provide for the payment of money out of the Federal Treasury under our Constitution.",
  "Under the Administrative Procedure Act, there could be -- there could be claims brought, but those would not be for money damages. They're - -",
  "Not in the Federal Circuit, to my knowledge, because -- because the Administrative Procedure Act - -",
  "Yes. No -- in the -- under the Administrative Procedure Act -- I'm not -- just like any party could claim -- could challenge what was done by the Department taking particular administrative action. And I think there -- I think that was what - -",
  "No, not -- not in the way you put it. But there are cases that certainly talk about this, that the Secretary has trust responsibilities. But there are a lot of ways in which that concept can be used. It can be used in a political sense in that the United States Government, through treaties or a general sense of moral responsibility, should look out for the Indians, and in the day-to-day administration of Indian affairs, to contemplate a trust responsibility is simply to mean that the United States has a special relationship and should deal in that manner. And under the Administrative Procedure Act, if there is -- if there is an action the United States takes under a statute that governs Indian affairs, that would be -- that would be subject to judicial review under the general principles, is it arbitrary and capricious under normal principles, does substantial evidence sustain the determination? But, particularly in a suit for money damages under the -- under the Tucker Act and where Congress has said there has to be a violation of a money-mandating statute or regulation, general common law principles do not suffice. As I said, for money damages, only Congress or an executive agency under - - acting pursuant to congressional authority under the Constitution can provide for the payment of -- of money out of the Federal Treasury.",
  "I think it's really both. The general trust principles, at least -- at least again under Tucker Act jurisprudence, general trust principles are not what establish the Secretary's duties. It's the acts of Congress that impose duties on the Secretary in this area as in any other, or regulations the Secretary has prescribed under it. Now under this Court's jurisprudence, the Court has said that the notion of trust is relevant at the second stage of the analysis. The first stage is the threshold requirement that there be a specific statute or regulation that imposes duties or rights. If the Court finds that, then at the second stage, as this Court has held in Mitchell 2 and indicated in Navajo as well, that may be relevant to determine whether those specific duty-imposing statutes in turn also impose monetary liability on the United States for violation.",
  "Well, what the Court said in Navajo specifically with respect to IMLA, the Secretary, yes, does have to approve it, but the Court specifically rejected the proposition that there was any basis for liability stemming from the Secretary's approval of the lease.",
  "Section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act for approval of leases is essentially the same as IMLA. It provides for the Secretary to approve the lease. But, as this Court held in IMLA - - or in Navajo 1, the theory of IMLA is not to have the Secretary be responsible or to take the lead in leasing tribal lands for coal purposes. It's the tribe, subject to the approval, and the Court concluded it would be inconsistent with that arrangement for the Secretary to second-guess the determinations that the secretary had made. And the Court -- the argument was made there and expressly rejected that the Secretary was required to insist that the tribe negotiate a higher amount when it renegotiated the lease.",
  "What -- what the secretary has adopted -- has done is by regulation, is to say that -- that there is a minimum that the tribe cannot go below. At the time -- at the time of the renegotiation of this lease in 1987, from 1984 to 1987, there was a minimum of 10 percent or 10 cents per ton. The tribe was getting 37.5 cents per ton. This lease was renegotiated in connection with a clause in the lease that allowed adjustments for reasonable rates, which is not the same thing as maximizing the tribe's -- the tribe's revenues, so the Secretary had a regulation at the time of 10 cents per ton. The Secretary now has a regulation that says the minimum royalty rate will be 12.5 percent, which, as Court pointed out in Navajo 1, is the standard royalty rate for Federal and tribal leases throughout the United States. Now, what is significant, in further response to your question, is that regulation states that that minimum rate is 12.5 percent unless the Secretary determines that a lower rate would be in the best interest of the Indians. So the way this works then, the way the Secretary has implemented it, it's basically up to the tribe to negotiate something at or above the minimum. If it's below the minimum that the Secretary's prescribed, the Secretary has to make a judgment that that going lower, maybe because of a geological conditions or whatever, is in the best interest of the Indians. And that is -- that is borne out - -",
  "That's in IMLA. That's an IMLA regulation. The general regulations that implement the Rehabilitation Act have a similar provision. They don't talk about royalties, which I think is telling because royalties have to do with coal leases. They talk about -- they require it be a fair rental for property, not a maximum rental but a fair rental. And then it has the same sort of thing, that if it's going to be below the fair market value it has to be in the best interest of the Indians. And I think it's instructive that I know there's been an argument that this lease is governed by -- by the Rehabilitation Act rather than IMLA, and notwithstanding what this Court held in Navajo 1 six years ago, but in 1999 when Secretary Babbitt, who joined the brief arguing this is covered by the Rehabilitation Act, approved the amendments to the lease in 1999, he approved it under the IMLA regulations and he specifically said that because the minimum royalty rate is 12.5 percent -- he is quoting the applicable regulation -- \"I do not have to decide whether the royalty rate is in the best interest of the Indians.\" He went on to say: \"But I think it is.\" So secretary Babbitt's approval of those amendments really explains the way the Secretary has implemented the statutory scheme, and we think that's certainly well within the Secretary's discretion under a statute that did not impose any limitations. With respect to the Rehabilitation Act, the general leasing provision of that act, as we've explained in our brief, does not apply to mineral leases. That continued to be governed by IMLA after 1950. But even if it did, there is nothing in section 5 that imposes any more specific duties with respect to royalty terms or any other terms than IMLA itself. Section 5 has to do with surface - - leases for surface users, business purposes basically. And that was put in there because at the time there was no provision for long-term leases if somebody wanted to bring a surface commercial venture onto a reservation. But the last sentence of section 5 of the - - of the act on page 171a of the petition appendix says that: \"Nothing contained in section 5 shall affect the authority\" -- \"shall be construed to repeal or affect the authority under any other act of Congress.\" So section -- and the other act of Congress here is IMLA. I think it's also -- I think it's also instructive to point out not only did this Court hold the last time around that the lease was governed by IMLA, that was the tribe's position in this case. Its proposed findings of fact indeed in the Court of Federal Claims, pages 524 and 525 of the joint appendix, said the lease was governed by IMLA. But the textual dispositive point is that the lease couldn't have been entered into under the Rehabilitation Act. The lease in this case provided that the lease would be for a term of 10 years and then subject to a further extension for as long as minerals are produced in paying quantities. That precise language is repeated in the lease, which shows that it was under IMLA. Under section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act, the lease could only be for an initial term of 25 years and then a further term of 25 more years. It wouldn't have allowed for this sort of lease here and indeed, because the initial lease term here was 10 years and then could have only been 25 more years under the Rehab Act, this lease would have had to expire in 1999, and yet it was amended at that time and continues in effect and mining continues under it.",
  "No. Well, they said -- I think -- the only thing I think they say along those lines is that -- has to do with the form of the lease.",
  "The form on which the lease is used. I think what they said is there were several provisions that appear in regulations under general statutes that are related to leases. One has to do with the property can't be used for unlawful purposes, and I'm forgetting what the second one was. But it wouldn't be unusual that the Secretary might borrow or a tribe might borrow provisions from other leases and put them in this lease. This is -- again, IMLA provides for negotiation. So the parties are free to put in particular provisions of lease. So that the fact that there might be things that would parallel what were in the other leases we don't think is really dispositive. Also, the other significant thing is that the lease itself incorporates or refers to by reference the IMLA regulations. So even if somehow the lease were thought to be governed by Section 5, even though that wasn't what it was issued under, the IMLA regulations would control, and this Court already held in Navajo 1 that those IMLA regulations, which are in the lease, do not impose any -- did not impose any -- did not impose any duty on the Secretary with respect to the approval, approval of the lease. I should also point out that when the -- we cite this in our briefs, that at the time the lease amendments were approved in 1987 the Solicitor's Office did a legal review of the propriety of the lease amendments and that legal review expressly says that the lease was entered into under IMLA. So I think the circumstances are really overwhelming that it was entered into under IMLA and that the Rehabilitation Act lease provision does not have anything to do with this lease. And the more general emanation from the Rehabilitation Act that the tribe seeks to rely on here are too general and short. The Rehabilitation Act was enacted in 1950 in recognition that the plight of the Navajo and Hopi was very serious, and Congress undertook to study resources and put in the infrastructure and that sort of thing, and part of it was to have programs -- excuse me - - studies to determine what the tribe's coal resources were, and that was done, and this lease grew out of that. But that doesn't mean that it was in any way governed by the Rehabilitation Act.",
  "Yes. I would -- I would suggest that this case be reversed. I mean this -- this concerns a -- outright and with directions to dismiss the complaint. This -- this controversy arose in the mid-1980's. The litigation has been going on since 1993, and it's been -- this is now the second time that it's been -- that it's been to this Court. And we think in doing so that the -- that the Court should reiterate the analytical framework that it put forward in -- in its decision the last time around so that there will be no mistaking the way these cases are to be handled in the Federal circuit in the future by requiring that the threshold, a -- as I said, a specific statutory or regulatory provision that imposes duties and not in particular looking at general notions of common law that -- that might arise out of - - out of some sort of -- some sort of factual control. The last thing I wanted to say is that the Federal circuit also relied on the Surface Mining Reclamation and Control Act. And that -- and that, as I said, has to do with environmental issues in connection with -- with Indian leases. The Federal circuit relied on a provision that says that the -- that the Secretary should include in any Indian leases additional provisions that were proposed by the tribe. But that's additional provisions in addition to other environmental provisions extending from the statute that had to be in the lease. It was -- it was just quite a stretch for the -- for the court to conclude that that somehow controlled the economic terms of the leases. If there are no further questions, I will reserve the balance of my time.",
  "First, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to the text of section 5, it doesn't -- it doesn't by any means suggest that it covers mineral leases. The pertinent phrase is that they -- that the tribe or members of the tribe \"may lease\" -- \"with the approval of the Secretary, may lease for various religious, recreational, or business purposes, including the development\" of utilization -- \"or utilization of natural resources in connection with the operations under those leases.\" It's not a free-standing mineral lease or resource lease provision. It says, \"including\" and \"in connection with operations under such leases,\" referring back to business leases or the other things there. So I think, on its face, it doesn't suggest it covers mineral leases.",
  "But - -",
  "\"In connection with operations under such leases.\" And -- and what's above, a recitation of things that don't include mineral leases. It's educational, recreational, and business leases. And as we explained, there are specific - -",
  "It says \"business\" purposes,\" and as such - -",
  "\"For public, religious\" - - \"public\" would be like for a school, if a State was going to put a school on or something, but -- but the - - but as we explain in our brief, there was a specific reason why Congress enacted this. There was a gap in the authority to lease for these types of purposes at the time this was enacted.",
  "The -- the example would be --",
  "Well, the example would be, if you -- for example, if you were going to use water - - this is a Navajo reservation -- if you needed water for a business and sink a well, you would be utilizing or developing the natural resources in connection with a surface lease. But -- but the last section of -- the last sentence of section 5 says, \"Nothing in this section shall be construed to repeal or affect the authority under other provisions.\" And it's the other provision that is IMLA. The regulations - -",
  "Well - -",
  "I -- I suppose they could, but in -- in the terminology, mineral leasing, as we explain in our brief -- that the categories of leasing that are -- have always been handled differently. \"Mineral leasing\" is the term that is used for minerals. Business, grazing, farming -- we explain this in our brief, that those are different. The regulations that were utilized to implement section 5 had never included specific provisions for mineral leases. They have always been under other -- other provisions.",
  "They -- they -- not beyond basically repeating them, but the -- but they, for example, talk about rental value, which is not the way you describe mineral leases, which are -- which are royalties, not rental value. If I could also address the argument about sections (b) and (c), sections (b) and (c) of this Act provide -- first of all, were enacted after section (a), so I don't think much of an inference could be drawn. But there are situations -- special types of conveyances that the tribe was going to make: One was for fee land that it was -- that it was transferring. There would be no reason to think the United States should be liable for that, for what it did with the tribe did with its own fee land, and Congress wanted to make sure of that. The other was that the tribe could convey trust land to municipalities and that sort of thing, and what the statute says thereafter the United States won't be liable. The United States was just making sure it was washing its hands of it. Under section (a), we aren't saying that there could be no lease under which it could conceivably be for a business purpose in which the United States could be liable. If there was a regulation establishing a minimum floor and the lease terms went below that, then that might be a circumstance in which liability could be imposed. But otherwise, Justice Breyer is completely correct: This statute on its face imposes no more of a duty on the Secretary with respect to the approval of whatever leases are covered than IMLA imposed on the Secretary with with respect to -- with respect to mineral leases. And -- and another important point is, as this Court pointed out in the Cotton Petroleum and Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, the IMLA was enacted to bring uniformity to mineral leasing. And the notion that Congress would have implicitly wanted to specifically carve the Navajo and Hopi out of that general authorization and that preexisting set of regulations and cover it by -- by a provision like this we think is just not consistent with the way Congress has dealt with mineral leases over the -- over the years. I also just wanted to come back to this idea of -- of imposing liability on the basis of the common law, because the example of what the Federal Circuit did in this case, with all respect to that court, we think strayed so far from what this Court laid down in Navajo I, that it's important for this Court, however it thinks it disposed of this case before, to make clear that liability cannot be imposed unless, as this Court said in Navajo, there is -- there is a specific rights-creating or duty-imposing language in the statute itself. The theory that has been adopted in some lower courts -- Federal circuit court decisions, which you can look at -- a hodgepodge of statutes, one dealing with environmental concerns, one dealing with rights-of-way, one dealing with this -- add them all up and say the United States has control and, therefore, out of that sort of bucket of statutes, you can impose trust responsibilities. That's fundamentally inconsistent with the Tucker Act, which requires that the liability be based on the statutes themselves, and you have to look at each statute and each regulation that governs the United States in Indian affairs in the same way, under the Tucker Act, you would look at the - -",
  "-- United States elsewhere to decide whether it was - -",
  "No, no. I think that's not at all correct. With respect to the approval of the lease terms in 1987 -- under a provision that provided for \"reasonable\" lease adjustments, the Secretary approved leases negotiated by the tribe at 12.5 percent. The tribe entered into two other leases at the very same time, although not the subject of this case, for 12.5 percent. That's the standard royalty rate. And the tribe got other benefits from this as a package. With respect to the arguments about what the Secretary did on -- on appeal, it's even clearer that all this information about the Secretary meeting with Peabody's lobbyist, it was before the Court before, and the Court found no violation of any statute or regulation. But it's even clearer on remand, as we point out on page 22 of our reply brief, that the tribe was fully aware that the Secretary was not going to -- had -- had said the appeal was not going to be acted on and had sent the parties back to negotiations. In fact, when Chairman Zah of the tribe opened the negotiations on August 30 of 1985, he said, \"It appears that the Secretary wants us to take another shot at negotiating the lease.\" He knew what - -",
  "Well, what the -- what the Court of Federal Claims said along those lines was a legal conclusion, not a factual conclusion. And the - - the facts as described are really what they were before when the Court found no violation. And -- and as we say, it's clear factually on remand that the tribe knew. But again, that was just -- it's not a factual determination that has to be taken as true. For one thing, it was summary judgment, not factual findings. But it does -- it was just a legal conclusion. And at that, it was the sort of legal conclusion drawn from general notions of fiduciary responsibility, nothing that has been channeled or embodied or codified in a statute or regulation. And we think to unleash the law to regulate the day-to-day operations of a vast agency, like the Interior Department, which has to operate by statutes and regulations would be -- under Vermont Yankee and this Court's other jurisprudence, would be -- would be unwarranted for the courts to do and especially in a waiver of sovereign immunity under the -- under the Tucker Act to impose damages liability for the violation of a procedural regulation. And, of course, the Court pointed out the last time that there was no prohibition against ex parte contracts for this sort of informal adjudication, as there isn't across -- across the board for government -- government activities. If there are no further questions - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has long recognized that Title VII prohibits not only intentional discrimination but acts that are discriminatory in their operation.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, and let me -- your question had two parts of it. You said there are too many blacks or too many whites. That is not a permissible objective under our view. The employer's action has to be tied to a concern about a violation of the disparate impact of - -",
  "-- under -- under Title VII.",
  "Well, to -- to say that an employer violates the disparate treatment provision of Title VII when it seeks to -- when it acts for the purpose of complying with the disparate impact provisions of Title VII would be to set those two mutually reinforcing provisions of Title VII at war with one another, contrary to - -",
  "No, I don't think so.",
  "One of the purposes of -- of the disparate impact test, as this Court has recognized, is -- is as a prophylactic against intentional discrimination, to root it out; also, as this Court said in Watson, to identify possible instances of subjective or -- excuse me, subconscious discrimination, and in some cases, to break down barriers that have existed in the past, for example, possibly the 60/40 weighting requirement that was under longstanding collective bargaining agreement. The disparate impact test has been recognized since Griggs as fundamental to fulfilling the purposes of Title VII. Title VII also has another important objective, as this Court has repeatedly recognized, which is that the voluntary compliance is the preferred objective -- excuse me -- preferred means of achieving the objectives of Title VII. Employers therefore require considerable flexibility in assessing their practices and deciding on appropriate action if it looks like one of their actions -- their practices would violate - -",
  "We think -- we think - -",
  "Well, this - -",
  "Well, in -- in our view, the -- in -- in the situation here where the -- where the test has been given, and there is a list produced, we believe that the -- in order to avoid summary judgment and a disparate treatment case on a claim of intentional discrimination, the employer would have to show that his concerns were reasonable ones. It has to be - -",
  "-- more than simply a disparate - -",
  "I -- for example, a -- a gross statistical disparity. A statistical disparity makes out a prima facie case under Title VII. We're not saying that in all cases simply a statistical disparity would be sufficient. A gross statistical disparity could lead the -- the employer to believe that something was wrong with the test. So I think -- but in addition if the employer has concerns about the validity of the test -- as you pointed out, concerns were expressed to the Civil Service Board in this case.",
  "Well, we're -- we're not suggesting that the Court should affirm summary judgment. We're -- we're suggesting remand. The District Court identified reasons other than complying with Title VII's disparate impact standard for the employer's action here, diversity and role model, promotion of role models which we do not see as falling within this framework. But if the only evidence that the plaintiff has that the employer took race into account was that the employer was aware, as obviously the disparate impact provisions require him to be, of the racially disparate impact of the test, and the employer acts in response to that, if that is the only evidence the -- the plaintiffs had, then the employer would be entitled to summary judgment. We think that the evidence - -",
  "We think that evidence of pretext or evidence that there is something else has to be external or something other than - -",
  "Yes - -",
  "If it's not reasonable, then we think that that would be evidence of -- of pretext - - and - -",
  "Well, I think they go primarily to the district court's identification of diversity and -- and role models as possible motivations for what the -- what the employer was doing. The plaintiffs have also alleged that the -- that there was influence on the Civil Service Board external to the - - to the board's own decision. By the way, I should point out in this regard, at pages 166 and 167 of the Joint Appendix, the two board members who voted not to certify expressed concerns about the validity of the test based on what they had heard at the hearing. We don't think realistically a board in this situation should be required to do more, because it's important to recognize that the -- what the employer did here was not what concerned the Court in Wygant and cases like this. The Court -- the employer did not adopt racial classifications with all the potential for adverse consequences for individuals who are labeled by race and promote on the basis of race. That's not what the employer did here. The employer paused and decided that there might be another nondiscriminatory or less discriminatory means. In other words - -",
  "We -- we don't think so, and for several reasons. First of all, the action that the employer has taken in response, as I just said, is not a racial classification response. It is a facially neutral response where the -- where the employer has decided the test will -- perhaps we'll look for another standard which would be given and applied equally to all applicants.",
  "Yes.",
  "And - -",
  "And we -- and we - -",
  "Well, we -- there also has to be some concern that the test may not be job-related and -- and that there may not be other alternatives. And we've been talking just about the prima facie case, but those are important elements as to whether the test is job-related.",
  "No, but the -- but the - -",

  "I -- I think that's a more difficult question, but there may -- there may be a situation where the employer is concerned that his recruitment or his job announcement has had a disparate impact in terms of the -- of the applications that he has gotten. In -- in that situation, the employees who have responded and may be advantaged, like the people promoted here may actually be taking advantage of a test that imposes barriers and disadvantages other people. So when -- when we consider the impact in a situation like this on somebody who has passed the promotion test, it's important to consider that the people who have passed it may have benefited from a test that is discriminatory.",

  "Yes.",
  "As I've mentioned to Justice Ginsburg, I think it would go -- there are several things. One, it would go to the justifications that were advanced by, that identified by the district court here that do not fit into this framework, do not fit into complying with the Title VII disparate impact test, and those are promotion of diversity and -- and role models. That is -- that is one. Also the district court did not apply what we believe is the right test, whether the employer had a reasonable basis for believing that what it was doing was necessary or a reasonable basis to believe it might be violating the disparate impact test. If it did not have a reasonable basis then we believe there would be a triable issue for the jury.",
  "Yes. That -- the district court rejected that argument and whether or not that should be revisited on remand is -- is another matter. We're - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, under this -- under this Court's decisions dealing -- dealing with summary judgment, even on questions of intent, the -- the plaintiff ordinarily has to come up with some affirmative evidence that there was -- that there was in this case an impermissible racial motive to do that. And the -- the district court looked at what the civil service commissioners said and concluded that -- that they did not have an impermissible racial motive, that they were responding to concerns about the validity of -- of the test.",
  "No, no, we do not. There may be other people who had input into the process, and whether the -- the district court evaluated that and concluded that the -- that the input, that there was not a triable issue for summary judgment -- to avoid summary judgment on that question. That would be open to the district court to reconsider on remand. We don't deny that -- that it could go beyond that, but our principal concern here is the analytical framework that an employer who seeks to comply with the disparate impact requirements of Title VII which have been longstanding should not be teamed to have engaged in the sort of intentional discrimination that either the Equal Protection Clause or Title VII prohibits.",

  "Let me also stress, we are not arguing that a denial of the assertion of the deliberative process privilege is immediately appealable. Our -- the -- the submission that we make in the latter part of our brief, and that we urge the Court not to foreclose here, is the Presidential communications privilege, which applies to communications involving the President or his top advisors. And we also say that the State secrets privilege raises similar concerns. Both of those serve functions of constitutional significance. We do not make the same claim about -- about the general government privilege for deliberative process.",
  "I don't want to rule out the possibility that there could be a statutory privilege of some -- of some particular sort - -",
  "That -- that would be -- that would be available in an appropriate case. There are the -- there are the limitations. We trust that a court would -- would grant that, but these -- these are interests of the highest order.",
  "No. Not -- we don't get an interlocutory appeal under -- under 1291. No. We are not arguing for that -- for that position. And, for the two particular privileges that -- that we have identified in our -- in our brief, it is possible that 1292(b) certification would be granted by the -- by the Court, but it is also possible that it would not. And I -- I would like to -- I would like to identify -- and I think Justice Sotomayor asked about - - about a test for importance, and the Court, in its recent decision in Will, tried to summarize what -- what it has been driving at over the last 15 years on this importance prong and whether the importance outweighs the -- the final judgment values. And what the Court said there is that there has -- that the denial of an immediate appeal has to undermine -- let me -- let me quote -- \"has to undermine some particular value of high order.\" And then the Court identified the things that have fallen into that category. It mentioned separation of powers. The Court mentioned disruption of government operations through the denial of qualified immunity, and I would add the denial of statutory immunity under the Westfall Act to that.",
  "We -- I think the -- I do not. And I think the problem is that the denial of attorney-client privilege is tied up with discovery of the sort that happens every day in Federal Court. It's bound up with -- with discovery plans, that - - objections on relevance, materiality, various -- various privileges. One of the important values served by the final judgment rule is that the conduct of -- of district court proceedings like that is committed to the judgment and discretion of the district court, and if a disappointed litigant could automatically run to the court of appeals that undermines the ability of the district court judge to manage the day-to-day - -",
  "I think the more precise question, Mr. Chief Justice, is whether the -- the question is whether the denial of an attorney-client privilege threatens to -- so substantially undermine the values of the privilege to warrant an immediate appeal, and I think, as has been pointed out by several of the Justices here, there are -- there are exceptions to the privilege, which -- which will -- might undermine the confidence people might have in it. There are uncertainties at trial. These are often fact-based determinations that would be subject to clearly erroneous review on appeal. The very sorts of reasons why issues like this are committed to the district court's discretion and reviewed on final judgment when you can find out whether the error actually made a difference on a particular case.",
  "Well, it's not entirely meaningless. It can -- if the evidence was used in the trial and had -- had a substantial impact you can have a reversal of the judgment, and -- and the -- the injury can be mitigated by saying that the -- that the evidence cannot be -- cannot be used in the retrial. That is not - -",
  "Well, again, the -- the question is -- the attorney/client privilege is not for competence in its own right but to encourage frank communications in order to promote litigation in the function of lawyers. And the question is whether the denial of a privilege in a particular case will so undermine that privilege as a general matter to warrant an immediate appeal. And we think the answer is clearly no. And also the loss of the privilege to the individual litigant we think is not a sufficient basis, because the other cases that I mentioned, and that the Court identified in Will are situations where the injury transcends the particular case.",
  "That's -- that's a very important -- that's a very important point. And I think that - -",
  "They are. And I -- I -- I think that supports the point for not having immediate appealable - -",
  "Well, but the - -",
  "But that's the nature of trial proceedings and discovery. Judges may make erroneous rulings. And this Court, again, acknowledged in Will that the purpose of the final judgment rule is no to protect -- prevent particular injustices that might happen in a particular case. Again, to go back to what the Court has stressed, there has to be a -- a -- a value, and the Court said constitutional or statutory or something with a large public pedigree where the - - where the injury will -- will not be -- where the weighing of the costs and benefits comes out quite differently.",
  "I don't think so if there was a statute that just codified the -- the privileges like this. What I -- what I -- what I was suggesting is there might be a statute that would identify a particular governmental interest as in the D.C. Circuit's decision in the -- in the - -",
  "I think and that's a - - district judges are -- are -- who manage these cases every day can see through that, and -- and -- and can be trusted to, by and large, make correct results. It may be that there will be an occasional erroneous determination. But, again, as for privileges generally, that's -- that's so. I did want to make one final point about - - about irreparable injury. For the sorts of privileges that we have identified in -- in our brief, the -- the presidential communications privilege and whatnot, that -- that harm is immediate and broad on behalf of the nation as a whole. That is a different question from the harm to a particular litigant when a privilege is denied in a particular case and it doesn't undermine the broader purposes of the privilege.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: From the outset, this case has been a challenge to the actions of the Florida legislature and its executive branch in enacting and implementing the Beach Restoration Act. That is a conventional takings claim and that is the way I think it is most useful for this Court to approach it. Rather than seizing on particular statements in the opinion of the Florida Supreme Court and regarding the Florida Supreme Court's judicial act as itself a taking, it's best to focus on the Act itself. And with respect to the Act itself, what -- what has happened here is the State has exercised, not just sovereign regulatory rights; it has exercised critical sovereign proprietary rights.",
  "Well, but -- but, in fairness, first of all, that's how this case originated, was a challenge --",
  "No. My --",
  "My -- my point isn't -- isn't so much about whether it could have been raised earlier. It is that what -- what is -- what is being objected to here is a -- is a -- this was not a judicial declaration, for example, that somebody who has littoral property can walk up to the edge of the water and can't touch it. There was no abstract declaration on littoral rights.",
  "That -- that would be more like Hughes. I'm not sure that I would analyze it as a judicial taking. I think another way --",
  "-- to come at this -- and this may even be suggested in -- in Justice Scalia's dissent in the Cannon Beach case -- is that the -- the usual principle that where State law is interposed in a way that would -- would defeat a Federal constitutional right, a court can look to see whether there is a fair and substantial basis for it. That's not really a -- there's no need to fashion a new judicial taking doctrine when you have --",
  "Right, and --",
  "And -- and maybe so, but -- but, again, I think it -- it would be possible to -- to review it under the general principle about whether a State interpretation of State law that would defeat a claim to Federal right would be without any fair or substantial basis, without -- without saying that the supreme court itself has committed an unconstitutional act. It -- it could be looked at that way. But if I -- but if I could turn to the -- the operation of this statute, what -- what has happened here is -- as this Court has recognized in numerous cases, the authority of the State over its submerged lands is a critical aspect of sovereignty. It is held in trust for the public and for public uses, and what has happened here is the State, with respect to its own sovereign lands, has filled that land. That does not change the ownership of the sovereign lands. They remain sovereign lands, and the State has done it for a critical public purpose, to protect --",
  "Accretion --",
  "Accretion would, but -- but avulsion or rapid change would not.",
  "I -- I don't want to quibble, but I think it depends. The -- the Florida Supreme Court's decision in Sand Key was a situation where the State had -- had erected a jetty or an offshore structure that caused sand to accrete on the -- on the property, and the Florida Supreme Court said that belongs to the littoral property owner under the doctrine of -- of accretion. On the other hand, if the State came along once a year, on one day, and added a foot, that would not be gradual and imperceptible, but would be quite perceptible because the State would have added a foot of property. And even though it's a small avulsion, I think it -- I think it would still count as an avulsion.",
  "Well, the -- the difference between accretion and avulsion is whether it's gradual and imperceptible or whether it’s -- whether it’s dramatic or --",
  "Well, the Florida Supreme Court's decision in the -- in the Peppe case relied on Martin v. Busch, which -- I agree with Justice Scalia, it's very critical here, where there was State action in draining the lake, which exposed the surface -- the -- the formerly submerged land, and the Florida Supreme Court said that land belongs to the State, it was action by the State in a dramatic way. And Florida --",
  "They -- they did not there, but in -- but in --",
  "No, but my point was, in Peppe, where -- where there was actually an avulsion, the court characterized what happened in Martin v. Busch as an avulsive act. But you don't need to label avulsion, because there's a separate doctrine that when the State fills its own land, it remains its own land. And I’d like to point out -- this is not a unique doctrine --",
  "I -- I think it is surprising, although the Florida Supreme Court did discuss avulsion, but if -- if I could just make one point. This is not a -- a unique notion in Florida law. This Court's decision in Hughes v. Washington, which dealt with accretion, responded to the -- to the point that was -- that was made there and said, well, the -- the littoral property right is vulnerable anyway because the owner of the adjacent submerged lands can always take action on his own lands that could affect what the upland property owner did. And this -- and this Court said, yes, that's right, but we're talking, here, about natural causes. And in -- in Hughes, the Court cited two cases, one in Washington State, for example, where the -- where there was an absolute right to fill the submerged lands even if that completely cut off access. It also pointed out another case, from New Jersey, where -- where the -- a case of this -- from this Court, where the Court said, you have a right to accretion as long as nobody's filled the land in between.",
  "But once the land --",
  "Again, I think I would analyze it under the fair and substantial basis. But, yes, if there -- if there is no justification in background law, if it's basically pretextual in the same way that -- that any --",
  "Not pretextual, but if there's --",
  "But -- but the phrasing the Court has used in the due process is whether it's unforeseen and indefensible. I mean, if -- if there's just -- if there's just -- if it's just ipse dixit. But there -- but there -- but that’s by no means true here. And it's important that Martin v. Busch was cited in the two -- and distinguished in the two principal cases on which the Petitioner relies here. In Sand Key, the court distinguished Martin v. Busch on the ground that in Sand Key it was an accretion, but -- and it distinguished Martin v. Busch on the -- on the ground that there it was a -- it was a sudden, dramatic action by the State, and the -- and the same thing was also true in the Florida National case, where the -- the court again distinguished --",
  "-- Martin v. Busch on that ground.",
  "I would -- I would say there -- I would say it's tied up with the right of access, as long as the littoral property owner remains adjacent to the water. But what you have here is a neighboring property owner, the sovereign, exercising critical sovereign rights over its property, which has its own property interests, and if under Florida law the -- the State is permitted to put sand on the beach -- this is -- this is not filling for an amusement park. This is adding something that is very germane to the maintenance of the beach, for critical public purposes, the very reasons --",
  "No, it -- I don't think there's any universal theory of this. As I -- as I said in -- in the Port of Seattle case --",
  "Well, I --",
  "No. It varies. And in -- that may be true in the Port of Seattle case discussed in Hughes, where the State had the -- you're balancing the rights of adjacent property owners, just like -- just like nuisance or other principles do. In Washington State, apparently, you could completely fill the submerged land and the upland owner had no rights. In Florida -- Florida is actually more protective than that. It has limited rights. You have a -- you maintain a right of view, a right against unreasonable interference. So there's no one constitutionally based rule. It's a question of Florida property law. And the background principles of Florida property law under Martin v. Busch and the fact that the State owns the adjacent land, I think, not only is there -- there is more than a fair and substantial basis here. There is a -- it's very solidly grounded in State law.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States has participated in this case both, at the Court's invitation, at the motion for leave to file stage and then before the Special Master, primarily on the issues that were addressed in the Special Master's preliminary report, which go to questions of the assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity in original actions as well as the structure of the compact and the compact's power to assess monetary sanctions itself. Today we make two principal arguments: one, that the Court should deny North Carolina's motion to dismiss the Commission as a party, rejecting at this time or for the time being the assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity; and second, that the Court should deny the claim that the Commission has the power itself to impose monetary sanctions under article 7(F). That’s not to say that the States party may not seek monetary relief, appropriate monetary relief, themselves in an original action in this Court. It's only to say that the compact Commission is not a forum established by the compact itself, which is not only a compact between the States, but an Act of Congress, to do that.",
  "Well, I -- I, think, as Mr. Phillips suggested, this Court's decision in -- in the United States v. Georgia establishes the Court is not required to, and in some circumstances it -- it may be possible to dispose of the case on -- on the merits because the plaintiff States in this case I think undoubtedly have a cause --",
  "Well, the plaintiff States undoubtedly have a cause of action for breach of the compact. They are parties to the compact, and as parties to the compact, they can bring an action whether or not the Commission is properly before -- before the Court. And the question of whether the -- North Carolina violated the compact therefore can be adjudicated solely on the basis of -- of the plaintiff States' claim, without having to reach the question of -- of whether the Commission could properly be made a party. If this Court were to agree with the Special Master that there was no violation of the compact, then the question of whether the Commission could be -- could also bring that claim and what -- what remedy there might be for that, either to the States or to the Commission, would never have to be ­ - to be reached. So there is, I think, some efficiency with -- with respect to that. But on the Eleventh Amendment question --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "This is -- this is a novel question as -- as far as I -- as far as I am aware. And -- and that may be one reason why the Court would prefer not to specifically address the question. But I -- but I do think on the -- on the basic principles of Eleventh Amendment immunity, that this Court's decision in Arizona v. California, at least at this stage of the case, is dispositive. Because there the Court concluded that the States -- because the United States had intervened, they had no assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to the subject matter of the dispute. As the Court put it, the tribes are not bringing any new claims or issues before the Court, and therefore the judicial power of this Court would not be enlarged and the State's sovereign immunity would not be compromised by the Indian tribes' participation in the case. We think that’s an important principle, at least with respect to Indian tribes, who this Court recognized in Arizona --",
  "Well, I -- I don't think the Court --",
  "Well, two things about that. In Maryland v. Louisiana, which was a suit brought by a number of States to challenge a -- a Louisiana tax on Commerce Clause grounds, that case went forward on the suit of the -- of those States, but the natural gas companies who paid the tax were permitted to intervene, and the Court did that, notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment. Surely, the claim of the States parens patriae was not identical to the claims of the individual natural gas companies to get a refund on their own behalf, but the Court nonetheless allowed them to intervene, and the Court's judgment in this case awarded -- required the State of Louisiana to make refunds to -- to all taxpayers. So I -- I don't think -- especially in an original action where the State has a certain parens patriae responsibility, I don't think that the claims have to be identical in the precise way that they were in -- in Arizona v. California.",
  "Yes, although I -- I think ­ - I think -- I don't know whether this falls within the precise terms of the Eleventh Amendment. It would depend on whether the compact Commission is regarded as a citizen of another State, which I think it would not be. But, yes, it would be the -- the principle recognized in Alden. But I -- the principles that I am describing here I think would apply equally to that immunity, as they would to the other --",
  "There -- there are several points that I think are important to bear in mind with this. I think this Court has always recognized that monetary liability on the part of a State is distinct from prospective relief, and I think the Court should not lightly assume that States have agreed to have a nonjudicial forum, like a --",
  "No, but --",
  "Yes, and as we point out in pages 26 and 27 of our -- of our brief, there were three -- it’s actually four compacts that were adopted or approved in the very same Act of Congress which specifically provide for monetary sanctions -- or monetary -- monetary remedies, which shows that the compacting parties knew how to do it when they wanted to. But beyond that, I think it's important to look at the overall structure of article 7, where the sanctions power appears. First of all, article 7(F), which is on page 19a of the blue brief, refers to any party State which fails to comply, et cetera, \"may be subject to sanctions, including suspension of rights under the compact and revocation.\" Those are all forward-looking sanctions. But -- but I think what really reinforces that is if you look at the title of article 7, which is on page 17a, it says -- it deals with eligible parties, withdrawal, revocation, entry into force, and termination. Article 7 is all about membership in the -- in the Commission. The Commission's powers, by contrast, are set out in article 4 of the -- of the compact. There are enumerated powers there and, for example, article 4(E)(11), on page 11a -- the only enumerated power with respect to sanctions there, at the bottom of 11a, is to revoke the membership of a party State in accordance with article 7(F). One would think, if there -- if there was an extraordinary power to grant monetary sanctions, that it would have appeared in the enumerated powers, and in fact, in the one compact adopted at the same time that provides for imposition of fines, it actually appears in the enumerated powers portion of the relevant compact, not in the membership. And, Justice Breyer, you asked about section -- article 7(C), with respect to the power of the Commission to be the judge of -- of certain matters. I think it's pretty clear that what that's driving at is the Commission being the judge of the qualifications of the -- of the States and the members of the Commission appointed by the States to participate. It's like the power of any legislative body, the power of Congress to determine the qualifications of someone who’s about -- who has been voted in, should that person be seated. I think article 7(C) is directed at that, not at some power of --",
  "But if you continue -- “And the laws” --",
  "Right, but -- but -- the -- the laws of the parties -- if I may finish? \"The laws of the parties State,\" the final phrase relating to the enactment of the compact, I think would modify the qualifications -- compliance with the conditions and requirements of the compact with respect to membership. Again, I think that comes from the first part of article 7(C), but I think it's -- it's the overall thrust of article 7 that it deals with membership.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text, the context, the purposes, and legislative history of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act demonstrate that it was not intended to apply to the preexisting common law --",
  "-- doctrine of official immunity, but rather -- yes --",
  "Yes.",
  "I’m --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, let me answer that in two ways. First, there’s -- there is a very practical distinction between suing the state and suing the individual. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is not just about immunity; it's about the subject matter of the courts. If a foreign sovereign is found to be immune, the court has no jurisdiction over the case. So to say that the individual is -- is governed by the FSIA means that it would be a threshold subject matter jurisdictional inquiry in every case. So in terms of judicial administration, that is a problem. It is also a problem, as a practical matter, to apply the FSIA's very reticulated standards that were carefully negotiated between the Executive Branch and Congress when they knew what they were dealing with. They were dealing with the immunity of states and the -- and the principals of states. And this is reflected, as Ms. Millett said, in section 1602. That's the business that Congress wanted to get -- Congress and the Executive -- wanted the Executive to be out of, which was the immunity of foreign states --",
  "Okay. And -- right and --",
  "Right.",
  "And --",
  "I don't -- I don't regard the position as extreme at all. It's exactly --",
  "Because this --",
  "-- this is a statute that invaded the common law in the -- the background was the common law in which the Executive made the determinations for both foreign sovereigns and individual officials. This -- and in addition, it -- it affected the relationship of the political branches. It had been a power of the Executive Branch for foreign sovereigns. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act took that away with the agreement of the political branches. There’s none of -- there’s no indication whatsoever that Congress addressed common law immunities, and there’s a good reason. And that is that there -- there are a lot of diplomatic sensitivities about whether immunity should be recognized in a particular case or not. And with respect to foreign sovereigns, the political branches addressed those in very precise ways. There’s nothing in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to take into account the different sensitivities that might well arise with respect to foreign sovereigns --",
  "It would -- it --",
  "And -- and it would -- here's one example in which it would work: If the relief was going to run against the state, if there was an injunction to take money out of the state treasury or to convey land, for example, that would, in substance, be an action against the state, just like under Ex parte Young. If you tried to bring an injunction against a state officer to make him pay money out of the state treasury, you couldn't do that. It's not because the officer being sued is the state. It's that the state is a necessary party to that lawsuit. The state not being joined, the suit against the individual would have to be dismissed.",
  "That's Pimentel.",
  "There -- there -- there is a difference in the operation of the suit. We’re not saying that such an official should not be immune. What we are saying is that the immunity derives from the common law immunity. There’s a presumption against a statute invading the common law, and particularly a common law that was primarily shaped by the Executive. There should be a strong presumption against taking that flexibility away in the absence of a clear statement in the statute. And as -- and -- if the -- if a -- if a suit should go to judgment like that, perhaps the state would indemnify the person. But we are not saying that that person is not immune. A question that was asked --",
  "Yes. To the -- and -- and I -- I understand the practical problem that the district court faced, and the district court was very patient. I think it's important to appreciate, though, the -- the -- this case really illustrates the sensitivities of -- of foreign official immunity. This is -- this is a claim of foreign official immunity by a former official of a collapsed state in a -- in Somalia, as some of the briefs point out. There has not been a functioning central government since 1991. There are a number of factions. On the ground in Somalia, the absence of a central government has led to foreign governments coming in and exercising influence, to domestic terrorist groups, and to piracy off the -- off the coast of Somalia. The request to the United States, to the State Department for its views, arose in that context. This very case at this moment arises in a context where things are fluid, and -- and there are circumstances in which the Executive Branch or sometimes even the court --",
  "It -- such a suit would not be perfectly okay in -- because, I mean, it would depend on the circumstances. But as was pointed out with respect to the suits against the two Israeli defense ministers, in that circumstance, the Israeli Government said, listen, these two officers were acting on behalf of -- of the government when they carried -- that's the Dichter case and the -- and the case this Court had from the Second Circuit last term.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, under international law the -- the official immunity exists for the benefit of the state, not for the individual. The state can waive that immunity, and the state can determine whether, as happened in the Philippines case, that the -- that the actions being complained of were not -- were not within the official activity.",
  "No. If -- if -- if one of our officials was sued in a foreign court, then we would expect the dynamic to play out as -- as I have described, where the United States would take the position, presumably that what was being done was within the scope of official conduct after investigation and assert immunity, and expect that to be respected. My only point is that --",
  "And the -- this --",
  "It -- it was the purpose with respect to foreign sovereigns, but there were good reasons why the court did that, precisely because immunity questions -- as I've said, this case illustrates, to -- to recognize an immunity or not to recognize would -- might favor one faction or another in the ongoing dispute in -- in Somalia.",
  "And so the -- what --",
  "We are not addressing that here. The court of appeals remanded for consideration of common law head of state and other immunities. Suggestions of immunity traditionally have been tendered to the district court. And the legislative history of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act shows -- clearly says that the official type immunities -- using the word “official” immunity, head of state immunity, diplomatic immunity, consular immunity -- those things are not addressed by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Section -- section 1602 shows that Congress wanted to take the Executive away because the government was being pressured by foreign governments with respect to the restrictive theory with respect to commercial activities. And that's where the pressure was being applied, and the Executive Branch wanted to get out of that business, and agreed to. If you read 1602, it specifically refers to commercial activities. There was no such conscious abrogation of the Executive's critical role to make immunity determinations on behalf of officials in the legislative history. And this Court should not strain to read the rigid provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which were just not tailored to the immunities that the Underhill decision of this Court specifically said officials have immunity for their official acts exercising governmental authority.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress in deciding who among the various people born abroad should be made citizens of the United States has to take into account myriad factors that may bear on that question and its judgment. They include importantly Congress's prediction in the case of conferring citizenship at birth, what would be that person's likely connection to the United States. Congress also has to consider the interaction with the laws of other countries where these people may be born. It may take into account equities, potential statelessness or dual nationality. These are complicated questions to which the courts should defer. Now, in the particular -­",

  "I think the answer to that question lies in the Court's formulation of the test that is applied in this particular context, and that is the formulation drawn from Kleindienst v.

  "I think the Court could have no trouble concluding that an arbitrary choice between men and women -­",
  "The -- the ultimate reason may be legitimate, but I think the facial legitimate test also encompasses means not just end, and if Congress is just arbitrarily choosing between men and women or people of a different race, I think given this Court's tradition it could conclude that those would be impermissible bases under the well-established test, but for the reasons we say in our brief we don't -­",
  "Fiallo v. Bell for -- and the cases underlying it and we also think -­",
  "You could call it that or you could call it a facially legitimate -­",
  "I think it is -- it is a test that this Court has articulated in Fiallo v. Bell and Kleindienst v. Mandel to address this very situation, including a situation where asserted constitutional rights of U.S. citizens in this country are being claimed. And we agree with Justice Kennedy that the standard should not be more demanding, but rather if anything it should be less demanding where the question is whether someone should be made a citizen.",
  "We would argue for the facially legitimate -- and that was the case in Fiallo, in which the plaintiffs included U.S. citizens, children and fathers, claiming that, in a very parallel situation claiming that that special privileges for illegitimate children to reunite with the mother worked an unconstitutional discrimination against the fathers of such children. And it was U.S. citizen fathers and children who were among the plaintiffs and the Court nonetheless said that this is -- there is no constitutional right to pass citizenship, this is a question of Congress's judgment about who it believes should be made citizens. And one of the important factors Congress has looked at is connection to a U.S. citizen that is in turn a proxy for what the likely connection to the United States will be.",
  "Well, that was the issue.",
  "I think the facially legitimate standard in Fiallo v. Bell would render a reliance on race.",
  "No, I don't think so because I think that same principle would be given effect in the way -­",
  "It wasn't, but in the eyes of the Constitution, anyone born abroad is an alien unless and until Congress has passed a statute making them a citizen. So analytically, doctrinally it is the same question.",
  "But there were claims based on both illegitimacy and gender and there were equal protection claims based on both. But if I could move on to the way that the statute operates because we think it satisfies either standard of review in this case. And if I could just step back for a moment. As I mentioned, there are a number of factors that Congress takes into account in crafting a statute like this. 1401 deals with married couples and where both parents are citizens, all that is required is that one of the parents have resided in the United States prior to the birth. Where you have mixed parentage, the background of the enactment of this in 1940 and reenactment in 1952 and continued up to this present day is Congress was concerned that such a child may not have the requisite connection to the United States. They have a connection to the parent, but may not have a connection to the United States such that Congress wanted to grant citizenship to that person. So what Congress did in the mixed citizenship situation was to require prior residency of the parent as a talisman, as the Court said in Rogers v. Bellei, for a connection to the United States of ten years, five years after the age of 14. Congress has liberalized that, but that was the basic thought. Where you have unwed parents, in 1409(a) what Congress did was to follow general principles of the law of illegitimacy or children born out of wedlock, if a father legitimates a child then it's as if the child was born in a marriage, and the rule in 1401 with respect to marriage applies. That is true whether both parents are citizens or in a mixed marriage situation. If a father legitimates a child and both parents are citizens, then not the one, then the child benefits from the rule that if either parent was present in the United States before birth he's a citizen, doesn't have to satisfy the one year unbroken residency requirement under 1409(c). If it's mixed parentage, and the father legitimates, then the rule applicable to married mixed citizen and parents applies as if the child had been married at the outset. It's a perfectly sensible and provision or approach and consistent with the way this has been done. What Congress did with respect to the mother of the child born out of wedlock where there has not have been legitimation is to confer citizenship on the basis of a one year residency. Now, as counsel for the Petitioner explains, a mother in that situation who at the moment of birth, as this Court understood in Nguyen, that mother may be the only either legal parent or the only parent at the moment of birth with the requisite connection to the child to have an opportunity for this sort of connection at birth. So the mother in that circumstance is very much like the two citizen parent family, the only parents are parents with a connection to the United States.",

  "Right. And in -- in that situation, I think it would be expanding on a gender-neutral basis rather than singling out one parent or the other. But I -- but I would like to finish the description, I have because it's incomplete and there is a critical piece left out, and that is that counsel for Petitioner says that if -- if a father legitimates an out-of-wedlock child, he is in the same position or that child is in the same position as a child in an out-of-wedlock mother, and that is not likely to be so, and it's not likely to be so at birth. And this is the reason why, is when a child is legitimated, there are two parents who have the strong connection that was described in this Court's decision in Nguyen to that child, the U.S. citizen father, but also the mother, the alien mother in that country. So you have two parents whose interests have to be taken into account. Whereas in the situation Congress was addressing in 1409(c), the situation of a child born out of wedlock where there was no -- at the moment of birth, likely to be no recognized father, have you only the mother. If we -- if we think of this in -- in parallel to the illegitimacy -- the cases involving illegitimates that this Court has had in a domestic context, I think that is instructive. In a case like Lehr, where the question was whether the father of a child born out of wedlock should have received notice of a prospective adoption, the Court explained in that case that the father had not taken the steps necessary to form the relationship with the child, and therefore, be -- be a father in the eyes of the law, then the mother alone -­",

And I -- I think that is perfectly legitimate, because Congress -- because you only have one parent and Congress was deciding, well if somebody has been here for a continuous period of 1 year, then there -- then there is probably a greater likelihood that that person will -- will have roots here then, for example, the other situation where if you had a child born abroad and came home in the summers, that child may not think of himself or may not be regarded as an American in the same way.

Albright addressed the rational basis there. And here, this is not just based on the gender of the parent, it's based on the -- on the complexities in the legal history with respect to illegitimacy, and -- and how children born out of wedlock are dealt with, which again turns not on -- on stereotypes of behavior or talents, but on longstanding legal regimes not just in this country but in -- in other countries, that until the father does something to have a meaningful relationship, the mother is the -- is the only legal parent, or in the terminology of this Court's decision in Nguyen, the parent who is likely to have the meaningful relationship.

  "Well, again, I think this is the issue the Court addressed in Nguyen, in which the Court -- the Court said that there is -- there is a difference at the moment of birth in the potential and therefore the likelihood of a -- of a connection of child to parent at the moment of birth that justified the requirement that -- that the father take a step to legitimate the child, in order to be able to -- to be on an equal footing with the mother with respect to -- to the rights. And here the residency requirement is what measures the connection of the parent to the United States, not the child to the parent; but we think the same point obtains, that at the moment of birth in another country, for example, another country might take a view that this Court did in Nguyen and Lehr and cases like that, that the father doesn't have a meaningful connection to the child in the sense that one would predict citizenship on the basis of, until there had been some formal steps which would happen after birth to establish the relationship with the child. If it was constitutional for Congress to do that in Nguyen, it is constitutional for Congress to take into account that other countries might do the very same thing.",
  "Well, yes, but in Nguyen the Court did not look at the circumstances of the particular case. It looked -- it looked generally to what would have justified Congress's acting categorically as we think Congress has to have the flexibility to do. And -- and I think the questions in these statutory provisions show that there are numerous competing equities and considerations that have to be taken into -- into account. And that -- that is what -- that is what Congress did here with respect to establishing a -- to requiring a close nexus to the United States. And if -­ if in another country a father has -- has legitimated or done those steps, then you have a U.S. citizen mother and a father in another country that is directly parallel to the married mixed -- mixed parent marriage; and Congress was concerned about whether that child was going to be sufficiently affiliated with the United States to justify a conferral of citizenship.",

There was no independent State law duty to warn at issue in Buckman. It was solely a tort based on lying to the FDA. It is a tort that depended entirely on the existence of the FDA.",
  "Well, Buckman was a situation of a collateral attack on a decision that had actually been made by FDA. There was no independent duty -- State law or duty to warn, no relationship between the person submitting information to FDA. It was just a State making the tort to lie to the FDA, and you would have had the State regulating nothing but the relationship between the manufacturer and FDA. Here State law is regulating the relationship between the manufacturer and -- and the patient through the doctor, and that's a traditional area of State regulation, duty to warn, and, Justice Kagan, I think you're right, the question then is whether there is an affirmative defense of -- of preemption, and the preemption comes in.

And in our view it's not preempted if the standard in 57(e) is met to propose a labeling change that is an obligation that extends to all manufacturers generic or not.",
  "It can't revise the labeling, but that doesn't mean it can do nothing. Impossibility preemption kicks in only when it's genuinely impossible, and if the manufacturer could go to FDA and propose a labeling change, it is not impossible for to it do that. At that point it's up to FDA and preemption would kick in.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Vermont statute protects important interests that the Vermont legislature could recognize in physician autonomy and control over information that concerns them. When a patient brings a prescription to a pharmacy, after that point the patient information is protected under HIPAA and under State law. That leaves two primary actors in that transaction -- the physician and the pharmacy. Both are professionals, both are subject to regulation under a comprehensive, closed system for the distribution of drugs. Prior to the time this statute was enacted, the pharmacy had complete control over the disposition of that information. What this statute does is put the physician, the prescriber, on an equal footing with respect to the pharmacy -- with the pharmacy, with respect to the use of the information about that prescriber, but only with respect to the use of the information in marketing to that prescriber. It is a narrowly drawn statute that enables the physician, not the State, enables the physician to determine whether the information that he was required to furnish in connection with the prescribing of a drug will be used in the marketing of products to that -- to that physician.",
  "Well, it's because it's a prescription drug. Federal and State law require a prescription for a prescription drug. But if this was not a prescription drug, a person can go into a drug store and purchase a nonprescription drug just like any other item in a drug store, not have to furnish the name, not have to furnish any of this information. So the information is furnished because of the requirement of a prescription which is of long standing. So this statute is really of a piece with a -- with a number of other types of regulations to protect -- protect privacy, for example, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, where a person is required to furnish certain information in order to get a driver's license.

  "Well, that's why I'm saying there might be a further question in -- in what you're describing as to whether that would be a valid defense in the State prosecution, because I can certainly imagine the State saying: We don't want our rates tested in individual criminal prosecutions any more than we would want them tested in affirmative --",
  "Yes, but unexamined. And let me say, we are not challenging those cases. And the Court, we think, doesn't need to look more broadly to a theory. We are -- to -- to an all-encompassing theory. We are focusing on Spending Clause legislation in a particular cooperative Federal/State program --",
  "-- under the Spending Clause.",
  "I think probably the best way to explain them is equitable cause of action drawing on the courts' traditional equitable jurisdiction. You could call that an implied cause of action under the Supremacy Clause, but I think, historically, it's been described as an --",
  "-- exercise of the courts' equitable authority. The court has equitable discretion, and we think, because of the Spending Clause nature of this legislation, it should not create a cause of action --",
  "Right, we are -- we are focusing on --",
  "Under --",
  "We are certainly not challenging the existence of a cause of action at equity. I'm -- I'm just -- I think we would view it as a cause of action in equity rather than implied under the Supremacy Clause, but I think you may -- you might get to the same place, but I think it is judicial creation of a cause of action. But if I could before my time expires --",
  "Well, it -- I don't think there's any categorical rule because, for example, under Spending Clause cases, you can have rights enforceable under 1983. Our basic point is the Spending Clause is a contractual relationship between the Federal Government and the State, and the Respondents here are in the position of the people asserting rights as third-party beneficiaries to the bilateral relationship between the United States and the -- and the States. Under standard contract law principles --",
  "-- the third-party can sue only if the parties intended him to be.",
  "Yes, and the circumstances in which the Court has made that point and that we agree with are often in situations where you have Title 6, Title 9 instances of individual discrimination that are arising under Federal programs, or where you have a right under 1983 where -- where there is an enforceable right that a party has and is going into court and is supplementing the agency's oversight. Here, under -- under paragraph 30(A), you have only general standards that are really suitable for administrative review, with balancing general --",
  "Well, I -- I don't think it's just a merits question. I think it also goes to the question whether the parties to the contract intended third-party beneficiary-type rights to be able to sue under -- under a -- what is really analogous to a contract. I would also point out that this Court's decision in Maine v. Thiboutot, which first recognized a 1983 cause of action, pointed to prior cases enforcing Social Security programs, on the assumption that 1983 could have been the only source of the cause of action. If there was an implied judge-made cause of action in those circumstances, that assumption would have been unwarranted.",
  "I am informed that it may slip past December, that there -- there has been a lot of interaction with -- with comments on it. I don't know a precise date, but I'm informed that that may be possible.",
  "That is -- that is still pending. There have been extensions. There have also been planned amendments that have been submitted covering some of these same rates. Justice Ginsburg, I also wanted to respond to one of your questions. I do believe the United States would have an injunctive action in certain circumstances. For example, if the United States disapproved a plan and a State continued to -- a plan amendment, and a State continued to follow the terms of the disapproved plan amendment, I think the United States would have a cause of action to enforce --",
  "-- as the party to the contract.",
  "No, it would be enforcing the -- the terms of its agreement with the -- with the States.",
  "It doesn't have to rely on pre-emption in those circumstances.",
  "We think it's a harder question, but probably so, because we believe paragraph 30(A) does not confer private rights, and that would be true in the State court as well as Federal court.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Montana Supreme Court committed three basic errors with respect to all three rivers that require a remand for further proceedings to actually weigh and make factual findings concerning the evidence of the -- of the relevant reaches of the river for purposes of navigability for title. We're not talking about navigability for interstate transportation or admiralty or regulatory jurisdiction under the Rivers and Harbors Act or the Clean Water Act. We're talking about navigability for title.",
  "Well, in The Montello, for example, the question was whether there was admiralty or regulatory jurisdiction over the use of vessels on the -- on the upper reaches of the river, and that depended, in the Court's view, on whether that stretch was part of an interstate or international highway of commerce. And so, it would make sense to look at the whole river in determining whether there's a highway, and maybe in deciding whether there's a highway, you would look to a bypassed stretch. You would look at the highway, the land highway, to decide whether it's useful in interstate commerce. For title purposes, though, the question is, what happens to the stretch of the river right in front of the riparian owner's land? As Mr. Clement said, that reflects the expectations of the property owner; that if there are no ships or boats going back and forth, that that property is -- adheres to the riparian land more. I also think it pertains to the control or use of the beds of the rivers themselves. If the river --",
  "Well, first of all, we're not -- we're not talking about chopping the river up into narrow slices. I mean, I think there has to be a discernible and substantial segment of the river. Often -- often, it will be self-evident from the topographical features of the area. Are there -- are there major falls and rapids over an extended period of time? But also, the points you're raising are -- I think are inherent, because in deciding where navigability stops under any test or in any circumstance, you could have the difficulties that you have described.",
  "Well, I think --",
  "I think it -- I think it may well be. I think it -- I think a -- an important -- I agree with the points that Mr. Clement made as guideposts. I think another one -- and this pertains to --",
  "No, I -- I think it has to be -- I'm speaking of a situation where the -- where the river is not navigable in fact. And that's the test, navigable in fact, not navigable in law. So, if a -- if a boat cannot pass in front of the riparian land, then that would be nonnavigable. I agree that --",
  "Well, I --",
  "For title purposes, yes.",
  "Yes. And, you know, I don't want to --",
  "Well, I -- I think at some -- if you -- if you consider part of the -- part of what's going on here is who controls the riverbed, I think it would be unworkable to have a passage or a portion of a river where you had 20 -- 10-foot strips across the river that are riparian owner-owned, and the State owned everything else, or if you had stripes across a river. So, I think -- I think the test also has to take into account --",
  "Well, in The Montello, the -- there is -- there is evidence that the boat was lifted by -- men got out of the boat and lifted the boat up over the falls.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "In that situation, but if you have a long stretch of -- of river where that was not practicable, then you --",
  "It's owned by the State.",
  "The reply brief I think describes --",
  "That's not an -- I think that's not an extended strip in the way that -- the way that we're discussing here.",
  "Well, if I -- I think --",
  "Yes, and that --",
  "Yes, and the -- or --",
  "Well --",
  "I think it does matter whether it's 5 feet, because the -- because an important point here is that -- who can make sensible use or control the relevant stretch of the river. If it's 5 feet or 10 feet and you had strips that stayed private --",
  "We could, and we have not given consideration to that, but that might be -- that might be a possibility. The United States is not a party to this case and couldn't be -- and couldn't be bound by the judgment.",
  "Ordinarily, the United States would not intervene in a State court proceeding, or if it did, it would remove the case to Federal court. So, that -- that would be -- that would be a -- an additional consideration as to whether to get into this suit. The United States would typically bring its own quiet title action in -- in Federal court.",
  "Well, we would be bound by this Court's decision, obviously. But I was just speaking of the law of -- the law of judgments. And if this Court remands back to the trial court with general directions but doesn't adjudicate particular stretches definitively, then, you know, I think we -- that's the situation that we would -- that we would be in.",
  "I assume so. Obviously, that would be a -- that would be a further consideration.",
  "Physically --",
  "No, I think if they --",
  "I think if they can take it through the river, it's not an interruption at all. But if -- if you have -- if you have something that can't be transversed by a boat at all and it's long enough that it could sensibly be thought of as a -- as a separate parcel adhering to the -- to the riparian land, that would be --",
  "They didn't carry the boat out of the river. These were Durham boats that were 70-feet long and -- and weighed quite a bit. Now, maybe there were small canoes that could have been done. I -- I think a small portage -- again, I don't think it's the length of the portage; I think it's the interruption of the -- of the navigable portion of the river that -- that is -- that is relevant, and if it's large enough to constitute a -- a sensible administrable parcel, that that should be enough. I did want to take one moment to discuss the Madison River because there, as Mr. Clement discussed, the considerations are somewhat different. I mean, first of all, the court made a similar mistake there by discussing the river as a whole and a log float in the middle stretch of the river, but not focusing on the relevant stretches where the dams are located. But it also put a lot of emphasis on current recreational use by drift boats and whatnot, without a proper foundation to determine whether that was relevant for title purposes at statehood, because the relevant question is whether whatever boats are used now are ones that would have been used as -- this is the language from The Daniel Ball -- as \"the customary modes of travel and transportation\" at the -- at the time of statehood. It had to be general --",
  "Well, that's -- that's a product of the -- of the equal footing doctrine. And the Court has long said that the State gets the beds of navigable waters.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals erred in its categorical ruling that a corporation may never be held liable under the Alien Tort Statute regardless of the nature of the norm, the locus of the wrong, or the involvement of the state.",
  "Well, I think the difference is really a matter of degree. I mean, under respondeat superior liability, a corporation is normally responsible, liable for the acts of its agents. Judge Posner, in the Seventh Circuit Flomo decision, suggested that in the nature -- in this category of cases, assuming that the ATS would allow a common law cause of action for conduct in another country, that maybe there should be more limited respondeat superior principles because the action would occur in circumstances were the corporation sought to be held liable may not have much -- much control over it. Where the corporation itself is liable -- and this would be true in criminal law and presumably in -- in tort law -- would usually require some action by those responsible for running the corporation or high enough up the chain of command --",
  "-- that policy --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "I -- I think it's both. Particularly the latter, but I think the former as well. As Mr. Hoffman said, international law norms proscribe certain conduct, but the enforcement of that is left to each nation.",
  "Well, with respect to sovereigns, a sovereign could not be held liable for -- at least for conduct outside the United States, because of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. That's -- that's what this Court held in the Amerada Hess case. Within the United States, if the foreign sovereign committed a tort, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, subject to certain limitations, would allow --",
  "Well, the court in Amerada Hess did hold that, that -- and it made an important --",
  "It made a point that is important to this case as well. It said that while the Alien Tort Statute identifies who the plaintiff must be -- the plaintiff must be an alien -- it does not identify who the defendant may be, and that if there are limitations on who the defendant may be from other sources of law, and foreign sovereign immunity would be one of them, then the suit could not go forward against the foreign sovereign.",
  "Well, first looking at footnote 20 in -- in Sosa, it -- what the footnote says, that a related consideration, meaning related to whether the particular norm satisfies the criteria in Sosa, is whether international law extends the scope of liability for a violation of a given norm to the perpetrator being sued. If the defendant is a private actor such as a corporation or individual --",
  "Right.",
  "Because the state actor aspect of it goes to the question of the conduct. Does the conduct itself violate the norm? I think it's a -- but beyond that, it's enforcement. I think it's important to bear in mind that the Alien Tort Statute uses the word \"tort.\" And it's --",
  "Well, it goes to whether the defendant can be sued, the sovereign immunity does.",
  "Because there is no independent prohibition in international law or domestic law against suing a corporation the way there is for a foreign sovereign. To the contrary --",
  "I was just going to say, to the contrary, at the time the Alien Tort Statute was adopted, corporations could be held liable. This Court's decision in Chandler recently surveyed the -- the law, and corporations could be held liable in tort.",
  "I -- I think that's correct, and --",
  "Yes.",
  "No, because that goes to the definition of the norm. But if we -- if we take -- if we take the Alien Tort Statute, in 1907, the Attorney General concluded that an irrigation company could be sued for violating a treaty. If we take the examples that gave rise to the Alien Tort Statute, if a process serving company -- if one of its agents went into an ambassador's house and tried to serve process, that was a criminal violation at the time.",
  "No. The question of extraterritorial application is distinct from the question of whether a corporation can be held liable.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, our -- our position is straightforward. Just as you said, the question of whether a corporation can be held liable we think should be based on the fact that the ATS refers to torts. And in applying -- this question we think is not complicated. In -- in fashioning Federal common law to decide whether there should be a common law cause of action, the ATS's reference to tort law, I think, directs the Court to domestic tort law, and the question of whether a corporation can be held liable under domestic tort law. And it clearly can be. It could be at the time this statute was enacted, and it can be today.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There should be no occasion for the Court in this case to consider issues of severability, because, as we argue, the -- the minimum coverage provision is fully consistent with Article I of the Constitution. But if the Court were to conclude otherwise, it should reject Petitioners' sweeping proposition that the entire Act must fall if this one provision is held unconstitutional. As an initial matter, we believe the Court should not even consider that question. The vast majority of the provisions of this Act do not even apply to the Petitioners, but instead apply to millions of citizens and businesses who are not before the Court.",
  "Well, I -- I think the continuing validity of any particular provision would arise in litigation that would otherwise arise under that provision by parties who are actually - -",
  "Well, in the first place, I don't -- the point isn't that there has to be an affirmative cause of action to decide this. You could -- for example, to use the Medicare reimbursement issues, one of the things this Act does is change Medicare reimbursement rates. Well, the place where someone adjudicates the validity of Medicare reimbursement rates is through the special statutory review procedure for that. And the same thing is true of the Anti-Injunction Act - -",
  "I think that proves our point, Justice Scalia. This Court has repeatedly said that just because there's -- no one may have standing to challenge -- and particularly like tax credits or taxes which are challenged only after going through the Anti-Injunction Act, just because no one has standing doesn't mean someone must. But beyond that - -",
  "This case is directly parallel to the Printz case, in our view. In that case, the Court struck down several provisions of the Brady Act but went on to say it had no business addressing the severability of other provisions that did not apply to the people before the Court.",
  "Yes, we think that is the proper way to proceed. Severability - -",
  "We think the Court should leave it to Congress for two reasons. One is the point I'm making now about justiciability, or whether the Court can properly consider it at all. And the second is we think only a few provisions are inseverable from the minimum coverage provision. I just would like to - -",
  "Yes.",
  "No, we believe that in that case, the tax -- the tax provision should not be struck down. In the first place, the Anti-Injunction Act would bar a direct suit to challenge it. And it would be very strange to allow a tax to be struck down on the basis of a severability analysis. Severability arises in a case only where it's necessary to consider what relief a party before the Court should get. The only party - -",
  "The fact that -- that such a clause might make it easy doesn't change the point. Article III jurisdictional problems apply to easy questions as well as hard questions. If I could just - -",

  "I -- I think not, Justice - -",
  "I think not, Justice Kennedy, and then I'll move on. But this is exactly the situation in Printz. The Court identified the severability questions that were -- that were briefed before the Court as important ones but said that they affect people who are -- rights and obligations of people who are not before the Court.",

  "No, I understand.",
  "-- blend into -- blend into discretion and, in turn, blend into the merits of the severability question. And as to that, just to answer a question that several Justices have asked, we think that severability is a matter of statutory interpretation. It should be resolved by looking at the structure and the text of the Act, and the Court may look at legislative history to figure out what the text and structure mean with respect to severability. We don't - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, that is -- that is the - -",
  "That is correct, and I'd also like to -- going -- I just wanted to finish the thought I had about this being a matter of statutory interpretation. The Court's task, we submit, is not to look at the legislative process to see whether the bill would have been -- would have passed or not based on the political situation at the time, which would basically convert the Court into a function such as a whip count. That is not the Court's function.",
  "Yes.",
  "It would.",
  "I think -- I think that's - -",
  "I think that -- I think that's exactly right. As I said, it is a question of statutory interpretation.",
  "Well, I think in this case there is an easy answer, and that is -- Justice Kagan pointed out that that the Act itself creates a sharp dividing line between the minimum coverage provision - - the package of -- of reforms: The minimum coverage provision along with the guaranteed issue and community rating. That is one package that Congress deemed essential.",
  "It is -- it is in Congress's - -",
  "It is in Congress's findings that the -- that the minimum coverage provision - - without it, the Court -- the Congress said, in Finding (I), without that provision, people would wait to get insurance, and therefore -- and cause all the adverse selection problems - -",

  "Well, I -- I think -- I think it does, because Congress said it was essential to those provisions, but it conspicuously did not say that it was essential to other provisions.",
  "I don't -- I mean, first of all, for the Court to go beyond text and legislative history to try to figure out how the finances of a bill operated, it's like being the budget committee. But - - but we think the economists had added up the figures wrong. If there's Medicaid expansion, the insurance - - and the insurance companies are involved in that, they're going to be reimbursed for the - -",
  "We don't -- we don't think that that would have any effect. And that could be addressed in the next argument. But we don't think that would have any effect on the -- on the rest of the -- on the rest of the Act.",

  "Yes. It's -- in the past, Congress has expanded Medicaid coverage without there being -- it's done it many times without there being a minimum coverage provision.",

  "No.",
  "No, I don't - -",
  "No, I don't think so, because when you -- when you're talking about monetary consequences, you're looking through the Act, you're looking behind the Act, rather than -- the Court's function is to look at the text and structure of the Act and what the substantive provisions of the Act themselves mean. And if I could go past - -",
  "I think Booker is the best example of that.

  "I -- I just don't think that's realistic. The Court would be doing it without the parties, the millions of parties - -",
  "Yes. No, it just -- it just is not something that a court would ordinarily do. But I would like - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. And -- and I would like to discuss it again in terms of the text and structure of the Act. We have very important indications from the structure of this Act that the whole thing is not supposed to fall. The most basic one is the notion that Congress would have intended the whole Act to fall if there couldn't be a minimum coverage provision is refuted by the fact that there are many, many provisions of this Act already in effect without a minimum coverage provision. Two point -- 2 and a half million people under 26 have gotten insurance by one of the insurance requirements, $3.2 billion - -",
  "There's no reason to think it's going to -- it's going to bankrupt anyone. The costs will be set to cover those -- to cover those amounts that are - -",
  "Two and a half - -",
  "Two and a half million people would be -- would be thrown off the insurance rolls if the Court were to say that. Congress made many changes to Medicare rates that have gone into effect. For Congress -- for the courts to have to unwind millions of Medicare reimbursement rates -- Medicare has covered 32 million insurance -- preventive care visits by patients as a result of this Act.",
  "No, but what I'm saying is it's a question of legislative intent, and we have a very fundamental indication of legislative intent that it -- that Congress did not mean the whole Act to fall if -- without the minimum coverage provision, because we have many provisions that are operating now without that. But there's a further indication about why the line should be drawn where I've suggested, which is the package of these particular provisions. All of the other provisions of the Act would continue to advance Congress's goal, as the test that was articulated in Booker, but it's been said in Regan and other cases. You look to whether the other provisions can continue to advance the purposes of the Act. Here they unquestionably can. The public health -- the broad public health purposes of the Act that are unrelated to the minimum coverage provision but also the other provisions designed to enhance affordable -- access to affordable care: The employer responsibility provision, the credit for small businesses, which is already in effect, by the way, and affecting many small businesses. That - -",
  "But that - -",
  "The question for the Court is, Congress having passed the law by whatever majority there might be in one house or the other, Congress having passed the law, what at that point is -- is the legislative intent embodied in the law Congress has actually passed?",
  "No, I -- with respect, I disagree, because I think it's evident that Congress's purpose was to expand access to affordable care. It did it in discrete ways. It did it by the penalty on employers that don't -- that don't offer suitable care. It did it by offering tax credits to small employers. It did it by offering tax credits to purchasers. All of those are a variety of ways that continue to further Congress's goal. And most of all, Medicaid, which is - - which is unrelated to -- to the private insurance market altogether. And in adopting those other provisions governing employers and whatnot, Congress built on its prior experience of using the tax code, which it has - - for a long period of time, Congress has subsidized the provision of health care - -",
  "No. Employer coverage -- 150 million people in this country already get their insurance through -- through their employers. What Congress did in seeking to augment that was to add a provision requiring employers to purchase insurance or pay a tax penalty.",
  "No, I -- I think it's -- any cost assumptions -- there's no indication that Congress made any cost assumptions, but -- but there's no reason to think that the individual -- that the individual market, which is where the minimum coverage provision is directed, would affect that. I would like to say -- I have pointed out why the other things would advance Congress's goal. The point here is that the package of three things would be contrary -- would run contrary to Congress's goal if you took out the minimum coverage provision. And here's why -- and this is reflected in the findings. If you take out minimum coverage but leave in the guaranteed issue and community rating, you will make matters worse. Rates will go up, and people -- there will be less -- fewer people covered in the individual market.",
  "Those are -- what Congress - - Congress did not think of those things as balancing insurance companies. Insurance companies are participants in the market for Medicaid and -- and other things.",
  "Well - -",
  "-- that's because -- that's because I think this Court's function is to look at the text and structure and the legislative history of the law that Congress enacted, not the financial -- not a financial balance sheet, which doesn't appear anywhere in the law. And just - -",
  "We do. That's -- that's - - and it's not just the text of the Act, but the background of the Act, the experience in the States, the testimony of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. That's the -- that's the problem Congress was addressing. There was a -- there was -- a shifting of present actuarial risks in that market that Congress wanted to correct. And if you took the minimum coverage provision out and left the other two provisions in, there would be laid on top of the existing shifting of present actuarial risks an additional one because the uninsured would know that they would have guaranteed access to insurance whenever they became sick. It would make the -- it would make the adverse selection in that market problem even worse. And so, what -- and Congress, trying to come up with a market-based solution to control rates in that market, has adopted something that would -- that would work to control costs by guaranteed issue and community rating, but if you -- if -- if you take out the minimum coverage, that won't work. That was Congress's assumption, again, shown by the text and legislative history of this provision. And that's why we think those things rise or fall in a package, because they cut against what Congress was trying to do. All of the other provisions would actually increase access to affordable care and would have advantageous effects on price. Again, Congress was invoking its traditional use of the tax code, which has long subsidized insurance through employers, has used that to impose a tax penalty on -- on employers, to give tax credits. This is traditional stuff that Congress has done. And the other thing Congress has done, those pre-existing laws had their own protections for guaranteed issue and community rating. Effectively, within the large employer plans, they can't discriminate among people. They can't charge different rates. What Congress was doing, was doing that in the other market. If it can't, that's all that should be struck from the Act.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As has been pointed out, this Court has consistently held in its flooding cases and reaffirmed in Loretto that a -- that a taking occurs in the context of flooding only if the flooding is the direct result of the structure itself and if it results in a permanent effect on the property such that it's an actual appropriation. So - -",
  "The -- I think the intent point, I guess I would modify that. There are some things that -- I think it would have to be an objective standard. In Dickinson, for example, the -- the modification was intrinsically permanent. The landowner had corrected for it. But it was intrinsically permanent until the landowner had done something about it. So actually Dickinson is consistent with our - - with our position. But I do want -- there is a critical piece about this case that Justice Kennedy's questions have touched upon that I think it's very important for this Court to focus upon. This case is not about flooding by the project itself. The reservoir behind the dam, the easements, the flowing easements there, the spillway, the project is the Government and I think it's fair to say the Government is occupying the land when the Government builds the project. What we have here are incidental consequences downstream from the dam as a result of the flowage. And there are -- Loretto, when it is summing up this Court's flooding cases, makes two points. One, it says it has to be permanent, not temporary invasion; but it also distinguishes the category of cases in which there is conduct outside the landowner's property that has consequential damages within the property.",
  "No. I - -",
  "No, but what I'm saying is this would be a particularly bad or problematic context for the Court to depart from that.",
  "I don't think it's a question of causation, and if I could just point out two cases, one of which was cited in Loretto in its summing up of this Court's flooding cases is Bedford. Bedford was a situation in which a revetment, as counsel pointed out, a revetment was constructed in the -- in the Mississippi River to protect erosion and access to the City of Vicksburg. It was -- it was clearly shown in that case that over time, over a period of 6 years, as in this case, downstream by 6 miles it resulted in permanent flooding of land as a consequence of that. But what the Court said is that is consequential injury downstream; it is not occupation by the Government.",
  "No. I don't think - -",
  "I don't, and -- and let me explain why. What we're talking about here is the Corps of Engineers operating a dam from which it has to take into account multiple considerations. In this case, there was marina operators, there were farmers along the river, there were drainage districts.",
  "Because this is a classic example of the Government adjusting benefits and burdens. This is why the Federal Government was invited in to construct these projects because along -- along the river there was very serious flooding. So the Government puts in a dam to control the flooding, it has to release the flood waters, and the timing of the release of the flood waters is something that you have to take into account - -",
  "I think that's a different situation because the Government itself is actually putting the water -- I think that's very close to being the reservoir behind the dam. But -- but typically, when the Government -- I think uniformly, when the Government is operating - -",
  "I think because it would be -- it would be specifically deposited on that landowner's land.",
  "It would be the same as if they put a pipe from the dam - -",
  "-- to that person's land. But that's not what's happening when the Government's operating a dam, and it's operating it with consequences for the basin. It's not aimed at any particular landowner.",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, it was not -- there is no suggestion that it was targeted at this land, which is -- which is I think something quite different. This was -- this was an incidental consequence of what was happening downstream. Again, in the Bedford case you had permanent - -",
  "No, I don't believe foreseeable is enough. It was -- it could have been - - it could have been foreseeable in Bedford. Let me take a more -- a more dramatic example that I think illustrates this point. This Court's decision in Sponenbarger which we cite in our brief, that a -- that case discusses a prior holding by this Court in a case called Jackson, which was a situation where a levee, Government built a levee on one side of the river which had the effect of flooding property on the opposite side of the river because it - - it kept it from going to this side and channelled it into the river and it caused it to overflow the -- the land on the other side, and the Court said that is not a taking.",
  "I think that would be - -",
  "Unless there was some emergency justification.",
  "Yes. When they go in with the chain saw the Government is actually going on the property and the Government is, to use counsel's term, directly cutting down the trees. I think it's very hard to explain consequences 110 miles downstream as being direct. It's -- and there is no case that -- that Petitioner has pointed to with that sort of incidental consequence - -",
  "I -- I think, under this Court's takings decisions, and specifically those dealing with effects caused by something outside the property, I think it is basically a per se rule.",
  "Well, it would be -- it would be analyzed as a regulatory taking - -",
  "It -- it has certain parallels in that respect in the sense that the Government has to make a choice. It constructed the dam, and its releases are going to help someone and hurt someone. It can't be put in a position where it's going to have to pay compensation every time it chooses one - - one thing or another. There's another point I'd like to make - -",
  "No.",
  "Yes. And - -",
  "I'm talking about downstream, not the -- not the reservoir. And after it goes - -",
  "-- after it goes through - -",
  "Well, assuming it's permanent in the reservoir, which it's likely to be when the Government is constructing it - -",
  "Right.",
  "Yes. But that - -",
  "Well, but that -- that is covered by this Court's decision in Cress, in which the Court said that if you have a situation where property is permanently liable to inevitably recurring flooding, that that's the same thing as a permanent - - even though sometimes it's not -- it's not covered, it is permanently liable.",
  "Well, insofar as we're looking at the temporary aspect of it. It wasn't seven years, it was -- it was -- it was a series of individual determinations made by the Corps; but -- but for reasons that tie into the downstream effects, it was releasing water from the dam and was making a series of administrative decisions about how to operate the dam. It has a water control manual. Downstream landowners are protected, not by retroactive award of damages under the Just Compensation Clause, but by public participation requirements - -",
  "I -- I -- I think, under this Court's current precedence, there would be no claim downstream.",
  "Foreseeable.",
  "No, because Jackson, Spokenbarger -- Sponenbarger, the revetment case, Bedford were all cases where - -",
  "-- where it was -- where it was permanent. If I could mention one other point - -",
  "No.",
  "But I think it's -- we have argued, both below and here, that -- that this is consequential, and that -- that it's downstream and had those effects. We agree with the -- with the Federal circuit, we are not disagreeing with that conclusion, because this is -- these were temporary -- a series of individual temporary decisions made for their own reasons.",
  "Well, but -- but I think, in deciding what's temporary, you shouldn't divorce it from context. And -- and here, the context is the consequences downstream. This is -- this is not -- if you were to depart from the Court's rule up until this point about permanence -- and there has to be -- something less than permanent will do, I don't think you should ignore the fact that the consequences are not the sort of direct governmental occupation of the land like at the reservoir, but the sort of consequences downstream that affect -- that can affect a whole range of people. And I would like to make one very important point about context, and that is, in 1928, after the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, Congress first got into the flood control business in a massive way, but it - - it -- it was unwilling to do that if it was going to be held liable for consequential damages from flood waters downstream. It therefore included Section 702(c) in the Flood Control Act of 1928, which says that the Government shall not be liable for any damage to any property at any place resulting from floods or flood waters.",
  "I think what it - -",
  "No, but Congress -- no, it's -- the point is more fundamental than that. Congress recognized -- and the legislative history shows this -- Congress recognized that under this Court's precedence, there would not be takings liability. The Bedford decision is, in fact, cited in that. This Court pointed out in its James decision, which recounts the history of that, that there was a proposal to -- to make the Government responsible under the flood -- flood control projects for any taking or any damage to property. And this Court said that went way beyond anything the Fifth Amendment would require, and it was cut back. And Congress said it's not going to be liable for any damage. And I think that shows a very important reliance interest on the part of Congress with respect to the line that this Court has drawn. Congress was not going to - -",
  "I don't believe that that's correct. I mean, that -- that would turn on the happenstance of what a particular landowner had -- had on his property downstream. And -- and I think the Government, in operating the general project, cannot be held to do an investigation of every property owner. Again, it's releasing water generally. And if we -- maybe if I could use the levee example here. This -- the release changes that were made here were made to protect farmers so that they could - - so that they could plant more crops and not -- and be protected during their harvesting. If you shift back to what the Corps -- to the Corps' regular operating scheme, it affects the farmers. There might be a flood - -",
  "It is in the nature - -",
  "It is in the nature of living along a river. Riparian ownership carries with it certain risks and uncertainties, from weather, from intervening causes. The Government is -- there are a thousand square miles, more square miles of drainage area - -",
  "Well, when -- picking up on what I said about Congress, Congress would not have gotten into the flood control business without this protection of liability. People - -",
  "Well, this Court in James said it was an important condition for Congress getting into it, that it was not -- Congress was not going to be held liable for the -- for the damages downstream. That came to be the basis, the baseline, of expectations for people downstream from - -",
  "Well, if it's -- but the construction of the project itself and the flooding of the reservoir, the Government condemns that land, purchases that land. It recognizes - -",
  "Well, the question would be whether it falls within the Cress test of whether it is permanently liable.",
  "It -- it was basically -- I mean, it was the rationale of this Court's cases in - - in Bedford, in Sponenbarger, and reaffirmed by this Court in Loretto, a modern takings case dealing with the question of physical occupation. And the Court said that -- and it made two points. Again, it said -- it made the temporary versus permanent point, but it also made the point about conduct outside the land that has an effect inside the land. This case has both of those features. You have a series of temporary decisions - -",
  "Well, again, it depends. If the Government -- if the Government is occupying the land when it happens, yes. But there's -- as you've I think pointed out, there's a critical difference between a tort and a taking. And there -- there can be collateral consequences of what the Government does that -- that cause injury.",
  "I think it would depend on whether -- and there was a -- a case -- I believe it's the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad - -",
  "It says if the -- it had to do with releasing smoke from -- from a train. And the Court said just -- just releasing it into the air - -",
  "-- but -- but if you focus it on someone - -",
  "If -- if you pipe it -- if you pipe it to the person's property, that's a -- that may be a different matter.",
  "It was focused, and that's not -- not true in the operation of the dam.",
  "They're not focusing it on his land. His land -- first of all, the commission's land has always been subject to flooding and, as we pointed out in our brief, even under -- even under Petitioner's analysis, it results in an incremental flooding of 5, 4 or -- 3 or 4 days.",
  "But it is land -- it is land in a floodplain that would be suitable for any sort of construction or development. It is land in a floodplain. And they have -- they have not argued, and in fact, their appraiser in this case acknowledged, that there is no permanent decrease in the valuation of the land. They are -- they are arguing only about trees. And that is -- that seems classic consequential tort-type damages, that -- that flood waters, it -- we'll assume in somewhat greater increments, went on the land and damaged trees. They didn't damage the land. In fact, the commission - - there was still hunting on the land during this period of time.",
  "Yes. Because - -",
  "First of all, the Court - - the Court did not say that the Government knew. In fact, it said the Government was unaware -- this discussion's between 95a and 99a in the Court of Federal Claims decision -- that the Government was unaware in - - in 1993.",
  "The taking goes -- the taking claim here goes from 1993 to 1998. The Court of Federal Claims said even as of 19 -- at least until 1996, it was generally assumed that the operations of the dam did not have a significant impact below the Missouri-Arkansas line. Again, this is 110 miles downstream. This was in no way focused on the -- on the commission's land, but - -",
  "I think there's a -- I don't know about the \"intend.\" I mean, in the hypothetical with the Chief Justice the Government was actually transmitting the water. It was essentially using the land as -- as a reservoir. And that -- that's, I think, what Petitioner's counsel was trying to conjure up by saying the Government was using this land for storage. The Government was not using this land for storage. The -- this wasn't the Government's water. There weren't any outtakes from the commission's land to use this water. These were flood waters, which again the Flood Control Act says the Government is not liable for the release of flood waters from a project, that ended up on the land that is an incidental consequence of the operation of a flood control project. People who live in a basin where there is a flood control project get enormous benefits in the control of that. The water has to be released. And it has long been the case that the way that problem is - - that issue is handled about how it will be released is by ordinary administrative law principles, basically, with the Corps, in operating the dam, they have requirements of public participation. In this case, the commission participated on ad hoc planning groups. This manual had not been updated in 50 years. Corps regulations say that manuals should be updated to keep apace of changing circumstances, population changes, different uses, environmental concerns, so that when that happens, the commission acted responsibly here and, had - -",
  "I think that's the consequence of this -- but there's no -- the Court doesn't have to decide that here.",
  "That -- that's I think the necessary consequence of this Court's holdings in Bedford, in Bedford and related cases. And -- it may have harshness in some circumstances. But again, when you live on a river and you know the consequences of having a flood control project on the river, that - - that's what happens, but this is not arbitrary. There is this planning process. There is notice and comment. There's NEPA - -",
  "No, that's not -- that's not what happens. What the Corps was working for here, it's commendable. The Corps was trying to develop a consensus of downstream water users, which is why it convened this ad hoc working group: The commission drainage districts, representatives of farmers, the marina, the Corps of Engineers, getting everybody together to try to come up with a -- with a way to handle the problem. And - -",
  "Well - -",
  "No. He doesn't lose because he has an action under the Administrative Procedure Act. He's not -- the -- the Corps is required to take into account various factors including, specifically, the impact on other people in the basin when it's making a decision. If the Corps - -",
  "Well, the Corps cannot be arbitrary in doing that.",
  "But the -- but the Corps requires a broad ambit of discretion in managing a river over time, and it has to be able to change to update circumstances without exposing the United States to massive liability.",
  "We have two submissions. I mean, it's the confluence of both factors mentioned in Loretto. And the Court doesn't have to decide anything broader than that. It's the temporary nature of the decisions. These were individual decisions made often with a recommendation or concurrence of the ad hoc committee. So it's temporary in nature -- self limiting, as everyone knew as part of this ongoing planning process -- but, also, particularly in this case, where it has only consequential effects downstream, which is, again, the way the Court - - including in Lionel, one of the leading cases -- the Court says that this is consequential.",
  "I don't think analytically, for the reasons I said about -- about the downstream; but, to the extent the Court is focusing on temporary, these were self-limiting, and there was no guarantee they were going to be renewed. And, in fact, at the end of this process, the court -- or the Corps decided not to adopt a permanent change after going through the NEPA process.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under Part A of the Medicare program, the Federal government pays out more than $230 billion annually to more than 30,000 institutional providers, including more than 6,000 hospitals. The total amount to which each of these providers is entitled is determined by a fiscal intermediary on the basis of a cost report. The statute provides that a provider may obtain a hearing before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, only if he appeals the intermediary's determination with -- within 180 days. For the almost 40 years of the existence of the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, the Secretary, pursuant to her broad rulemaking authority, has prohibited the board from extending that period, and instead required dismissal of the appeal, except as specifically provided in the Secretary's own regulations.",
  "Well, the 180-day limitation here is not a limitation applied to suits filed in court, in which the court is the relevant tribunal, and the court has -- has itself construed the statute's regulating access to the courts or the appellate courts as a matter -- a matter of internal judicial administration. This deadline governs an appeal within the Department of Health and Human Services, and that is something that Congress has delegated the responsibility to the Secretary to construe the relevant statutes and to adopt the relevant regulations pursuant to her broad rulemaking authority. So in -- in this setting, it is the board that is the relevant tribunal, and the rules governing the board's jurisdiction are established --",
  "Excuse me.",
  "Well, I --",
  "Well, I was responding to -- first of all, the -- the Secretary's regulations have, from the outset, referred to these limitations as limitations on the board's jurisdiction. This is -- this is set forth in the -- in the regulations promulgated --",
  "Right. And we -- and we clearly believe that equitable tolling does not apply. That would be fundamentally inconsistent.",
  "There is nothing incompatible between a good cause -- a limited good cause extension and a jurisdictional rule. For example, in -- in the several cases that this Court has considered finding provisions to be jurisdictional, the time for taking an appeal and the time for petitioning for certiorari are both jurisdictional, but both allow extensions for good cause. In fact, this Court's decision in Bowles involved the extension for good cause. So the question here for the Secretary -- and, again, this is just a narrow question of good cause. It in no way suggests that equitable tolling would be -- would be permitted. The narrow question is whether the Secretary permissibly construed the statute to allow a comparable good cause exception, where -- where something akin to an act of God would prevent the provider from actually appealing within the requisite period of time, just like the district court can extend the appeal period.",
  "Well, I mean, there are a number of differences there. I think, technically, it was not intra-agency. It was an appeal from the Board of Veterans Appeals to the Court of Veterans Appeals, which is a separate body. It is not something under the jurisdiction of the VA. The VA was not given rulemaking authority over that, unlike here, where the board is under the Secretary's jurisdiction, and, in fact, she has adopted regulations that have been in place for 40 years, which have expressly barred any extensions and treated that limitation as jurisdictional. Also, very much unlike Henderson, this statute is not one comparable to a statute regulating benefits for veterans, to which there has always been a solicitude by Congress and the courts --",
  "Well, I think, in Henderson, there would have been the problem that the rule, as I understand it, was a rule to -- for appealing to the Court, which was outside the -- the Secretary's rulemaking authority; whereas, here, this is a body within HHS over which the Secretary has rulemaking authority. But, yes, we -- we think that the Secretary clearly had -- and she has very broad legislative rulemaking authority under this statute -- has the authority to adopt strict limitations, as she has done on that --",
  "I -- we don't think that she could have. We think that, as we say in our brief, quite aside from the Secretary's regulation, we believe the sort of open-ended equitable tolling that the court of appeals has imposed on this program for the first time in 40 years is fundamentally inconsistent with a need for repose, especially given the sophisticated nature of these providers, as this Court noted in the Your Home nursing home case --",
  "Yes. We -- we certainly do believe that. For -- for -- in the first place, most agency time limits are established by the agency itself, pursuant to regulation. So if there had been no statutory 180-day limitation period here and the Secretary had adopted a regulation imposing that, then whether -- and the extent to which that provision would be open to extensions for good cause, for some degree of equitable tolling, whatever the factors, would be up to the Secretary in construing her own regulation --",
  "Well, as you say, we do not -- we do not agree with that. And the findings by the district court in this case, which was the same district judge who sat in the Baystate case, disagreed with that -- with that conclusion.",
  "Well, it -- it may be more difficult. This was a situation which required the matching of data between CMS and the Social Security administrative -- massive data files of 11 million Medicare claims, I think 6 million SSI claims. And when you have two agencies matching something, there will be errors. And the -- the providers did not know --",
  "There -- it --",
  "There may be -- there may be situations in which the provider would not know that, but the need -- but the need for finality under this program, we think, requires an across-the-board rule. Otherwise, a provider could come in -- as this Court suggested in the Your Home case, circumstances --",
  "Well --",
  "First of all, we do not believe this is an ordinary claims processing rule. We believe that this is a jurisdictional limitation imposed by the -- by Congress, interpreted by the Court to allow this narrow exception. So we do not believe that --",
  "But with -- yes, we do believe that the Secretary, in the interest of -- of finality, can impose that sort of limitation. There's a presumption of regularity in the -- in the operation of -- administration of Federal programs. There are criminal sanctions.",
  "Yes. We -- we believe the Secretary would be -- would be required to, and we think may well be compelled to. But let me point out, if there was that sort of extraordinary circumstance, then either Congress or the Secretary could provide a special remedy in that situation. If there was an inspector general's report that showed widespread fraud in something, I think Congress or the Secretary could be expected to respond to that in an appropriate way. The question is whether the hard and fast rules that have been adopted should be -- should be open to general equitable tolling principles.",
  "Insofar as the board is concerned. The board has said and the Secretary has said that the board -- this is jurisdictional, and the board has no equitable powers to --",
  "As I said, in -- in Bowles, the Court was dealing with the jurisdictional time limit for an appeal, but there was a comparable -- there is a comparable statutory provision for the Court to extend that period for good cause. It remains jurisdictional. That was the point in Bowles. It was -- there was a question of whether the --",
  "Right. And -- and the -- the question is -- some time limitations have been understood to contain explicit -- excuse me, explicit or implicit authorizations for the tribunal concerned. And this --",
  "Right. This is a mandatory -- this is a mandatory -- even if nonjurisdictional, it is a mandatory limitation. And the question is whether the statute contains an implicit authorization, whether the Secretary could permissibly construe it to allow for this narrow good cause exception comparable to the one for extending the time --",
  "Yes, that is --",
  "-- that is -- that is correct. But we -- but I think it's also important to recognize that the -- that this statute was enacted, the regulations were adopted before this Court's recent jurisprudence identifying some things as jurisdictional, some things as claim processing, primarily focusing on the judicial situation. Here, we have a statute governing procedures in an administrative agency and regulations adopted at a time before that -- that bifurcated way of looking at things arose.",
  "That's --- that's correct. And I want to make clear that under, whatever the answer to that precise question, the Respondents in this case lose because whether -- if it's an absolute rule to which there can be no exception or the Secretary's regulation allowing a limited exception is valid, in no case would the sort of open-ended tolling regime that the court of appeals imposed be permissible. If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. --",
  "I -- I think that's unclear under the current regulation. The current regulation is written in terms of good cause for something that prevents the actual filing of the appeal, like a fire or destruction of records or something.",
  "No, no. But that hasn't been tested as to whether it could. But that's not the only avenue. In fact, the predominant avenue for raising claims of -- of new and material evidence, which at bottom this is, evidence that -- that there was not the best evidence used in this match, is the reopening regulation, and that's the regulation that was addressed by this Court in the Your Home case. There, the Court made clear that it was a matter of grace, not statutory compulsion, that the Secretary allowed for any reopening at all of past cost reports. This sort of claim of new evidence, for whatever reason it wasn't available, could be raised under that. But this Court held in -- in Your Home, that a denial of a reopening was not even appealable to the board at all or subject to judicial review for reasons of finality and certainty, that, at some point, the cost years have to be closed. And the Court specifically pointed out that to allow administrative and judicial review of a denial of reopening would circumvent the very 180-day limitation that we have at issue here. What Respondents are trying to do is to come up with another way of circumventing that 180-day limitation by superimposing, for the first time in 40 years, an open-ended equitable tolling regime in this situation. The Respondents here are seeking to recalculate payment years back to 1987. The only reason it goes back no further is that's when the DSH payments began. DSH payments, by the way, go to 80 percent of hospitals. It's not some limited category. And what is being claimed here is -- is a mismatch of a legislative type. It's not some concealment from an individual provider. With respect to the allegations in the complaint, I'm not in a position to spend time refuting them here. We have a footnote in our reply brief that refers to the government's summary judgment motion in which the allegations of misconduct are -- are addressed. I would like to say that -- that whatever label one attaches, jurisdiction, claims processing, mandating, it's absolutely clear that, from the outset of this program, the Secretary understood and implemented the 180-day time limit as limiting the board's authority. It says an appeal shall be dismissed if it's not filed within 180 days. No extension shall be granted if requested after -- after 3 years. That 3 years -- Respondent has conceded a regulation that provides for coming in within 3 years to address matters of fraud or anything else would be valid. That's what this regulation does. And we think there is no plausible argument at this late date in the Medicare program to suggest that a 3-year limitation on -- on revisiting of closed cost reports is arbitrary and capricious under -- under this Court's decisions. And if we're wrong, as I said, about the validity of the Secretary's narrow good cause regulation, which simply parallels what's in jurisdictional provisions -- for example, notices of appeal -- if the Secretary has no authority to do even that, then the result is the same, there is no broad equitable tolling. Just one side comment on this Bradford opinion, that did not involve the 180-day limitation. That involved a regulatory provision. The Secretary's consistent position has been, as we cite in the brief, that the 180-day limitation is not subject to any equitable extensions at all because the board is not an equitable body. And the Medicare program, like the tax program in Brockamp, is not one in which equities are taken into account. You need absolute rules. Allegations of fraud or concealment are easy to make, but they can -- they can lead to widespread delayed litigation, as the Baystate litigation shows, requiring calling of witnesses -- in this case, 20 years ago -- what happened 15 or 20 years ago. You would have a hospital-by-hospital determination of when did the hospital know or have reason to know what happened. And we think that that's -- could be chaotic in a program like this.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to emphasize, at the outset, that Petitioner's argument that Nollan and Dolan should apply in this context would -- would constitute a radical change in the -- in the way standard generally applicable regulatory programs are operated. It is standard procedure, when someone applies for a permit from the government, it is the permit applicant's burden to establish that he complies with the regulatory program. Nollan and Dolan shift that burden to the government. That has never been the case under regulation, including land use regulation.",
  "If -- if --",
  "That is what -- if -- if the permit had issued and the -- and an easement was granted, yes, it was the easement.",
  "The -- the basis of the -- the theory of Nollan and Dolan -- and the Court made this clear in -- in Lingle -- and in Del Monte Dunes, for that matter -- is those two cases apply in a specific situation where there is an exaction of a right of access, an easement for the public to enter the land as a condition. And the -- the reason for that, the Court explained in Lingle -- there are really two reinforcing points. The first was that there would be public access, which is a permanent physical occupation, which is one of -- one of the exceptions to the general Penn Central test for regulatory takings. The other is that it was a per se taking. The -- it -- it was per se that the government could not have acquired that easement for paying -- without paying compensation; therefore, the government could not attach as a condition to the granting of a permit that the person convey something, unless it was proportional. So the -- the theory began with the idea that the easement itself would have been -- the taking of that would have been a per se taking. This is a very different situation because the other way in which Petitioner's theory would constitute a radical departure is that compliance with regulatory programs frequently, maybe almost always, requires the expenditure of money. If someone wants to build a power plant -- a coal-fired power plant, he's going to have to install a scrubber to protect the air, to prevent no -- diminution of air quality. Constructing that costs money. It can't be that the requirement to spend money to comply with a regulatory program is itself a taking. The taking would be --",
  "I think, in that situation, there would be a very substantial equal protection challenge because one landowner is being singled out with no rational basis --",
  "Well, that -- that -- it applies when there is an identifiable property taken. If the --",
  "Right, right.",
  "Well, certainly --",
  "Certainly --",
  "Certainly, a Penn Central argument could be made there, but I think that's very different from a Nollan argument --",
  "-- which -- which imposes the -- the burden on the government and, basically, treats the -- the payment of money as, itself, a taking.",
  "Yes. And this is not even an obligation to pay money. It's an obligation to spend money to come into compliance.",
  "We -- we think --",
  "No. If the -- if the agency decision is written where there is an express condition, we don't think that it matters -- an express condition satisfying Nollan and Dolan; in other words, an exaction, a per se taking, we don't think it matters whether the -- whether it's a permit grant or permit denial. There was no actual taking in the sense that compensation would be owed, but it could be challenged as an unconstitutional condition under the Nollan and Dolan analysis. But we think it's critical, when thinking about that, that the -- that the permit denial -- that only applies if the permit denial expressly is based on the condition because, otherwise, you would get into a situation of negotiations and what was discussed and -- and liability could turn on an exchange of ideas; whereas it should turn on the formality of the agency's final decision. It's akin to the Williamson County final decision requirements.",
  "Well, if you look at the -- the orders denying the permit applications in the record at -- I believe it's 49 to 51 and 59 to 61. In those situations, it says the permits were denied because the plaintiff did not give the reasonable assurances that the statute requires in order to get the permit -- the reasonable assurances of -- of no loss of wetlands functions. One of the ways --",
  "But the ultimate standard under the statute is whether he has provided reasonable assurances. What assurances -- the way in which he goes about it, whether offsite or onsite -- the offsite part just arises because this is a wetlands case. Normal regulation wouldn't raise the offsite -- onsite problem. But the ultimate question is he didn't carry his burden of establishing no net loss of wetlands.",
  "I think it's clearly not like the Shriners -- the Shriners Hospital --",
  "But I did want to come back to Justice Scalia's question. The permit -- permit denials -- just general permit denials, the Court made clear, in Del Monte Dunes, are not covered by Nollan and Dolan. They are covered by Penn Central. And the Court made clear, in Nollan, that the Court could have denied the permit without attaching the condition. We think it's important that the agency always have that option. And the third point is --",
  "Well, I don't think so agency actually wants to get the easement. But this Court, in Lingle, made clear that -- that the general rule is Penn Central, with only the two exceptions for regulatory takings --",
  "Because -- if may I answer, because the agency has to reserve -- has to have the ability to -- to deny the permit because the conditions required by the statute were not met. And Nollan and Dolan deal with formality and the formality of conveyance of an easement. If there is not a document that requires that, then the strict requirements of -- for the narrow exception in Nollan and Dolan do not apply.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to start with the definition of \"parent\" under the Act because I think a lot flows from that. The Act provides that a parent -- a parent of an Indian child is the -- if it's the biological parent, except where the child -- or where the parent -- paternity has not been established or acknowledged. Here, the -- the father's paternity was acknowledged and established, both courts below found. As a consequence, he has not simply a biological relationship to the child, he has a legal relationship to the child, created under Federal law. Then --",
  "\"Paternity\" itself is in a biological sense, but when --",
  "Yes.",

  "Well, several things about that.",
  "Well, several things about that. First, there are States -- the Casey amicus brief in footnote 7 identifies a number of States which recognize parental rights for a parent who has established or acknowledged citizenship. So the State law varies on that. And this was the -- one of the very problems Congress was concerned about with respect to Indian children because --",
  "I'm sorry. I meant to say paternity. Sorry.",
  "What you have here -- what you have here are people who are citizens of two separate sovereigns. An Indian tribe is a sovereign and a State. Congress tried to accommodate those competing interests by leaving the cases in State court, letting them be subject to State law, but subject to minimum standards to protect the people who are citizens -- or eligible for citizenship in the Indian tribe. That is a classic implementation of Congress's plenary responsibility in the Federal trust and guardianship for Indians, and nothing could be more at the core of tribal self-determination and tribal survival than the determination of tribal membership and the care about what happens to Indian children.",
  "I think it's not two classes of parents. It comes from the text of (f) itself, which talks about continued custody, which we -- we think means that (f) applies -- it presupposes that there is custody to continue. And that's just a condition on the termination of parental rights.",
  "I -- I grant you it is somewhat awkwardly written, but we think the sense of it is -- is that because this is -- as this Court noted in the Santosky decision, this is a very unusual statutory provision with respect to the burden of proof. And there is some logic for Congress applying this -- this -- where there is a custodial --",

  "No, no, no.",
  "It's -- it's not as anomalous as you're suggesting because state law standards still apply, and under state law standard under Santosky, there has to be clear and convincing evidence to terminate -- to apply the State termination of parental rights provisions, which is what the family court did in this case. This is -- this is a Federal overlay, an additional requirement. If I could, though, move on to --",
  "Well, with respect, I don't think so because custody is in the one and -- and not in the other. (D) speaks of breakup of -- of the family relationship. And I think there, the family relationship because it -- it speaks of termination of parental rights, which is in turn defined in the Act as anything that terminates the parent-child relationship, which -- which can be much broader than -- than whether the parent actually has custody, which is the word that --",
  "Not -- with -- with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I don't agree. Remedial services here would entail -- the remedial services have to be tied to whatever the problem is. And here the problem was the father had not shown sufficient interest in the child. Remedial services would have been efforts to interest the father in the child. Here that wasn't necessary because as soon as the father found out about the adoption proceeding, he acknowledged and established his paternity and said, I want that child.",
  "And that's -- that is precisely the point when ICWA kicks in. ICWA does not try to regulate the relationship between the mother and the father. That is -- that is left to State law or tribal law. ICWA kicks in only when there's going to be an adoption or a termination of rights and the child is going to be placed outside of -- of the relationship.",
  "No, their burden is to demonstrate that that has happened. The remedial --",
  "Well, I -- I think the -- the family court could direct that remedial service -- this -- this happens, I think, frequently in family court, is the remedial services -- this is not an unusual provision. Much State family law provides for this. The State court can oversee the -- the remedial services and that could have been done in this -- in this case.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As several questions from the Court suggest, the Due Process Clause itself does not supply fixed rules for the attribution of forum contacts from one corporation to another. Rather, such rules are the province of the positive law that creates the corporation and other substantive law, such as agency, that defines the relationship of that juridical person to other persons. And those rules are the ones that the corporations themselves rely upon and that others who deal with the corporations rely upon.",
  "But in the instance you're talking about, in taxation ­­ and this is related to a question the Chief Justice asked ­­ the Due Process Clause does not, itself, prohibit a State or the Federal government from attributing substantive liability, for example, from a ­­ from a subsidiary to a parent or, in the case of taxation, of choosing to look at the entire enterprise of which the parent corporation is the head. But those are the results of deliberate choices by the lawmaking organs of the State, which ­­ State legislature, or when Congress does it, the Federal government. They do not ­­",

  "No.",
  "No. No, they are not. And ­­ and for the taxation, there has to ­­ for taxation to begin with, there has to be some nexus between the individual and the ­­ and the State. The rules that I think Justice Sotomayor was talking about in the Federal Tax Code has similar provisions, really have to do with the measure of taxation. And in most of those situations, certainly, in taxation among the States, there is an apportionment formula. Yes, the ­­ the overall income may be lumped together for purposes of ­­ of the initial step, but then there's an apportionment formula that says that ­­ in the Mobil case that's cited in the briefs, for example, that ­­ that Vermont can only tax so much of it, that portion that is fairly attributable to Vermont.

  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: I would like to respond, at the outset, to the suggestion that this Court might modify the categorical rule in Kiowa that an Indian tribe is subject to suit only if Congress unequivocally consents in order to allow suits by States. First of all, both Puyallup and Pottawatomi were suits by States for prospective injunctive relief, and the Court found them barred. Puyallup was off reservation. But there's another point that I think ties in with the questions about foreign sovereign immunity. In this Court's decision in Blatchford, the Court held that the State of Alaska could not be sued by an Indian tribe complaining about the distribution of State ­­ some State funds in Alaska, which does not have Indian country. The Court held that the suit was barred. In doing so, the Court recognized that the Eleventh Amendment had originally been understood to bar suits only by individuals. But relying on this Court's decision in Principality of Monaco, the Court said that the Eleventh Amendment also barred suits by foreign sovereigns. And the Court's rationale in Principality of Monaco was that foreign sovereigns were not parties to the convention. There was no reciprocal abrogation of immunity between foreign sovereigns and States. And, in fact, the Court specifically pointed out that the State of Mississippi could not sue Monaco, and, in this case, Monaco could not sue Mississippi. The Court applied that very same reasoning in Blatchford to an Indian tribe. The Court said, we have held in the past that Indian tribes may not be sued. And they cited Puyallup, which was a suit by a State. And the Court said, logically, it follows that a tribe may not sue a State ­­",

  "Yes, but let me ­­ if I may explain? It's important to understand the reasoning.

  "With all respect, Justice Scalia, it was based upon the Executive Branch's determination in the Tate letter. In this Court's decision in Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman. The Court said it is not for the Courts to deny an immunity that the government recognizes. Prior to 1952, when the United States adopted the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, foreign sovereigns were absolutely immune from suit, unless the political branches said otherwise. In the Tate letter, the Executive Branch adopted what was the developing body of international law for foreign sovereign immunity and said that commercial activities could be the subject of suit. That was codified, but the Court did not take it upon itself to modify that foreign sovereign immunity. And this is ­­ this is the point that the Court made in Kiowa.",

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Several points at the outset. Justice Alito asked about taking into account the interests of employees as employees.

And the second and related point I would like to make with respect to that is the use of the word \"benefits\" in 1104(a) that says that the plan must be operated for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants.

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with the point about whether the FSIA simply incorporates due process standards, and we think it does not.

  "Because I think ­­ I think that's very parallel to what this Court confronted in the Nelson case where the ­­ the Court said the failure to warn ­­ there was a claim there too, a failure to warn about the hazard ­­ about the potential tort. And the ­­ and the court said, it ­­ it would not recognize jurisdiction by that sort of feint of language. You can't recharacterize something that is basically a tort abroad by claiming that there was a failure to warn ­­",
  "­­ about the tort. We think that's true here.",
  "We think that, at least for tort claims, that, again, under our ­­ our position you look at the foundation of the claim, the gravamen of the claim. And applying that principle to tort claims, anyway, it's proper to look about where ­­ where the conduct occurred, the tortious ­­ the injury­causing conduct occurred rather than the injury itself?",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Well, it ­­ it could be based­upon activity in two jurisdiction ­­ two jurisdictions. The House Report describing this talks about commercial activities occurring in whole or in part in the United States.",
  "I think, depending on where the tort occurred, it may ­­ it may just be in the place where the ­­ where the negligence occurred. But I do want to say that for airlines ­­",
  "Oh, it could be ­­ it could be because the question under the FSIA is whether you can sue in the United States. Whether you can sue abroad is not determined by based­upon language in the ­­ in the FSIA. But the ­­ with respect to airlines, those ­­ those are covered by the Montreal Protocol which provides a variety of jurisdictions for suits to be brought ­­",
  "No, I ­­",
  "No, but I ­­ but the hypotheticals, a lot of them, the transporter have to do with ­­",
  "­­ an airline.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "I think probably not, but I ­­ but I think it's ­­ I think it would be a good idea for the Court not to address the due process and just focus on the ­­ on the statutory terms here, because the question ­­ question of virtual presence by purchasing a ticket on the Internet can arise in all sorts of ways for due process purposes in private cases. And ­­ and here, we have a statute to focus on.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like at the outset to respond to the argument that tribal court jurisdiction over tort claims is somehow inconsistent with the superior sovereignty of the United States. That argument was flatly rejected, I think, in both National Farmers Union and Iowa Mutual where this Court was asked to apply the rule of Oliphant to civil jurisdiction. And this Court, in an unanimous decision joined by Justice Rehnquist, who was the author of Oliphant, said that those principles do not apply to civil jurisdiction. Iowa Mutual and National Farmers Union enforced the rule of exhaustion on that premise. Then, importantly, not too long after that, Congress undertook a thorough review of tribal courts in connection with the passage in 1993, as we explain in our brief, of the Tribal Justice Improvements Act ­­ Tribal Justice Act. It held hearings, and in that ­­ in that statute, Congress made two specific findings: Tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal government and serve important forums for ensuring public health and safety and political integrity of the Tribe, and Congress in Federal courts ­­",
  "Well, no, but if I could ­­",
  "If I could finish, what Congress's ­­ Congress's judgment, the next finding, Congress and Federal courts have repeatedly recognized tribal justice systems as the appropriate forums for the adjudication of disputes affecting personal and property rights. The committee reports on that statute made clear that they ­­ that those provisions were enacted in light of Iowa Mutual and National Farmers Union, and in fact, one of the ­­ one of the committee reports says that that second provision was added in recognition of the jurisdiction that tribal courts have over non­Indian ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "No. The ­­ what I'm saying, it was enacted in the wake of National Farmers Union and Iowa Mutual, which both concerned tort claims against non­Indians. And the legislative history makes clear that Congress was implementing that, and it provided funding for tribal courts. Another point ­­",
  "There were ­­",
  "This ­­ this was a statute against the backdrop of two decisions of this Court saying that the rule of Oliphant does not apply to civil jurisdiction over non­Indians in tort cases specifically. And importantly also, in Iowa Mutual the argument was made about, specifically in connection with the diversity point, which Mr. Katyal has responded to, but the argument that the policies of the deferred city statute, such as concerns about perhaps competence of tribal courts or bias, that they should at least inform the analysis. And the Court said that would be inconsistent ­­ and this is before the 1993 statute ­­ that would be inconsistent with Congress's judgment about encouraging tribal courts as an important expression of tribal sovereignty. And then Congress comes along and provides funding and training, statutes that ­­ that provide for training of tribal judges, money to support the payment of tribal judges and to support tribes in publication of their tribal codes. Congress thoroughly examined this and then again in the year 2000 enacted a statute with a similar finding. So what we have here is not congressional silence but congressional approval of that, here in particular.",
  "Sometimes.",
  "It does not.",
  "My ­­ my point is that this was a ­­",
  "No, they did not vote.",
  "I didn't ­­",
  "Congress ­­ the answer is Congress has not placed it as part of the inherent sovereignty of a ­­ of a tribe that ­­ that predates the Constitution as ­­ and was not displaced, as this Court made quite clear in the National Farmers Union decision, unlike in criminal cases where, from the start, from 1790 ­­ and this was an important part of the Court's analysis ­­ in ­­ in Oliphant. From the very beginning, Congress placed criminal jurisdiction over crimes by non­Indians against Indians in Federal courts in order to assure that they would have the full protection of the Due Process Clause in courts. Congress has never done that with respect to civil jurisdiction.",
  "No. That was going to be ­­ that was going to be my second point. State courts over issues of State law does not have the authority ­­ or do not have the ability to go to Federal court. And ­­ and the same thing with respect to tribal law.",
  "Right. The Constitution does not require that. It provides for it, but does not provide ­­ does not require it. There's an amount­in­controversy requirement, and also a complete­diversity requirement. And if Dollar General was a Mississippi corporation, there would be no ­­ no ability to remove it.",
  "I ­­ I think there's a very strong argument that it is because the ­­ the tribal members are the citizens of the jurisdiction whose courts are being held. Just like when someone goes from Alabama to Mississippi, they may be tried before a jury of Mississippians who are not ­­ of which that plaintiff is not a member. But if there is a problem with that, that is why the Indian Civil Rights Act is there. If that is a due process problem, that is something that can be raised. And Justice Kennedy, in response to your concern, Congress has fulfilled its obligation with respect to the jurisdiction of tribal courts over nonmembers by the Indian Civil Rights Act to assure that the protections that are equivalent to the Due Process Clause are ­­ are afforded people. There may be ­­ may be some ­­",
  "No, it could not. The Tribes have inherent sovereignty; the American Arbitration Association does not. The last thing I wanted to point out is ­­",
  "The courts ­­",
  "But ­­ but ­­ no. There was some with the five tribes in Oklahoma. The Tribes did not have developed judicial systems, but that does not mean that they weren't resolving disputes in some manner, however it may be. They have now given expression to dispute resolution through tribal court systems, for which they should be commended, I think, not ­­ not undermined. And again, the Court made that point in Iowa Mutual, recognizing that tribes did not have courts at the time, but that did not deprive them of jurisdiction today. And with respect to the consensual relationship, I point out on page 372 of this Court's decision in ­­ in Nevada v. Hicks discussing the Montana case, it was referring to private individuals who voluntarily submitted themselves to tribal regulatory jurisdiction by ­­ by arrangements that they or their employers entered into. That precisely describes the situation where you have consent hewn. You have a business operating on the Reservation pursuant to tribal license, a tribal lease agreement, and this particular child was working there because of a consensual agreement.",
  "May I answer? This Court has often said that tort law is a form of regulation, and again, that Iowa Mutual and those cases are premised on the idea that tribal tort law governs. And this Court's observation in Nevada v. Hicks about El Paso, that the Navajo tribal law tort claims, the tribal court ­­ there was little doubt that the tribal court had jurisdiction over those claims.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: This Court has held since the days of the Schooner Peggy that Congress may amend the law and make it applicable to pending cases, and the court must give effect to that law. That is what Congress did here, and after the district court made the determinations that triggered the application of this law ­­",
  "I ­­ I think not, Justice Kagan. And there's several important principles underlying that. One, the Footnote 9 in ­­ in this Court's decision in Plaut said that there ­­ that imposing individual duties or liabilities on a particular person; in other words, a particular law, private law, there's no limitation on that in the U.S. Constitution. Counsel for Petitioner has mentioned various State law decisions that have said special bills are not permitted. This Court's decision in Paramino distinguishes those cases and said, yes, some State constitutions have that, but the Federal Constitution, as a matter of separation of powers, has no limitation on special laws. There may be equal protection issues, bill of attainder issues, or special Article I powers like bankruptcy, where there ­­ where there's a Uniformity Clause and you can't have a State statute affecting a particular case or dispute. The second point is if Congress is able to legislate with respect to a specific dispute, and it's done it, for example, with respect to railroad labor disputes at ­­ in the Maine Central case, and this Court's decision on Burlington Northern mentioned there, where Congress ­­ there's a labor dispute, Congress comes along and prescribes the results of that dispute. That's a specific law. It's ­­ it's okay. It can't ­­ it can't be rendered unconstitutional just because there happens to be a suit pending about it.",
  "Absolutely. The ­­ the straightforward principle is whether Congress is amending the law or whether Congress ­­",
  "­­ directing a result under existing law.",
  "I think if Congress is amending the law, it can do that. And let ­­ for example, in the Schooner Peggy, which involved an international treaty in ­­ in the court of foreign relations, and that's another reason why what Congress did here, I think the court should owe special deference to. But in the Schooner Peggy, if there had been only one ­­ that was a treaty that required each party, the United States and France, to restore ships to the other nation. There was a pending prize case. If there had been only one ship seized in the ­­ in the United States, we ­­ we don't think any principle in Article III would prohibit giving ­­",
  "No. I think ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "If ­­ if it's directing a result under preexisting law without an amendment. If the Court interprets the law that way, then ­­ then you would be correct. But Congress amended the law ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "No. I think what Klein ­­ what Klein has come to be understood to stand for is Congress can't direct a result in a case without changing the law. In other words, Congress comes along ­­ Congress comes along and says, you should find it ­­",
  "­­ this way.",
  "It is still an amendment of the law, whether it's for a particular case or a general ­­ general ­­",
  "But ­­",
  "No. I ­­ I don't think that's fair, Mr. Chief Justice, because if Congress ­­ if ­­ if specificity is not a problem before a lawsuit is filed, it doesn't become a problem when ­­ when a law ­­",
  "But Congress has amended the law by ­­ by making assets attachable that would not otherwise have been attachable.",
  "And Congress ­­",
  "It refers to the assets in a particular docket number, and we think that's ­­ that's ­­",
  "Under the statute, they would be. But I ­­ if I ­­",
  "­­ could just say what's ­­ what's also critical about this case is the foreign relations context in which it arises. This ­­ this Court has recognized, for example, the ability of the executive to suggest immunity or nonimmunity in individual cases for foreign sovereign immunity. Those are case­specific determinations, and they affect the case. They may require dismissal of the case, just like the Schooner Peggy required dismissal of the case. The ­­ the rule of law required it. It wasn't Congress telling the Court to dismiss the case. The rule of law that was to be applied, the change of the law required dismissal of the case ­­",
  "Because what ­­ Congress changed the law, and it did not purport to direct a result under existing law. It changed the law of foreign sovereign immunity by removing a possible defense that Central Bank funds were not subject to attachment. It changed ­­ it changed the law by overriding State ­­",
  "Yes, but ­­ but ­­",
  "But ­­ as long as Congress is amending the law, there is not a separation of powers problem. Maybe an equal protection problem, there may be a bill of attainder problem, something like that. But in terms ­­ in terms of the judicial function, the judicial function is the same whether the law is general or whether the law is particular.",
  "And that is certainly ­­",
  "That ­­ that is certainly true in this case. It is a pool of assets that, under this Court's decision in James and Moore, emphasizes the need for Congress and the President to be able to take hold of assets, whether it's a small amount or not for two principal reasons: To use as a bargaining chip and also to compensate people who may be injured. And ­­ and frankly, also to sanction. This law does both of those things. It ­­ it ­­ the ­­ the freezing of these assets is a bargaining chip, and you don't have to bargain ­­ pay all your chips at one time. A bargaining chip may mean you want to use the ­­ one bargaining chip, one set of assets this time and hold off on the other ones. The executive and President and Congress need great flexibility in the area of national ­­ of national affairs.",
  "We have not taken a position on that. That ­­ that refers tray under a number of issue that were briefed in the court of appeals on ­­ on that question. So we have not taken a position on that. Here, we're here to defend this act of Congress which we think Congress enacted to address this particular dispute. And if ­­ if a pending lawsuit would prohibit, would ­­ would interfere with the flexibility of the executive and Congress to solve a dispute by disposing of assets to pay particular judgments, that's exactly what the Court feared in Dames v. Moore ­­ the pending lawsuits. Just because one happens to be pending rather than the law or the executive order being adopted before a lawsuit should not be able to tie up the Federal government's control over national ­­"
