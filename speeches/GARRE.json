  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Kiowa Tribe, this Court recognized that Indian tribes enjoy sovereign immunity from suit in state courts with respect to both the governmental and commercial activities. In deciding whether a tribe has waived that immunity, this Court applies the same stringent standard that is applied -- that it applies in determining whether a state, or the United States, has waived its immunity from suit.",
  "Well, certainly this court in the Santa Clara Pueblo case --",
  "The Court said that the test was unequivocal expression. And the Court has in the Potawatomi case said the test was a clear waiver which certainly we view as being the same as an unequivocal waiver. And the court even in the Kiowa case cited Santa Clara Pueblo with approval.",
  "Well, we certainly don't mean that unequivocal means one thing for a state and one thing for a tribe. The court has expressed the standard as unequivocal expression and the Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, the court addressed the question of whether because Indian tribes had different attributes of their sovereignty than the states, or the United States, a different waiver standard ought to apply.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, that sort of interpretation I think goes beyond the four corners of the document that the Court would be construing. And this Court in finding unequivocal waivers has always limited its analysis to the language of the statute of contract. Here, that would be applying an understanding or a belief about the availability of jurisdiction in Tribal Court, about whether Tribal Courts exist. And that, we don't know from the record in the case. And that I'm not sure it'd be reasonable in the case --",
  "But, the Court of course has said that in the context of the state in the Kennecott Copper case and in the College Savings case. And we think that that makes sense as a rule of construction, that a sovereign as a presumption would only intend to consent to suit if it were going to consent to suit in its own courts and not another sovereign's courts.",
  "Well, of course --",
  "No, we don't believe that it does. Because the Court has held squarely and most recently in Kiowa Tribe that the on the reservation - off the reservation distinction doesn't work for purposes of tribal sovereign immunity. This contract was entered into with the tribe.",
  "But, we don't think that the Court has drawn that distinction or should draw that distinction in this case.",
  "The contractor -- the contract was entered into with the tribe. The fact that the particular property underlying this contract was not on the reservation doesn't add or subtract any ambiguity from the language that's in there, which is again any court having jurisdiction language. It doesn't answer the ambiguity that this Court identified in Kennecott Copper --",
  "The record in this case doesn't reflect that.",
  "I'm not prepared to make a representation on that. It is clear, however, that this court and Congress has recognized that Tribal Courts are perfectly competent and capable of adjudicating important personal and property rights.",
  "Of course, it would require the Court to go beyond the contract to interpret it, which is -",
  "The contract provides that arbitration shall be in accordance with the rules. If that's all that were here, then the separate arbitration enforcement provision would not be necessary. And moreover, whatever ambiguity that is resolved by the fact that the rules provide for jurisdiction in a federal or state court, the fact that the contract omits that language simply reintroduces the ambiguity back into it.",
  "We don't think so. We believe that the party's intent should be determined from the language in the contract as in any other contract case. And in reviewing this language, we believe that the language does not unequivocally express the tribe's --",
  "As I said, the agreement says arbitration shall be in accordance with that. There would be no need for the separate enforcement provision of the clause if the reference -- if the parties thought that the reference to the rules alone resolved that. And the fact that the contract doesn't contain the federal or state court limitation that's in the rules simply introduces ambiguity as to whether the parties intentionally omitted that. Now, with respect to the choice of law provision, we don't think that the separate choice of law provision itself can unequivocally express the tribe's consent to suit in state court. And moreover, the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act by its terms is inapplicable to the contract in this case because that act only applies to agreements which provide for arbitration in this state. And the agreement in this case did not provide for arbitration in Oklahoma. So, that act doesn't apply.",
  "I think that gets back to the question of what courts would have competent jurisdiction. But, it is -- given the plain meaning to the language, providing for jurisdiction in this state we think that the conflict - that the law requires that the arbitration contract provide for arbitration in Oklahoma. That's not uncommon in this context.",
  "Some tribes --",
  "Some tribes, like some states, and the United States after 80 years of its existence, have decided to waive immunity from suit in breach of contract actions. The Navajo Nation has done that in its laws. Each tribe will have to make that determination in whether or not to waive its immunity from suit in any given case. In Kiowa Tribe, this Court recognized that Congress was in the best position to weigh the competing policy concerns and reliance interests in this area. The Court has consistently recognized the unequivocal expression standard. We don't think that unequivocal should mean one thing in the case of the states, which even here today has acknowledged this type of language would not waive their immunity from suit in federal court and should mean another thing for the tribes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When an individual is arrested alongside the car that he has just occupied, the rule of New York v. Belton permits the police to search the car incident to the arrest. In our view, that is true regardless of the reason that the suspect got out of the car before the arrest. The Florida supreme court's contrary ruling in this case should be reversed for three reasons. First, it compromises officer safety in the dangerous and recurring context of vehicle-side arrests. Second, it needlessly complicates --",
  "I'd like to make one thing clear on that at the outset. Respondent has never challenged the search in this case on the ground that it was not contemporaneous with the arrest. That was not a basis for any of the decisions below. It's not within the question presented by petitioner.",
  "Absolutely. We cite statistics in our brief, I believe it's on page 22, where people who are handcuffed and on the scene do continue to pose a danger to the police. We think that with respect to the question --",
  "The danger was related to the fact of the arrest, and that's what justifies the search under the Belton doctrine as well under the search incident to arrest doctrine. When someone is placed under arrest, he immediately has an increased incentive to get to a weapon that may be nearby, or get to evidence that may be nearby.",
  "Well, first of all, I think it's important for the Court to recognize that this case is a little bit unusual in that the person was put into a house. In the more typical Belton situation --",
  "Belton --",
  "The justification for the search is provided by the arrest. Belton requires that the search be a contemporaneous incident to the arrest, and we think in a situation like this, where the search and the arrest are plainly part of the same process, where only five minutes separates the arrest from the search -- the officer on this scene had a choice. When he arrested the respondent at the car, he was by himself outside. He had a choice of leaving the respondent unattended by the car as he searched the car, or he had the choice of bringing the respondent into the house, which, although the record is a little bit unclear on this, it suggests it was only about 20 feet away, where other officers were, and where other people were after drug arrests had been made in that house. We think that the Constitution and the Fourth Amendment gives the officer in Officer Maney's position the leeway to make that choice, and if the Court were to adopt a different regime, it would be inviting all the sorts of line-drawing, case-by-case determinations that it sought to foreclose in Belton with respect to the initial just --",
  "With respect --",
  "Well, we --",
  "Sure. We know from cases like Preston and Dyke that where the person is taken off the scene, he's in the police station, his car's removed from the scene, that that's not substantially contemporaneous under the --",
  "Well --",
  "We think the scene in this case would include the house. The respondent drove up to a house where drug-related arrests were being made. He parked in the driveway right outside the house. He's on the --",
  "No. The Belton rule is limited to the vehicle. We're not asking --",
  "With respect, no. The rule is that once the officer has a justification for the search, the search must be contemporaneous with the arrest, and we think that that requirement is met, as every court of appeals of which we are aware has held that it has been met where the search and the arrest are part of the same process, one continuous event.",
  "Well, every case is comparable in that the officer typically puts the suspect in the squad car.",
  "Which --",
  "No, and we think that that case is unusual in that respect, but we would urge the Court to keep very much in mind the much -- very typical case in which the suspect is in the squad car, and in that situation it's clear that we think that the search would be contemporaneous with the arrest, and again, to remind the Court, that issue we don't believe is before the Court in this case. The issue --",
  "Well, we think that the --",
  "We think that there is jurisdiction. We think that the Belton issue has been finally decided, and the way it's been decided is based on the proposition on which this Court granted certiorari, which is whether or not the application of the Belton rule depends on initiation of contact with the suspect in the car, and there are situations where police come upon a suspect after he's gotten out of the car. Michigan v. Long, which was decided just a year after this Court's decision in Belton, is that type of situations. Police may be conducting surveillance activities. They may choose that for their own safety it's not wise to initiate contact while the person's in the car. The supreme court, the Florida supreme court's rule in this case is, it compromises officer safety, because it requires --",
  "That may not be enough in itself, but that, coupled with the fact that if the State were to prevail on remand, the Belton issue would be lost, the State of Florida and officers in Florida would be governed by the Florida supreme court's erroneous interpretation of Belton in this case --",
  "We've cited cases that are interlocutory in the respect that they come up on a suppression motion, New York v. Quarles in our brief. This case, we believe it's very important for this Court to decide the Federal question presented. If the State did lose -- did prevail on remand, that issue would be lost. We think that there's a compelling Federal interest in this Court setting the Florida supreme court straight on the proper application of Belton, that the application of that rule does not depend on a requirement that the officer initiate contact with the suspect while he's still in the car.",
  "That issue was never raised by the respondent in this case, and we don't believe it's within the question presented. It's not even within the question formulated by the respondent in the opposition brief. If there are no further questions --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For decades Federal employers and the Merit Systems Protection Board have engaged in the common sense practice of considering an employee's prior disciplinary record in deciding what punishment is appropriate for subsequent misconduct. The settled practice has long been to do so, even when a prior disciplinary action is subject to a pending labor grievance, although in that context, the board permits the employee to collaterally attack the prior actions in proceedings before it. In this case, the Federal circuit --",
  "The Government employer bears the burden of proving the action by a preponderance of the evidence. That's the standard that's set out in the statute. Now, that -- that burden of proof -- the evidentiary focus of the hearing is on whether the Government has proved the charges resulting in the adverse action. Here those charges --",
  "Under the longstanding framework, which is established by the board's Bolling decision, the employer has to prove the fact of the prior action, and he has to -- and the employer has to prove that it was preceded by certain procedural protections: first, that the employee received advance notice of the action; second, that the employee had an opportunity to respond to the charges before the supervisor, as well as by a higher authority within the agency; and third, that there was a record --",
  "It does, and that's -- and that's the same type of challenge that is framed in the early stages of the grievance process. It's an independent authority than the supervisor. In this case, the notice of removal was -- the proposed notice was made by the respondent's supervisor, but the -- the actual notice of decision was entered by a labor relations specialist who -- who was in a different district, independent from the supervisor.",
  "In that circumstance, the board has held that it would be inappropriate to rely on that action to defend the subsequent action. However, until or unless a prior action is proved to be unreliable, there's no basis for the Federal circuit's rule which presumes that prior disciplinary actions are unreliable and effectively presumes that employers act in faith when they take important disciplinary actions --",
  "That's correct. And -- and that can happen, but it doesn't undermine the legitimacy of prior actions that have not been overturned. And in addition, the board has a reopening mechanism which permits employees to bring to the attention of the board any new evidence, including any evidence that a prior disciplinary action has been set aside. The grievance is not a step in the decision making of the prior disciplinary action.",
  "Well, first of all, there's -- grievances can be pressed before, during, and after appeals before the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Merit Systems Protection Board, after all, has come up with a practice which allows it to decide appeals before it, and it chooses to consider the prior disciplinary actions, whether or not they're -- they're subject to a pending grievance. If a grievance does proceed and it proves successful, then the board has a procedure by which it can reopen an appeal and reconsider the appeal --",
  "My understanding is that even when a grievance is proceeding, the board would -- would proceed with the processing of its appeal.",
  "I'm sorry. I misunderstood your question. The board doesn't have the authority to go to an arbitrator and tell the arbitrator to stop the proceeding. What sometimes happens is the union chooses to withdraw grievances when an employee -- employee's removal has been affirmed by the board. That's a decision that the Civil Service Reform Act and the collective bargaining agreement leave to the prerogative of the union. The union's decision to withdraw a grievance, after an employee has been removed, provides no more basis for --",
  "The board can't go to an arbitrator and tell him to stop.",
  "It's --",
  "That's a matter covered by the collective bargaining arrangement. The Civil Service Reform Act provides for the creation of a negotiated grievance procedure. The union and the employer have reached a memorandum of understanding, under which once, in this case, in the -- in the collective bargaining arrangement in this case governing Postal Service employees, once an employee is removed for disciplinary reasons, the union typically withdraws the grievances. When the employee is not removed for disciplinary reasons, the union chooses to press the grievances. Those are matters covered by the collective bargaining agreement, and they provide no basis for upholding the Federal circuit rule which creates a categorical rule that employers can't --",
  "That can happen and it happens because of --",
  "The arrangement is the -- the grievances are withdrawn by the union or they're withdrawn under the arrangement that's been worked out under the collective bargaining agreement.",
  "That -- that would be a decision left to the arbitrator under the framework of the negotiated grievance. It can happen.",
  "That's right.",
  "That's correct. The -- the act leaves to the --",
  "That's right. And -- and the act does leave the prosecution of the -- of the grievance up to the union and --",
  "-- through the arbitration.",
  "It's -- it's very problematic. But first of all, the general rule applied by the Federal courts in the collateral estoppel effect is the fact that a prior case is on appeal doesn't prevent a court from giving the underlying case collateral estoppel effect. But --",
  "But --",
  "There are several problems with the abeyance rule adopted by the Federal circuit, which is essentially the narrow rule which is hypothesized by respondent. First and most fundamentally, the Civil Service Reform Act limits the Federal circuit's scope of review to whether a legal ruling of the board is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law. So, it's not enough for the Federal circuit to come up with a rule that it thinks is fair or makes more sense. It has to come up with a rule which it thinks is compelled by a provision of law. And the Federal circuit did not cite any provision. Secondly, as a policy matter, the abeyance rule is very problematic. The abeyance rule, first of all, would frustrate Congress' intent to streamline the administrative appeals process --",
  "Well, first of all, although the employee is placed in a non-duty/non-pay status when she's removed by the agency, she continues to fill a permanent slot on the agency's rolls, and if the abeyance rule is going to require agencies to keep the employee in that position for months, if not years, on end, that's problematic from the employer's perspective. Second and more generally, the abeyance --",
  "The -- the employee is placed -- under the practice followed by the Postal Service and I believe other employers as well, the employee occupies the full-time slot, and until her removal is affirmed by the board, she continues to fill that slot. Now, the employee can replace her position with -- with temporary workers, but nevertheless, from the employer's standpoint, he's prevented -- the employer is prevented from filling that -- that full-time slot. The abeyance rule creates other problems. It -- it leaves the most important disciplinary decisions, including a removal and -- hanging limbo for months, if not years, on end.",
  "It also --",
  "I think they have tried, but the fact is that in the Postal Service, there's currently 126,000 grievances pending in that process, backlogged. And the fact is that grievances are taking as long as years, not in every case, but certainly in many cases, they're taking years to be processed through arbitration. And this is the situation --",
  "Well, this is the situation that exists, and the board isn't required to hold its appeals in abeyance while that procedure is played out.",
  "Well, first of all, the inherent informality of the grievance and arbitration process is always going to invite delay. That's not new to this case. And second of all --",
  "Well, that hasn't happened, and I don't think it's unique to the Postal Service arbitration context. There are also mechanisms in place, as this Court recognized in the Cornelius case, which can address that, and that's that either side can file an unfair labor practice charge. Either side can seek to compel arbitration. Either side can file a grievances.",
  "I think it's --",
  "I think it's the latter. I think that the grievance is a collateral proceeding. It's not -- it's not an appeal in itself. It's -- it's a collateral proceeding --",
  "Absolutely. In fact, I think the sentencing guidelines direct the court to take that into --",
  "Then they can bring it to the attention of the court and ask for relief.",
  "That's correct. And that -- and that --",
  "Well, we think that this Court should decide the question presented, reverse the decision below, and remand for further proceedings, allow the Federal circuit --",
  "The other two grievances were withdrawn by the union when the board affirmed the -- the removal. The union has -- has tried to reassert those, and the Postal Service's position is that this Court ought to decide this case, and then we can consider what should happen there. Now, this Court should decide the question presented, and it can remand for further proceedings. This -- the Federal circuit --",
  "The -- the issue that -- that remains open is the question of what effect the grievance that has been set aside should have on the board's decision affirming the removal. Now, we think that an argument could be made that the Federal circuit could affirm since the respondent did not bring that grievance to the attention of the Federal -- to the Merit Systems Protection Board, although she indisputably could have, and she raised it for the first time in the Federal circuit. But we don't think that this Court needs to address --",
  "We -- we -- that's what we would ask this Court to do. We're concerned about the Federal circuit's categorical rule that Federal employers and the Merit Systems Protection Board can't consider these prior disciplinary actions, engage in what is, for public employers and private employers, a time-honored management practice --",
  "We -- we think that the fairest reading of the court of appeals decision, as it applies both to Federal employers and the Merit Systems Protection Board, the holding of the court is unqualified. It says that consideration may not be given to these prior actions as long as there are grievances. The remand order of the court indicates that the court of appeals viewed that rule as limiting the -- the prior actions that the agency could consider in this case based on whether or not they're subject to further proceedings.",
  "Well, first of all, we don't -- we don't think that's the fairest interpretation of the court of appeals decision. But even assuming this Court were to adopt that interpretation, there are several problems with the Federal circuit's abeyance -- with respondent's abeyance rule. The first is -- is that it frustrates Congress' intent to streamline the administrative appeals process. Congress placed a duty upon the Merit Systems Protection Board to expedite its proceedings to the extent practicable because one of the factors that led to the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act in 1978 was the concern that the overly elaborate procedural protections which had developed under the prior Civil Service regime had -- had prevented employers from taking the most effective disciplinary measures because of concerns that things would be subjected to drawn-out appeals. Employers simply weren't taking the most effective disciplinary action. That's one of the problems --",
  "The -- the board's regulations permit the board to reopen any case at any time to reconsider it in light of a grievance which may have proved successful. And our position is that employees have the opportunity to request --",
  "Yes.",
  "No. That's correct. That's correct. I'm -- I'm sorry. I thought you were asking about the board's reopening rule.",
  "Well, certainly in that --",
  "That's -- the typical practice is that the employee will go to the board and say, reopen my appeal because this grievance has proved successful. If the employee went to the employer first and asked it to reconsider it, then I suppose the employee could appeal from another decision, if there were another decision, on the discipline. But the more common practice is for the employee to go to the Merit Systems Protection Board and say, reopen my case because of this subsequent action. So, typically --",
  "The employee may do that, and the board may do that. And the reopening procedure is available under the board's regulations at any time.",
  "It is discretionary, and that's really no different than any other reopening procedure which would exist to enable a court or other body to reconsider something in light of subsequent evidence. The -- the respondent's basic position and the Federal circuit's basic position is predicated on the notion that prior disciplinary actions are unreliable and that Federal employers act in bad faith when they impose discipline. And we respectfully take issue with that.",
  "We think that they are final. They're preceded by the procedural protections set out in the act, and they're final enough to warrant the imposition of discipline in a minor case. If they're final enough to warrant the imposition of discipline, they're final enough to warrant collateral effect in appeal before the board. And here we're talking about the minor actions.",
  "We think that the board can take those into account under the Bolling framework, which allows the board to consider the prior disciplinary actions under a procedural framework which looks to the procedural protections provided in those proceedings and then considers whether those actions --",
  "To reopen the?",
  "Those arbitrations could go forward. Again, there's nothing that --",
  "The --",
  "Under the memorandum that's in place, if the respondent's removal were affirmed by the board, then under the memorandum in place, the union's practice is to withdraw those agreements under the collective bargaining arrangement. That could be renegotiated or reconsidered, but that's the practice in place, and that's something that the act permits the parties to agree to under the negotiated grievance framework.",
  "Ordinarily we would bring that to the attention of the board. It was not brought to the attention of the board in this case because different parties were -- were governing the different proceedings. But the fact is, is that it was not brought to the attention of the board. It could have been brought to the attention of the board and still could be today. If there are no further questions --",
  "The Federal circuit ruling in this case is not based in any way on the burden of proof applied in board proceedings. And respondent didn't even argue before the board that the -- that the board was applying the wrong burden of proof in challenging or considering her prior actions. Respondent's reliance on the Douglas case is a little bit odd because that case was followed by the Bolling case and scores of other precedents which established the framework by which the Merit Systems Protection Board considers prior disciplinary actions, even when they're subject to grievance. The board allows -- it requires the employer to prove the fact of the prior action, and then it -- it allows the employee -- in addition to the fact of the prior action, that certain procedural protections were present. And then it allows the employee an opportunity to collaterally attack that action. That -- that comports with the employer's burden of proof under the statute. It's supported by decades of administrative practice, and the Federal circuit had absolutely no basis for invalidating that practice without citing to any provision of -- of law or anything else. Now, to follow up on a question by Justice Kennedy, I want to make clear that we would not object to the continuance of the grievance. The employers would not object if this Court reverses the decision below. If there are no further questions.",
  "Justice Scalia, the Federal Government has a very limited program that applies in only one facility Nation-wide, and it has made a determination to allow for voluntary participation among convicted sexual offenders in that program. Now, in our view that is a judgment that this Court's decisions clearly enable the Federal Bureau of Prisons to make, and we think that the Kansas prison officials have acted within their judgment to adopt a different kind of program. As the therapists all acknowledge, denial is one of the biggest obstacles to receiving treatment in these kinds of programs, and I think it's important for the Court to recognize --",
  "Oh, the Federal Government reserves the right of the same confidentiality limits that the State does, that is, to deal with offenses that threatens institutional security, to deal with suspected cases of child abuse, to deal with suspected cases of harm to individuals within the prison or outside of the prisons. Those confidentiality limits are clearly related to legitimate penalogical interests, and we think that the Federal Government --",
  "That's right. The confidentiality limits work in conjunction --",
  "That's right.",
  "And that's absolutely clear from the waiver of the confidentiality statement that inmates sign before they enrol in the program, and we think that particularly where you're dealing with a program that does clearly promote legitimate penalogical interests in rehabilitating a class of offenders that poses a unique risk of recidivism upon their release, that States, the mere fact that the State doesn't grant immunity to inmates who participate does not provide an answer to the constitutional problem.",
  "The Federal Government doesn't apply the same incentive schemes that the State of Kansas does for participation.",
  "The incentives -- the overriding incentive is, of course, the value of the treatment that the inmate receives. Now, once a --",
  "Well, that's true up front in terms of the incentive scheme. Now, once an inmate is in the program, and if he chooses not to comply with the acceptance of responsibility goals, the inmate can be transferred back to his parent facility and that can be something on its record, but certainly up front --",
  "That's the way the Federal Bureau of Prisons --",
  "It is at a more desirable facility.",
  "I think that's right, and I think it's important --",
  "Well, we don't -- we think that the privileges that we're talking about in the case of Kansas, TV ownership, personal TV in the cell, visitation privileges beyond immediate family, and lawyers, canteen expenditures, these aren't the sorts of things --",
  "The privileges are reduced. I think that the chart that's on page 27 of the joint appendix explains how they're reduced.",
  "There is a definite reduction, and the flip side of that is Kansas reserves the higher privileges, the more modern facilities to those inmates who choose to take the constructive steps towards reentering society.",
  "There's no -- the Federal system currently doesn't employ the same earnable privilege scheme that the Kansas prison does.",
  "That's correct, except that the inmate can be sent back to his parent facility.",
  "As is --",
  "Well --",
  "With respect, we think that that is the issue. I mean, we're not talking about losing someone's job, or means of livelihood, the consequence faced by free individuals in the penalty cases that respondents relied upon. We're talking about loss of institutional privileges that inmates have no expectation of enjoying once they enter the prison. We think that the prison context is key to evaluating the Fifth Amendment claim in this case.",
  "Well, foremost because the Fifth Amendment says, compelled self-incrimination. The amendment therefore recognizes that there are some sorts of pressures or conditions short of compulsion which would not meet the Fifth Amendment standard, and this Court's cases --",
  "Well --",
  "I think that type of hypothetical is much different, much further afield than the program in this case.",
  "It says compelling, that's exactly right, and that's supported by the text and history and purpose of the amendment.",
  "That's --",
  "That's absolutely --",
  "That's correct, and I think it's important for the Court to recognize that these sorts of earnable daily privileges like TV ownership, canteen expenditures, and housing in preferred facilities are among the most common tools the prison administrators use to manage order in the prison environment and to encourage inmates to take socially constructive steps. This Court's cases like Sandin and Meachum and Bell v.Wolfish recognize that once someone is lawfully incarcerated, that brings about a necessary withdrawal of many rights and privileges consistent with the needs of day-to-day management.",
  "Oh, sure. Sure.",
  "And we think -- we agree with Judge Friendly and others who have suggested that those cases lie at the outer reaches of this Court's Fifth Amendment jurisprudence, and we think that the denial of the sorts of common, routine privileges at issue in this case, TV privileges, canteen expenditures, don't even come close.",
  "Well, it's not a complete loss of this case. Again, the chart on page 27 of the joint appendix in the case that --",
  "Well, I mean, the further the Court goes out in that direction, then obviously at some point that program would be more difficult to defend under the Turner v. --",
  "-- analysis.",
  "Well, with respect, we don't think that that's the Kansas program. The Kansas program offers incentives by withholding privileges from those inmates who choose not to take socially constructive steps. It's important to recognize that no one disputes that the rehabilitation program in this case is designed to serve legitimate penalogical interests. There's widespread agreement the sexual offender treatment programs benefits inmates and society alike by enabling convicted offenders --",
  "Well, again, I would disagree with the characterization of the Kansas program, but more importantly we think that the judgment made by the Federal Bureau of Prison and the judgment made by the Kansas prison officials are well within the range of decisions that this Court's prison decision --",
  "Your description presents a different situation.",
  "The statutes at issue in this case, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and title II of the ADA, do not sanction the award of punitive damages which are, by their definition, damages in excess of that necessary to make good any wrong done. Now, there are several -- both section 504 and title II derive their remedies expressly from title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which operates as a condition on the receipt of Federal financial assistance. And it seems to me that -- to us that there are several facets of the title VI statutory scheme which make it particularly inappropriate to infer a punitive damages remedy. The first is, is that title VI, although it's silent with respect to a compensatory remedy, expressly provides for punitive and regulatory measures in the event that the violation of its nondiscrimination provision. In particular, the statute provides for a termination of Federal funding, which this Court has itself recognized is a very severe -- severe remedy that can have a powerful deterrent effect. In addition, the statute authorizes administrative enforcement actions, actions that -- in which the regulatory agencies, who have responsibility for enforcing section 504 and title II, can take remedial action, order remedial action, short of funding termination. Now, the second aspect of title VI and title VI statutory scheme it seems to us to be quite pertinent is that punitive damages are themselves antithetical to Spending Clause legislation like title VI because the availability of unbounded punitive damages awards can actually have the effect of diverting resources from achieving the important objectives of the underlying spending programs.",
  "We think the Court addressed that in passing in the Carlson v. Green case, and we think that that -- the discussion of punitive damages in that case is properly regarded as -- as dictum in that case. But -- but --",
  "Yes, but there are two distinctions between Bivens and this case. First, in the Bivens context, there aren't statutory penal and regulatory measures that can be used like funding termination or administrative enforcement actions to take deterrence measures when -- when needed to deter violations. And second, in the Bivens context, this Court is giving effect to a constitutional tort that it alone has recognized. In -- in this context, the Court is purporting to ascertain Congress's intent in enacting section 504 in title II.",
  "That -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. And -- and first of all, if I can make two points -- first, in that context, again, there is no express statutory penal or regulatory measures that Congress created to provide deterrence as it did under title VI, the remedies at issue in this case. And secondly, what's important, we think, about the Smith case, in which this Court recognized a punitive damages remedy under section 1983 -- is that in that case, the Court didn't start with the presumption that punitive damages were available and simply look to see if Congress had said otherwise. And that's the presumption that the court of appeals applied in this case. Instead, the Court purported to engage in an inquiry of Congress's intent and -- and focused on the fact that when -- when Congress enacted section 1983, it made very clear that it was adopting a special species of tort liability looking to the -- the State common law at the time which provided for punitive damages there. So, we think that the section 1983 case is quite different than this case. The Court --",
  "Well, first of all, it does happen. It happened in the Grove City case that came here, and I could point Your Honor to additional examples in which the termination funding mechanism has been used. Now, to be sure, it -- it's an unusual remedy and it's a harsh remedy, and simply because it's not used in more cases doesn't mean that it doesn't have a deterrent effect.",
  "Yes. I could point you to -- to one case. It's -- it's not a case cited in the brief. It's a court of appeals case, Freeman v. Cavassos, 939 F.2d. 1527, which is one example. But -- but again, the -- the Federal Government -- Congress gave the Federal Government and the Federal agencies authority to enforce these provisions short of funding termination. The -- the agencies receive thousands of complaints each year under title II and section 504. And they investigate those complaints commeasurate with the seriousness of the allegations raised in those complaints, and they are successful in negotiating compliance agreements, ranging from informal agreements to formal settlement agreements, in which those alleged to -- to have engaged in discrimination agree to take corrective measures to eliminate discrimination and, in some cases, to pay monetary sums. Now, the -- the Federal agencies have entered into more 300 of those agreements under title II alone in the past 8 years. So, there is an administrative process in place. It's statutory -- statutorily created by Congress, and we think that that process itself counsels heavily against judicial inference of punitive damages. Or in addition, to return to the -- the Court's Franklin case, the Franklin case is grounded on the notion that the Federal courts have the authority to provide a remedy when necessary to make good the wrong done. That principle has no application to and has never been extended to punitive damages. It would be a quantum leap for this Court to extend the Franklin principle to punitive damages. Punitive damages, the Court has recognized, are both quasi-criminal, unpredictable, and at times have a devastating effect. Those characteristics of punitive damages make them uniquely suited for careful legislative judgment. Congress in section 504 and title II has not made any legislative judgment that punitive damages should be available, and therefore, this Court should reverse the decision below. If there are no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: In 1960, Congress declared the former Fort Apache military post to be held in trust for the White Mountain Apache Tribe. The specific --",
  "Well, it -- it's certainly much older today. It's about 40 years older today. The condition the -- the legislative history doesn't discuss the condition of the fort in particular detail. It's important to recognize that the military fort was built for temporary use -- today, some -- almost a century ago, and in 1960 had been built for temporary use, you know, more than 50, 60, or 70 years ago. So it wouldn't at all have been surprising if there had been a state of decay in 1960. And of course, when Congress passed the 1960 statute, there was no indication at all -- certainly not on the face of the statute, or in the legislative history that's contained in respondent's lodging -- that it had in mind a historic preservation goal, or that it had in mind that -- that it would require the Secretary of the Interior to undertake the enormous financial responsibility of having to restore a century-old fort.",
  "Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. The -- the vast majority of the buildings and historic district area of Fort Apache are used today for school and administrative purposes. The Bureau of --",
  "They are. As we point out in note 1 of our reply brief, the Department of the Interior has spent more than $3 million over the past decade or 15 years on repair and maintenance projects at the fort. It's also true that the tribe itself has engaged in historic restoration efforts at the fort with the support of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of the Interior, and with the assistance of private, State, and even -- in some cases -- Federal tax dollars.",
  "That's true. Just like the U.S. Government --",
  "Well, when Congress places land in trust for Indians, it has two well-settled meanings that this Court has recognized. First, it places a restraint on the alienation of property, and second, it immunizes the property from State taxation. And if you look at pages 6 and 7 of the respondent's lodging, that indicates that in 1958, when there was discussion about what to do with Fort Apache, the tribe itself encouraged the Department to have Congress place the land in trust so that it was in a nontaxable status like the surrounding reservation lands. Now, we know from the first Mitchell decision decided by this Court that simply placing property in trust does not in itself create a substantive right to money damages.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, that -- that may be true in the factual sense, but the 1960 act -- that is, that the Federal Government is using the property, but the 1960 act -- quite unlike the General Allotment Act -- specifically reserves to the Government the right to use the property for Government uses. And in that respect, we think the trust relationship created by the statute in this case is much more limited than the one that was created by the statute in Mitchell I, and the existence of factual Federal control cannot in itself give rise to a damages action under the Tucker Act.",
  "Well, I -- I think generally, the \"administrative use\" can refer to executive uses, and is a very broad term. In that respect, I think it's instructive that Congress used that term. Nevertheless, I think that -- that \"administrative purposes\" has to be read with school purposes, and can be read to refer to both uses for storage and the like, and also for administrative purposes used by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to undertake activities at Fort Apache or -- or on the surrounding reservation. So in that respect, it's administrative for the purpose of the Department of the Interior, who operates activities there through the local agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Now --",
  "Oh, well, our position would be that the vast majority, if not all, was -- well, that's not true. The -- the vast majority of the property has been within the Government's control, but it's important to recognize that the court of appeals' decision remands for building-by-building, in a sense, trial on the existence of Federal use and control. And the tribe does have access to the Fort Apache property. The tribe is there. The tribe even has a -- a cultural museum that it operates on the property. So it's -- it's not as though this is a Federal enclave --",
  "If you look at appendix A to the tribe's complaint, which -- which has a detailed building- by-building analysis of the ways in which the building don't meet certain requirements, I think it's fair to say the tribe's damages claim extends to all the buildings at Fort Apache and that, therefore, it may extend to buildings over which the Federal Government is not -- have any active use or -- or control. But we don't think that a damages action can be brought against the United States based on some fact- bound, manipulable notion of Federal control.",
  "Under the Tucker Act -- and this Court emphasized it in the Mitchell decisions, and it's emphasized it in other decisions -- a substantive right to damages against the United States -- which, after all, is a right to damages against the public fisc -- has to be grounded in a source of substantive law.",
  "That -- that's true.",
  "Well --",
  "That is true and it's much unlike the typical common law trust, but the -- the most fundamental reason, Justice Kennedy, is we don't think that a court should have to plumb through the common law to determine whether or not Congress established a right to damages against the United States in this case. And it's also true -- if you look at the common law, the first thing you -- you're met with -- with -- is with the general rule that you can't get breach of trust damages against the sovereign. So you'd have to get -- not only you'd have to get around the courts --",
  "Well, and I agree, Justice Scalia, and we think that that question should be answered by looking to the act of Congress on which the tribe relies, which is the 1960 act.",
  "With respect, I disagree. And I think the Mitchell I case establishes that. In Mitchell I, both the Court of Claims and the dissenters on this Court reasoned that because the General Allotment Act placed land, quote, in trust, that therefore one could look to the common law and therefore one could import into the Tucker Act all the liabilities that would follow against a private trustee, even liabilities that would result in damages actions. A majority of this Court rejected that analysis. Now, in Mitchell II, the Court specifically affirmed the result in Mitchell I, and it emphasized that Mitchell II was different because in that case, the Court had statutes and regulations that created specific management duties that could be fairly interpreted as mandating the payment of compensation for the breach of those duties. Now, the court of appeals recognized at page 18a of the petition appendix -- and the -- even the tribe recognizes on page 11 of its brief -- that the 1960 act doesn't set forth any specific management duties on the part of the Government.",
  "Well, I -- Justice Stevens, I think that the notion that the Government would destroy the property, if it did so in a way that was clearly inconsistent with the terms of the act --",
  "That -- that duty, if it exists, comes from ordinary tort principles and from principles of just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. And those claims haven't been asserted in this case. This case involves a breach of trust action, a claim for damages based on the alleged breach of trust which the tribe grounds in the 1960 act, and --",
  "Not under -- under the 1960 act, the statute in this case. Now, if the Government had --",
  "I -- I think -- I think it would, Justice Stevens. If I could respond by -- by maybe running through some hypotheticals --",
  "Yes, it would under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution if Congress sold the fort to someone else, or if Congress destroyed the fort. Then the tribe might have a claim for just compensation. The tribe has referred to some just compensation cases in its brief, but it hasn't brought a just compensation claim in this case. The tribe also might seek to bring a damages action under the Federal Torts Claimed Act -- Tort Claims Act for some kind of destruction of property. The tribe hasn't brought that --",
  "Well, it's -- it's not clear to me the context in which that question came up. But I also think that it's true that if the Secretary decided that it was necessary to level a building because it proves an attractive nuisance to school children, or because it was desirable to build a more -- newer and better educational facility at the fort, that the 1960 act would authorize the Secretary to do that. But -- but we do recognize that there are other principles in this area stemming from the Fifth Amendment, a source of substantive law, stemming possibly from the Federal Torts Claims Act, another source of substantive law, which aren't invoked in this case, which might be implicated based on the Government's management of the property.",
  "Well, in Mitchell II, Justice O'Connor, the statutes and regulations there, which -- which the Court described as a pervasive, statutory scheme governing Indian timber management, provided specific fiduciary management duties that could be fairly interpreted as -- as mandating payment of compensation. They -- they specifically govern the generation of profits or proceeds for the Indian tribe, and in that case, the Court held that the violation of those duties, grounded in a statute or regulation, gave rise to a money damages action under the Tucker Act. This case is --",
  "I think the -- the principal duties are the ones that the Court has always recognized when it places land in trust: not to alienate the land and -- and it immunizes it from State taxation.",
  "Well --",
  "That's correct when the tribe comes into court under the Tucker Act and asserts a claim for monetary damages against the United States Treasury. We're dealing against an area of sovereign immunity where the United States is immune from damages for breach of trust unless Congress --",
  "Not enforceable in an action for monetary damages. Of course, in this area, the Court has recognized --",
  "It's conceivable that there would be an equitable remedy based on a violation of statute, not on equitable duties. This is -- this is a realm --",
  "Yes. Sorry.",
  "I think in that situation, Justice Souter, the tribe might be able to bring an injunction -- injunctive action perhaps under the APA claiming that that use of the property, the destruction of it, would exceed the scope of the Government's use right under the 1960 act.",
  "That -- that would be under statute, not on some --",
  "Well --",
  "I think it could be a property interest as well. I mean, we acknowledge that the 1968 -- the 1960 act gives this tribe --",
  "Well, it doesn't necessarily have to. The Court has had many cases brought by Indian tribes claiming just compensation under the Fifth Amendment of -- of property, which -- at least in some management -- some aspects would have a trust in it. Overlapping all this area is the notion that the Government has political and moral responsibility to the Indian tribes, and the Court has recognized that throughout its decisions since --",
  "The United States has general fiduciary obligations to the Indian tribes that this Court has recognized. But the Court has never recognized -- and I think it rejected the notion in the Mitchell I case that --",
  "Not a duty and certainly not a duty that's enforceable in an action for monetary damages.",
  "Well --",
  "Justice O'Connor, that duty certainly is not expressed in the terms of the 1960 statute, and -- and, of course, there are other statutory --",
  "I -- I don't think that that position would be consistent with the Court's ruling in Mitchell I, where the Court rejected the notion that the use of language, in trust, subjects the United States to all the liabilities of a private trustee.",
  "With respect, I think that there -- there's less, Justice O'Connor, that -- that Congress specifically carved out of the trust relationship the right of the Government to use the property for the Government's purposes.",
  "But -- but there's a key difference, Justice Ginsburg, between this case and Mitchell II with respect to the question of control. In Mitchell II, the Court emphasized throughout its decision and -- and discussed the statutes and regulations in detail for more than four pages. The control stemmed from specific statutory and regulatory duties that were created by Congress in that case, and the Court found that the violation of those specific duties, which could be fairly -- fairly interpreted as mandating compensation, gave rise to a damages claim against the United States. In this case, the tribe can't point to a single statute or regulation, and the only statute it relies in this case -- in this Court is the 1960 act that creates any --",
  "Well, there -- there is no specific management duty in this case. Instead of the situation in Mitchell I or Mitchell II, Congress gave --",
  "It -- it might, Justice Stevens, but I think the reference to that also is important in terms of Congress' express delegation to the Secretary the duty to use all of the trust property, the land and the buildings, to operate an Indian school there, which is the -- the use that -- that the property had been put since the 1920s.",
  "It -- it certainly would be a much --",
  "-- different case.",
  "I -- I think -- if I can analyze that claim. I -- I think they -- they might have a claim, Justice Breyer.",
  "The --",
  "Well, I think it would be no, Justice Breyer, and if I could explain why.",
  "Well --",
  "Congress creates a number of duties. And Congress has legislative -- of course, in the area of historic preservation, and it creates duties that the courts below found are procedural in nature.",
  "Then the statute -- they would -- they would have a specific management duty. And then the question --",
  "I -- I think they might under that situation.",
  "But there's a second question under the Court's cases that the Court would have to answer it, and that's case two, and that's whether or not that specific statutory duty can be fairly interpreted as mandating the payment of compensation.",
  "Of -- of course, in that situation.",
  "Of course, in that situation --",
  "Well --",
  "I don't think it's the question because the word control doesn't appear anywhere in the face of the statute.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "No, not at all.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes. And -- and I think -- and if I could be more clear, I think that we think the Court's cases and the Tucker Act -- and -- and we think can also look to cases in the section 1983 context -- establishes a two-step inquiry. First, has Congress created a specific duty on the Government's part, and second, can that duty be fairly interpreted as mandating a payment of compensation breached?",
  "Conceivably you might have a tort claim, Justice Breyer, but that's not a claim that's --",
  "Possibly as a breach of a contract or a tort --",
  "-- violation.",
  "I think the Court refused to do that in the Mitchell I case because there, the Court used the language, in trust, and it refused to --",
  "Well, that's true, Justice Scalia. And --",
  "Well --",
  "I think what the -- I mean, there you might have a situation where the question is whether you could enforce obligations against a private individual who left it in trust. Here we're talking about a situation where the --",
  "You could impose -- you could --",
  "I think the Restatement provisions --",
  "-- that we referred to incorporate the doctrine of sovereign immunity in this area, and you could impose possibly injunctive --",
  "Well --",
  "No.",
  "I -- I think it's both, Justice Scalia, that the public trust is different in that we don't ordinarily assume that the Government acts in all its capacities as a private trustee. And that's certainly true in the Indian law context. This Court -- there are more than 56 million acres of land that the Government holds in trust. If the Court assumed just by Congress' use of the word in trust, the Government had assumed all the liabilities of -- of a common law trustee, then that would be an enormous potential liability that there's no indication whatsoever Congress ever agreed to assume.",
  "Under the Tucker Act -- and, of course, the Tucker Act doesn't refer to claims for breach of trust.",
  "Yes. That -- that's true, Justice Souter. But I -- I think --",
  "Those words had great effect here. They had the same effect that the words have -- this Court has recognized -- with respect to the alienation of land and with respect to immunization of land to State taxation.",
  "Those -- those --",
  "No. With respect, I would disagree. It has those two settled consequences. We know from pages 6 and 7 --",
  "No.",
  "The -- that -- that line of argument is the argument that we think that the court of appeal -- the Court of Claims made in Mitchell I and that the dissenters made in Mitchell I, and we think that the majority of the Court rejected --",
  "In the factual sense.",
  "No, no, Justice Souter. That's not the implication of our argument. They do have the accepted meanings. The United States holds land in trust. It is immunized from State taxation. If the tribe itself held it or private Indians held it, it wouldn't be subject -- it would be subject to State taxation.",
  "Well, it does in this case, and that's the significance of holding it in trust.",
  "That -- that -- it also has -- in this case it has the effect of making the lands here like the surrounding reservation lands. And -- and again, I think pages 6 and 7 of the tribe's lodging helps to make that point. If I could reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens. May it please the Court: The Government is not using the property, and is not required to use the property for the benefit of the tribe as the court of appeals acknowledged at page 14a of the appendix to the petition. It's using the property for its own Government purposes, and in that respect, this case is completely unlike Mitchell II, where the statutes and regulations specifically required the Government to manage the property as an economic resource for the Indians. There are no trust assets to pay for any historic restoration efforts because Congress directed that the property would be used for Government purposes, not for any -- any kind of economic purposes that would generate assets. Congress has a separate regime for historic preservation. It grants millions of dollars each year for historic preservation projects, and as Mr. Brauchli alluded, Congress has granted funds for historic reservation at Fort Apache. The tribe has engaged in its own historic preservation efforts there with millions of dollars of private, State, and Federal funding, and the Department of the Interior has put millions of dollars of its own maintenance and repair efforts into the fort. Thank you very much.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The petitioner in this case did not make any false designation as to the origin of its good, a videotaped series on World War II, when it put its own label on that good. Petitioner manufactured the good at issue in this case, the video series. It produced it and it and it distributed it to consumers. Under this Court's decisions interpreting the Lanham Act and under the Lanham Act itself, petitioner is, therefore, the origin of the good at issue at this case and is the source of that good in the way that this Court has used that term. In 1990, Congress addressed the question of artistic attribution and it addressed it in the -- in the context of the copyright laws. And it --",
  "We -- we would take that position, Justice Scalia, and I think that -- that would be consistent with the way this Court has consistently interpreted the term origin, if you look at the Wal-Mart case, the Qualitex case, and going back to the concurring decisions in the Two Pesos, which is to refer to the source of production or manufacture.",
  "Absolutely, and --",
  "That's correct, Justice Scalia. And that's -- of course, we encourage the intellectual property laws, and this Court's decisions encourage firms to go out and copy goods that come into the public domain. In the Court's recent TrafFix case --",
  "That's correct. The television --",
  "We do think that it could be copyrightable as a derivative work to the extent that it's not subject to copyright protection. Of course, the -- the original television series was subject to a copyright, but that copyright expired in 1977 because respondent, Twentieth Century Fox, failed to renew it. And of course, if -- if the respondent had renew it, one suspects that we wouldn't be here today arguing about the -- an expansive interpretation of the Lanham Act. Now, Congress has addressed the -- the question of artistic rights of attribution. It did so in the context of the copyright laws, and it did so very carefully. It limited -- it recognized specific rights of artistic attribution in 1990, but it limited those rights to a small class of visual arts, made them personal to the author of those works, and limited the duration of the life -- limited the duration of the -- the rights to the life of the author. In this case, the Ninth Circuit recognized a general right of artistic attribution that is not limited in time, that applies to a work, an audiovisual work, that Congress specifically exempted from the scope of its 1990 legislation and that is not personal to the author of the work, which in this case was Time Inc. who initially produced the television series.",
  "Well --",
  "Two responses. First, when they labeled a good that they manufactured and produced as their own good, they didn't make any false designation of origin within the meaning of section (a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act. Now, as we've discussed in our brief, section (a)(1)(B) of the Lanham Act, which the respondents in this case have never invoked and the courts below didn't address, isn't limited to false designations of origin. It applies to false designations that misrepresent the nature or qualities or characteristics of a good. So the second type of description that Your Honor characterized conceivably could fall within the scope of section (a)(1)(B), but of course section (a)(1)(B) was not raised in this case and it's also limited to the context of commercial advertising and protection. The purpose of the Lanham Act and the trademark laws -- and this is made clear in the definition of trademark that appears at 15 U.S.C. 1127, is to ensure that firms identify and distinguish their goods in order to prevent consumer confusion as to the source of goods.",
  "Well --",
  "No. There's -- there's another source, Justice Scalia, and we've mentioned in note 7 of our brief, the Federal Trade Commission Act gives the Federal Trade Commission authority to go out and address deceptive or unfair trade practices. But that statute too isn't limited to false designations of origin. Origin doesn't even appear in that -- in that statute. Origin has --",
  "We haven't addressed that issue, Justice Kennedy, and -- and there is some varying case law on that. I think most courts would probably answer that question in the negative. Most courts have interpreted section (a)(1)(B) to refer to advertising in the print ad --",
  "Well, of course --",
  "Of course, advertising is often --",
  "Advertising is often associated with the sale of products, but more importantly, (a)(1)(A) is addressed -- it's intended to ensure that consumers can look at a product and identify the source of that product so if they do have complaints about the product, they can go to that person. And notably, in this case, no consumer who has ever purchased petitioner's videos has registered any complaint along the lines that Your Honor is suggesting. And if --",
  "Under section (a)(1)(B), that's correct, but I think that the important distinction between (a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(A) in this case with respect to origin is that -- is that (a)(1)(A) is limited to false designations of origin or as to sponsorship or approval, and -- and the latter two elements, sponsorship or approval, aren't addressed in -- in this case. (a)(1)(B) is much broader and -- and would include the types of other representations that Your Honor is concerned about. And of course, all this we think goes back to the notion that respondents seek artistic attribution for their product.",
  "I believe that the copyright would cover the new material. And of course, the --",
  "I -- I think that's right. We haven't addressed that --",
  "-- question in detail in our brief.",
  "Under the derivative work.",
  "I believe that that's true. But we think it's also important that when a consumer buys the product in this case, a video -- a package of videotapes on World War II, the consumer doesn't purchase the intellectual property on those tapes. And that's the purpose of the FBI warning that appears at the very beginning of -- of the tape. The consumer purchases a videotape series package and a copy of that which it can view at home. Nothing in the Lanham Act, which is not an artistic credit statute, required the petitioner in this case to provide any attribution to the true creator of the television series that petitioner initially copied.",
  "Well, we -- we think that -- that's true with respect to authorship because we don't think authorship or -- or the concept of invention is covered by (a)(1)(A). And, of course, the notion of attribution that respondents would urge this Court to adopt this case would have to apply to other types of goods like the sign stand in the TrafFix case. No one in TrafFix suggested that petitioner could go out and reverse engineer and copy the sign stand which had entered the public domain. But that when it did that, it had to go and give credit to Marketing Displays, the firm that initially had the -- the patent on that, or to the original inventor himself, Robert Sarkisian. Now --",
  "May I answer that question?",
  "It is relevant in that it's an international convention that -- that covers copyrights, but we explain our brief it -- we don't think that it affects the analysis in this case because it -- as -- as the Berne Convention Implementation Act states, it doesn't expand or reduce existing rights under -- under domestic law.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners' claims for racial discrimination in the terms and condition of employment are subject to the uniform statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1658 because those claims were created by and therefore arise under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, an act of Congress enacted after December 1 -­",
  "Well -­",
  "Justice --",
  "Justice O'Connor, I think some of the -- the issues that have been identified to the Court are a direct product of the compromise that Congress struck in 1990. Originally the act, as proposed by the Federal Courts Study Committee, would have applied a uniform statute of limitations to all existing causes of action. And some Members of Congress and groups believed that that would create retroactivity concerns. So the -- the compromise that was adopted was that the uniform statute of limitations would apply on a going-forward basis with respect to causes of actions that were created by acts of Congress enacted after December 1990. This case involves precisely such a cause of action. Petitioners' claims we know from the Patterson case were not actionable under statute 1981 prior to the 1991 Civil Rights Act. The only reason petitioners are in Court today and have viable claims is because of the 1991 Civil Rights Act. Therefore, we think that respondent's position which results in the conclusion that petitioners' claims arise under the -- the same statute at issue in Patterson, the statute that we know does not create those claims, is an absurd conclusion that we think counsels against their position.",
  "We --",
  "Justice Scalia, we think that the circuit split problem would be resolved for purposes of section 1658 the same way it would be resolved for retroactivity purposes. Anytime Congress creates a new cause of actions, there -- there are going to be questions that arise from the creation of that cause of action. The Court considered the same question in Hughes Aircraft v. United States ex rel. Schumer where Congress amended the False Claims Act to eliminate a jurisdictional defense, and this Court said, on pages 949 and 950 of its opinion, created a new cause of action. And therefore, the Court held that cause of action cannot be retroactively applied.",
  "No, Justice Scalia. In the sense that the same issue would -- would arise for retroactivity purpose, whether or not Congress has created a new cause of action which would apply retroactivity -- retroactively or not. And even if the retroactivity question didn't arise, that's a product of the statute that Congress has drawn. Another -- another problem with respondent's construction -­",
  "As we interpret it, and we think that that is the plain meaning of Congress' use of both the -- the all-inclusive term, the traditionally inclusive term, arising under, as well as Congress' reference to an act of Congress.",
  "We don't think it applies to State causes of action at all.",
  "Well, that's not a product that Congress has used of arising under. It's a question of whether Congress intended to supply a Federal statute of limitations for State claims.",
  "Well -­",
  "In the first place, we think that plaintiffs' claims arise under the 1991 Civil Rights Act under any definition of arising under, dictionary definition, the statutory definition, and 28 U.S.C.",
  "No.",
  "The question would be the same question that this Court considered in the Rivers case which was whether or not Congress created new causes of action in the 1991 Civil Rights Act, and the Court analyzed that question by looking to Congress' intent enacting that act. Some parties argued that Congress had simply clarified and continued into effect old rights. Other parties argued that Congress had created new rights, and this Court agreed with that interpretation. And we think that that interpretation requires the conclusion in this case that petitioners' claims are governed by the statute of limitations in section 1658. If I could refer to another problem with respondent's construction and that is it -- it essentially renders inoperative the default rule established by Congress in section 1658 in the vast majority of cases, and that's because Congress rarely creates the kind of wholly new and self-contained cause of action that has no reference to or roots in Federal law. And that's the only time that the default rule, which Congress thought was a significant improvement to the prior practice of State -­ borrowing State statute of limitations would apply under -- -- under respondent's under respondent's interpretation.",
  "But -- but, Justice Kennedy, Congress often chooses to -- to build upon existing Federal law in creating causes of action.",
  "We think -- from our understanding of section (c), it was intended to clarify that section 1981 does create a private right of action, which -- which this Court had held in Runyan and reaffirmed in Patterson. But we don't think it's a problem if the Court concludes that petitioners' claims depend on both subsection (a) of 1981 and subsection (b) of 1981 because petitioners' claims only exist today because of the 1991 act, in that respect, arise under that act, under the dictionary definition of arising under and under the settled definition of arising under that Congress uses in title 28 of the United States Code. Petitioner seems to read the statute's reference to an act of Congress to refer only to an act of Congress that creates the kind of wholly new self-contained cause of action I mentioned.",
  "Respondent. You're right, Mr. Chief Justice. But we think, as -- as Judge Alito concluded in his dissenting opinion in the Zubi case, that an act of Congress is just as naturally read and has to be read to include an act of Congress that creates a cause of action by amending an existing cause of action. And all of respondent's objections about the practicality of our position, which we think is -- is the plain-meaning position of what Congress -- the statute that Congress wrote, have to be weighed against the intractable problems that this Court and the Federal Courts Study Committee identified with respect to the past practice of borrowing State statutes of limitations. Our inquiry focuses the analysis exclusively on Congress' actions and Federal law, and we think that that's where Congress wanted the courts to focus. The prior practice focused the inquiry on State law. It required Federal courts to canvas State law, to identify an analogous State cause of action, and then to try to identify the statute of limitations that would apply in the State to that cause of action, and then to make a separate determination whether that State statute of limitations could appropriately be applied to Federal law. And that had created great uncertainty and great disparity in the application of Federal law. Indeed, under the old practice, a single Federal claim could be subjected to 50 different State statutes of limitations. And that was the problem that Congress was addressing at the -- the recommendation of the Federal Courts Study Committee in enacting section 1658. And it decided, as a result of the compromise, to apply it only on a going-forward basis with respect to new claims that were created by Congress after 1990. Petitioners' claims only exist today as a result of Congress' action in the 1991 act, and we think they're clearly governed by the default statute of limitations established by section 1658. As petitioners' counsel made clear, section 1658 is only a default rule. Congress can always specify a different rule and it has done so several times since 1990. It did so in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of -- of 2002, and that's significant because that act, Sarbanes-Oxley, amending an existing cause of action under the Securities and Exchange Act -- so if -- if Congress had in mind the interpretation of section 1658 that respondent proposes, it's certainly odd that Congress felt obliged to amend 1658 to put in the special statute of limitations for securities laws claims.",
  "It's 2 years after the discovery of facts and 5 years after the violation, which is different than the 4-year rule established by Congress in section 1658(a). We think the court of appeals in this case erred in subjecting petitioners' section 1981 claims, which only exist because of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, to the old borrowing practice that Congress sought to put an end to in 1990, and we think that this Court should hold that those claims are governed by the uniform statute of limitations established by section 1658.",
  "No. As -- as Judge Alito explained in his -- may I answer that question?",
  "As Judge Alito explained in the Zubi dissent, there's no retroactivity problems because the only expectation that a plaintiff could have after Congress created the new causes of action in 1991 is if those causes of actions would be subject to the default statute of limitations specified.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The sole contention advanced by petitioner on appeal was that the search of his car was not lawful under the rule of New York v. Belton because Officer Nichols did not succeed in initiating contact with him while he was still inside his car. The court of appeals correctly rejected that contention. To begin with, petitioner's initiation of contact rule has no foundation in the rationale of Belton. It is the fact of the arrest and not the reason that the person exited the car that gives rise to the justification for the Belton search. The custodial arrest is an extremely dangerous and volatile encounter for the officer in the field, and that's particularly true in the case of the arrest of a recent occupant of a vehicle. In Belton, this Court drew the generalization that when the recent occupant of a vehicle is arrested, that the inside of the vehicle is always within the area in which that occupant might try to -- try to lunge in order to get a weapon to effect his escape or to grab evidence to conceal it or destroy it in the car. Now, the application of that generalization -­",

  "No, Justice Stevens. I -- I actually don't think that that's correct. I think the Frick case, which is discussed, listed with the cases discussed at page 459 of the decision, involved the situation where the police came upon the person in a parking lot, and in that situation -- which was one of the cases that the Court identified as the disarray in the case law that existed before Belton. And that's a critical point for the Court to understand in weighing the -- the petitioner's reaching distance argument here. This Court knows what the world is like in a reaching distance regime under Chimel and the important context in which the recent occupant of a car is arrested. As the Court mentioned in -- in Belton, it's a world in which there's disarray and confusion in the case law, more litigation and more confusion for the officer in the field. The Court noted on page 460 of its decision in Belton that that kind of confusion was not helpful to the police who need clear rules for the scope of their authority in this context.",

And -- and to respond to your second question as to what is a recent occupant, in our view it's someone who's just occupied the car. It's -- it's the person in the vast majority of cases in which this question has arisen. In this case it was clear that Officer Nichols met petitioner moments after he exited the car, and that's going to be the situation in which this question has arisen and it can arise in a number of ways. In Michigan v. Long, the police -­",

  "Well, and it is in a typical Belton case. If I could give the Court an example. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center trains its officers that they should stop their police car within two to four lengths of the vehicle that they're stopping and to pull the person out of the car prior to the arrest. And this is -- this is the way officers are trained to bring them back because of the inordinate risks that officers face in that situation. In this case, Officer Nichols intended to pull petitioner over. That's at page 16 of the J.A., but he didn't succeed in doing so because the petitioner pulled into a parking lot. And that's not an uncommon practice that -- that suspects do if they -- if they feel or sense that they're under surveillance by the police. And he got out of his car, and the record shows at page 11 of the J.A. that Officer Nichols got out at the same time and met him within moments. This is -- this case we think has the hallmarks of the classic Belton encounter. Officer Nichols patted him down, found drugs on his person, and at that moment, placed him under arrest. The -- the pat-down was a consensual search. That's -­ that's indicated at page 19 of the joint appendix, and at the moment that he placed petitioner under arrest who, after all, was a convicted felon who just had drugs on his person and who had a loaded semi-automatic gun --",

  "My -- my point, Justice Souter, was that the officer safety justification for Belton is going to be squarely implicated regardless of the reason that the person got -- got out of the car.",
  "Sure. And -- and we don't think it's going to be any less bright in the most common situation in which this question has arisen where police come upon the person right as he's -- as he's exiting his car. Michigan v. Long is another example. That case was decided two terms after Belton. And in that case this Court indicated in dictum that Belton would apply in the situation where the police come upon the person after he's outside of the car.",

If he gets a block away, then sure, it might matter. These are cases at the outer extreme or margin and aren't implicated by the commonly recurring fact pattern in which this case arises where the police meet the person in the same spot that he would have been if he had been ordered out of the car. And -- and let me talk about the problems with line-drawing that the Court is going -­",
  "Well -­",
  "Of course, there's something absent there which is the positive linkage. The police don't know that that person has just gotten out of the car. That -- that case is a lot like the Frick case that the Court noted in Belton as one of the cases that it was trying to deal with when it came up.",
  "I think the police -­",
  "I -- I think in that situation where the person was arrested right by the car, we think that Belton probably would apply. But that's not the fact pattern initiated here. If -- if I could just talk about the line­ drawing problems that the Court is going to invite if it adopts petitioner's initiation of contact rule. The -- the petitioner said today that -- that the rule the Court ought to adopt if the light is on, then Belton is -- is on. Well -- well, that's going to create line-drawing problems. To take an example close to home, the -- the police officers in the District of Columbia often drive around with white flashing lights on. Now, I'm not sure how the existence of those white flashing lights would come into play under petitioner's initiation of contact rule. Take the case that the Court had before it this fall, Arizona v. Gant, which was a case that presented the same issue, but the Court vacated and remanded it in light of the Arizona Supreme Court's decision which rejected the initiation of contact rule. In that case, the officer came upon the suspect and he shined a flight -- shined a flashlight into the car which the suspect was still inside the car. The suspect got out of the car. The officer met him moments later, and yet the court of appeals in that case said that the police officer hadn't sufficiently initiated contact with the suspect while he was still in the car.",
  "The Arizona Court of Appeals held in that case. That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. And -- and in describing that, the Court listed the number of different factors that would have to go into the calculus both from the standpoint of the officer on the scene and from a court later reviewing that determination as to whether the officer initiated contact. He'd have to take into account the lighting in the situation, how far the officer was the car when he -- away from the car when he shined the flashlight into it, whether the person saw the flashlight, whether the person thought it was a police officer shining the flashlight or someone else, whether the person was aware that there was a police -­",

  "In -- in that case where the person -­",
  "If the person comes out and is right next to the car in the place he would have been when he had been ordered out, yes, we think that -- that Belton would apply in that situation. But -- but the rule that we're asking the Court to adopt here is that on this fact pattern, which as the court of appeals we think correctly recognized has temporal and spatial limits, where the police see the person exit the car, confront him moments later, the application of the bright line rule in Belton shouldn't depend on the fortuity of whether the police initiate contact with that person beforehand. And that's particularly true in a case like this where Officer Nichols intended to pull the car over and -- and yet didn't do so because the suspect did what suspects sometimes do, which is to pull over and get out in order to try to blend in. The -- now, going back to the officer safety rationale, we think that is a justification for Belton and that it is implicated in this situation and that the initiation of contact rule would implicate officer safety in a number of ways. One is the surveillance situation that was mentioned during petitioner's argument and that the court of appeals mentioned in this case. In -- in some cases, officers are engaged in surveillance activities and maybe determine that it's undesirable and unsafe to make contact with a suspect while he's still inside the car and so take the prudent step of waiting for the suspect to step out of the car before confronting him. The -- the case out of Virginia, the Glasco case that's discussed in the brief, is an example of that. There's -- there's also the -- the possibility, which is recognized in the case law, that an initiation of the contact rule would have the effect of increasing the volatility of Belton encounters by creating a dynamic in which suspects had an incentive to race out of the car before police could -- could initiate contact.",
  "There is danger, Justice Kennedy. I mean, first of all, on -- on the handcuff -­",
  "Right. There is danger. And we -­ we -- and it's true in -- in a stop and arrest like this case where there's a lone officer and a person who he arrests. And the -- the deeply ingrained practice in this country is for the officer to put the -- the suspect, arrestee, in the squad car and then go back and search the car. And -- and we cite cases on page 38 of our brief where -- where suspects have escaped from handcuffs and gotten out. And -- and that danger is remote, but we think that it's still real as long as the suspect is at the scene of the arrest. All of the courts of appeals that we're aware of that -- that have considered this question and Professor LaFave who's -- who's recognized and have concluded that Belton applies when the person is handcuffed in the back seat of the squad car. And of course, Justice Brennan in his dissent in Belton recognized -­",
  "The -- I believe the answer to that is -- is no because the record doesn't -- what the record shows -- and this is on page 50 of the J.A. I think -- is that the officer arrested petitioner, put him in the car and then went back and searched the car. There's nothing in the record that suggests that the officer needed keys. But -- but on the inventory search question, although it may be true in some cases that the inventory search inevitably would have led to the discovery of the contraband, in that sense the privacy interests of the person from a Belton search at the time are -- are further diminished. The inventory search I don't think is an answer to the officer's safety concerns and justification for Belton, which are real as long as the person is still at the scene of the arrest. There is the remote risk that the person can escape and try to get back into the car. There's also the risk, as -- as you mentioned I think, that there could be confederates in the area who might try to get into the car, either for a weapon or to get drugs out of the car or other contraband out of the car. Officers in -- in the Belton stop, it's not uncommon for them to -- to have the person out of the car, to secure him, and then it's only at that point that they -- that they feel safe to go back to make sure that there's no one else in the car who could be hidden in the car or other things in the car. So I -- so we don't think that the inventory search is an answer to the very real concerns that the officers face in conducting the Belton search and that provide the rationale for the Belton search. I wanted to just go back briefly to the Court's decision in Michigan v. Long. And although it is dictum in that case on the application of -- of Belton, we do think that it's -- it's persuasive dictum. In that case the police officers saw a car swerve off the road, and they -- they came around back to investigate. The petitioner -- or -- or the suspect in that case, the individual who was driving the car, was already outside of the car when the police came back. And -- and the Court in that case made quite clear in dictum that if the -- if the suspect in that case had been arrested, that the search of his car would have been perfectly lawful under Belton. And we think that that was -- that is a persuasive and a correct understanding of Belton. If I could -- I wanted to make clear too that we think that this case does bear the -- the hallmarks of a classic Belton encounter. The only difference is -- is that Officer Nichols did not succeed in initiating contact before the suspect got -- got out of the car, but Officer",
  "Well, we think that the -- the most important thing for the Court to hold in this case -- that we would ask the Court to hold in this case is in the commonly recurring situation where police see the person exit the car and confront him moments later in the same vicinity that he might have occupied if he had been ordered out of the car, that it doesn't make a difference for the purposes of applying Belton as to whether or not the police succeeded in initiating contact or succeeded in initiating contact in a sufficient way. There may be -- there are going to be other cases that arise, and -- and we don't think that this is an area in which the Court should try to establish a rule which is tethered to a particular distance or -- or a particular amount of time. These are -- this is an extremely dangerous encounter for police. This is an area in which police need to make judgments. This Court recognized in the Lago Vista case -­",
  "No. That -- that's not what we're asking for, and I'm sorry if I -- if I misled the Court. We're asking the Court to apply the generalization that it adopted in Belton. The -- the reaching distance rule that petitioner has alternatively asked for would just eviscerate Belton and put courts and police officers back in the situation that they occupied before Belton in trying to apply Chimel in -- in the recurring and dangerous context of an automobile stop. The Court recognized in Belton on page 59 of its decision that that -- the Chimel analysis had -- had provided to be -- shown to be unworkable in this context and -- and had created litigation for the courts and uncertainty for the police officers. So we're asking the Court to -- to stick to that bright line.",
  "That's absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice. On the handcuffing in the squad car, I -- I did want to make clear on that point that that argument was not raised by petitioner below, and -- and the court of appeals noted that at page 74, note 2 of the joint appendix. It's not pressed by petitioner in this Court. I think petitioner's reply brief makes that clear on page 16.",

  "Well, and -- and that's -- that's a different fact pattern that has arisen. We think Belton would apply in that situation, and police we think have reasonably concluded that and courts have reasonably concluded that. But -- but that's not the question here. And the most important question for the Court to answer, which is the situation where the police do see the person get out of the car and do confront him moments later. The -- the States -- a number of States have filed an amicus brief in this case supporting the Government's position and -- and urging against adoption of an initiation of contact rule. And -- and we do think it's significant that each of the States and jurisdictions that have adopted the initiation of contact rule, States like Florida and -- and Illinois and Michigan, have signed that brief and urged the Court to reject the initiation of contact rule. We think that that rule is unworkable. It's shown to be unworkable in cases like Gant v. Arizona. There are other cases in which added wrinkles have been applied to the rule. There's a Florida case, which is not discussed in the briefs, but it is publicly reported. It's Kavallierakis v. State, 790 S.2d 1201. In that case, the courts in Florida, applying the initiation of contact rule, concluded that in order to trigger Belton, the contact had to be of a confrontational nature and not of a friendly nature, so that in that case, the courts reversed a conviction for possession of drugs found in a car because the police officer met the person with a greeting while he was getting out of the car as opposed to a confrontational signal such as a -- as a siren or a light. Now, that -- that seems like an extreme application of that rule, but it's nevertheless indicative of -- of the variations in the line-drawing that can arise and that have arisen. In this case we think that the court of appeals properly held that Belton apply. The record conclusively shows that petitioner was a recent occupant of the car and the search was contemporaneous with the -- the arrest, and we would ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.",

  "Yes.",
  "Justice Kennedy -­",
  "Justice Kennedy, the assessments in this case are imposed on a class of people who sell particular commodity -- cattle. In that respect, they're no different than the types of assessments the Federal Government has been imposing for centuries on the same of commodities, from the first tax the Federal Government imposed on whiskey to the excise taxes on gasoline producers today. And Respondents concede you could do this out of general tax revenues. They concede that you could have a government speech program funded by excises on certain commodities, like cigarettes or alcohol. There is no basis under the First Amendment to carve out a different rule in the case of beef.",
  "Well, we agree with the government speech doctrine, although we also think that the Court can uphold the statute under the intermediate-scrutiny analysis. It makes perfect sense for the government to be speaking out in order to correct the market problem that Congress identified in the midst of a two-decades-long depression in the beef industry. Take the BSE incident last year. BSE imposes a potentially catastrophic and overnight impact on the beef industry. In response to that threat, because of the beef checkoff program, the government was able to respond immediately with the funds necessary to respond on a national scale, not only through promotion -- and this is an important part in which this case is different from United Food -- only about half of every checkoff dollar goes to promoting beef through commercial advertising, like the \"Beef, it's what's for dinner\" campaign. The rest of that dollar goes to things like producing information to consumers about the safety of U.S. meat, the -- addressing the health concerns imposed by BSE and other potential diseases, like E. coli; going to open up foreign markets so that we can export beef -- beef exports have risen dramatically under this program -- and going for things like research in order to identify an early- detection system for BSE. In United Foods, this Court emphasized, at least three times throughout its opinion, that the only aspect of the program that was -- the dollar was being collected for was commercial advertising.

So if the Court finds that attribution is a constitutional concern, it's no basis to bring down the act of Congress on the record in this case. The -- I want to emphasize, if I could, that the program in this case has been effective. The record establishes that the beef checkoff has had a statistically significant impact on increasing consumer demand for beef and an increase in prices. That's contained in the expert testimony of Professor Ward, at pages 100 and 173. The record also shows that for every checkoff dollar spent on the program, there's more than a 5.67 rate of return back to the beef producers in the form of increased prices for cattle. The Beef Board's 2003 report suggests -- finds that the price of a fed steer increased by more than $200 in the past few years. This program has worked. Thank you very much.",

Under international law, article 94 of the Law of -- Law of the Sea Convention, which the Bahamian Government has ratified -- and by the way, the United States has not, and that's an important principle for this Court to keep in mind -- foreign-flagged states may be bound by different international treaties than the United States.

  "Justice Souter, first of all, it's -- it -- the statute doesn't say full sweep. It says sweep, and that's in the findings of the ADA. It's reprinted on page 32 of petitioners' brief. And second of all, the definition of Congress, which doesn't contain that sweep language, is almost identical to the definition of commerce in McCulloch, which is on page 15, note 3 of that decision, and that definition, the United States argued in the McCulloch case, was not sufficient to extend U.S. labor laws to foreign-flagged vessels. It's important to understand the -- the potential international conflicts that extending the ADA to foreign-flagged vessels could create. There are more than 40 nations that have adopted anti-discrimination laws for the disabled. Three nations have -- have adopted laws for domestic vessels: Britain, Canada, and Australia. If a country like the United States extended its laws to foreign vessels that entered its ports, then other nations may well follow suit. And if you take a simple hypothetical example, the Queen Mary II traveling from South Hampton to New York, if you look at the guidelines that Britain has adopted for domestic vessels, those guidelines contain different structural and design requirements than the draft guidelines that the United States have promulgated. There are different requirements for door widths. There are different requirements for sloping. There's different requirements for the watertight compartments. There are different requirements about whether vessels have to be - - have accessible cabins all throughout the ship.",
  "Well --",
  "Justice Scalia, I think in some you could and in others you couldn't. And -- and that's an important -- important point.",
  "Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor. And -- and in many cases, it's not going to be clear which regulation is going to be more accommodating to the disabled and which is not.",
  "We don't think so, Justice Breyer.",
  "We would take the same approach that this Court emphasized in -- in the McCulloch case, which is that kind of ad hoc balancing analysis would wreak havoc for the question whether a significant regulation like the ADA would apply to a vessel. How would foreign vessels know, when they enter U.S. ports, whether they have to undertake the extraordinary changes - -",
  "Justice Breyer, the way that those issues are worked out in the international shipping context is through the International Maritime Organization. This organization has been responsible for crafting scores of conventions, hundreds of shipping codes, and it's already begun to address the issue of accessibility on ships for the disabled and the elderly. We cite the 1996 guidelines in our brief. Those guidelines right now are -- are not binding guidelines, but they could well become binding guidelines. And when an organization like the IMO addresses this question, it resolves --",
  "Well, we don't think the readily achievable language in the first case in any way contemplates conflicts with international law. This Court has a separate canon that's almost as old as the country that it presumes Congress doesn't intend to interfere with international obligations or international laws, including customary international law, as you wrote for the Court last term in -- in the Empagran case. We presume that American legislatures give respect to the interests of sovereign nations when they write their laws, and we don't assume that Congress intends to intrude on the sovereign interests of other nations. And that's what extending the ADA to foreign-flagged ships would do. The Bahamian Government has a solemn responsibility under international law and under its own law to govern the construction and design of all flags of all ships that fly -- fly its flags. Article 10 of the Geneva Convention on the High Seas recognizes that flag states have responsibility for the construction and design of ships. Article 94 of the Law of the Sea Conventions specifies that flag states have responsibility over administrative, technical, and labor matters, including construction and design matters. These are precisely the sorts of matters that for centuries the flag state has been responsible for. And in the Brown v. Duchesne case, this Court recognized that, a case that dealt with the application of patent laws to the construction and design of a foreign-flagged vessels. There are going to be conflicts within - - between international law and the requirements of the ADA, but first of all, there's going to be confusion. It's been more than a decade since the ADA was passed, and we don't even have final regulations as to what rules apply. And in the meantime, foreign-flagged vessels are going to have to be reviewing the case law in the United States courts, determining on a vessel-by-vessel, design specification-by-design specification as to what standards apply. That's only going to create additional international discord and confusion. Petitioners proposed solution to this problem we think is telling. They urge this Court in their reply brief if there is a problem after the ADA is extended to foreign-flagged ships and other nations begin to follow suit and you have a crazy made -- maze of different regulations applying to construction and design, then at that point, the United States can go to the IMO and ask it to clean up the mess. With respect, we think they have it backwards. The purpose of the IMO and the international framework that exists for governing regulation of shipping is to establish a uniform set of rules in the first instance. The IMO has already begun to address the problem at issue in this case, accessibility for the disabled. They are available to address that in a multilateral fashion. And Congress, in enacting the ADA, gave no indication that it weighed any of the international repercussions of the action that petitioners urges the case -- petitioners urge the Court to take in this case. And we would urge this Court to return this matter to Congress. Congress is in the position to weigh the risk of international confusion, to weigh the potential for international discord and to address those matters as it sees -- sees fit. If there are no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Petitioners rejected the educational plan found appropriate by local school officials, enrolled their child in an expensive private school, and then filed a due-process complaint seeking reimbursement of $21,000 in private tuition expenses.

  "No. Your Honor, we think the rule is the same in all of the various situations that could arise under the statute -- the complaining party, whether it's the parents, as in this case, or the school district, as in many other instances. And, Justice Breyer, you're right, one of the situations that is covered by this statute is where a child with a disability acts out in class, and the school has to take disciplinary action against that child. In that situation, IDEA regulates the actions that the school district can take. And if the parents believe that the school district has -- take a more severe disciplinary action than is required by the statute, school -- the school district, or the parents, could initiate a challenge in that situation. In fact, there are many parts of the statute that we think speak to the question, or at least -­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. The child was in a private school, at which point in time, the private school suggested that they find -- the parents find another environment for the child suitable for what they determined to be \"special needs.\" The parents contacted the local school district, and, at that point, the school district, in conjunction with the parents, devised an educational plan for the child.",
  "That is correct, Justice Ginsburg, except that the record does show that, during the time that the IEP was being developed, the parents applied for the child to attend a private school and actually accepted an application fee and enrolled the child in that school, and the ALJ in this case found that the parents had made a predetermined decision to send the student to child -- the student -­",

  "Well, under the statute Congress -­",
  "The Congress placed on school districts the obligation to identify disabled children within their jurisdiction.",
  "And when they have -- they believe they identified such children, and they request the parents to subject them to the evaluation -- Congress placed on the school districts to at least conduct an evaluation in that situation, and if parents disagree -­",
  "-- school districts can initiate. The second situation is in -- is where children act up in the classroom. The school -- the statute places restrictions on how the school district can discipline a child if the school district determines that the misbehavior is a manifestation of the child's disability. In that situation, if the -- if the school district believes that more severe discipline is warranted than would be allowed under the statute, the school district has to initiate the hearing in order to get an ALJ to allow it to take more severe action. And the third situation is where the school district disagrees with a parent's request for an independent educational evaluation. Parents can request, as part of the developmental process of an educational plan, to have an independent educational evaluation conducted on their child, paid for at public expense. Most of the times, that's conducted without incidence. In some situations, if school districts believe that that expense was not warranted, they could initiate a proceeding. And in all those cases, we acknowledge that -- under the traditional rule, that the complaining party, the party that initiates the action and seeks relief, bears the burden of proof in that proceeding.",
  "Your Honor, I don't have those statistics. I would -- I think it's probably true that in most instances it's the parents who are initiating the hearing. That would not have been news to Congress, however. Congress, in the statute -- and this is one of the things that we think is important, bearing on the burden of proof -- placed on parents the obligation to plead their case -- that is, to identify both the problem with the educational plan that they've seen -- and this is in 20 U.S.C. 1450(b)(7) -- as well as the proposed solution that they would -- that they would like to see the Court adopt. Now -­",
  "The -- Your Honor, that's correct. I think that the District Court also acknowledged, though, that the parents probably were interested in sending their child to private school.

And so, too, we think, with the question of the burden of proof. If States wanted to voluntarily assume the burden of proof for their own school districts in these proceedings, which this Court has characterized as a substantive rule of law -- the question of who bears the burden of proof -- we think that States could do so, and that that would be the rule that applies. We don't quarrel with that.",

  "Well, Justice Scalia, we agree, in the sense that we think that the statute establishes at least a default rule. And, just to be clear, if the Court holds that Federal law establishes the traditional rule, then, obviously, we would be very happy with that decision. What we -- what we reject to strenuously is petitioner's position that Federal law imposes an unstated burden on the school districts in all proceedings initiated under the Act.",
  "That would be -­",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, Congress has answered that problem, in the sense that it requires, in response to a complaint, the school district to submit the proposed -- the IEP, the educational plan, it's adopted, as well as the other considerations -- the other options it considered and why it didn't accept those other options.

  "Well, the way it's done in the States right now is, where, in the jurisdictions where school districts bear the burden of persuasion, they are required to go first. And that increases the costs and complexity of these trials for school districts, because the -- before the parents have put on their evidence as to why they think an educational plan is inappropriate or is -- in this case, why they think the school district hasn't properly characterized their child's disability, the school district has to go forward and present its case, which is a more complex -- it's -- there's more guesswork involved -­",
  "I don't know the answer to that question, Justice Stevens. I think it would be a very unusual rule.",
  "That's absolutely correct, and that's certainly the way that we think it would -- it would, more preferably, operate under the statute. But the question before the Court in this case is, Who bears the burden of persuasion? That's a very important question under the Act. It's not just, with respect, an academic question about the number of cases in with -- in which the evidence is mathematically in equipoise. It is going not have a much broader impact on the implementation of this statute, because it's going to be decisive, or at least potentially decisive, in cases like this, where you've got a battle of the experts.

  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States' participation in this case is addressed to the Voting Rights Act issues, and our position is that the district court properly concluded that the 2003 plan does not unlawfully dilute minority voting strength in either the Dallas/Fort Worth area or the south and west region of the State. The district court based that conclusion on factual findings that are entitled to great respect on appeal and that preclude appellants' section 2 claims under this Court's decisions.",
  "I -- I think that's right, Justice Stevens, insofar as --",
  "Well, that's true in the context that the Court said it in the Shaw II case, but we don't think that the principle of Shaw II would apply to the section 2 claim in the south and west part of Texas in this case. And that's because in Shaw II, the Court found a violation in the southern part of the State and considered the question as to whether a creation of a district in a completely different part of the State, the middle of the State with no connection, would remedy the section 2 violation, and the Court said no. This case deals with a section 2 claim which is addressed to a particular region of the State, a region that's marked by its high concentration of Hispanic citizen voting age population, as well as common geography and other factors. And we know that the claim is addressed to that particular region of the State because that -- that region is the focus of the plaintiffs' demonstration plan. Mr. Cruz referred to it. It's at page 241 of the GI Forum jurisdictional statement. That's the plan that they claim they're entitled to under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and it's addressed to the entire part of the State. So in that situation where you've got a claim where you have a -- a Voting Rights Act section 2 claim addressed to a particular region of the State, we don't think that the Shaw II principle would come into a play. Here, we don't think there's any section 2 violation with respect to the elimination of --",
  "Yes, not just the same part of the State, but a part of the State that falls within the section 2 -- within the focus of the plaintiffs' section 2 claim, and a part of the State that's marked by its high concentration of minority citizen voting age population. In -- in the De Grandy case, this Court confronted a very similar problem where you had one part of the State, the Miami-Dade area of Florida, which had a high concentration of Hispanic citizen voting age population, and the State was drawing various districts in that part of the State. And the Court looked to those districts and considered whether there was a proportional representation of the minority group in that area and -- and found that, under the totality of the circumstances, there was, and therefore, there was no violation of section 2. Here, you have a situation where the district court found that the citizen voting age population in the south and west part of the State was 58 percent, and that under the State's plan, Hispanics enjoyed 85 percent majority minority districts in that area, which is to say, six of the seven districts under the State's plans were districts in which Hispanics enjoyed a majority of citizen voting age population. The decision within that area of where to draw district lines is a decision that section 2 and this Court's precedents leaves up to the States. And, in fact, in the De Grandy case, this Court in -- in particular considered the situation where a district line ran through a minority neighborhood and split up that neighborhood. The Court discussed it on page 1015 of its decision. And it said that the fact that the district line went through that neighborhood and had an effect on minority voters, in terms of which district they went into, didn't in itself establish a section 2 violation. And we think the same principle would apply here, where the fact that the district lines separating district 23 and 28 in the southern part of the State near Laredo splits a Hispanic neighborhood, which is, after all, not -- not surprising given that the large percentage of the population in that part of the State is Hispanic, doesn't in itself establish a section 2 violation. The plaintiffs' section 2 claim in that part of the State really sounds very much in a section 5 retrogression or dismantling claim, and this Court made clear in the Holder v. Hall case that retrogression principles of section 5 are not applicable in section 2 cases. And we certainly think that that principle holds here and that --",
  "Well, I don't know of a --",
  "-- specific case that has addressed that concern. I suppose it would go perhaps to the cohesiveness analysis under the Gingles factors. I mean, what -- what is clear under this Court's cases and the text of section 2(b) is that the Court has to take into account the totality of the circumstances in the area, not just the rough proportion -- the existence of proportionality between the Hispanic population and the number of districts in which they enjoy a majority, but all the circumstances that could bear on the region. And the district court in this case conducted that analysis and it found, under the totality of the circumstances, that there was an -- that there was not a section 2 violation in the south and west region of the State. And we certainly think that that finding is entitled to respect under the clearly erroneous standard that this Court applies in reviewing findings of -- ultimate findings of vote dilution. The Court has -- has said repeatedly that it will not disturb such a factual finding unless it is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made, and we don't think the record in this case would support such a conclusion with respect to either the section 2 claim in the south and west or the section 2 claim in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. As we have explained in our brief, that claim -- and I'm now turning to the Dallas/Fort Worth claim -- fails because of the district court's finding that African American voters in old congressional district 24 lacked the ability to elect candidates of choice in that district in the sense that they would be unable, in a contested election, to put their candidate, the African American candidate, into office. That finding too is supported by ample record evidence and we think could not be set aside under the standard that this Court applies.",
  "Well, I don't think that would bear on the typical section 2 analysis this Court would apply. The -- the plaintiffs bear the burden of coming in in a section 2 case, which is, after all, a claim that the State is forced to draw a district in a particular way, to show the demonstration district in which the three Gingles factors can be met. And this case is a little bit unusual in that instead of coming up with a -- a new district, they've just pointed to the old district, which in itself is -- is similar to more of a section 5 claim. But with respect to that district, the district court failed -- failed to -- the district court found that plaintiffs failed to meet the first Gingles precondition, which is that they could not show in that district that they had the ability to elect the candidate of their choice because African Americans were 22 percent of the population in that district, the third largest racial group, and because other evidence, including the past elections in that district and direct testimony of politicians with intimate familiarity of that district, supported the logical conclusion that a group that comprises only 22 percent of the electorate --",
  "Oh, I'm sorry. With respect to district 23, again I -- I think the -- the framework for the plaintiffs' challenge to section 23 is the south and west region of the State in a claim that they were entitled to a seventh -- a seventh effective majority district in that part of the State. The State's plan, 2003 plan, gives them six majority minority districts. The plaintiffs, GI Forum --",
  "Not including 23. That's right, Mr. Chief Justice. They claim that they're entitled to a seventh majority minority district. The district court rejected that claim because it found that they had failed to show that the seventh district that they drew would be an effective district because it only had 50.3 percent citizen voting age population --",
  "The GI Forum drew. That's right. And again, that's at page 241 of the GI Forum jurisdictional statement. It found that that district was not effective because it only had a 50.3 percent citizen voting age population, and the district court found, based on the testimony that showed that Hispanics have a comparatively low turnout rate in elections, that a 50.3 percentage wouldn't do the trick to give them the potential to elect.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The failure to inform a foreign national that his consulate may be notified in the event of his arrest gives rise to a treaty violation between sovereign states, but it does not give rise to an individually enforceable right.

  "It does, Your Honor.",
  "I think in that situation you would have -- you wouldn't be asserting an individual right under the treaty. You ultimately --",

  "That would be the case, Your Honor.",
  "But -- but --",
  "In these -- in these two cases -- one you have on Federal habeas, one you had on direct appeal -- individuals are seeking to affirmatively invoke rights that they claim that they can enforce under the Vienna Convention, and we don't think that the Vienna Convention confers those individual rights. If -- if I could try to explain the -- the -- what you referred to as a metaphysical question earlier. We agree that the Vienna Convention, as a self-executing treaty, is part of our Federal law.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Alito. The -- the treaty has an enforcement mechanism, and that's -- that's an important thing to keep in mind. The -- the signatories to this treaty permitted for a judicial enforcement mechanism.",
  "That's right, Justice Alito. The remedy would be the traditional remedy for enforcement of treaties, diplomatic repercussions, diplomatic protests, and that happens all the time. That happens in this country where -- where consulates complain to the United States State Department. It happens overseas where the State Department complains about the treatment of American citizens. This -- this --",

And they explain that in those situations, there -- first of all, the cases are a little bit vague as to which provisions they're purporting to enforce. But, second of all, there are domestic statutes which we think that the correct reading of the cases is in those cases they were giving effect to the domestic statutes. There's certainly no -- no unambiguous example that --",
  "Because, to be blunt, the ICJ decision is wrong. This Court gives respectful consideration to the decisions of the ICJ and other international tribunals, but it's certainly not bound by those decisions. This Court should look carefully to the text of the treaty itself, to the ratification history, to the consistent interpretation of the executive branch, and to implementing practice in other states. At best, they -- Petitioners and their amici have suggested that there's some ambiguity in -- in two states, Australia and Great Britain. There are more than 160 contracting states to this -- to this treaty.",
  "What you don't --",
  "There are authorities that we've cited where courts have rejected the notion that article 36 creates individually enforceable rights, in Canada and Australia, and there's a case in Germany where they refused to provide for a suppression remedy. So there are authorities going the other way. The manner in which this treaty is implemented by the State Department overseas and by the State Department here is to provide for enforcement through the traditional means. This Court, as long back as the Head Money Cases, said that the traditional -- treaties are compacts between states. The traditional means of enforcing those obligations is through diplomatic repercussions.",

  "Generally it happens during the arrest process. If -- if, during the course of questioning, they determine that a detainee or arrestee is a foreign national, then at that point in time, generally they would provide consular notification. The State --",
  "The State Department advises law enforcement officers at the Federal and State and local level that ordinarily they should make that determination.",
  "That's right.",
  "That's right, Mr. Chief Justice. And many foreign nationals are reluctant to provide information about their citizenship because they fear that that could result in other legal jeopardy. Importantly, Justice Kennedy, article 36 is in no way an interrogation right. It has no connection to interrogation. The International Court of Justice in the Avena decision, at page -- at paragraph 87, specifically made that point, that this was not related to interrogation. In many European countries, detainees who are arrested not only can't have access to consular officials during questioning, they don't even have access to lawyers during questioning. So -- so this --",
  "Well, when they -- when they learn that the person is a foreign national. Oftentimes, that could happen -- that could happen during questioning, although oftentimes it doesn't. It could happen at booking. It could happen later in the process. That's what the State Department advises law enforcement officials. The State Department has engaged in extensive efforts to ensure compliance with this treaty in order to abide by our international obligations. We -- we have sent information to State and local law enforcement officers how to comply with this treaty. There have been training videos. There have been cards similar to Miranda cards. More than 600,000 of those cards have been sent out to local officials, and -- and the initial indications that we've received is that these efforts are working. In fact, these indicate -- these efforts are -- are outlined in the Hardy affidavit, which is in volume II of the Counter Memorial and Avena decision, which we've offered to lodge with the Court. But -- but we -- the feedback we've gotten is that in some offices, they're being overwhelmed by notifications. So the United States is seeking to abide by its treaty obligations. Those efforts are working. This --",
  "Your Honor, the efforts that we undertake are diplomatic efforts. We do not go into foreign courts and assert or suggest that American citizens should go into foreign courts and assert a right to individually enforce this treaty either through suppression or any of the other remedies that have been suggested.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. In fact, during the 1980's the United States complained to Mexico about the fact that American citizens had not received consular notification, and through the result of those diplomatic discourses, they negotiated an -- a agreement whereby American citizens were brought back to the United States for custody. But significantly there, the -- the United States didn't take the position that those convictions were unlawful or could be set aside under the Vienna Convention. They simply, through diplomatic discourse, the traditional means of enforcing a treaty, provided for the -- the transfer of these citizens back to the United States to serve out their custody. The -- the traditional rule in international law is that treaties don't create individually enforceable rights. Many treaties, by their terms, do expressly contemplate private enforcement in domestic courts. Look at article 28 of the Warsaw Convention.

These treaties do expressly contemplate that theirs -- their provisions will be individually enforceable in the domestic courts. It would have been --",

  "They didn't, Your Honor, but those treaties, as we explain in our brief, are dealing with commercial relations, property rights, and -- and are almost entirely dealing with individuals and how they should be treated in foreign states, are much more amenable to a construction that they create individually enforceable rights. And the Vienna Convention, which after all is a convention about the quintessential matter of interstate relations, consular functions between states -- we don't think that that treaty can be interpreted to confer individually enforceable rights.",
  "Your Honor --",
  "-- read --",
  "We would suggest read the treaty. It's -- it's -- we agree with you that you get back to the treaty and you have to make the determination that the signatory states to the treaty intended for private enforcement in domestic courts. The signatory states to this treaty provided for a very limited judicial enforcement mechanism, only contracting states that join the optional protocol and only in the ICJ. It would have been an extraordinary thing for those contracting states that so carefully limited that remedy to -- to subject themselves to suit in their own courts to any number of foreign nationals who went abroad into their countries.",
  "What you -- what you -- what they're asking you to do, Your Honor, is to say that this treaty is individually enforceable in our courts.",
  "May I answer the question?",
  "It is, Your Honor, insofar as if you think it in waiver of sovereign immunity terms. A state may waive its sovereign immunities from some types of claims, but not other types of claims. And what they're claiming here is that these claims are enforceable, and we think that they are incorrect.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Because title VII prohibits an employer from suspending an employee for 37 days without pay because of her sex or from reassigning her from one responsibility that's material different -- materially different than another responsibility because of her sex, it prohibits an employer from doing so because she filed an EEOC charge complaining about discrimination. Title VII's anti-retaliation provision creates an additional basis for unlawful discrimination, but it does not create a different or more expansive concept of discrimination in the statute's core prohibitions.",
  "Well, I think the problem that Justice Souter identified, I believe, where an employer or even a collective bargaining agreement could identify categories that had so many different responsibilities --",
  "Here, what we know and what the jury found -- and this is actually -- it's important to keep in mind. This is a jury finding. The jury was instructed properly on what would constitute a material adverse employment action. The instruction is at page 63 and 64 of the joint appendix. One of the conditions that a jury could find an adverse action based on was a materially significant change in responsibilities. The jury heard evidence on the different types of responsibilities that the Respondent performed, and it concluded that being changed, being reassigned after 3 months of working the forklift, to manually repairing railroad track was a materially significant change in responsibilities. That's the language that comes from this --",
  "I don't think so. I think it would be ultimately a jury question in this particular category of claims. As -- if -- if it were the case that employees typically worked the forklift and then the next day worked the -- worked the track, then the next day did something else, then I don't think a jury could find that there was a material -- materially significant change in responsibilities.",
  "Well, that -- that --",
  "That's right. And -- and if -- if employees were shifted around for one reason or the other, then I still think it would be unlikely to be a material change in their responsibilities when they went --",
  "There was testimony to that effect, Justice Ginsburg. Also, when -- when Respondent was hired, they had just lost their existing forklift operator, someone who had done that. In any event, I don't think the evidence will permit a court, if it agrees that material adverse employment action is the test, to overturn the jury's finding that the change here was materially adverse.",
  "Well, I think most courts have held that where you have suspension with pay, then you don't have material adverse employment action. Now, at some level, if the suspension is so long, 6 months, a year, then effectively you could have a different type of material adverse action, but where it's a 2-week suspension to investigate, that would not be material adverse action. In fact, as -- as the AFL-CIO amicus brief points out, I think, that's the favored practice in the industry. Now, we -- we do think that with respect to the standard, that as this Court recognized in Faragher, it makes good sense to harmonize discrimination standards. And here, we think that Congress intended the courts to harmonize the standard for section 704, the anti-retaliation provision, with the standard for section 03, the act's core prohibitions. Justice Scalia, it does -- the section 704 does omit the phrase, terms, conditions of employment, but as we've explained in our brief, we think it is reasonable to read the discriminate against as a shorthand for the unlawful employment practices identified in section 703. It's also important to keep in mind that Congress knows how to write a broader anti-retaliation statute when it wants to. Look at the ADA, the Family Medical Leave Act. These are statutes which, by their terms, prohibit employers from any attempt to intimidate, coerce, threaten, or interfere with the exercise of rights. Look at the Family Medical Leave Act --",
  "Well, we --",
  "With respect, what I'm telling you is that Congress has determined in that some areas it may be important to have a broader provision protecting against intimidation and coercion. I mean, if the Court interprets discriminate against to include all that kind of conduct, then it renders those provisions redundant.",
  "It does, Justice Ginsburg. As the Government explained in its brief in the Robinson case, post-employment references are reasonably viewed as a term, condition, or privilege of employment because it's routine for employees to request them and routine for employers to provide them. Now, if I could address the --",
  "-- the reasonably likely to deter test that you referred to, Justice Breyer. If the Court disagrees with our submission that the statute should be written in pari materia, then as we said in our brief, we think that that is the next best test to adopt. But -- but the Court should -- it should be clear to the Court how much broader that test is than the material adverse action test.",
  "Well, again, we think Congress knows how to write that statute, and it does it differently. It has a different provision. For example, in the Family Medical Leave Act, not only included the coercion and intimidation language, it also said in any manner discriminate. We also think, again, going to our interpretation of discriminate against, it makes sense to read that for a -- as a shorthand for the -- the unlawful practices spelled out and detailed in section 703.",
  "Two -- two points with respect to that. First, no, I don't know of empirical data in the Seventh Circuit. Second, we know that retaliation charges are -- are rising. They've more than doubled in the past decade. And third, the Seventh Circuit test is essentially like the -- the test that this Court applies in the First Amendment context to determine when there's retaliation. This Court in the Rutan case observed that something as trivial as failing to hold a birthday party for an employee could satisfy that test. Applying this test in the lower courts, courts have held that an officer not being able to see his police dog would be -- could go to a jury, that -- that a shunning conduct less than hostile work environment could go to a jury, that failing to hold employee feedback meetings could go to a jury --",
  "That's -- that's true. I mean, at that point, we think it would just be a policy decision. Again, we think that Congress made the policy decision that the tests should be harmonized.",
  "That's possible. That would be --",
  "We think that the balance that Congress struck in title VII was from -- between deterring all forms of discrimination and not -- not allowing every employee grievance to become a Federal court case. I think the Court has recognized repeatedly not all work place conduct that's offensive or even harassing violates title VII, and we think that that same compromise should inform the Court's interpretation of section 704 of the statute. If there are no further questions.",
  "Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. After carefully considering the issue the nation's expert agency in environmental matters concluded that Congress has not authorized it to embark on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to address global climate change. And that even if it has, now is not the time to exercise such authority, in light of the substantial scientific uncertainty surrounding global climate change and the ongoing studies designed to address those uncertainties. Plaintiffs have provide no reason to override that quintessential administrative judgment.",
  "Your Honor, I don't think that it does. In the sense, I think EPA made clear in its decisional document that it considered as an alternative matter, that if it, even assuming it did have the authority, that it wouldn't be appropriate to exercise it at this time. And importantly, too, I mean, just to be clear on this, EPA has never made an endangerment finding with respect to global climate change. That was true in 1998 and 1999 when the agency had a different position on authority to regulate. Even then the agency's position was clear. Even assuming we have the authority, now is not the time to exercise it. So I don't think - -",
  "Well, to that degree, Your Honor, this Court has made clear, for example, in the Brand X case that even where agencies change positions, where they've provided reasonable grounds for a new interpretation, that interpretation is entitled to Chevron deference. We think that that is true in this case.",
  "Justice Breyer, I don't think that it depends on how many pages that the agency devoted to the - -",
  "I think it depends on the reasons that the agency gave. And one of the reasons that the agency gave was the substantial scientific uncertainty surrounding the issue of global climate change. Petitioners acknowledge that that was an appropriate consideration for the agency. So even if you think the other considerations were inappropriate, and we certainly do not, but even if you think they are, the agency gave an appropriate reason. And that reasons --",
  "But Your Honor - -",
  "I -- I don't think that that is a fair reading of the EPA decisional document, Your Honor. Certainly, the agency didn't go out of its way to say, \"and reading these considerations together and not any of them individually.\" And with respect to the scientific uncertainty, Your Honor, you also have to take into account that the EPA had before it and pointed to the report of the National Research Council on global climate change.",
  "Your Honor, if you are referring to the amicus brief, Your Honor, there are -- assuming there are amicus briefs on the other side. The Ballunas amicus brief -- I think it is fair for the Court to look at, to look at the document that the agency had before it. That -- that document produced by the National Research -- Research Council, that's the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences. And it's one of the gold standards of research.",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think one thing that we ought to be able to agree on is there is that there is uncertainty surrounding the phenomenon of global climate change. I think the debate is on which areas are more uncertain than the others. But certainly I think the agency was entitled to conclude, particularly if you take into account the deference this Court should give to that kind of determination, that the scientific uncertainty surrounding the issue of global climate change, surrounding issues of the extent of natural variability in climate, surrounding the issues of impact of climate feedbacks like ocean circulation, and low cloud cover, are permissible considerations for the agency to take into -- -",
  "Your Honor, the report says that it is likely that there is a -- a connection, but that it cannot unequivocally be established. I think that - - if I could use that to go back to the standing question, Your Honor, which is the fundamental question of whether they've showed not just a connection between greenhouse gas emissions in toto and the phenomenon of global climate change, but the particular class of greenhouse gas emissions at issue in this case. Six percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, at most. That assumes you put all U.S. vehicles off the road or that they are all zero emission cars. So you're talking about emissions - -",
  "I think that's true, Your Honor. But what petitioners here to show, they bear the burden in order to establish standing under this case, is that regulation of the class of greenhouse gases at issue in this case will make a difference to them.",
  "Your Honor, I think that that is a fundamentally different case, for the simple reason that global climate change is a global phenomenon. I mean one - -",
  "The -- the individual in that case, Your Honor, like the plaintiffs here, would have to show specific facts demonstrating injury, redressibility and traceability. Now in this case - -",
  "Your Honor, this Court's standing cases make clear that you have to show that granting the relief requested is likely to redress the alleged harms. And again, looking at the - -",
  "I don't -- we're not saying that.",
  "We're not saying that, Your Honor. We're saying that they have, they certainly have to do more than they have done here. And they're granted their standing - -",
  "Well, I will be more specific. And if I could also just point to what they grounded their case on here. They grounded their case on here, in the declarations, on the notion if the United States regulates greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles, then other countries will follow suit with respect to the emissions of vehicles and other greenhouse gas emissions. That's clear from the McCracken declaration on page 239, paragraph 32 of the JA, as well as the Walsh declaration.",
  "Well - -",
  "That, that's true, Your Honor, but I still think you have to look at the basis that they've relied upon on standing. And they haven't shown specific facts which should provide any comfort to this Court that regulation of less than 6 percent or fewer greenhouse emissions worldwide will have any effect on their alleged injuries.",
  "Well - -",
  "Your Honor - -",
  "Justice Souter, one fundamental reason is that we don't know what the rest of the world is going to do, whether or not - -",
  "Justice Souter, their burden is to show that if the Court grants their requested relief it will redress their injuries. I'm not aware - -",
  "I think - -",
  "And that's fine, Justice Souter, I grant you that. But they still have to show that there is reason that it is likely to believe, that the reduction in that tiny fraction of United States emissions, putting aside the 99 percent or the 95 percent in the rest of the world and what they do, and the evidence that shows that greenhouse gas emissions in those countries are increasing, they have to show the regulation of that tiny fraction would have an affect on their alleged injuries, not to completely redress them, Your Honor. We don't say that - -",
  "They have to show that it is likely, Your Honor. And they haven't even tried to make that showing. The one thing that they've - -",
  "I don't think that it is fair, Your Honor. I don't want to pretend to be an expert on global climate change. But the one thing I can say is from the materials I looked at is that this an extraordinarily complex area of science. I'm not aware of any studies available that would suggest that the regulation of that minuscule fraction of greenhouse gas emissions would have any effect whatsoever on the global -- -",
  "Your Honor, what I would point you to is your decision in Lujan versus Defenders of Wildlife, Justice Kennedy's opinion in ASARCO versus Kadish, where the Court made clear that you cannot establish standing based on predictions of the actions of independent actors not before it. That's true about other agencies that aren't here today. That's true about other countries whom this Court does not have jurisdiction over.",
  "Well, first of all, Congress has specifically addressed two of the areas that you mentioned, Your Honor, and we're not saying that categorically - -",
  "That's exactly right, Your Honor. That's exactly right.",
  "Well, Your Honor, we're saying two things. First, every plaintiff has the obligation to establish that he has Article III standing under this Constitution. And secondly, there are members of this Court, for example, Justice Kennedy in his concurring opinion in Defenders of Wildlife, who did suggest that perhaps if Congress specifically addresses an issue, that could inform the standing analysis. For example - -",
  "It cannot, Your Honor. Congress could make findings with respect to causation or other issues that this Court would have to give deference to and seriously consider, but you're right. It would not override the requirements of Article III. And there may be some global phenomenon that create more difficult challenges to establish standing but - -",
  "That's true, Your Honor, moving to the merits, that's true. And with respect to that, the agency engaged in the same type of analysis that this Court laid out in the Brown and Williamson case.",
  "Your Honor, our view is that agencies have inherent discretion to determine when to make that judgment.",
  "I think that gets to the question of whether there is, what judicial review is available. We have assumed in this case that there's some measure of judicial review. So I think at some point you got to the point where the agency either has provided no reasons whatsoever, or there is no sound basis for the agency not to take that step. Then assuming that there is a role for the courts here, a court could come in and say that that was inappropriate.",
  "Well, again, I think it goes to the question -- we think the statute does not put a deadline on when the agency has to have, and that therefore - -",
  "That's not the agency's interpretation. In fact in its decisional document under the section no mandatory duty, the agency explains why that's not its interpretation and we think that that's a reasonable interpretation. Congress knows how to constrain the exercise of discretion. We point in footnotes 18 and 19 of our brief of many examples where Congress has laid out deadlines or other constraints on the exercise of discretion, and those aren't present in Section 203.",
  "That's right. And then I think it's a point the D.C. Circuit made in the Ethyl Corporation case at footnote 37, that precisely because the statute imposes a duty to act once that endangerment finding is made, the agency has discretion to determine when to make the endangerment finding.",
  "That's a separate sort of action, Your Honor. There are cases where people have said that this is unreasonable delay. That's not the claim that the petitioners in this case brought.",
  "Under the statute - -",
  "No, I was assuming -- in answering Justice Stevens' questions, that we were down in the exercise of discretion part. But you're right, Your Honor, the threshold position of the agency on this is that it lacks the authority to - -",
  "I think there is, Your Honor. The way that the agency looked at this is to look at the question of whether Congress intended it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions to address global climate change, and it looked to the factors that this Court laid out in Brown and Williamson. The statute as a whole is specific legislation addressing global climate change, and it concluded that the agency had not authorized it to embark on that regulatory - -",
  "No. The agency -- what the agency found, Your Honor, was that because global climate change is not air pollution within the meaning of the statute -- which is to say that Congress did not authorize it to regulate it as air pollution.",
  "I think, Your Honor, that the key to the agency was that Congress did not give it regulatory authority over this. And I think on the question of whether or not greenhouse gas emissions qualify - -",
  "The agency pointed to the term \"air pollution agent\" in the statute, and concluded that because global climate change was not air pollution that Congress intended to address - -",
  "And with respect to acid rain, it's a good example insofar as Congress has enacted a whole separate title of the Clean Air Act to address acid rain. The other thing I want to mention on the interpretive question is, in the Brown and Williamson case, this Court assumed at the outset of its analysis that nicotine would be within the general terms of the definition of drug in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and that cigarettes would fall within the general term of drug - -",
  "I think it's largely the position that the agency took, Your Honor, insofar as it reasoned that, look, we've looked at everything. We conclude that Congress doesn't intend us to regulate global climate change as air pollution. And so therefore, we're not going to say that greenhouse gases are air pollution agents.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, it was 30 years before the agency reached the conclusion in 1998 that carbon dioxide was an air pollutant. And again, even when it reached that conclusion, it made clear that it didn't think that the agency would exercise its authority to regulate it.",
  "And I think -- I mean, I grant you that there are differences between Brown and Williamson and this case, but the fundamental conclusion that the agency reached is the same. Which was, to borrow the phrase from the Whitman case, Congress did not intend to hide elephants in mouse holes. Here we are talking about an issue of the magnitude of regulating global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which are fundamentally an important part of the nation's economy. Nearly 85 percent of the economy is a direct or indirect source of greenhouse gas emissions. And when we look at when Congress did mention carbon dioxide in the statute, which is in the 1990 amendments, Section 103(g), that was the first time that Congress mentioned CO2. And when it did that, it went out of its way to say that it was giving non-regulatory authority to the agency, and moreover, that nothing in this section shall provide any basis for any air pollution control requirements. That's a strange thing for Congress to say if it believed that the agency already had this far-reaching authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. There are other aspects of the statute that we think lead to the same conclusion in Brown & Williamson. There's a fundamental inconsistency, the agency concluded, between attempting to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the national air ambient quality system, and that inconsistency is similar to the inconsistency that the Court pointed out in the Brown and Williamson case.",
  "I think you're wrong in the following respect, Your Honor.",
  "Congress has passed at least six separate statutes to specifically address the issue of global warming, and all of them share two common features. One, we want you to research this issue and learn more about it. And two, we want you to work on an international framework for addressing global climate change. The agency reasonably concluded that unilateral U.S. regulation of greenhouse gases - -",
  "There's nothing in the Clean Air Act, if that's the stature you're referring to, but I - -",
  "That's right, Your Honor. We've got a unique collective action problem, and yet, the reaction experience of the agency in dealing with the issue of stratospheric ozone depletion rate had precisely that situation, where the U.S. initially took steps. The stratospheric ozone depletion worsened, and it was only after international agreement was reached in the Montreal Protocol that a global solution to the problem was reached.",
  "I think it's a proper basis within its inherent discretion, Your Honor, for at least two reasons. One, the agency is a part of the executive branch and it had unique experience with the issue of stratospheric ozone depletion. And two, Congress has made clear, for example in the Global Climate Protection Act of 1987, that the EPA has a role in at least reporting to Congress on international cooperation and efforts in that realm.",
  "That's true, Your Honor, but - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, again, I think in looking at all the sources the agency looked to, the conclusion is, that the agency responsibly and prudently reached, is that Congress has not authorized it to embark on this regulatory endeavor. And I think the closest statute that comes to - -",
  "May I answer the question? No, Your Honor. I think the agency's conclusion was Congress had not authorized it to undertake the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to address global climate change and that, even if it had, that authority should not be exercised. Thank you very much.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a suspect disobeys a lawful command to stop, races off in a reckless attempt to elude the police, and demonstrates a disregard for his own life and the lives of others in his path, the police may use force, including deadly force, to bring the suspect's vehicle flight to a halt and protect the public safety.",
  "It does, Your Honor. The key determination is whether the officer on the scene reasonably determines that the vehicle poses a substantial risk to other motorists or the police in his way.",
  "I agree that it does, Justice Kennedy. Here what you have is an individual who's going extraordinarily high speeds, 80 to 100 miles an hour. An individual who has passed cars, crossed the double, double line; there were numerous motors, motor vehicles on the night. And an individual who has ran red lights, an individual who when three police cars - -",
  "Well, that's true, Your Honor. But as the Court said in the Sacramento versus Lewis case, we don't blame police for the individual's reckless flight in that context. We don't blame police that Respondent made a decision to just - -",
  "Not on this record, Justice Stevens. In this particular - -",
  "That's exactly right, Justice Sc alia.",
  "We agree, Justice Scalia. As Justice Kennedy put it Sacramento versus Lewis, if there's a real danger - -",
  "The question in our mind, Justice Stevens, is whether Deputy Scott reasonably believed that Respondent posed a serious risk of injury or death to other motor vehicles, bystanders or police on the roadway that night.",
  "We agree, Your Honor.",
  "Justice Breyer, to answer the second question first, Scott did not know that he was initially in a chase.",
  "Well, Scott, I believe, Scott's testimony was that he did not know. What Scott knew, and he was engaged in the chase, was this is an individual who had crossed cars, crossed the double yellow line. This was an individual who had ran red lights. This was an individual, when three police squad cars converged on him in the shopping center parking lot, collided with them and ran off into the highway, reaching again speeds up to 90 miles an hour.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "It is, certainly, at a commonsense level. Statistic show that most vehicles who flee in this fashion, oftentimes there is alcohol or drug abuse involved, oftentimes they are stolen vehicles. We don't think - -",
  "I'm not sure that it would, Justice Scalia -- uh, Justice Stevens.",
  "Well -- that's true. The key, the key point about this case is the threat that Respondent posed in the -- suspects who engage in high speed vehicle chases pose to the public, and that is, that is fundamentally different from Garner for the reason that you mentioned. Garner involved - -",
  "Yes. It doesn't matter why the chase began. The point is that when Scott made the decision to use force against Respondent, he reasonably determined that Respondent posed a grave threat to other motorists, the police and any bystanders who might come in his way.",
  "Because, Your Honor, regardless of the reason the chase began, at the moment that Deputy Scott used the force, this car posed a serious risk to everyone else on the road that night. Someone traveling 90 miles an hour, up to 90 miles an hour, on a two-lane windy road with numerous cars passing during this course of the chase, it was that threat that Deputy Scott acted against when he used that force, and that was a reasonable use of force. It's reasonable regardless of whether or not this Court determines - -",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the holding in that case was that a roadblock amounted to a seizure. And we don't, no one disputes there was a seizure in this case when Deputy Scott intentionally used force to put Respondents off the road. So it respect, Brower doesn't speak to the question in this case, which is whether or not that use of force was reasonable under the circumstances. Justice Kennedy in the Sacramento versus Lewis case, in his concurring opinion, say that there was a real danger of adopting a constitutional rule that suspects are free to disobey lawful commands.",
  "Well, the -- ultimately to determine whether this decision could be made at the summary judgment stage you would have to consider whether a jury could find it unreasonable. Here, on the relevant undisputed facts, we submit as a matter of law, Deputy Scott reasonably believed that this force was necessary under the circumstances. And the final point that I wanted to make, going back to Justice Kennedy's concurrence, is that there is a real danger in adopting that kind of constitutional rule, that it will encourage more suspects to flee, and will only increase the danger to the public and to police and to motorists in these high speed chases. I would urge this Court to reverse the decision below. If there are no further questions - -",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent asks this Court to recognize a new constitutional tort under Bivens and the Just Compensation Clause - -",
  "Hopefully that's better. -- recognize a new constitutional tort under Bivens and the Just Compensation Clause that would subject public officials to personal liability for conduct that he concedes does not amount to a taking. Recognizing that constitutional tort would require this Court to extend Bivens to an entirely new context, it would disregard limits that have existed for centuries on Just Compensation Clause claims, and it would skew the enforcement of important public land use objectives and thereby threaten public resources and public lands.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, there are a number of avenues that he could have sought to prevent this alleged conduct and that he did invoke. We don't think that there is a remedy under Bivens or an inferred action under the Just Compensation Clause.",
  "He can challenge the citations for challenging the -- canceling the grazing permits - -",
  "Well, I don't think that that's a reasonable inference, Justice Ginsburg. In fact, the IBLA considered and rejected each of the alleged administrative actions on which his claim is now based.",
  "Well, our position is that he hasn't established a constitutional tort or an actionable claim under RICO.",
  "To answer your question, the Government takes these types of allegations seriously. It's taken seriously at the line level at the Bureau of Land Management. It's taken seriously within the Department of Interior and it's taken seriously at the Department of Justice.",
  "But we know from the decisions of the IBLA that he did challenge that they rejected the grounds that he - -",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, to bring an APA action to Federal court challenging the final decisions of the IBLA.",
  "Again, I think you have to assume that his claims would not succeed either at the administrative level or at the APA level, and if he got - -",
  "Well, if there's a trespass he can go, he can obtain an action under the Federal Tort Claims Act. A trespass is an unauthorized taking. That's the way that this Court has treated it 1952 in the Hasselly case.",
  "Well, he claimed that they were trespassing on his lands.",
  "Well, he'd raised that objection before the IBLA and the IBLA concluded, and we think reasonably, that, given the history of the disputes with this individual, given his litigious nature, that it was reasonable for the BLM officials who were out there to be documenting his trespasses on public lands, and that's an important dimension of this case.",
  "To document, to document his trespasses on other lands, and that's -- the citation to the IBLA decision is at footnote 2 of our reply brief and it discusses that allegation in depth. In any event - -",
  "He does not have a remedy under the Just Compensation Clause or Bivens, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "He can challenge, he can challenge these actions under the administrative process available to him under the - -",
  "-- like any number of other contexts.",
  "He has to challenge each administrative action - -",
  "-- that he claims is unlawful.",
  "He did not. In fact, the IBLA found that the BLM had a right of administrative access to cross his lands to get to public lands which it was administering. And again, this case would have been quite different if the IBLA had found that the BLM officers were acting without legitimate authority.",
  "And they do.",
  "It has, Justice Breyer. It has.",
  "The result of that is it was determined that these actions by these line officers of the Bureau of Land Management were perfectly appropriate, that they were dealing with someone who has systematically violated the permits and conditions that are found - -",
  "There was a settlement agreement, Justice Ginsburg. But the Department of Interior stands behind the actions that are issued, at issue in this case, and I think - -",
  "Well, I'm not sure that that's a fair characterization. I mean, like any party to litigation, any party to multiple lawsuits and claims, there are many reasons why it might be deemed in the interest of a person to agree to a settlement. And I don't think it's fair to - -",
  "This Court has to accept those factual allegations, to - -",
  "-- to be sure. But the court of - -",
  "That's a fulsome remedy, Justice Ginsburg, when you think of the claims that could be brought administratively under the Administrative Procedures Act, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, to receive damages, to receive injunctions - -",
  "If the allegation is that these trespasses have in effect deprived me of my property which is my business, then conceivably he could make a request for a large amount of damages.",
  "No, I think - -",
  "He, he has made both claims, Justice Scalia. And I think -- he has, he has complained about BLM officials exercising the right of administrative access, which has been confirmed at the administrative level and which is well settled. And he has made the more general complaint that these trespasses have -- and interfered with his businesses and interfered with his property. He filed a, a bond in this Court seeking, claiming the damages were in several million dollars related to the business. So that - -",
  "Certainly he could under the APA. He could challenge the administrative actions he complained about, and if court concludes those are unauthorized or unconstitutional he could obtain an injunction.",
  "Well, the other thing to keep in mind is that many of these discrete administrative actions -- for example, take the cancellation of the permits. That was based on a course of conduct that included 20 formal trespasses, disregarding trespass notices by the BLM, 20 violations of his grazing permits. All of that would be part of a record before the IBLA and before a Federal court in an APA. It would have an opportunity to review those allegations and determine whether or not the alleged Federal action was unlawful. And if a court believed - -",
  "He would have to exhaust his administrative remedies, just like any number of other people who believe that they have been wronged by the Federal Government.",
  "Well, the I -- let me answer that in two ways. First the IBLA found that there was not an effort to extort or blackmail Mr. -- the Respondent for exercising his rights.",
  "Well - -",
  "No. I don't think that's what the IBLA found and we cite the part of the IBLA record at footnote 2 of our reply brief. Secondly it's well established that the Government can seek reciprocal arrangements with respect to property. The Court in the Leo Sheep case forced the Government to seek reciprocal arrangements.",
  "That's true.",
  "That's true. But I think it's important to keep in mind the scope of the claim before the Court.",
  "The BLM doesn't have to stop enforcing its laws and regulations once someone refuses to enter into reciprocal arrangements. There are thousands of reciprocal arrangements.",
  "A valuable right-of-way, Justice Scalia, that - that was for 30 years, that covered 14 miles of public road - -",
  "Well, but that did not convey with the property. It had to be reassigned in order for Mr. Robbins to take advantage of that right-of-way.",
  "Absolutely. And it's in the regulations. The right-of-way has to be reassigned, and it wasn't going to be reassigned because Respondent refused to agree to the reciprocal easement and because he refused to make rental payments.",
  "The right-of-way was for 30 years which was long than the 20-year easement that the Government got in exchange. And this something that was negotiated at arm's length by parties that didn't have the acrimonious relationship that developed between Respondent and the BLM.",
  "Well, first I don't think it gives him a cause of action under Bivens or the Just Compensation Clause. Second - -",
  "Then I, then I don't think he is a very sympathetic plaintiff to be complaining that he is entitled to violate BLM rules or regulations. There is a certain amount of give and take that we think is inherent in these reciprocal arrangements and we think that the Just Compensation Clause tolerates. These are, the Just Compensation Clause or property rights here are protected fundamentally by State law. That's why any unauthorized action by the Government is a trespass, which is, which is dealt with under State law. The Just Compensation - -",
  "I think he was on notice. The BLM made a determination that because it wasn't recorded, it wouldn't seek to enforce that against Respondent. It may be that it was -- it made a legal error on that; I don't know. But it made that determination - -",
  "But in any event, the point is that the BLM recognized that it had to negotiate a new reciprocal arrangement with Respondent and it sought to do so.",
  "Well, it, it's trying to seek, establish a new reciprocal arrangement. Regardless of why it was back in the position of having to do so, it did so in a way that it did in any number of other situations that did arise.",
  "I, I don't think so, Your Honor. I think what is distinct about the Bivens claim here is first Bivens and Just Compensation Clause claims are fundamentally incompatible. And that in Bivens, its damages are nothing. Here the constitutional right actually explicitly provides a remedy, just compensation. Secondly, just compensation claims are claims against the Government.",
  "Well -- two points. First, Davis versus Passman was decided in a day in which this Court was much more likely to infer new causes of action from the Constitution or from statutes. The Court in its recent cases, most recently Malesko, has said that it's sworn off that habit, and it's refused to recognize any new Bivens action in 25 years since those cases were decided. Secondly, the Respondent here has ample remedies and avenues that he could seek. If he believes that there has been unauthorized trespass he can seek damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act.",
  "It would be closer to it but the Court would still have to confront the question of whether it would be appropriate to infer a constitutional tort under the Just Compensation Clause. And we would urge the Court not to do so. There is an overarching question here of qualified immunity. Whatever is true with respect to whether this new constitutional tort should be created towards other claims before the Court, the Petitioners on this case were not on clear notice that their actions in responding to someone who had systematically violated the rules and regulations, which -- on the books for some time -- would subject them to personal damages actions and in fact treble damages under the RICO statute. For that, for that - -",
  "Well, if that's true - -",
  "If that's -- they would be on notice, that that conduct if true could subject them to a tort action under the Federal Tort Claims Act. There is no decision that the court of appeals or Respondent has pointed to that would put the Petitioners here on notice in the specific situation they confronted, that their actions could subject them to a constitutional tort which had never been recognized by any court, whether their actions could subject them to treble damages under RICO.",
  "You have to have - -",
  "Yes. The first question is whether he has established a violation of the right. And the rights that are alleged in this case that are before this Court, or a right under the compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment to - -",
  "No. The -- the -- the Congress has waived the sovereign immunity from those types of claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act.",
  "It's against the United States if they are acting within the scope of their conduct. If it's unauthorized actions outside the scope of the conduct, then they can go directly against the individuals. That's - -",
  "Well, then it would be additional suits in State court. They could also - - there are also State, Federal and criminal laws that they could seek to invoke or have invoked. But - -",
  "Two things, Justice Souter. First the argument was not raised below; we don't think it's properly before the Court. Second, the question under qualified immunity, and this Court made this clear in the Wyatt case and again in the Knight case, it doesn't look to the particular offense. It looks to the nature of the responsibility that the Government officials are performing. And here the nature of the responsibilities are enforcing grazing permits, enforcing access to public lands, activities that BLM officials have discretion and have had discretion for more than a century to enforce. And we think that falls squarely within the rubric of qualified immunity.",
  "I don't - -",
  "With respect, I don't think it would be. First, the large portion of the courts of appeals that have addressed this have concluded that qualified immunity principles do extend to RICO. And second, again, the focus of the inquiry is on the nature of the responsibilities. It's not on the particular offense alleged. It's not on whether there's a violation of that offense. It's the nature of the responsibilities, and here these responsibilities, enforcing permits enforcing access and use of public land, and protecting against abuse of those lands, are things that BLM officials and other government officers have exercised their discretion to do for more than - -",
  "Well, no, because we don't think that there's a violation of the Just Compensation Clause when someone doesn't take property, when someone doesn't act through allegedly - -",
  "Oh, are you -- the question with respect to qualified immunity?",
  "Well, we think that qualified immunity now - -",
  "No, because there has been no violation of the substantive Fifth Amendment right and there has been no violation of Bivens. It's important to recognize the overarching context of how the Federal Government manages the public lands. There are -- there are numerous reciprocal arrangements that could be affected by this. Any time a landowner refuses to enter into a reciprocal arrangement, he can then turn around in any government action that is taken against that landowner, all he has to do is add on an element of wrongful subjective intent, and he can bring a constitutional tort claim, or even a RICO claim like the respondent here, and subject officers to the threat of personal liability. And we think that this would have a significant skewing effect on legitimate government decision making. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First I want to clarify, the question of the assignment. And our position, it's always been our position that a new right-of-way had to be issued after the property was sold. And I'll point the Court to JA 84, which is where the BLM officials made clear at the outset that an assignment was required. Point the Court to JA 100 which is the right-of-way - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Pointing to JA 100 which is the right-of-way, which says that in accordance with Federal regulations, and I point the Court to 43 CFR 2803, which discusses assignments and makes clear that assignments have to be approved.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, assignments have to be approved by the BLM. That's - -",
  "It was never approved. And that's clear, there was never any valid assignment. That's why the reciprocal arrangement had to be negotiated anew and again, I point to 43 - -",
  "It -- it was revoked as part of the decision not to assign it. And that's clear from the decision canceling the right-of-way. There was no assignment that could be approved, and rents had not been paid on it. So it was combined with the assignment.",
  "In order for the right-of-way, because these are rights-of-way to public lands. They have to approved by new -- once new property owners seek to assert them. And again the - -",
  "But, but again it's clear -- and it was not approved, and one of the reasons it wasn't approved was because rents weren't paid and he wasn't agreeing by the terms and conditions of the regulations which are part of the right-of-way. And that's at JA 100. The next point I wanted to make, Justice Kennedy, is we agreed this would be a dramatic new extension of Bivens, and we agree with Justice Breyer, the problems or types of litigations that this new constitutional tort would create are really just -- the -- capable of the imagination.",
  "No, it's not. Because the Respondent here has more statutory and administrative remedies available to him than the plaintiff in Passman did, including claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act for trespasses, for any of the other alleged wrongs that you've heard about here today. These were -- these were wrongs that were addressed by the IBLA and the APA.",
  "They don't have a Bivens remedy and they don't have a RICO remedy. I'd point the Court to Lujan versus National Wildlife Federation, where the Court said that in that situation what a plaintiff must do is challenge each administrative action individually, and the types of programmatic pattern challenges are for Congress, they're for executive branches; they are for inspector generals.",
  "I think the law and this Court reasonably assumes that where individuals have remedies available to them through challenging individual - -",
  "It's reasonable to assume that if there are actions against United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, or actions finding Government conduct unauthorized under the APA, that the Government will take action to prevent that. Here every action that was challenged was found to be appropriate and lawful under the existing regime. We would urge the Court to reverse.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner takes the position that a school district may both refuse to provide a child with a disability with an appropriate public placement and refuse to pay for an appropriate private placement. This Court has twice before considered and twice before unanimously rejected - -",
  "I think he does in the sense, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, that the -- the school district can take the position, even if the IET that is proposed is inadequate and it's adjudicated to be inadequate, because the Schaffer presumption that was brought up earlier does not apply in this case. Because we are talking about situations where a parent can prove that the placement was inadequate. In that situation the parent cannot qualify for reimbursement unless it subjects his child to the inappropriate placement. This Court rejected that rationale in clear and unambiguous terms in the Burlington case. Justice Rehnquist put it in that case - -",
  "Under a different statute but interpreting the fundamental requirement of the statute that all children with disabilities are entitled to a free and appropriate public education. But that requirement didn't change, and this is what Justice Rehnquist - -",
  "The -- the part of the Burlington case I'm referring to Justice Scalia is the interpretation of the fundamental requirement of providing free and appropriate public education. And what Justice Rehnquist said there -- and the unanimous Court agreed -- is forcing a parent to choose between subjecting his child to inadequate public placement or paying for private placement deprives the parent of his right to a free and appropriate public education.",
  "The way the 10-business-days requirement works in practice is that all of the IEPs - - virtually all of them are proposed towards the end of the school year; and, typically, the parent is submitted the proposed IEP during the summer. And it's at that point that they have to make a decision whether to litigate that, put their child in a private school, or put them into a public school. So the 10 business days in practice is not going to require the child to go into the inadequate placement. That was true in the fact pattern - -",
  "And we don't -- we don't dispute that - -",
  "In order -- in order to qualify for reimbursment in that provision which is -- which is followed by the provision describing in more concrete detail the circumstances that courts ought to take into account in determining whether reimbursement is appropriate. And if I can explain the way we read Section 1412(a)(10)((C), the first part of that subsection is Subsection (C)(i). That hasn't come up during the argument today. It is barely mentioned in Petitioner's brief. That subsection -- it is on page 5a in the appendix to the Gray brief, lays down the general rule -- the rule that tells school districts when they don't have to worry about paying reimbursement. And that is when they provide a free, a public -- an appropriate public education in the first place. That -- that is consistent with Burlington and Carter, and that lays down the general rule. School districts that provide an appropriate placement don't have to worry about reimbursement. Subsection (C)(ii) then goes on to identify a particular fact pattern which also happens to be the most common situation in which reimbursement claims are presented to the courts. And Congress in that situation, along with Subsections (3) and (4), provided the courts with more concrete guidance in determining how to exercise their discretion in that situation. The legislative history supports that interpretation. On pages 25 to 29 of the National Disability Rights Network brief they explain how Congress in the legislative history indicates that they were focused on case law applying this Court's decision in Burlington and Carter where the students were already enrolled in public school. There is no indication whatsoever at all in the legislative record that anybody had in mind scaling back the fundamental mandate of the statute for school districts to provide a free and appropriate public education for every child.",
  "And it would, Your Honor, insofar as we are dealing with flushing out the requirements for students enrolled in public school. But there is no indication that Congress meant to scale back this Court's interpretation of the act's fundamental mandate to provide a free and appropriate public education. Petitioner's give-it-a-try rationale just doesn't fit to advance its argument before this Court. It doesn't fit to the extent that Petitioner is suggesting that you have to give public school a try, because it's clear that the -- their interpretation would apply to students in public school, as well as private school. It would apply to all students entering the special education system, including the student who's been enrolled in public school from kindergarten to 11th grade. If he hasn't previously received special-education or related services, then, under Petitioner's view, if he's offered a grossly inadequate plan, he has to be subjected to that plan in order for his parents to qualify. And Petitioner's interpretation doesn't require the parents to give the proposed placement at issue a try. All it requires is that they show that they received previous special-education services at some point in the past. And that's the way it worked in Burlington; that's the way it worked in Carter; and that's the way it works in most of the cases. Students are already in the special education system, and they are proposed an IET at some point typically during the summer. And the parents at that time say this IET is inadequate for my child, and I want to - -",
  "If you have previously received special- education services. But my point, Justice Scalia, is under Petitioner's -- the way they read the statute, you don't have to give the proposed placement at issue a try. So to the extent that this Court thinks, or Petitioner is arguing, that Congress wanted to make sure that we could better evaluate whether or not this proposed placement proposed placement is going to work for this child. That doesn't fit with the statutory language because in practice the students - - all they have to show is that they received services at some point in the past and if they have they can go into private school and seek reimbursement. It doesn't require a student to be subjected to the inadequate plan unless you happen to be the student who is enrolled in public school or enrolled in private school and you're entering the special education system. At that point then, Petitioner's interpretation requires the parents to enroll their child who has already been determined to have a learning disability in a plan that is inadequate, and we think that is an untenable result.",
  "That's true, Your Honor. But two points about that -- first, parents who do enroll their children in private school at their own financial risk. And as Justice Scalia pointed out in his concurring and dissenting opinion in Winkelman, there are particular incentives against bringing frivolous reimbursement claims in this context.",
  "And Justice Scalia -- two points on that, first the statute provides in clear and unambiguous terms that all children with disabilities are entitled to a free and appropriate education. The child find requirement, which Section 1412 - -",
  "And I agree with you on that, Justice Scalia, and that's why the way that school districts can avoid reimbursement is to offer an adequate placement in the first place. That's what Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(i) provides. It lays down the general rule. School district today talks about we need to have collaboration, we need to have cooperation during the IEP process. They hold all the cards during that process. And if they want to avoid reimbursement they should do what this Court said in the Carter case, that's provide the student with a free, appropriate public education.",
  "I disagree with that, Your Honor. I think that's inconsistent with the statutory mandate to provide a free and appropriate education for all children with disabilities. I would say though, and I want to be clear on this -- even though appearance of students in private school or in public school who haven't previously received special education or related services qualify for reimbursement under our interpretation of the statute. It doesn't mean that they are entitled to reimbursement. In the situations Your Honor may have in mind, where the parents genuinely aren't complying in good faith or genuinely aren't interested in sending their kids to public school, they only want to try to gain the system -- in those hypothetical situations, courts have equitable discretion to deny reimbursement claims, and they have denied those reimbursement claims.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Evidence of discrimination by other supervisors within the company is sometimes but not always admissible in a disparate-treatment case to help prove discrimination by the plaintiff's own supervisor.",
  "I think you need to look at the evidence under both rules, the first question being whether it meets the minimum-evidence threshold in 401. And that is a very low threshold set by the Federal rules. The second question being whether it may be excluded under Rule 403, which would - -",
  "Yes. We do think that there are some instances where other-supervisor evidence is not admissible under 401. For example, if you have a large company and you have a plaintiff in the Chicago office claiming that her supervisor had it out for her and she wants to put on the testimony of an employee in the Seattle office who two years ago complained that her supervisor had it out for her, we think that that would not be relevant under 401.",
  "You have a company of 70,000 people, but you have allegations that supervisors in the same division, implementing the same company-wide reduction-in-force plan in the same timeframe and giving similar explanations under similar circumstances, engaged in discrimination. We think that the district dissenting judge in the court of appeals was right to say that evidence of that kind is at least marginally relevant, which would then put the focus on whether this evidence could be excluded under 403.",
  "Well, I think you've got other situations as well, Justice Scalia. I think we've got a situation of a general comment of discriminatory animus. For example, older people just don't get it, something like that. I think the -- the -- by a different supervisor. I think even if that's within the same office, the plaintiff is going to be hard-pressed even to meet the minimum-relevance threshold. But the relevance threshold, as this Court has recognized in the Furnco v. Waters case and the Huddlestone case, this is a broad threshold that allows evidence in. And then we look at the other parts of Article IV of the Federal Rules of Evidence to see whether it may be excluded - -",
  "Well, I would point to several criteria, Justice Scalia, in determining relevance. First, whether you're dealing with same alleged -- same kind of alleged discrimination and a common catalyst; second, whether the proffered witnesses are working in the same corporate vicinity; third, whether they are alleging discrimination in the same time frame; four, whether they are alleging a pattern or practice of discrimination.",
  "Well, you would look at the proffered evidence. For example, in this case you have evidence that all of the proffered witnesses were terminated under the same companywide reduction in force. You've got a common catalyst. In this case, you've got employees who worked in the same geographic vicinity, the headquarters of Sprint, the same office complex or at least the same vicinity. You've got witnesses who were terminated on the same day - -",
  "I think it is more likely - -",
  "Where you have supervisors in the same division, in the same vicinity, carrying out the same plan, providing the same distinct explanations in similar circumstances, a reasonable juror might infer that plaintiff's own - -",
  "Yes, with respect to the minimum threshold of relevance. Keep in mind, once - -",
  "Well, I think if you're talking about pattern of practice, maybe doesn't -- certainly as a matter of law that's not a -- going to prove a pattern of practice, and the employer can make that argument to the district judge, to the jury, and that evidence could be limited or excluded. If you have got, for example, a -- a proffered witness who's complaining that supervisors in the same complex used the same distinctive explanation that my supervisor gave me - - for example, in this case, several of the witnesses were going to testify that their supervisors told them they were being -- they were removed because their positions were being eliminated, and then they later found out that younger persons assumed their jobs.",
  "The plaintiff has - -",
  "The plaintiffs - -",
  "The plaintiff has the burden of showing that the evidence is relevant, Justice Kennedy.",
  "That's correct, and that's why as I said the plaintiff has to show that the evidence is relevant, that it has some tendency to make a fact or consequence more likely. This Court in the Huddlestone case confronted - -",
  "And Justice Scalia - -",
  "It might. And that probably would be a strong candidate for exclusion under 403. In the Furnco case - -",
  "Well, we -- we acknowledge that the record isn't precisely clear on that. We think that --",
  "Largely because of what was said in the order, and because of the way it was briefed.",
  "Well, it doesn't say 401, but the reason why the evidence can't come in is because the -- the proffered witnesses didn't have the same supervisor. The order is on page 24.",
  "What the court excluded is any evidence of the pattern - -",
  "It's relevant, but not it's certainly not determinative, and we think in a case like this, where this kind of evidence is the critical evidence for the trial -- in the case - -",
  "Yeah - -",
  "With respect, Justice Scalia, in this case, this proffered evidence was the crux of the trial, the critical issue. It came up not only in the context of the motion in limine, it came up in the context of the motion for a new trial. And if you look at what the district court said in denying a motion for a new trial, she said again -- and this is on page 436 of the JA -- she says, \"none of the proffered evidence makes it more likely that the decisionmakers in this case discriminated against the plaintiff.\" That's relevance language, and you're quite right - -",
  "Well, the district court serves as a gateway. District courts have tremendous discretion under the Federal rules to determine whether or not evidence is relevant, and whether or not it should be excluded under 403. So that determination is made by the district court. In some cases, as happened in the Huddlestone case -- that was a 404(d) case -- the court acknowledged in some cases the evidence may go in and then the jury may instruct that that evidence is allowed.",
  "Well, if you're pointing to other acts of discrimination by other supervisors that are relevant, then that would be allowed in, and the employer would come in and present their counter evidence - -",
  "In our system we put that evidence before a jury. If it is relevant under the Federal rules, it is admissible. We put before a jury --",
  "And - -",
  "In the Furnco case, the Court said that -- that the evidence doesn't have to conclusively demonstrate the fact. It simply has to be relevant. We put relevant evidence before juries, we instruct them on the consideration of that evidence, permit the defendants to put that evidence into context, and then we ask juries to draw a conclusion - -",
  "No. I think you'd look at it under the relevance threshold, and I think you'd look at it under 403. 403 is going to exclude a lot of this evidence. It is going to exclude the barely evidence, the barely relevant evidence. But it -- we would expect a trial court in this kind of situation to make some kind of findings as to why this evidence is excludable, and we would expect the court of appeals not to undertake a de novo 403 balancing in its own instance.",
  "That's correct, and that's the way this case was litigated all the way until to the reply brief in this case. If there are no further questions?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners ask this Court to invalidate a method of execution that everyone agrees is entirely pain free when followed and to order the State of Kentucky to adopt a method that has never been used in any execution and is out of step with the laws and practice in every death penalty jurisdiction in the United States. The proposed constitutional standard that Petitioners say requires this extraordinary result has several fundamental flaws. First, it is at odds with this Court's precedence establishing a substantial risk threshold for claims of future injury in the Eighth Amendment context and this Court's cases holding that the added anguish caused by the negligent, accidental or inadvertent infliction of pain is not the unnecessary infliction of pain prescribed by the Eighth Amendment. Justice Marshall wrote that for the Court in the Estelle v. Gamble opinion on page 105, and this Court has reiterated the principle that negligent, accidental or inadvertent infliction of pain, however strong or anguishing, is not proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.",
  "A few things. We are here today in this Section 1983 action, because this Court and the Hill case and the Nelson case analogized methods of execution claims to conditions of confinement claims insofar as these claims are not directed to the punishment itself, but to the manner in which punishment is implemented or carried out. So this Court itself under the Hill and Nelson case put these types of cases into the conditions of confinement.",
  "I don't think it is, Justice Souter. The substantial risk standard that the Court has applied in the Farmer v. Brennan case and the Hiland v. McKinney case -- applied to conditions of confinement claims -- where inmates faced the risk of an excruciating pain or even death. If the risk -- if the standard that the Court applies to someone who is forced to spend -- to live with a five pack a day smoker is substantial risk, even though that person faces the risk of developing lung cancer, which everybody would agree is excruciatingingly painful death they're not sure why the Constitution would place any different standard with respect to the types of claims at issue in this case.",
  "We think that that could be part of the analysis -- that you would look to other feasible available alternatives. Although I would say that - -",
  "Well, Justice - -",
  "And we agree with that, and that's why we think that Petitioner's claim is wrong. It's going to lead to endless litigation and a regime in which there is no finality. The other point I wanted to make, in response to Justice Alito, is that as a threshold matter, this court case is establishing that you have to show with respect to the method you're challenging, a risk that is more than the risk of negligence or accident in the method that is being carried out. And again, Estelle v. Gamble establishes that, Farmer v. Brennan reiterates that - -",
  "Well, the way that we've described it, Justice Kennedy, is you that have to show a substantial risk that the method you're challenging would impose a considerably greater degree of pain than other available feasible alternatives. But to get into that kind of comparative inquiry, we do think that you have to get over the first threshold established by this Court's cases -- that you're arguing about something other than the accidental or negligent infliction of pain, and we don't think Petitioners in this case have even gotten over that hurdle.",
  "Well, threshold two would as well because once you're into that kind of comparative inquiry you would still have to take a look at the feasible other alternative and no one has ever tried the one drug alternative. Justice Breyer you're right we don't know whether it's going to work in practice.",
  "And the answer is no. First and foremost they had an opportunity to develop the one drug alternative below. They made no effort to present any evidence on that. The record is completely undeveloped and typically this court doesn't allow people to go back and relitigate a case again.",
  "We think that this court should decide the issue. We think it should decide it by saying Petitioners have not established a constitutionally significant.",
  "Let me make two responses to that if I could again we don't think Petitioners have shown anything close to a substantially of risk and second a virtue in allowing there is a virtue in not going further in this case and allowing the states themselves to continue to assess this matter. The states have continuously reassessed and repeated modifications to their lethal injection protocols three states within the last years have taken major internal reviews of the three drug protocol California Tennessee and Florida they have all concluded that additional safeguards were warranted but that - -",
  "That would be - -",
  "Yes.",
  "That would be the end of the matter.",
  "That's probably true. There is no shortage of imagination on the death penalty advocates that have brought those kinds of claims but a decision along those lines would go a great way to providing greater clarity and certainly in this area.",
  "May I answer the question.",
  "Yes Your Honor. The Federal Government concluded that that was an appropriate dosage to ensure a deep consciousness among the condemned inmate. Other jurisdictions have picked three grams and I would say that the Federal Government is currently considering whether five or three is the correct dosage. But the Federal Government - -",
  "Unconsciousness, yes to render the inmate deeply unconscious for a number of hours that's established by the record thank you very much.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Age Discrimination and Employment Act does not expressly prohibit retaliation in the Federal sector context and it should not be read to impliedly prohibits such conduct either.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the Court did so very, very focused on Title IX, the Court's cases interpreting the language of discrimination in Title IX broadly. And it specifically distinguished statutes like Title VII and the Age Discrimination Act which delineate different types of discrimination. In fact, on page 175 of the Court's decision in Jackson, the Court said because Congress did not list any specific discriminatory practices when it wrote Title IX, its failure to mention one such practice does not tell us anything. And then it pointed to the fact that Title VII had delineated certain types of practices.",
  "I think that would be unfair, Justice Alito. The government's position is that statutory context matters. It made that clear in footnote 1 of its Jackson brief before this Court. It's made it clear in this case. In this case, there are several indicia of statutory intent that are lacking where you have a general prohibition in the context of the inferred right that has -- that this Court has treated differently, as it did in Jackson and as it should in the did in the CBOCS case that you'll hear about tomorrow. In the Age Discrimination Act you have separate provisions of the Act which explicitly delineate different types of discrimination, including retaliatory discrimination, and in the Federal sector prohibition the Congress added in 1974, it added that at a time where it decided to treat State employers like Federal employers, specifically put the State employers in the definition of employer for the Federal -- for the private sector provision of the Age Discrimination Act, and it created a stand-alone provision for Federal employers. And then it went even further. It specifically said in subsection (f) of section 633a, the Federal sector provision, that the Federal sector provision should be unaffected by the private sector provision, the bootstrap to make clear that courts should not be reading into the Federal sector provision the additional protections or other provisions in the private sector provisions. And this Court recognized the significance of that construction, that statutory scheme in the Lehman v. Nakshian case. In that case, the Court considered whether Federal employees were entitled to a right to a jury trial in an action for discrimination under the Federal sector prohibition. Private sector employees were entitled to that. And so the plaintiffs in that case made an argument very much similar to the argument made by Petitioners in this case: Well, the private sector provisions covered a jury trial right; it would make no sense not to have a jury trial - -",
  "Well, let me try to answer that question, Justice Ginsburg, but I just want to make one final point on Lehman and the statutory construction in that case. The Court specifically said on page 162 of its decision that because Congress demonstrated that it knew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial when it wished to do so elsewhere in the very legislation cited, but in section 633a it explicitly failed to do so, and it said that that was the conclusive point of statutory construction in that case. So we do think the Lehman case is very on point here. With respect to the general notion that it's uncommon to provide -- not to provide an anti-retaliation right when you do have an underlying anti-discrimination prohibition, certainly we would agree with you that it is uncommon, but we don't think that it is absurd. It's certainly not absurd where Congress was aware that there was a separate set of protections available for Federal workers - -",
  "Well, we know that Congress in the Civil Service Reform Act, as the Chief Justice noted, we know that it didn't think that additional anti-retaliation protections were necessary for some Federal employees. So the fact that Congress wouldn't have a separate anti-retaliation -- anti-retaliation right in some situation in itself is not unprecedented. We do think that the statute has several indicia that make clear that Congress did not intend to provide an anti-retaliation right here. Not only the contrast between the private sector and Federal sector provisions, but look at what Congress expressed in section 633a. In at least three respects this is materially unlike the typical anti-retaliation right.",
  "As we make clear in our brief, we have not conceded that, Justice Alito. We don't think it's necessary for the courts to decide that in this case - -",
  "I think in practice, Your Honor, we have not challenged the interpretation of the Federal courts that have found that Title VII does incorporate an anti-retaliation right. But there are at least - -",
  "I'm not aware of a circuit court that has gone the other way on Title VII. Certainly the Age Discrimination Act is different. The First Circuit in this case explicitly recognized that the textual differences between Title VII and the Age Act call for a different result. And there are at least two differences that we do think call for a different result under the Age Act. The first is the fact that, whereas Title VII expressly incorporates the private sector provisions of the Act and by reference the anti-retaliation provision of the Act - -",
  "Well, this Court actually has interpreted that phrase, \"as applicable,\" in a case called Chandler v. Radabush. It wasn't cited in the brief, but it is directly responsive to that question. And the cite there is 425 U.S. 840. And in that case the Court said that the \"as applicable\" language just means that there are certain provisions of the private sector remedies that are inherently incompatible in the Federal sector context. And it pointed to the provisions in the private sector part of Title VII that allowed EEOC or the attorney general to intervene in the private action and take over the suit. So the \"as applicable\" doesn't undermine the express incorporation of private sector remedies and anti-retaliation. And that's a critical difference between Title VII and the Age Act. The Age Act not only does not include that express incorporation, it goes in just the opposite direction, and Congress went out of its way to say don't import the private sector provisions -- it did that in section 633a(f) -- don't incorporate those provisions, and that's what this Court recognized.",
  "Well, this Court in the - -",
  "I don't think there is any legislative history on point. The Petitioners argue that it meant don't incorporate the more restrictive features. But that argument is directly contradicted by this Court's decision in Lehman, where it pointed to section, subsection (f) of that provision as a reason to not import in the jury trial right that was not recognized for private sector employees. The other way - -",
  "Yes. She is a nonpreference-eligible employee of the Postal Service. That means that she has to pursue her remedies under the collective bargaining arrangement, which gives her a remedy to complain about reprisal. And it means that the union representative would present that grievance on her behalf. But it also means that if for some reason she felt that her right of -- her obligation of fair representation was not carried through, she could go to court and complain about that. This Court in a case called Bowen v. United States Postal Service recognized that employees who don't get fair representation can go into court and complain about that. So she is protected - -",
  "I believe the remedies are largely co-extensive in that the principal remedy that you would get under the Age Act, under the Civil Service Reform Act and I believe under the collective bargaining agreements, although I frankly am not certain about that - -",
  "Right.",
  "Well, then this Court would be directly disregarding the express intent in section 663a, where it says affecting employees or applicants of employees -- for employment who are at least 40 years of age. And further, in section 633 - -",
  "I think that's right, but if we're going to talk about anomalies then we have to recognize that that is an anomalous grant of retaliation protection right that only protects people within the protected class with respect to discrimination.",
  "If - -",
  "I think it's a great deal more anomalous, with respect, Justice Souter. With both anti-retaliation provisions, whistleblower provisions, all the provisions that the government is aware of, including all the ones cited in Petitioners in its brief, protect all employees, all - -",
  "Well, that's not the way the courts have interpreted it, Justice - -",
  "What the courts have focused on is the \"any employee\" language of section 623d of the private sector provisions. And that's the way - -",
  "And that's the longstanding interpretation of the EEOC and I don't think there's been any doubt in the courts to date that under the private sector provision you can bring claims for retaliation if you're an employee, and of course that's the way it is under Title VII. We do think that it would be anomalous to say that employees who complain about age discrimination or who testify about age discrimination in a case are not entitled to protection if there is an anti-retaliation right, and if they are under the age of 40; and there is at least two other respects in which - -",
  "Well, I think that that's right. But it's odd to say that this prohibition in 663a, which is clearly limited to people -- and I think by - -",
  "That's not -- that's not the way the courts have interpreted for more than 20 years under the statute.",
  "It is a prohibition.",
  "Right, and then that would be - - their argument is that 663a contains that prohibition, and so therefore it is limited by 631b.",
  "I wouldn't disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice. I'm not sure it's unusual to have retaliation claims piggyback on discrimination claims, but I think you're right.",
  "I wouldn't doubt that. I think in most cases you do have discrimination claims. I would say, though, that our research indicated that in the Age Discrimination Act context, at least the private sector context, only 14 percent of the claims involve - - cases involve retaliation claims, which is lower than other statutes. I wanted to point out two respects - -",
  "I don't know.",
  "I don't know the answer to that question.",
  "She abandoned that claim at the summary judgment stage. That's my understanding, Justice Ginsburg, and of course we are here today because she is still pursuing her anti-retaliation claim; and certainly if there is an anti-retaliation right, we've agreed that you could pursue that independent of whether you complained about the underlying discrimination, but we do think that in at least three respects the prohibition in 663a is incompatible with an anti-retaliation right. One, we think it is limited only to the people within the protected class, people 40 years old. Two, it's limited to personnel actions, which means if you think about it in the context of this Court's decision in the Burlington Northern case and the Oregon case, it's limited to workplace-related things that happened to you, and in Burlington Northern the Court specifically said, in holding that Title VII's anti-retaliatory provision was broader than that, was that it would defeat or at least limit the purpose of achieving the purpose of an anti-retaliation provision, to limit it workplace-related harm. And then third, of course, the discrimination that's expressed in section 633 is discrimination based on age, not discrimination based on conduct -- the conduct of complaining about or exercising your rights under Federal law. And that, that - -",
  "With respect - -",
  "I think if we have the conduct and status alone, then I think you're in the Jackson box. But where you've got the three indicia that you have here, which indicate that this provision is incompatible with the typical anti-retaliatory provision, and you couple that with other indicia of statutory intent -- you have the competing schemes in the statute between private sector where Congress specifically delineated an anti-retaliation right, with the fact that it didn't delineate that right in the Federal sector scheme; the evolution of the statute - - where you have Congress specifically deciding not to put in Federal employers with private employers, as it did for States having the separate provision; and the distinctions between 663a and 623 of the Act -- 623 of the Act is the main private sector prohibition; 663a, the Federal sector provision, doesn't have all the other types of practices that are prohibited by 623. For example, pensions -- pensions are specifically addressed by 623. Congress didn't address that in 663a of this Act. It presumably understood that it either would address it through other means if there were other protections out there. Similarly we think with respect to retaliation. Congress knew how to express an anti-retaliation right. It did so forcibly in the private sector provisions of the Act; and that language which you find in 623d of the Act is simply completely absent in 663a of the Act.",
  "I do think that, Justice Alito. There certainly are several differences between Title VII and the Age Act, and I'm not sure that Congress has explained each difference, but nevertheless they exist and this Court has recognized them, most recently in the Smith v. City of Jackson case, where the Court noted that because of textual differences between acts, there is less protection with disparate impacts of discrimination under the Age Act and Title VII. It's also the case that Congress has provided for compensatory damages in Title VII and not in the Age Act. It's also the case that there is a right, a Federal right to a jury trial in Federal sector actions in Title VII but not in the age act. And this Court has recognized, in Smith v. City of Jackson, that Congress has treated age discrimination as if it's qualitatively different and presumably accorded different protections taking that into account. So, the notion that this -- that the Age Act is different than Title VII or different than other Federal statutes in itself with respect to retaliation in itself is not unusual, and it's especially not unusual when you take into account that there is this back-stop protection that's - -",
  "Well, we -- no, Justice Stevens. I think that the textual argument that the courts have embraced with respect to 623d, the anti-retaliation provision, is because in 623d the Congress specifically said \"with respect to any employees or applicants.\" It couldn't have meant with respect to only 40, only employees who are over 40. And, again, that's the way it's been interpreted consistently for decades under the statute. And we think, though, that giving effect to the language in 633a, you have express prohibition limited to people over 40 years old, and that it is anomaly, and we're not aware of any other situation that --",
  "I think - -",
  "I think that is the practical effect. This Court has recognized, in Bush -- in the Bush v. Lucas case, which dealt with the question of whether to infer a retaliation remedy for constitutional claims by a Federal employee -- that Federal employment practices present different questions. It's an area in which this Court uniquely defers to the policy judgments of Congress, recognizing that Congress has greater resources to police Federal employment, that there are a number of balances that have to be struck between government efficiency and the rights of Federal employees.",
  "That's true - -",
  "Well, what would happen, if you had an employee alleging discrimination on the basis of age and retaliation, that would be a so-called mixed complaint. They could bring that to the - -",
  "If it's purely - -",
  "-- a retaliation claim, they'd have to bring it under the protections afforded by the Civil Service Reform Act.",
  "I don't have any evidence.",
  "I wasn't - -",
  "Well, I guess, if I could just add though, I don't think there's any reason to doubt that certainly Congress had any concerns about whether the system under the Civil Service Reform Act is working properly.",
  "My assumption is that Congress felt that the back-stop protections that were available for Federal workers at the time it passed the Age Discrimination Act and that were subsequently codified by Congress in the Civil Service Reform Act were appropriate for people who complained about age. As I mentioned earlier - -",
  "I don't know the -- Congress didn't tell us the answer to that.",
  "Well, I think the reason would be that Congress viewed age discrimination as materially different than other types of discrimination, and it - - either it felt that the risk of retaliation wasn't as great or that the protections -- that it didn't need to add protections. And as I mentioned - -",
  "Your Honor, again, Congress didn't say -- I'm not -- I think you can make the same argument with respect to why it gave Federal employees a jury trial right under Title VII but not under the Age Act, why it gave Federal employees compensatory damages under Title VII but not under the Age Act.",
  "Well, you can bring them together. What you would do is you would bring a discrimination claim under the Age Act and you'd bring a reprisal claim under the Civil Service Reform Act.",
  "You can bring them both together before the Merit Systems Protection Board, if you're - -",
  "Well, in -- what would happen there is you would have your proceeding in the Merit Systems Protection Board, which would decide the discrimination claim and the retaliation claim. At that point, the employee could decide to go to the EEOC to try to fight on discrimination, or the employee could go to Federal court, and in Federal court he would get a de novo trial on his -- on his discrimination claim and a record review - -",
  "No, I don't think so. And it's a clear difference. There are several types of mixed claims that can be brought in this fashion. Once you get to Federal court on your Age Act discrimination claim, you get a trial de novo on that claim. You just only get record review of the Civil Service Reform Act claim because that's what Congress deemed appropriate.",
  "If it doesn't amount to an adverse action, then you have to go the route that Congress thought appropriate for - -",
  "Well, you would have -- you would -- it would be investigated by the Office of Special Counsel.",
  "It would not, and that's what Congress deemed appropriate for those types of actions.",
  "But there are at least two material textual differences between Title VII and the ADA -- and the Age Act. The first is that the Title - - the Title VII - -",
  "Well, to understand the meaning of that section you have to understand the meaning of the whole section itself including this express incorporation. And, secondly - -",
  "The Court does not have to decide the - -",
  "I think that that's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think this Court recognized similar considerations in the Bush versus Lucas case.",
  "Well -- and that's because Congress gave them one, and this is - -",
  "I think, at least with respect to congressional employees, I'm not sure that they would have been protected by the Civil Service Reform Act protections that existed for executive agency employees, but -- but look at the statutes -- and we cite them at page 36 in the appendix and our brief -- in those two statutes, Congress used the same substantive prohibition that is in section 633(a): \"All personnel actions affecting these employees shall be made free from discrimination based on age.\" But they explicitly included a separate anti-retaliation provision, which, again -- that's a subsequent statute, but that's - - again, that's another indication that Congress doesn't think that this kind of general prohibition in section 633(a) covers discrimination. When it wants to cover retaliation, it passes an express anti-retaliation provision Thank you.",
  "It was of consequence, but FERC still believed it had some interpretive authority after the decision. Maybe this was a wrong judgment at the time, but FERC thought that it still had some interpretive authority under the decision, and that it could - -",
  "Well, FERC - -",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under this Court's precedents and universal international law norms, the government of Iraq, like all sovereign nations, has a sovereign right and jurisdiction to try and punish individuals, including American citizens, who voluntarily enter its borders, commit crimes in its country, and remain there. In two independent respects, the court of appeals in the Omar case lost sight of that principle and departed from this Court's precedents: First by exercising habeas jurisdiction at all; and second by sustaining an injunction that the court of appeals itself recognized prevented the government of Iraq from trying and punishing Mr. Omar for any crimes that he committed in Iraq. As to the jurisdictional question, we believe that this Court's decision Hirota versus MacArthur points to the conclusion that habeas jurisdiction is lacking over these cases because the habeas petitioners are being held under international authority pursuant to determinations made by an international Multinational Force acting and carrying out a United Nations mandate, and in Mr. Munaf's case pursuant to an order of the Iraqi courts that he remain in custody while proceedings go forward in the trial court.",
  "Well, that is the difference, Justice Souter. And I think, to be clear, if this Court does find jurisdiction in these cases, we think that citizenship would be a basis -- would have to be the basis for jurisdiction, and we urge this Court to limit its decision to that ruling, because that would have profound practical consequences.",
  "That's true, and let me explain why we think that Hirota does govern the circumstances in this case, notwithstanding that this case involves citizens and notwithstanding that the Petitioners in Hirota had been the subject of an international conviction. First of all, we don't think that Hirota would have come out differently if the habeas petitioners had filed suit earlier and sought to enjoin the international proceeding in Hirota and sought an injunction that would have prevented the conviction from taking case. Secondly, we do think that, although one obviously has to take a careful look at the Court's decision in Hirota, we think that what the Court did say points to the conclusion that it was the international authority that was key to the Court's finding that there was no jurisdiction. I think there's at least a couple - -",
  "Well, obviously the Court reached that conclusion in Hirota as to aliens. With respect to citizens, I think that the key for the jurisdictional question under the habeas statute is whether or not these individuals are in custody under and by color of United States authority. Just as the Court presumably concluded in Hirota that the petitioners in Hirota were not under custody under color of United States authority, we think that the Petitioners here are not. And so we think - -",
  "If I can make - -",
  "-- two points in response to that. First, ultimately the United Nations controls the strings and the source and the scope of international authority. The -- the current Security Council resolutions are set to expire in December. It could - - it could eliminate those resolutions today and that source of international authority would exist and we wouldn't be here arguing that these individuals are being held pursuant to international mandate.",
  "There has been a subsequent resolution. It's Resolution 1790, and that resolution is set to expire this December. And the -- the government of Iraq and the other parties have indicated that this will be the last extension. Obviously, they'll have to assess the situation in December. But the international authority that existed at the time of the briefing continues to exist. The other point I was going to make, Justice Souter, is your point about American domination or influence over the Multinational Force was equally true with respect to the force in Hirota. You had - -",
  "So I don't think that that's a basis for distinguishing Hirota. The - -",
  "Well, again, I think that Hirota -- the amount of influence that the United States forces have over the international force isn't a basis for distinguishing Hirota. But to get to your point about citizenship, I guess we would say a few things. One, we that think the Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in Hirota and the court of appeals below recognized that the theory of the Court's decision in Hirota doesn't lend itself to a citizenship exception. The habeas statute, as this Court emphasized in the Rasul case, doesn't have a citizenship -- doesn't distinguish between citizens and aliens, and it has since 1789 contained the requirement that the person be in custody under or by color of United States' authority. So - -",
  "Not the concurring opinion. We're relying on the Court's decision in Hirota, but we look at the concurring opinion; we've looked at the briefs. We've tried to discern the best principle of law from that decision. And the principle that we think it stands for is that where individuals are held under international authority by the judgment of several nations, not the law of any single nation, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the custody of such individuals.",
  "If I can make a couple of points. One, the parties in Hirota, the habeas petitioners, made very clear that they weren't asking this Court to review the international conviction. They made very clear that they were asking this Court to review the actions of American officers under United States law. They made that clear on page 14 of their merits brief, where they said -- and I'm quoting here - - \"We are not asking this Court to review the decision of international court\" -- end quote. And quoting again: \"All the questions deal solely with official actions taken by General MacArthur as citizen and U.S. Army officer.\" -- end quote. And again on page 15, quote: \"We repeat again that we bring into question only unlawful action taken by General MacArthur for us.\" The other point that I would make is these individuals -- they haven't been convicted pursuant to a trial, like the individuals in Hirota, but these individuals are being held pursuant to determinations made by the Multinational Force carrying out the international mandate. In Mr. Omar's case, he not only received a three-judge tribunal shortly after his detention and capture, but he also received a determination before a nine-officer combined review release board, consisting of six Iraqi officials and three Multinational Force officials, who determined that he was a security internee who should be detained in accordance with the United Nations mandate. Now, Mr. Munaf's case did proceed before the Iraqi criminal court because an injunction was not entered against those proceedings. The Iraqi court initially did enter a conviction. That conviction was reversed on appeal by the court of cassation. We think that -- that the recent decision is significant in a couple of respects. I think, one, it underscores there is an Iraqi legal system, that that system is capable of processing these cases and hearing from these individuals, and is capable of granting relief where appropriate action isn't taken. And, two, the Iraqi court order setting aside the conviction, much like an appellate order in this country would, remanded the case for further proceedings but directed that Mr. Munaf and his codefendant - -",
  "Yes, both.",
  "The individuals are detained by the Multinational Force while there are proceedings before the Iraqi court - -",
  "Yes. In Mr. Munaf's case, there were four investigative hearings and a trial, after which he was convicted. In Mr. Omar's case, if he were -- if the proceedings were allowed to go forward, he would remain in MNF-I custody during the course of the Iraqi proceedings. And then, if there is a conviction and that conviction is sustained on appeal, the Iraqi government issues an order, a transfer order, to the Multinational Force. The Multinational Force makes a determination to carry out that order.",
  "And, again - -",
  "There are 24,000 people currently being held by the Multinational Force, the vast majority of whom obviously are aliens. Two thousand individuals held by the Multinational Force have been transferred to Iraqi custody. Many if not most of those individuals have undergone court proceedings because the Multinational Force is obviously working in close coordination with the Iraqi government to bring to justice people who have committed crimes in Iraq. And if I could turn to the second question, because we think that there is - -",
  "We say the same is true with respect to the allied forces - -",
  "There is not, Justice Breyer. An American - -",
  "-- official has the supreme command - -",
  "The same was true with respect not only to the tribunal, but the allied forces - -",
  "-- in Hirota.",
  "That's correct. And ultimately the key point, we think, is that those forces were acting under international mandate. The Far Eastern Commission in Hirota ultimately had say over what the force could do - -",
  "-- whereas the United Nations here ultimately has.",
  "Well, I think that that's true, but the point I wanted to make is that the United Nations today could repeal the resolutions authorizing this international force and the specific mission.",
  "They would be under the authority of the United States. We wouldn't be here arguing that this Court didn't have jurisdiction. So, ultimately, an international body distinct from the United States is controlling the strings - -",
  "As is, in our view, General Petraeus. He is sharing now the authority - -",
  "I don't think it does, for the reasons that I have already indicated to Justice Ginsburg. That wasn't the argument the parties were making in Hirota. They went out of their way to say that they weren't challenging the international conviction, that they were challenging the actions of the American officers acting under international law.",
  "It did. And if I could turn now to the second issue, because we do think there is a - -",
  "Analytically, it would be the same, Justice Stevens. As a practical matter, United States forces don't act under international authority; and, thank goodness, Multinational Forces don't act in the United States. It would make a difference as to the second question, which is to say if the individuals were detained in the United States and there was a question of transferring back to Iraq, that would be a classic extradition situation. And we'd have a whole different body of case law governing these individuals - -",
  "Absolutely. In Iraq it's undisputed that if the Multinational Force were to release them, the Iraqi authorities could arrest them, take them into their custody. The injunction that we face today is one preventing the Iraqi courts from going forward with any proceedings against Mr. Omar, preventing the Multinational Force from sharing information with Iraqi authorities about the circumstances of his release, and directly preventing the Multinational Force from transferring these individuals to Iraqi custody if they are convicted. The laws of this Court -- we go back to Reid versus Covert, The Schooner Exchange -- makes clear that when American citizens go abroad voluntarily into other countries, commit crimes in those countries, and remain in those countries, they cannot come back to this country and complain about the offenses they committed, nor complain about the modes of trial and punishment available in those countries. The Court made that express in the Neely versus Henkel case. And at least on the second question, we think that that principle establishes that the U.S. force, even assuming it has habeas jurisdiction to review their detention by the MNF-I, shouldn't be in a position of directly thwarting Iraq's sovereign right and jurisdiction to try these individuals and, if they find that they committed offenses, punish them for offenses committed in Iraq. American citizens - -",
  "I think we would maintain that American citizens, when they go abroad, they have to take what they get. I think there is some suggestion - -",
  "What -- I think what this Court said in Neely versus Henkel -- and I'm quoting from page 122, and I think it partially answers your question, Justice Kennedy: \"The Suspension Clause has no relation to crimes committed without the jurisdiction of the United States and against the laws of a foreign country.\" If this Court thinks that it would be different if there were no system of fairness or process, then it could reserve that question for another case.",
  "No. And here, Justice Kennedy, the Iraqi courts are functioning under principles that require fundamental standards and - -",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Habeas, as this Court has made clear, is concerned with the fact or duration of custody. I think if we're talking about things that could happen to people that would be a different type of action. American courts might be open in that extreme situation. I don't think that would be an exercise that's ever been available in habeas. I think that the closest analog of this Court's cases to this situation is perhaps Wilson versus Girard, where you had an American serviceman stationed in Japan who committed alleged offenses in Japan, and the Japanese authorities made a request that they take jurisdiction of that person to prosecute him for offenses in Japan, and this Court considered the question. There was an injunction against the transfer of that individual to Japanese authorities. This Court set the injunction aside because it found no affirmative bar on the exercise of that discretion, recognizing the sovereign right and jurisdiction of the Government of Japan to prosecute individuals, including American - -",
  "Let me make a practical and a legal point on that, Justice Ginsburg. First, as a practical matter, it is important to keep in mind that reports of torture and abuses in the Iraqi system all deal with the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defense. We point that out - -",
  "And I don't believe he was pointing to any reports of systematic abuses within the department, the Ministry of Justice. And that's what our -- our own State Department concluded in its most recent reports on this. And if you look at all the reports, including the most recent report that came out a couple weeks ago from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, they point to alleged abuses within the Ministry of Interior and Defense. These individuals would be going to the justice system. We don't have reports of systematic - -",
  "No, and that was the legal point that I was going to make. Even in the extradition context, where everyone agrees that there would be habeas jurisdiction to review a transfer for some reason, the courts have not entertained allegations of torture, recognizing that those considerations are uniquely for the executive, except when - -",
  "I think because for centuries, Justice Souter, the courts have recognized that these are matters for the executive to assess, because - -",
  "Well, I think there we weren't talking about habeas. I think if -- and my answer was if the Court is concerned about that situation, this isn't it. It can reserve it for a different case.",
  "Well, that's true, Justice Scalia.",
  "That's - -",
  "That's what the district court, the court of appeals, and maybe this Court would have to do if it were going to entertain allegations of - -",
  "That's right, and General Garner explained that on page 48 of the appendix. The other thing I want to make on torture - -",
  "There would be none, Justice Alito. And these individuals are represented by Iraqi counsel, by American counsel. They have access to Iraqi ombudsmen. They can make reports. They can make reports, as some detainees have, to the Iraqi investigative judges of alleged mistreatment; not torture, but Iraqi investigative judges have directed that mistreatment not occur.",
  "It's not the situation that the NGO brief described, because all of those reports are focused on Ministry of Interior and Defense, where these individuals are not going to -- U.S. court, even in the extradition context, don't review these allegations - -",
  "I don't think so. Respect for the prerogative of the executive in making its determinations, respect for the sovereignty of the Iraqi courts. You have a habeas court having discovery and who knows what types of proceedings as to what is going on in Iraqi's criminal justice system. I think this Court would give respect to the justice systems of other sovereign nations. This is a system which, as we say in our brief, is founded on principles of fairness. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "No. No, emphatically not, Your Honor.",
  "I think this court confronted a similar situation in the Padilla case a couple of years ago. And what it -- it -- there was a habeas petition filed in New York, and it -- the court held that that habeas petition was improperly filed and a different petition should be filed in South Carolina. And it didn't get into the question of the transfer. And we certainly -- we don't think that transfer - -",
  "Whether the habeas court could direct that he be brought back to Portland?",
  "I think the habeas court would - -",
  "I would say probably not, Justice Souter. I mean there are transfers all the time where habeas petitions are filed, and people are going from State authority to Federal authority. And the rule is that those transfers, of course, can take place. The habeas proceedings can continue. The habeas has traditionally been used to block transfers. Here -- and I think it is important to focus on the injunction that the court of appeals sustained. It is an injunction against allowing the Iraqi prosecutions to proceed because the court enjoined American officials from presenting Mr. Omar to the Iraqi courts. Now, Mr. Margulies said that they didn't enjoin --",
  "What the injunction says -- and it is on page 59a -- is that it bars -- of the petition appendix in the Omar petition, the gray petition, and I am quoting now: \"Shall not remove the Petitioner from the United States or MNF-I custody, or take any other action inconsistent with this court's memorandum opinion.\" \"Any other action inconsistent with this court's memorandum opinion\" is allowing the prosecution to proceed, and the Court of Appeals makes this express on page 25a of the petition appendix where the Court of Appeals majority says, quote, \"we agree with the dissent that the injunction prohibits the military from presenting Omar to the CCCI for trial.\" Now, Mr. Margulies said that the proceedings can go forward just without his client's presence, but that - -",
  "That would be a vast improvement over the injunction that was held by the court of appeals.",
  "And then you are dealt -- you are left with the transfer, the injunction on the transfer to the Iraqi authorities in the event that Mr. Omar is convicted. And on that, I confess to being not -- not being entirely clear as to what my friend's position is. He says that we can release him because, of course, that is the office of the Writ of Habeas Corpus. But then he goes on to say: But we can't release him in a way that would affect a transfer. I'm not sure what that means because I thought he also said that we - -",
  "Just to underscore the affront to the Iraqi sovereignty on this, his clients acknowledge that they can be arrested by Iraqi officials for crimes they allegedly committed in Iraq if they were released. But the injunction that they're asking this Court to sustain is an injunction that prevents the Multi-National Force in Iraq from telling Iraqi authorities: We are going to release these Petitioners at 12:00 o'clock tomorrow. In effect, they're asking for an eight-hour head start so that these individuals whom the Multi-National Force has determined pose threats to the security of Iraq, who Iraq has determined pose threats to the security of Iraq, that an American court is enjoining the Multi-National Force from conveying that information to the Iraqi authorities so that these individuals who went to Iraq voluntarily can be held to account in he Iraqi system for crimes that they committed.",
  "Well, I - -",
  "Yes.",
  "That's true. But we think that it is quite clear from this Court's decisions that if they don't have the authority to enter the preliminary injunctive relief that they did at the end of the day they have no authority to enter it as a preliminary matter. I think on the jurisdictional point, the one point I wanted to stress is that if this Court does find jurisdiction we think it has to be because of a reading of the habeas statute informed by the Constitution that's limited to citizens. Extending jurisdiction to everyone in Iraq would be an extraordinary expansion of this Court's decision in Rasul. Just to be clear, Camp Cropper in Iraq bears none of the characteristics of the Guantanamo Bay that this Court discussed in its opinion in Rasul and that Justice Kennedy emphasized in his concurrence. So any jurisdictional ruling by this Court, we would urge it to rule only to the circumstances here of the fact of citizenship.",
  "I think there are both. This have been 2,000 transfers of individuals from Multinational Force to Iraqi custody, most in connection with criminal proceedings. The other individuals are held because they're a security threat. A lot of individuals come in and out of detention. Obviously the Multinational Force tries to limit the detentions as much as possible. Here the reason why these people have been subsidy contained so long is because the American courts have stood in the way of the Iraqi criminal proceedings where the Iraqi courts have sought to bring justice to these people under Iraqi law.",
  "It's -- we don't take the position this is like a battlefield situation. The occupation - -",
  "Certainly there are active hostilities in parts of Iraq.",
  "Well, the occupation has ended. I think there are active hostilities in part of it. We have not argued that there is no habeas jurisdiction because of the hostilities there. We've argued that there is no habeas jurisdiction because they're being held under - -",
  "Well, if the Court believes that that's our strongest argument, certainly we don't have any objection to having you address it.",
  "That's jurisdictional.",
  "That's correct, Justice Breyer.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The ability to locate and track an enemy submarine through the use of mid-frequency active sonar is vitally important to the survival of our naval strike groups deployed around the world and therefore critical to the nation's own security. In this case the Ninth Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction that places serious restrictions on the Navy's use of MFA sonar in training exercises that in the judgment of the President and his top naval officers are in the paramount interests of the United States. That injunction is fundamentally flawed for three principal reasons. First, it is based on an erroneous assessment of the likelihood of success on Respondent's NEPA claim. Second it is based on an erroneous conception of the showing of irreparable injury necessary to secure what this Court has aptly called \"the extraordinary and dramatic remedy\" of a preliminary injunction. And finally, it fails to take account the vital public interests in conducting the training exercises at issue unencumbered by the injunction's restrictions.",
  "Certainly we would, Justice Ginsburg. Obviously our position on the NEPA claim is the same with respect to any aspect of the injunction. So too with the risk of irreparable harm which we think Respondents haven't shown. The Ninth Circuit did modify the injunction by issuing a partial stay. It's important to keep in mind that its modifications were tied only to a stay. It didn't actually modify the injunction. So even if this Court thought those modifications were appropriate, it would have to vacate the Ninth Circuit decision.",
  "The Ninth Circuit framed its modifications in terms of a partial stay of its decision affirming the district court's preliminary injunction. That stay and therefore those modifications remained in effect only until this Court issued its decision in this case.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, yes, we are here complaining about the restriction on the 2200-yard shutdown requirement, where if a marine mammal comes within 2200 yards of a naval vessel part of one of these strike groups it has to shut down sonar operations, as well as the 75 percent powerdown requirement when significant surface ducting conditions are present regardless of the presence of marine mammals.",
  "The record -- and here I'm referring to the environmental assessment and the opinion of the National Marine Fisheries Services in the petition appendix and the joint appendix -- indicates that no marine mammal will be killed as a result of these exercises. The environmental assessment predicted there would be eight instances of injurious harm. These eight instances would take place only with respect to a common species of dolphins of which there are hundreds of thousands in the Southern California Operating Area. Now, the environmental assessment also predicted that there would be a much greater number, 170,000 over the course of two years, of so-called Level B takes. These are temporary and by definition non-injurious disturbances and that's made clear at pages 258a of the petition appendix and page 175 of the JA, which make clear that these Level B disturbances, the vast majority of the disturbances predicted by the environmental assessment, are temporary and non-injurious.",
  "The vast majority of those disturbances, some almost 90 percent, pertain only to dolphins.",
  "Well, I think that the statistics I have indicate that there are more than I think 500,000 dolphins on the western coast there. As to -- the number may be actually a little bit lower in the Southern California Operating Area. But this is - - no one suggests that is in any way a threatened species. With respect to the species that are endangered, threatened, or even strategic under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the National Marine Fisheries Services concluded there would be no adverse harm on the population level or with respect to annual recruitment rates with respect to those endangered or threatened species in the biological opinion that the district court sustained and that Respondents are not challenging on appeal. The focus of their claim of irreparable injury -- and keep in mind that that environmental assessment comes against the backdrop of a 40-year history of the Navy's use of MFA sonar in the Southern California Operating Area at the same frequency and, if anything, during more frequent training exercises than have been conducted in recent years.",
  "With respect to beaked whales, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. Those disturbances are temporary, non-injurious disturbances. That's important. Let me give you the page cites to the record on that because it's an important point. JA 178 to 180, JA 185 to 188, and JA 198 to 200 discuss each species of the beaked whales and explain that the harms that are predicted in the environmental assessment are non-injurious, temporary harms. Now as a policy matter - -",
  "In most cases it means that there's an alerting response, they hear the sound and they go in the opposite direction, as one who hears a noise that disturbs them would ordinarily do. It can also mean that they could have some temporary effect on their feeding or breeding patterns, but it's a temporary effect.",
  "No.",
  "That's right. By definition only a Level A take involves an injurious harm, that is a physical harm which results in permanent damage to tissue.",
  "It is confusing, Justice Ginsburg. The Navy as a policy matter described for purposes of the environmental assessment the Level B takes with respect to beaked whales as Level A takes because the Navy acknowledged that there is uncertainty about the effects of sonar on beaked whales. But when you look at what the environmental assessment says as to the actual injuries that the National Marine Fish and Wildlife Service and the Navy predicted based on the best science available to them and to us today, they are non-injurious, temporary exposures, and that is made clear at the portions of the JA that I mentioned. Now, the Navy -- there is nothing that prevents an agency from characterizing the particular harm one way or the other as a policy matter for purposes of an environmental assessment.",
  "Yes, there is, because we're not here arguing that, at this point, that we had no duty to prepare an environmental impact statement because of the intervening event of the Council for Environmental Quality's emergency circumstances alternative arrangements determination. That's the pertinent administrative event for purposes of Respondent's claim.",
  "Yes, it's one of the alternative arrangements that the Navy agreed to, is that the environmental impact statement which has been under way will be completed by January 2009 with respect to all activities in the Southern California Operating Area. Now, that's not to say that we concede that an environmental impact statement was not required -- was required at the outset. The Navy doesn't concede that. It litigated this case up to the point of the Council for Environmental Quality's determination.",
  "Because the Navy devoted its best resources to this and in good faith, as is indicate bide the 293-page environmental assessment, concluded that there would not be a finding of significant environmental impact, and at that point everyone agrees an environmental impact statement is not required.",
  "It's going to be completed by January 2009, Justice Breyer, under the alternative arrangements that have been approved - -",
  "Well, at this point we are. The point that the Navy faced in January of 2008, where it had an injunction against its use of sonar in these training exercises and only an environmental impact statement, it faced, as the Council of Environmental Quality found, emergency circumstances in terms of the need to conduct these training exercises.",
  "Because of its impact on national security, Justice Kennedy.",
  "I think there are three fundamental flaws, as I indicated. One, we think the Ninth Circuit just got the NEPA claim wrong. The Navy is complying with NEPA through the alternative arrangements and the regulations, but the CEQ found - -",
  "I think we would point to a couple of things. First, in terms of the statute, NEPA says that the obligations of the statute should be complied with to the fullest extent. And it doesn't specifically say what happens if they are not followed. These are procedural requirements. Secondly - -",
  "Well - -",
  "The statutory authority that we find in NEPA for the CEQ's regulation providing for alternative arrangements is -- first, it's acknowledged by this Court that CEQ has rulemaking authority. The Court acknowledged that in Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen. So we take that as a given.",
  "Well, let me -- I'll answer the question, but let me be clear: The government's position is that we are complying with NEPA by -- by complying with the alternative arrangements provided by the Council on Environmental Quality.",
  "And I would point, Your Honor, to the language in NEPA that says it should be complied with to the fullest extent possible - -",
  "-- and I would - -",
  "Well, that language, coupled with -- which seems to us to suggest that compliance to the fullest extent possible would depend on the circumstances, coupled with the fact that NEPA doesn't impose, doesn't say what the consequences of noncompliance would be - -",
  "-- but other - -",
  "Well, this Court has acknowledged in numerous cases, Methow Valley and in the Public Citizen case a few years ago, that NEPA gives CEQ rulemaking authority, and that this Court gives substantial deference to the CEQ's rules.",
  "To implement the statute, that's right. And there are a number of important procedural requirements that go far beyond what the statute requires that the CEQ has laid out in its regulations. One of the regulations -- and this has been on the books since 1979 and has been implemented some 40 times. So this isn't something that was made up in this case. It's an established regulatory practice under NEPA that where there are emergency circumstances an agency can come up with alternative arrangements to comply with its NEPA obligations. And here those alternative arrangements were: One, to complete an EIS that is under way for all sonar activities and all other activities by the Navy in the Southern California operating area by January 2009. The Navy is going to meet that goal. Two, to adopt the mitigation measures spelled out in the alternative arrangements. Three, to provide for public participation so that there could be comment on any concerns to marine mammals in the area. And four, to provide for research into harms to marine mammals. These were significant arrangements that the Navy agreed to.",
  "Well, it has -- it's important because the environmental impact statement that's going to be completed pertains not only to COMPTUEX and JTF exercises that will be completed in the Southern California Operating Area in the future, but all activities. So that environmental impact statement is going to be very meaningful.",
  "I think - -",
  "For several reasons, Justice Souter. First, there was a gap between when the Navy issued its environmental assessment and when the first training exercises began.",
  "I believe -- I believe that's right, but there was a gap and there's no -- I don't think there can be any - -",
  "Well, I - -",
  "Sure. Absolutely.",
  "But I don't think - -",
  "It did, and it also knew that it was in the process of finalizing an environmental impact statement that it prepared in good faith, a 293-page statement, which concluded that there would be - -",
  "An environmental assessment, that's right, with the finding of no significant environmental impact. This Court presumes the regularity of administrative actions. There's no reason for the Navy, particularly on this record, to have assumed that that EA would not have been sustained. The emergency circumstances arose in January 2008, when the district court enjoined the use of MFA sonar in these exercises when the Navy had several exercises.",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, with respect, I don't think that a 293-page environmental assessment with the kind of detail and support that this assessment has - -",
  "Well, that's right. And as I indicated earlier -- I want to be clear -- the Navy believes that its environmental assessment was not only prepared in good faith, but was appropriate and reached the right conclusions.",
  "The other two are: One, the injunction. Even if you agree with Respondents on the likelihood of success of the NEPA claim, it's based on a showing of irreparable injury that is fundamentally flawed. The Ninth Circuit and the district court looked to whether there was irreparable injury under a possibility standard.",
  "They did, Justice Souter, and we think - -",
  "Well, I don't think that a court could say that, Justice Souter, for a couple of reasons. First, when a lower court applies a fundamentally wrong standard to assess -- to make a determination, this Court usually corrects that legal standard and gives the -- the lower court an opportunity to do it again.",
  "And, two, the finding, which is a sentence in the district court decision repeated by the court of appeals, of \"near certainty of harm to marine mammals\" is utterly belied by the environmental assessment in this case as well as the fact that -- and the Ninth Circuit acknowledged this -- the Navy has been using MFA sonar in the Southern California Operating Area for more than 40 years and no one can point to any harm to marine mammals.",
  "Yes.",
  "I don't think it is, Justice Stevens. I think it is -- the normal practice is to require someone who seeks the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction to show irreparable injury, a likelihood of irreparable injury.",
  "You do.",
  "Well, I don't have authority for that precise proposition because I don't - -",
  "Well - -",
  "I -- I think that that's right, Judge Scalia.",
  "Clearly, the purpose of the requirements under NEPA are to ensure that the agency has -- is making an informed decision, and here I don't think there is any question that the Navy was after its 293-page assessment. I am not aware of any - -",
  "No, I'm not, Justice Souter. I am saying - -",
  "That's right, but then - -",
  "I -- the EIS - -",
  "But it is not a likely - - they have not shown a likelihood of irreparable injury.",
  "Well, we agree with that. We think it's important, though, to separate out the likelihood of success on the NEPA claim with the distinct question of whether there is irreparable injury and look to the record of whether there is irreparable injury. And we think they have not come close to establishing that. The one final - -",
  "Justice Kennedy, I haven't completed that -- that research with respect to all of the circuits, but I am confident in saying I am not aware of a decision in which a court has said that the irreparable injury requirement does not have to be met or is automatically met.",
  "And it may be easier in some cases than others, Justice Stevens. But I think in this case where you have the record that has been compiled, they cannot -- they cannot - -",
  "We're not taking that position, Justice Stevens. We're taking the position that the record in this case does not show a likelihood of irreparable injury.",
  "I think that's right. I think that fundamentally - -",
  "We -- we are contesting that. And if I could reserve the remainder of my time. And one must -- I can explain, if you would like, Justice.",
  "If I misspoke, I apologize. My point was that the administrative determination that is at issue now in evaluating the NEPA claim is the finding of alternative arrangements. The Navy has never conceded that it was required to do an EIS at the outset. It simply has agreed to live with the alternative arrangements approved by the Council on Environmental Quality.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First, the Court of Appeals did not adequately consider the balance of equities. It completely disregarded the President's determination of the paramount interests in these exercises. It disregarded the Chief Naval Officer's evidence on the harm of the 2200-yard shutdown, at Pet. App. 344-345A. It disregard the harm as to surface ducting, Pet. App. 33 A. Justice Alito, there is -- the EA says, quote, on page 200 of the JA, \"No serious injury or mortality of any marine mammal species is reasonably foreseeable because of these exercises.\" Page 170 makes clear that that applies to beaked whales as well. And finally I think I heard my colleague, my friend, concede that you have to show Article III injury in order to show irreparable injury. They not only have to show irreparable injury to marine mammals, which they haven't; they have to show irreparable injury to themselves, and particularly as to beaked whales, which none of the declarants and none of their members have ever asserted they have seen. They can't possibly establish any irreparable injury from any conceivable harm to beaked whales, even though the record in this case makes clear that all harms to the marine mammals that we have been discussing today are temporary non-injurious harms. We would ask this Court to set aside the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which seriously interferes with critical training exercises that the President, his chief Naval officers have determined to be in the paramount interests of the United States.",
  "It pertains to beaked whales as well. Page 256 of the petition appendix is the National Marine Fisheries Service's determination that the conditions which led to strandings with respect to beaked whales in other parts of the world are not likely to lead to strandings in the Southern California Operating Area. Those conditions are taken into account in the national defense exemption mitigation measures at page 258 of the petition appendix. There have been beachings of beaked whales in Southern California. None have been tied to sonar operations, and that further underscores the absence any injury to any marine mammal in Southern California despite 40 years of the Navy's use of sonar operations in that area.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a challenge to the efforts of the Federal Communications Commission to carry out its statutory mandate under 18 U.S.C. 1464, and more even-handedly address indecent material that is broadcast directly into the home during the time of day when children are likely to be in the viewing audience. After reconsidering its policy in this area, the Commission determined that an enforcement action may be appropriate in the case of indecent language that is isolated as well as repeated. Because the Commission provided a reasoned explanation for that change in course, the court of appeals erred in invalidating its action under the Administrative Procedures Act.",
  "They did change the policy, Justice Scalia, and the Commission directly acknowledged that in paragraph 12 of the Golden Globe Awards order, which is not reprinted in the petition appendix. In that paragraph, the Commission said, \"We now depart from cases holding that isolated or fleeting use of the F-Word was not indecent.\"",
  "Well, the court of appeals recognized, and we think correctly so, that the Commission did change its position on that. The Commission had never brought an enforcement action against a broadcaster for the isolated use of an expletive, and the Commission made clear in the orders it issued in this case, beginning with the Golden Globe Awards order and the particular omnibus and remand orders before this Court, that it was taking a change in regulatory course in determining that it was appropriate to bring an enforcement action where there was an isolated incident of an expletive if the context suggested that it would be indecent in that situation.",
  "That it has changed, Justice Kennedy, and the court of appeals recognized that at pages 20a to 21a of the decision. And we think this Court has recognized - -",
  "Well, I think there were some statements, we would acknowledge that, in different places. But if you go to the heart of where the FCC grappled with this, paragraph -- paragraph 12 of the Golden Globe Awards order, it specifically disavowed its prior decisions in which it had said that isolated expletives would not warrant an enforcement action under 1464, and it specifically said, \"we are departing from our policy.\" We -- after all, it didn't impose - -",
  "I think if you look at maybe pages 82 to 83 of the petition appendix here, where we discuss that as well, I think it made clear with respect to the indecency finding involving the 2003 Billboard Music Awards and the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, that in applying its contextual analysis in the past it focused on whether or not expletives were repeated or dwelled upon. In this case, the Commission determined that it was not going to be guided exclusively by that consideration and that it was going to take into account all contextual factors, including the explicit and graphic nature of the language used.",
  "Certainly, I would be defending it if the Court thought that it wasn't a change, and it would have been inappropriate for the Second Circuit to invalidate that as arbitrary and capricious. We have -- we think it was a change. The language that the Commission used indicated that it was departing from its prior understanding, and we are here defending -- either way, we are here defending - -",
  "Well, this Court has said that it's desirable for agencies to reconsider and to change its policy from time to time, but when - -",
  "It is, and it did in the remand order reprinted in the petition appendix. Mr. Chief Justice, I think either way the ultimate standard is arbitrary and capriciousness. Now, the Respondents have focused on whether or not we have complied with the criteria that the Court has looked to in determining whether or not a change in agency position is arbitrary and capricious. And we think that there are three factors here that must lead to the conclusion that it was not arbitrary and capricious. One, we think that the Commission did directly acknowledge its change in position. Two, the Commission provided a concrete explanation for that change. And, three, that explanation is at a minimum plausible and consistent with the Commission's statutory mandate. This Court has never invalidated a change in agency position where those three factors have been present. And if you look at the three principal justifications that the agency used in explaining its change in position, I think it's absolutely clear that this was at a minimum a rational policy choice that the agency was committed -- was permitted to take under the Administrative Procedures Act.",
  "Well, we do think, of course, that there is rhyme or reason to its determination. First, let me say that much of the vagueness type of arguments that the Respondents are making similar to your question could be made equally with respect to the Commission's policy with respect to repeated utterances as well as isolated utterances. If you take the \"Saving Private Ryan\" and the blues documentary example, those were repeated - utterances cases. We are here because they challenged the Commission's change in policy to go from repeated utterances to consider enforcement actions in the case of isolated expletives where they met its contextual analysis and where it was explicit, graphic, shocking or pandering in the context. Now, I think certainly there are going to be situations and this Court has indicated that the vagueness inquiry doesn't turn about coming up with hypotheticals at -- at the outer margins of the standard. I think in the Pacifica case our reading of the Court's decision is similar to the D.C. Circuit's reading of that decision in the Action for Children's Television case, that implicit in the Court's decision in Pacifica was that it rejected a vagueness challenge to the Commission's definition of \"indecency,\" which is the same definition that the Commission is applying today.",
  "The Commission has determined that news programming would be treated differently, with greater restraint, because of the different values present in that situation.",
  "Yes. And, similarly, if there were a news report about the argument today in this Court and there were reports about the actual language used, that's right. The Commission has exercised restraint in that area, recognizing that there are different values at stake than in the -- in the utterance of indecent language during a prime-time broadcast where are a substantial number of children in the viewing audience. For the broadcast in this case, up to 24 to 28 percent of the viewing audience comprised children under the age of 18. This language was concededly gratuitous in the context it was used. In the Nicole Richey example in 2003, there was an element of pandering as part of the dialogue consisted of Paris Hilton saying, \"Watch your language,\" before Nicole Richey launched into dropping the S-Word and the F-Word in -- in a context that was, the FCC reasonably determined, was shocking and gratuitous and explicit and graphic; and, therefore, in the context in which it was presented, indecent under the agency's longstanding definition of \"indecency.\"",
  "Well, certainly, the FCC's action in this case focuses on the use of the F-Word and the S-Word, and I think everyone acknowledges that a word like the F-Word is one of the most graphic, explicit, and vulgar words in the English language for sexual activity. And I think even the networks here concede that it was -- its use was gratuitous and inappropriate here. And that would control - -",
  "It can be -- it certainly can be used in a non-literal way. It can be used in a metaphorical way, as Cher used it here, to say \"F them\" to her critics. But the -- the non-literal/literal distinction is not unique to the isolated expletives versus the repeated effort -- expletives.",
  "I wouldn't say equally, Justice Stevens, but what we would say is that it can qualify as indecent under the -- under the Commission's definition, because even the non-literal use of a word like the F-Word, because of the core meaning of that word as one of the most vulgar, graphic, and explicit words for sexual activity in the English language, it inevitably conjures up a core sexual image.",
  "Which is, indeed, why it's used as an intensifier or as an insult, and it's why the networks themselves -- and this is reprinted, I believe, at 86 of the petition appendix -- have a 24-hour rule that the F-Word generally should not be use on TV.",
  "Outside of the safe harbor under this Court's decision, the -- the Commission recognizes that networks can use indecent language.",
  "Although they don't. Their policies are not to use indecent language.",
  "Because I think they recognize that it contravenes community standards for appropriateness in the broadcast medium, and that - - those policies are reprinted at pages 86a to 88a of - -",
  "Well, first of all, the community standards are community standards for the broadcast medium. This is set out a little bit at page 33 of the joint appendix at footnote 13. Second of all, they look to community standards for the average listener. And, third of all, the -- the Commission applies its expressly -- collective experience here, looking to statements from lawmakers, from courts, from broadcasters, from public interest groups, and from citizens to determine what is consistent with community standards. And certainly the - -",
  "Absolutely. I think it is an irrefutable reflection of what they think the appropriate community standards are.",
  "Community standards for broadcasting, that's right. And, in that respect, this case is much different than the Reno case, for example, where one of the criticisms this Court had was uncertainty about what community standards would apply. Another difference is -- is that here you have the Commission, an expert agency, making these determining -- making these determinations, drawing in part on the policies and practices of the regulated industry itself; for example, the self-imposed rule not to use the F-Word at particular times of day. And, of course, you have the fact that broadcast television has always been subject to a lesser standard of First Amendment scrutiny. Now - -",
  "We think it is, and we think it is reflected in the Court's cases. Let me -- and let me explain why. But let me first say that obviously we think that this Court does not need to, and should not, delve into the constitutional issues in resolving the case before it today. The only issue that we have presented and the only issue decided below is whether or not the Commission has provided a reasoned explanation of the Administrative Procedures Act.",
  "Well, if -- if I can answer the question as to the force of the Court's precedents, this Court has repeatedly affirmed in cases like Sable, in cases like Reno, in cases like Turner and Denver Area, that broadcasting is subject to a different and lesser First Amendment standard. The Commission in this case looked to the considerations that underlie that jurisprudential doctrine and concluded that they were still apposite, and that is at pages 108 to 110 of the petition appendix. Most Americans still get their information and entertainment from broadcast TV. Most children - - broadcast TV is extremely accessible to children because all they have to do is turn it on, and then they have network shows that they can have access to. And broadcast television is still broadcast in a way that invades the home, the place -- the one place where people typically don't expect to have uninvited, offensive - -",
  "I think that was the rationale in Red -- Red Lion. This is Court in Pacifica didn't rely on that rationale.",
  "Yes. I -- as we read the decision, Justice Stevens -- and I understand that you wrote the plurality decision there. But, as we read the decision, the Court did not rest so much on the scarcity rationale, but, yet, on the unique pervasiveness of broadcasting, the unique accessibility to children, and the fact that broadcasting invades the home in a way that other technologies do not.",
  "It was, Your Honor. Now, in the Turner case this Court said at page 190 that broadcast medium is still the principal source of information in entertainment in affirming the lesser standard that this Court applies. We actually think that the fact that there are now additional mediums like the internet and cable TV, if anything, underscores the appropriateness of a lower First Amendment standard or safety zone for broadcast TV, because Americans who want to get indecent programming can go to cable TV, they can go to the Internet. But broadcast TV is, as Congress designed that to be, the one place where Americans can turn on the TV at 8:00 o'clock and watch their dinner and not be expected to be bombarded with indecent language, either in an isolated basis or repeated basis. That's a societal expectation that has grown up over the last 30 years since Pacifica. And it would be a remarkable thing to adopt the world that the networks are asking you to adopt here today, where the networks are free to use expletives, whether in an isolated or repeated basis, 24 hours a day, going from the extreme example of Big Bird dropping the F-bomb on Sesame Street, to the example of using that word during Jeopardy or opening the episode of American Idol - -",
  "With respect to live entertainment programming, Justice Breyer, you can do what the networks now do, which is to have a tape delay which permits you to bleep out isolated or offensive - -",
  "No. It varies based on the type of programming. For example, the Commission has acknowledged -- and this is at pages 94 to 95a of the petition appendix -- that their -- that breaking news coverage is different and that it will not approach it --",
  "Well, I don't think - - that's not - -",
  "In a show like the Billboard Music Awards, they will use a delay. And since the incidents in this case, the 2003 and 2002 instances, the networks have gotten more people who are on hand to bleep isolated expletives.",
  "They did, and I think - -",
  "Well, if you look at the Nicole Richie example, they actually bleeped one word that was used, I believe - -",
  "-- before she got to the other two words. But at that time they only had one person working the bleeping machine or whatever it is they call it.",
  "I think that's right. But certainly there is an understanding that this is -- that these isolated - -",
  "It explained that - -",
  "-- in its decision in the petition appendix here as to the basis why enforcement action would be appropriate. Because here you are dealing with individuals who have used inappropriate in the past -- Nicole Richie had used inappropriate language in the past. You had an inappropriate tape delay, you had inappropriate measures in place to ensure that expletives were not used, which in the Commission's judgment meant that this would be an appropriate situation. If you had a different context, say a sporting event where there is an isolated expletive as part of a post-game news interview, the Commission as it would under its context-based approach, would look to all the contextual factors and determine whether or not it was indecent in that situation.",
  "Certainly our view is that it was pandering and invited. It could have been expected.",
  "The euphemism in the script I think was \"freaking\", and another euphemism for the S-Word, but they obviously departed from that. And I think the Commission - -",
  "That's what Paris Hilton said. I mean, I think the whole thing was set up to be pandering - -",
  "-- to invite this kind of abuse, which is one of the contextual factors that the Commission looked at, along with the extremely shocking and graphic nature of using this language at 9:00 p.m. on an eastern night.",
  "We did not fine them because we exercised restraint in making -- in attempting to make clear that the FCC going forward was going to consider isolated - -",
  "We had gone from Pacifica until 1987, approximately, in the Action for Children's Television case, where the Commission determined that that approach limited only to the seven dirty words in Pacifica was unduly narrow and inconsistent with its enforcement responsibilities.",
  "But I don't -- my understanding was that was not pertaining to use of the F-Word. The networks' policies are at 86 to 88a, the petition appendix, and described there. The D.C. Circuit found with respect to that change in position that the Commission had supplied an adequate explanation under the APA simply by saying that its prior practice, enforcement practice, was unduly narrow and not consistent with its enforcement responsibility. We think that the even more detailed explanation here clearly satisfies the APA standard that applied to the Commission's change in position.",
  "Yes, insofar as the Commission takes into account whether it's shocking, titillating, pandering - -",
  "Well, my point is that we will take it into account, but I think you can recognize the potentially greater harmful impact on children where you have celebrities using particularly graphic, vulgar, explicit, indecent language as part of the comedic routine during a show that children are comprising a substantial part of the viewing audience. And that is one of the factors that is appropriate under this Court's decision in Pacifica and the Commission's policy to take into account the time of day and the viewing audience.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, prong 1 hasn't changed, Justice Breyer, since the time - -",
  "-- of Pacifica. It has not. It's the same explanation, whether descriptions or depictions of sexual or excretorial organs or activities, the same definition before the Court in Pacifica. And as the Pacifica monologue makes clear, there were many both literal and non-literal uses of the F-Word and S-Word and other words in that monologue. So, I think the Commission's position is this kind of language has always been indecent, which is -- what has changed is it's now going to consider enforcement action when is it's used in an isolated basis on a context - based approach. If I can reserve - -",
  "Well, that approach would be consistent with this Court not deciding issues that haven't been decided below and the general practice of constitutional avoidance. Now, the Second Circuit at three different places in its decision, on page 2a and page 35a, and at the end of its decision, made clear that it was not deciding the constitutional issues. Judge Laval who dissented didn't say anything about the constitutional issues. So we certainly want another crack at those issues before the Second Circuit, and Respondents after all are not simply asking this Court to hold the regulation of isolated expletives is unconstitutional, but that any broadcast indecency regulation is unconstitutional; and at a minimum before this Court entertains that kind of radical constitutional shift, it ought to have the benefit of a court of appeals decision which actually decides those issues.",
  "Well, we think the Court is forced to decide that because that's the basis that the court of appeals has invalidated the Commission's action. The Court should reject that decision which is incorrect under the APA and send it back for consideration of the networks' other arguments.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First, Justice Scalia, it's on page 82-A of the petition appendix where the Commission acknowledges the change in the order at issue in this case. Justice Breyer, going back to your question about whether the Commission's definition of indecency has changed, it is not and that is made clear at page 73-A of the petition appendix where the Commission says, quote, a long line of precedence indicates that the use of the F-Word for emphasis or as an intensifier comes within the subject matter scope of our indecency definition.",
  "It explains on page 74 why the Commission has determined that these words are indecent. The Commission has only treated those literal uses of these words as potentially indecent under its contextual analysis. We think that Justice Ginsburg's decision for the D.C. Circuit in the Action for Children's Television case provides a road map for resolving this case, where the Court separately addressed the APA question of whether the agency had provided a reasonable explanation and then separated out the constitutional issues, which this Court need not address.",
  "I think it would probably qualify under the subject matter definition, but it probably wouldn't be patently offensive under community standards for broadcasting. The one thing that can't be disputed -- in this case is that the F-Word is patently offensive under community standards for the broadcast medium. This Court has reversed the decision below on the APA question presented and remand the case for consideration under - -",
  "Well, we certainly think that under community standards that that word is patently offensive as well. And certainly, but we think that the F-Word itself is clearly patently offensive. We think that the S-Word is patently offensive. This Court did so -- we think had that view in the Pacifica case as well, because that, of course, is one of the seven dirty words at issue in that case. If there are no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns the qualified immunity of high-ranking government officials, like the Attorney General of the United States and Director of the FBI, and supervisory liability claims under Bivens based on the alleged wrongdoing of much lower level officials. In concluding that the complaint in this case was sufficient to subject the high-ranking officials, like the Attorney General, to the demands of civil discovery, the court of appeals erred in two fundamental and interrelated respects. First, the court erred in concluding that the complaint stated a violation of clearly established rights by the former Attorney General and Director of the FBI, because under this Court's precedents the complaint fails adequately to plead the personal involvement of those high-ranking officials for the alleged discriminatory acts of lower level officials. And, second --",
  "It is a 12(b)(6) motion.",
  "No, for two reasons, Justice Ginsburg. The first is that this Court has recognized that a defense can be a basis for a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6). It did so most recently in the Jones versus Bock case. And -- and it's established practice in the Federal courts, in part because of this decision, that appeals from the denial of a motion to dismiss on the ground of qualified immunity are appropriate. And, second, as the Second Circuit recognized -- and we think it got this right -- the question of whether a complaint adequately pleads the personal involvement of government officials goes directly to the question of qualified immunity -- and the court of appeals said that on page 14a of its decision -- because it goes to the question of whether these defendants have violated any clearly established rights. And so the question of supervisory liability in this case we think is essential to the question of whether or not the Attorney General and Director of the FBI are entitled to qualified immunity. And in denying the government's -- the Petitioner's motion to dismiss on the ground of qualified immunity, the district court erroneously deprived these Petitioners of the protections of that important defense.",
  "Well, I think that that's fair, Justice Souter. I mean, I think that there are two general types of allegations in this complaint. One set of allegations says that Petitioners came up with this policy, and if you look at those allegations -- and I think I would point you to paragraph 69 and paragraphs 10 and 11 -- those allegations we think describe a policy which is neutral on its face, a policy of holding persons determined by the FBI to be of interest in connection with a terribly important investigation until they have been cleared. And so we think that those allegations can't be enough to sustain these -- to subject these Petitioners to -- to civil discovery.",
  "I think if you look at the complaint, that -- that interpretation doesn't hold up. And in particular, I would point you to paragraph 48, which is on page 164a of the joint appendix -- I'm sorry, the petition appendix. And what that paragraph says is that these allegedly discriminatory determinations, classifications, were made by FBI officials in the field, not Petitioners here, the former Attorney General and director of the FBI. And importantly, these determinations were made, quote, and this comes from paragraph 48, \"without specific criteria or uniform classification system.\" And so that's what's going on here. You've got a complaint that alleges that specific lower level officials are making these determinations. That's in paragraphs 50 and 51. You've got a complaint alleging that these determinations are being made on the basis of ad hoc criteria. That's page 48. And then you have these overarching allegations that the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI knew about, approved, and condoned these discriminatory conduct of much lower level officials.",
  "We've accepted that at some level that this complaint maintains, and it's in paragraph 69, that there was a policy of holding suspects until they -- the suspects were determined to be of interest by the FBI, until they were cleared by the FBI in connection with this investigation. That policy we have not disputed, and that policy we think is a -- is a factually neutral, perfectly lawful law enforcement response to the 9/11 attacks, resulting in --",
  "Not with respect to the Petitioners here, the former Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, because -- and I think in evaluating --",
  "Well, the question is which policy, what policy? And if you look at the complaint, I think the only policy that the allegations bear out with respect to the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI is a policy described in paragraph 69 of holding suspects until cleared. The --",
  "No. I mean, certainly that is one option. I mean, the Court mentioned that in the Crawford-El case, and that's an option. But just as in the Bell Atlantic case, where that was an option, too, and where the defendants in that case did not avail themselves of their opportunity to file a motion for a more definite statement, the Petitioners here did not do so and they were not required to do so. They had a different option under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to move for dismissal under 12(b)(6). They exercised that option, and the complaint -- the complaint should be dismissed because it fails to state a claim against those individuals.",
  "That's one of the reasons why I think it's important to distinguish between the different sets of claims. I think the general claim of a policy of holding suspects until cleared is much more like the Bell Atlantic situation, where you have got factually neutral allegations, perfectly lawful law enforcement conduct to have a policy that says, FBI agents, if you determine these people are of interest, hold them until they are cleared so that we are not releasing people that are potentially suspects or wrongdoers in this investigation.",
  "And we're not asking for a heightened pleading standard, Justice Ginsburg. I think what's missing here fundamentally is a substantive requirement of the cause of action -- Bivens -- for supervisory liability which is an affirmative link. Subsidiary allegations suggesting a plausible affirmative link between the discriminatory actions allegedly taken by much lower level officials in the field and the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General of the United States.",
  "It -- it's not -- I mean, in -- in a similar way that this Court considered the scope of a Bivens cause of action in the Wilkie case recently and in the Hartman case recently. In both of those cases the Court recognized that the scope of the Bivens cause of action goes directly to the question of qualified immunity. And here, in order to evaluate whether the pleadings are adequate against the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, you have to know what the substantive standard under Bivens is for a supervisory liability type claim. You have to know -- just as you did in Bell Atlantic, you had to know the substantive standard of antitrust law in this kind of context. Here you have to know the substantive standard of what's required to subject the Attorney General of the United States or the Director of the FBI to potential liability, civil damages, burdens of civil discovery, for supervisory liability for the claims of much lower level officials.",
  "And I think it would be --",
  "It -- it says that, as this Court interpreted it, in Rule 8 of the rules, Justice Breyer.",
  "Yes, because in Rule 8 --",
  "No. Rule 8 is the -- is the plain statement showing entitlement to relief. It is the rule interpreted in Bell Atlantic, and there the Bell Atlantic Court said that the plaintiff had the obligation to show a plausible entitlement to relief. And --",
  "It's --",
  "Rule 8 does, as interpreted --",
  "-- in Bell Atlantic, because that is not a plausible entitlement of a claim to relief --",
  "I certainly agree with you. You don't have to show that it probably is, but you have to show facts suggesting -- above the speculative level. And just as in Bell Atlantic --",
  "Well, we certainly think -- I mean, in Bell Atlantic, the Court said common economic experience would -- would support its determination in that case. We think here, and I think the brief filed by former attorney generals from several different administrations makes this point as well, that common government experience would suggest that the Attorney General of the United States is not involved in the sort of microscopic decisions --",
  "The -- and I think that gets to one of the fundamental problems with the Second Circuit decision, is it held the extraordinary context of the 9/11 attacks and the aftermath of those attacks against the Petitioners in this case. And that's problematic, not only from the qualified-immunity perspective of what it's going to be like for officials next time they have to --",
  "-- deal with something like that.",
  "But it's problematic because you have to look at the reality of the job of the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of the FBI. In general, these are people who are responsible not only for the litigating divisions within the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency, enforcing countless laws. These are people who have extraordinarily busy schedules. And ordinary --",
  "Well, Rule 26 governs discovery, Justice Breyer.",
  "Well, the power to -- to govern discovery doesn't solve the problem for the same reason that it didn't in Bell Atlantic. The Court specifically said we are not going to rely on district courts to weed out potentially meritless claims because we recognize the burdens that discovery can impose in the civil and in trust contexts. And those burdens are multiplied many times here where you are talking about subjecting to -- subjecting high level government official to the burdens of civil discovery. I think fundamentally we think you don't get to the question of how do district judges control discovery, because they haven't gotten through the gateway of pleading an adequate claim. And if I can give you the substantive rule that we think is on point here -- this Court, in the Rizzo case, which is a section 1983 case, considered the question of claims against high-ranking officials, the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia, the Police Commissioner of the City of Philadelphia, for alleged wrongdoing by individual police officers there. And there -- in that case, the Court held that a plaintiff under section 1983 has to establish, as a matter of law, an affirmative link between the acts of the -- the subordinates and the higher-level officials. And we think that that substantive rule in section 1983 at a minimum carries over to the Bivens context.",
  "Sure. That's one protection, Justice Ginsburg. And --",
  "And this Court --",
  "We --",
  "It's certainly not adequate protection, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "I would have thought that this Court's decision in Bell Atlantic put an end to those sorts of claims where the court --",
  "Absolutely, Justice Stevens. And certainly that's our position. We think it's --",
  "No one did it in either case, but in both cases the defendants are entitled to dismissal. I think this case is even stronger, not only because we think that the factual allegations are less plausible, but because we have the substantive rule of law that comes from Bivens, that you have to establish the affirmative link of alleged wrongdoing between much lower level officials, the FBI agents in the field here. And the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of the FBI, common experience shows, simply aren't involved in those sorts of granular decisions.",
  "And --",
  "Well, let me answer both those questions: First, the second point I wanted to add is interrelated with the first, and that's that the court of appeals applied an overly expansive conception of the supervisory liabilities available under Bivens. And, I think, in order to evaluate the adequacy of the pleadings, this Court has to have in mind the standards of supervisory liability that Bivens applied. And we think the that court of appeals applied an overly expansive concept of that under Rizzo and other -- the other precedents we cite in our case. And second: No, our case would not go away if this Court got rid of Bell Atlantic or if this Court limited Bell Atlantic to the antitrust context. We don't think the Court should do that. When the Court dispensed -- disavowed the broad no-set-of-facts language from Conley v. Gibson, we took the Court to be saying: We are disavowing that for all cases under Rule 8; we are not limiting it to parallel conduct in the section 1 of the Sherman Act context. So I think that Bell Atlantic's explication of Rule 8 and the disavowal of the no-set-of-facts language, which, after all, is the test under which the district court had to resort to, to sustain the claims in this case --",
  "Well, we don't think you had to wait for Twombly to get rid of those claims. We think that many of those claims would dismiss. They certainly would have been dismissed in the section 1983 context under this Court's decision in Rizzo. And we could talk about what it would be like for claims against the president of Coca-Cola or Ford Motor Company, but really we're here talking about claims against the highest level officials of our government, who everyone agrees are entitled to the doctrine of qualified immunity, a doctrine that was designed, at the end of the day, to protect the effective functioning of our government. These officials are entitled at least to the protections that this Court found appropriate for civil antitrust defendants.",
  "We don't think so, Justice Ginsburg. I mean, most fundamentally, extra-record materials, extra-complaint materials can't make up for the deficiencies in the complaint itself. Plaintiffs had the benefit of that 200-page report when they brought their action in this case. They have amended their complaint twice already. And so, in that respect, they are in a much better position than the typical plaintiffs. And, secondly, if you look at that report, if you want to go outside the record and look at that report, I would urge you to look at page 70 of the report, which says that \"we found\" -- and I am quoting from the report -- \"we found that the information provided to high-level officials suggested this 'hold until cleared' policy was being applied to persons 'suspected of being involved in the'\" 9/11 attacks, a perfectly lawful law enforcement program. And it goes on to say that \"in practice the policy may have been applied differently in the field. \" And the other pages I would point you to are pages 18, 40, 47, and 158, which make clear that this -- the alleged discriminatory acts were -- were taken on an ad hoc basis. That's what the complaint in this case says on page 48, where it says that FBI officials, far removed from the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, were making these determinations without criteria, without a uniform classification system. And we think that to go back up the chain to suggest that the Attorney General of the United States and Director of the FBI may be potentially subject to civil liability, the burdens of civil litigation goes far beyond Rule 8 as it's described in Bell Atlantic, far beyond this Court's qualified immunity cases.",
  "They are being defended by the Department of Justice, the -- the Attorney General and Director of the FBI.",
  "Yes, and that's a discretionary determination that has been made in this case.",
  "Yes, there are other claims. There are also claims that have been made. And we cite one of these cases, the Twitty case, which we cite in our reply. This case involved a prisoner who claimed that he was transferred one -- from one prison to the next for a retaliatory motive. They included a claim against the Attorney General of the United States. And the district court said: Well, under the Iqbal claim that -- under the Iqbal case, that case can go forward, and potentially the Attorney General can be subject to civil -- to civil discovery, which I think underscores Judge Cabranes's point that the decision in this case is a blue point -- is a blueprint for civil plaintiffs who are challenging the implementation of important law enforcement policies to subject the Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, or other high-level officials to civil discovery based on conclusory and generally -- and general and inadequate allegations. If I could --",
  "There are tort claims, Federal Tort Claims Acts, asserted in this case, and there's other parallel litigation going on in the Second Circuit, Justice Ginsburg. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And, first, let me clarify the record on discoveries. The Second Circuit didn't hold that discovery could not go forward against these Petitioners. It held that the district court might -- that's the word it used on page 67a of the petition appendix -- postpone or limit discovery. So --",
  "To the grace of the district court, that's right, and I think Judge Cabranes emphasized the -- the concerns of potentially vexatious discovery in this context, and we certainly wholeheartedly agree with that. Second, I think Mr. Reinert made an important concession when he acknowledged that substantive standards of law affect what you have to plead. And here there are two substantive standards -- two substantive issues that are key. One is the standard for supervisory liability under Bivens, which requires that the plaintiff show an affirmative link between the wrongdoing alleged by lower level officials and the potential wrongdoing on the part of higher level officials like the Attorney General. The complaint in this case has no subsidiary facts on which a reasonable person could affirm that kind of affirmative link. And, second, the -- the Attorney General is much different than the president of Coca-Cola in that he is entitled to a presumption of regularity of his actions. So that -- that standard itself ought to affect how one views the complaint.",
  "Certainly we would -- we would oppose that. It's conceivable they could try to get that discovery.",
  "I don't know that there is that standard, Your Honor. The same concerns --",
  "Fair enough, Your Honor. But certainly, you know, when we think they are parties to the case the potential demands of civil discovery and the burdens of civil litigation are much greater. Third --",
  "Well, we are in the realm of discovery, and we are in the realm of relying on the district court --",
  "For the reason this Court gave in Bell Atlantic: We don't rely on district court judges to weed out potentially meritless claims through discovery. We apply faithfully the pleading standards.",
  "Right.",
  "We think that Bell Atlantic answers that question correctly, Your Honor. Third, context does matter. The Chief Justice is right about that. In evaluating the claim, you have to look at the context in which it arises. Here the fact it arises in the qualified immunity context with respect to high-level officials is very important. The higher up the chain of command you go, the less plausible it is that the high-level official like the Attorney General is going to be aware of and know about the sort of microscopic decisions here: mistreatment in the Federal detention facility in Brooklyn, alleged discriminatory applications made by FBI agents in the field. These are not matters that one would plausibly assume the Attorney General of the United States has time out of his busy day to concern himself with. The Second Circuit decision should be reversed.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The expert agencies charged by Congress with implementing the Clean Water Act have concluded that the discharge of fill material, like the mine tailings at issue in this case, should be permitted by the Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Act, and are not -- are not subject to the effluent guidelines applicable to permits issued by the EPA under section 402 of the Act. That interpretation is grounded on more than three decades of agency pronouncements and reflects the collective judgment and expertise of the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA in administering the Act.",
  "Justice Kennedy, it's always one or the other. The Clean Water Act establishes two permitting regimes. And I think this is actually something where the parties agree. Either it's going to be permitted under section 402 of the Act, which covers pollutants generally but not the discharge of dredged material, or fill material, which is covered by section 404 of the Act.",
  "As a practical matter, for example, if you take the slurry in this case, which is 55 percent solid by volume, there is going to be liquid coming out of that pipe with the slurry, but under the definition that the agencies administer of fill material, this is fill material under that definition.",
  "Fill material trumps effluent. That's - -",
  "Sure, Justice Souter. First of all, I those concerns really go to the definition of \"fill material,\" and I don't think that the Respondent SEACC has squarely challenged that definition in this case. And I would point you to two parts of the record.",
  "Sure. And let me just point to the two parts of the record: The JA at 541 note 12, where the Ninth Circuit acknowledged they didn't challenge it; and also I would point you to the complaint, where the complaint is directed to the permits and does not seek a determination that the Fill Rule definition is arbitrary and capricious. We think that that definition reflects the settled understanding and expertise of both agencies, the Army Corps of Engineers - -",
  "That is correct, Justice Ginsburg. By \"settled,\" I mean it was settled in 2002. They adopted this rule.",
  "I think the EPA has always adopted and applied an effects test for determining whether or not a discharge is fill material - -",
  "There was a period, of course, Justice Ginsburg -- you are right -- where the Army Corps of Engineers adopted a primary purpose test. During that period -- you are right -- 404 permits were not -- were not issued for the discharge of things where the purpose was not to fill the lake; it was to dispose of material. Now, during that period, though, those discharges were not regulated under section 402 of the Act and under Section 306, the effluent guidelines, but for a different reason. The reason why that they weren't regulated under 402 during that period is because of the agencies' wastewater treatment exception, which is found at 40 C.F.R. 122.2, where the agencies excepted from the definition of the \"waters of the United States\" discharges into an impoundment area. And what you have going on here is the discharge of fill material into an impoundment area, which is dammed off with a 50-foot dam. Those discharges, in this case, are governed by section 404 of the Act. But any discharges from that impoundment area into downstream waters of the United States are subject to section 402 of the Act -- there's a separate permit in this case -- and are subject to the effluent guidelines and the new source performance standards. So you have those two. The agencies have come together. They've reconciled the statutory regimes, and they have the 404 permit of dredged material, material that's going to fill the bottom of the lake, raise it by 50 feet, governed by section 404 of the Act. That impoundment area then is sealed off, and any discharged material out of that impoundment area into waters of the United States is going to be governed by 402 and the separate effluent guidelines there. That - -",
  "Well, any -- we're talking about - -",
  "Well, let me address that in two different ways: First of all, at the end of this project, when the lake is going to be reclaimed, the agencies determined that it's going to be environmentally as sound, if not superior, for the habitats in Alaska, fish and wildlife. So at the end of the project, it is going to be - -",
  "The statute refers to specified disposal sites and what you have here, you are right, is a lake. But it's impounded by a 50-foot dam. The other part I wanted to point to is the section 404 guidelines are rigorous environmental guidelines that address a number of different concerns, including the quality of the water, the fish and wildlife habitat, and at the end of that process you have got the EPA, which has the right to exercise a veto over - -",
  "That's true.",
  "That's true, Justice Souter, but it's important to keep in mind that the reason why the lake -- the fish in the lake are not going to survive is because of the fill effect of the material, not because of any toxics put into the water.",
  "Any time you have fill material going into the waters of the United States - - of course, section 404 doesn't apply until you've got fill material going into the waters of the United States.",
  "I think what the agencies have done to reconcile their definitions is to apply this effects test. Now, if Coeur Alaska sought to fill the entire lake - -",
  "I don't think that's correct.",
  "The legal effect is to regulate that pollution under section 404.",
  "The primary environmental alternative considered was a dry tailings alternative. And that would be been problematic in two different ways. One, it would have required the destruction of some 100 acres of wetlands; and two, it would have resulted in enormous stacks of tailings, 100 to 200 high, thousands of feet wide, that would actually dwarf the Pentagon and be visible from nearby Berners Bay. Now, the Army Corps of Engineers, the State of Alaska, and the Forest Service determined that the wet tailings option, putting the tailings into a lake, and reclaiming that lake so that it would be environmentally superior, was the preferable option. I do want to emphasize that if this Court has any doubt about the statutory text the regulatory decisions here go back more than 30 years. In 1973 the EPA adopted a rule that said that the discharge of fill material is not regulated under the section 402 permitting system. In 2002, in the preamble to the fill rule, the agency made clear again EPA has never regulated the discharge of fill material under the effluent guidelines.",
  "Not the Environmental Protection Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency since the passage of the Clean Water Act has taken the position that discharge that has the effect of changing the bottom elevation of a water is going to be fill. And that makes sense as a practical matter. The agencies with 30 years of experience determined that the purpose definition that the Corps had adopted for a period was unworkable, unpredictable and didn't make sense. And I think that if there's any judgment that the courts ought to defer to here, it's the judgment of the agencies based on their collective experience as to the proper definition of \"fill material.\"",
  "I think as a practical matter if you put discharge into a river and it may not change the bottom elevation, that wouldn't be fill material. But, Justice Ginsburg, there have been a number of hypotheticals raised by Respondents here. Let me address those. The section 404 process is a rigorous environmental process, the EPA does have veto authority. We haven't seen these problems at all in the six years that the fill definition has been in place and I think it's simply untenable to suggest that these standards, which in section 4 require water quality determinations, wildlife, aquatic determination, would result in the sort of environmental harm that Respondents have hypothesized, and the prospect of that harm is no basis for this Court to override the statutory scheme that Congress created with two distinct permitting regimes, one for fill material, one for other pollutants, and to override the agency's pronouncements, interpretations for more than 30 years. And the other agency document I wanted to point to is very important. It's the 2004 mine tailings memorandum, which is contained at JA-141 to 146. In that memorandum, which is a 2004 memo by the heads of the EPA water divisions, they explain the application of the statutory and the regulatory scheme to these types of discharges, discharges that fill material into the impoundment is going to be subject to 404 and the rigorous process there. Any discharges out of that impoundment area is going to be subject to the rigorous requirements of 402 and that agency interpretation is entitled to deference.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case was decided by both courts below on the premise, which is not disputed at any point in the petition for certiorari, that Hastings reserves the funding and benefits that go to student groups that obtain school recognition to groups that choose to admit all students",
  "-- regardless of their status or their beliefs.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, first of all, this is a case about injunctive relief. As a matter of law, the only policy that’s relevant is the current policy, and that's the one --",
  "-- that both sides agree is in place.",
  "No. It’s -- it's the way in which Hastings implements the nondiscrimination policy in this particular forum. And, again, look at the Ninth Circuit decision in this case. It’s --",
  "No, it -- Justice Scalia, this is --",
  "It is operative. This -- the all-comers policy is how it's implemented in this context. And the written policy applies not only to the enumerated characteristics; it applies to any arbitrary unreasonable discrimination, and the law school --",
  "It does, Your Honor. It says in the first paragraph on -- this is on page 220 --",
  "-- of the Joint Appendix: The college is committed to a policy against legally impermissible, arbitrary, or unreasonable discriminatory practices. And then it also goes on and enumerates specific factors. And this is spelled out, I believe in page --",
  "I think it provides additional guidance. But -- but, again, there shouldn't be any debate about what policy is at issue here. The Ninth Circuit's decision in this case is two-sentence long. The first sentence describes the policy at issue in this case. And it says: \"The parties stipulate\" --",
  "Justice Alito, it was decided in the wake of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Truth, which had not only garnered a substantial panel decision but had garnered serious consideration on -- on rehearing. So this case, the Ninth Circuit properly concluded, was controlled by the Truth decision. So in that respect --",
  "In the -- in the sense that it was backed up by the Truth decision, yes. But look at the petition for certiorari in this case. Nowhere did -- did Petitioners challenge the Ninth Circuit's characterization of the policy at issue. The petition says on page 2 that \"There are no disputed issues of material fact.\"",
  "If -- if they believe that that caused the school to adopt a different policy, they shouldn't have stipulated to the policy that they did. And they should have challenged at a minimum --",
  "All of the bylaws that they've pointed to, Justice Scalia --",
  "-- that they have pointed to in their brief --",
  "-- Justice Scalia, either, number one, explicitly say that the organization will comply with the rules and regulations of the school or say that they will admit all students. That includes all the bylaws. Now, they have pointed to various things from the bylaws, and this evolved as they’ve tried to create material factual issues in this Court. One of the things they've pointed to is the bylaws saying, like the Outlaw bylaw, that says that students who are members of a group can be excelled if they -- expelled if they engage in disruptive or gross misconduct. There is nothing inconsistent about that with the school's policy. The school's interest is not in allowing students to disrupt the activities of students' groups --",
  "There’s a fundamental difference between a group that says people of a particular sexual orientation are not allowed to become members --",
  "Justice Scalia, the district court made a -- may I?",
  "Okay. My apologies.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, as -- as Dean -- as director of student services testified, the fact that the bylaws may say we want students who are interested in our activities doesn't mean that the bylaws are excluding students who want to join. And there’s a fundamental difference, again, between saying students that have these particular beliefs or status cannot become members of our group --",
  "Well, with respect, Your Honor, I think it's my friend's position that is evolving. You have joint stipulations before you as to what the policy is. You have the decisions of both courts below describing that policy consistently with the joint stipulations, and you have a petition for certiorari that never challenges that the all-comers policy is at issue.",
  "This case wasn’t --",
  "Justice Sotomayor, this case wasn't litigated as a pretext case. If you look at the briefs in this case, the first time that the word \"pretext\" is used is in the reply brief in this Court. It was litigated as a challenge, which is a serious challenge, to the constitutionality of an all-comers policy in this particular forum.",
  "But --",
  "There absolutely is, Justice Scalia, and it's explained --",
  "It's explained in the amicus brief for the American Council of Education, explained in the State Universities amicus brief.",
  "Justice Kennedy --",
  "Hastings --",
  "A few -- a number of things, Justice Kennedy. The first is the line-drawing issue that has been made clear during the first part of the argument this morning. If you're going -- they appear to take off the table race and what they say are other status considerations. I'm not sure why that excludes sexual orientation. But if you’re going to allow religious groups, or any group, to draw exceptions for some people, then you have to determine where to draw the line. And I think a school can reasonably say: We don't want to get into this business at all; we want to allow all comers",
  "-- for all school-subsidized groups.",
  "That doesn't go to status or belief. If you’re talking about attendance requirements or competition --",
  "-- those are merits-based requirements.",
  "The La Raza bylaws -- first of all, they did explicitly say that groups could not exclude members on the basis of sexual orientation. Now, they -- there was some confusion about how La Raza had interpreted their bylaws. The school went back to La Raza and said: Are you excluding members? La Raza said: No, we’re not; we’re open to all. And to eliminate any doubt, they amended their bylaws. That's the one example they've come up in the 20-year history of this policy. And what does it show? If you want to look at --",
  "Justice Scalia, it's based on the sworn deposition testimony on the former dean, who had been at the school since 1993, the director of student services, who had been there at least since 1999, as this is how they had implemented the nondiscrimination policy. I don't think there’s any basis for this Court to overturn that sworn testimony.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, you --",
  "If the Court believes that, respectfully, we think it should dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. This case was litigated based on stipulations to avoid precisely these factual issues that we’re now talking about for the first time before this Court. Now, I think it is common ground that --",
  "That's true. Georgetown Law School does. Columbia Law School. Look, there’s an amicus brief filed by 13 educational organizations representing thousands of colleges and universities across the country, including the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, saying that this is a not-uncommon and a reasonable policy. We’re not saying it's the only approach that colleges can take in balancing the competing interests here.",
  "We’re saying it’s a constitutional --",
  "Justice Alito, that’s the claim, obviously, that the other side is making. And, with respect, this example has never happened at Hastings in 20 years. It has really never happened in the history of American education. If you look at cases like the voter I.D. case, the partial-birth abortion case --",
  "I think this Court would ordinarily take into account the likelihood that something would happen, and if you're dealing where the only experience --",
  "Of course this Court is going to examine the chill, but so -- just like in the voter I.D. case, where you had had people saying this was going to and, on secondhand accounts, did exclude people from getting to the -- ballot access. This Court said, look, that might happen, but it's not a basis to invalidate this law across the board. Come back with an as-applied challenge.",
  "People have to be -- attend a certain number of meetings before they can join. They can have --",
  "They can have in their -- they can -- sure. I mean, we can entertain the hypotheticals. But they can have in their bylaws a provision just like the Constitution of the United States, that amendments can only be made by a super-majority --",
  "I think if that started to take place, the college would reconsider its policy. It could bring a First Amendment challenge saying that --",
  "-- that would --",
  "I think at that point --",
  "I think obviously the members would rejoin and form another group, Your Honor. I mean, we’re not dealing with this in a factual vacuum. CLS's predecessor existed at the schools for 10 years and in --",
  "If that happened Your Honor. I mean, this has never happened ever in -- in the history of --",
  "-- education.",
  "Absolutely. And CLS, like any group, can have a rule that disruptive members should be expelled.",
  "Well, Your Honor, the record does show that --",
  "The record does show, Your Honor, that there was a gay student who was a member of the group. And that's -- let me give you that --",
  "That was the predecessor group.",
  "Well, actually --",
  "-- what the record shows is that she participated in discussions that the officer of the group said it was a joy to have her and that both sides learned. I think CLS's position depends on the dark notion that students would not have any interest in joining a group with different viewpoints on certain issues except to disrupt that group. And I think that greatly undersells the intellectual curiosity of students. It greatly undersells the fact that groups have many different interests and perspectives. The church has a stance in homosexuality, but it has stances on many other issues, too. And if a student -- even if he or she disagrees with the stance on homosexuality, they may agree with many other aspects of the groups, and they may want to join in the fellowship of that group, they want to take advantage of intangible benefits like not --",
  "Your Honor --",
  "In fact, the record in the -- case shows that only officers teach Bible classes, and groups are perfectly free to structure their organization like that. They can have requirements that people attend certain meetings before they do that. CLS isn't forced to have anyone lead Bible classes.",
  "If it was excluding students from that group on the basis of their beliefs or their status, then, yes, it would. Hastings isn't in the business of second-guessing the -- the beliefs of -- of individual groups, and the whole point of the policy really is to stay out of this, to just have a blanket rule that’s equally neutral.",
  "Your Honor, I think even my friend recognizes that a group could not exclude an individual on the basis of their gender or their beliefs -- on the basis of their gender or race. And remember the Bob Jones case, this Court --",
  "But not at all costs, Mr. Chief Justice. In the Bob Jones case, the claim was from a -- a small private religious school that has a sincere religious belief that people who believed in interracial dating should not become members of their school. And this Court, nevertheless, held that that belief, sincere as it was, did not trump a statute that denied education -- denied Federal financial assistance on a viewpoint-neutral basis to schools that discriminated on the basis of religion. Here we have a -- a group that wants to exclude members on the basis of sexual orientation. We can -- CLS has tried to change that part --",
  "They -- there is a binding judicial admission. And, again, this gets back to the Bob Jones example. I think --",
  "Look at page -- J.A. page 460, which is where the district court said that CLS made a binding judicial admission that they wanted to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Keep in mind that this case began because CLS came back to the law school and said we’re happy to say we won't discriminate on some grounds, but we’re not going to say we won't exclude students on the basis of sexual orientation.",
  "Your Honor, I think it would be a much different case. It --",
  "I -- I think if the school is regulating outside of the purposes of a limited forum, public forum for recognized groups, then I doubt it could go in --",
  "-- and tell the groups --",
  "Where -- where --",
  "Where the rule operates on a viewpoint-neutral basis. Here what the -- the school is doing is it is publicly subsidizing --",
  "They can exist separately. At the school we have are numerous --",
  "In fact, Your Honor, it's not -- it’s not --",
  "-- unusual for schools to have all male or all women clubs. They are not recognized parts of the community. These -- these are activities that are subsidized by the students themselves through the mandatory student activities fees.",
  "Well, I think that's a much different example than this case --",
  "Well, I -- I may have misunderstood the hypothetical. I mean, I think it's a much different --",
  "The reason why the school has a policy that all groups that it subsidizes must admit all-comers is that, number one, it ensures that all students enjoy equal access to all school-subsidized and school-recognized activities. Number two, it avoids the line-drawing problems that we’ve discussed early this morning and I think are necessarily going to arise and also create strife in small educational communities. Number three, it allows --",
  "Not with the all-comers rule.",
  "I don't think it -- that happens at all, Justice Scalia. I think when you’ve the policy that all students have to become members, regardless of their status or belief, that gets the school out of the business of determining whether, number one, people are discriminating on the basis of an essential belief, which is, is the way that Petitioner describes his -- their rule.",
  "Competitive-based, merit-based requirements are not excluded. It -- they’re not --",
  "Yes. And I think --",
  "If it were truly an objective knowledge test, it would be okay. It would be no different than the law review. These are merits-based determinations. There’s a fundamental difference between excluding people on the basis of merit and excluding people on the basis of status or belief that has no connection to merit. That -- that, I think, is a long-standing understanding of discrimination.",
  "I think it goes to the nature of whether it's discrimination under the school's policy, and I think status or belief. People understand -- that's why we are talking about things like race or gender or sexual orientation, disability, military status, any number of these things. And I think the school's policy avoids having to draw lines as to whether or not a group has a sufficient enough belief that military members should become a member of the Amnesty International club because they disagree with the war, that disabled members should be -- disabled students should be a member of a particular group. And the school's policy avoids these line-drawing --",
  "Yes, that's the policy before this Court.",
  "I believe you have to do that, because that is the policy --",
  "-- before this Court.",
  "Absolutely. Absolutely. If I could just discuss briefly the --",
  "If it's pretextual in the Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye sense, yes. No -- no school can purposely discriminate at a group, no matter what policy it adopts.",
  "I don't think so, Justice -- Justice Kennedy, because that --",
  "No. And I get back to the petition for certiorari. On page 2 of the petition, the petition --",
  "It -- yes. We don't think that that's the case here. But if a policy is applied evenhandedly -- unevenhandedly, in a viewpoint-neutral way and it burdens religious groups, then there’s common ground that that policy violates the Constitution. Of course, we think the policy here is --",
  "I think that that would create a factual issue and that that issue might well be tried, Justice Alito. And the one thing that is important to keep in mind is that this is a request for injunctive relief and not damages. So the only policy that matters -- and Wilkinson v. Austin makes this clear -- is the current policy; all parties agree that the current policy is the all-comers policy. That's the policy supported by the record in this case.",
  "I understood my friend's opening brief to acknowledge at the least that that's the policy the school has said it has today. It is the school's policy. It’s supported by substantial history and sworn deposition testimony.",
  "It does.",
  "It does. And that is an additional basis for the school's policy. Look at California Education Code 66270. It explicitly prohibits discrimination in -- in programs and educational activities by public schools like Hastings. Hastings has an obligation under State law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The reason why we’re here today is because CLS insisted on the right to discriminate, to exclude students on the basis of their sexual orientation.",
  "Our position is that the registered student organization program is a program of the university; it’s subsidized by the university; it’s recognized by the university; and that all students should be able to enjoy access to that program.",
  "Your Honor, our position is that the provision that we've cited to, 66270, does not carve out an exemption in this program for a religious student organization. On its face --",
  "Yes. On its face, it excludes -- it has an exemption for religious schools; it does not include an exemption for religious organizations within the context of this program. And we think that the program is reasonable.",
  "Thank you very much.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Biotech crops have produced enormous benefits for the nation's farmers and consumers. The district court in this case issued a broad-based injunction against the planting of a highly beneficial, genetically engineered alfalfa crop. In entering and sustaining that injunction, the courts below erred in two fundamental respects. First, they short-circuited the requisite inquiry into the likelihood of reparable -- irreparable harm, because they reasoned that the agency was going to get into this anyway in the course of preparing its environmental impact statement. And --",
  "The Court shouldn't, Justice Alito. First as to the vacatur, we appealed the judgment that contains the vacatur and the injunction. And our notice of appeal, which is on page 59 and 61 of the excerpts of record in the Ninth Circuit, makes clear that we explicitly appealed the vacatur as well. And let me explain that a little bit more, but first I want to say as to the environmental impact statement, the government can address that more, but my understanding is that we’re probably about a year away from the environmental impact statement. This case presents important legal issues concerning the entry of injunctive relief. We think the Court properly granted certiorari and should decide those issues. We think that, although the record is large, that this Court can decide, as it did in Winter, that as a matter of law this record does not support a finding of irreparable harm.",
  "We did appeal the vacatur as well as the injunction which is contained as part of the same judgment. We know that the district --",
  "Well, we -- our argument all along, Justice Sotomayor has been that the court, the district court, erred in not adopting the government's proposed judgment. If you look on page 184 of the petition appendix, that proposed judgment makes clear that it’s intended to replace the district court's judgment, including the vacatur. So all along the whole argument about --",
  "They are part and parcel of the same judgment. It's true, a vacatur is different than an injunction. But here --",
  "Well, the district court could have vacated the order in its entirety and send it back to the agency. It didn't do that. It not only went ahead and enjoined the planting of RRA, Roundup Ready alfalfa, but --",
  "The vacatur was in part. We know that because the district court's judgment allowed the continued planting and harvesting of Roundup Ready alfalfa, the planting before 2007. But --",
  "Well -- and importantly, the district court's judgment -- and it's on page 108 of the petition appendix --",
  "-- not only enjoined the planting of Roundup Ready alfalfa, it enjoined the agency from taking interim measures. It --",
  "We --",
  "And that --",
  "Well, I'm not going to disagree with you on that. It is important that they enjoined the agency from implementing the very proposed measures that we’re now finding -- fighting --",
  "-- in the context of an injunction.",
  "108a. It's 108a of the petition appendix.",
  "Planting was allowed until March 30, 2007, and then that alfalfa could be continued to be harvested; seeds would be harvested and maintained separately.",
  "Absolutely. That in combination with the fact that it actually enjoined the agency from what it could have done, otherwise done, under --",
  "Well, I think this Court's decision in Weinberger involved at least an analogous situation, where the court found a statutory violation of the Clean Water Act. It doesn't involve the vacatur of a decision, but the court then went on to add an injunction on top of that. So you had the statutory violation that arguably prohibited the conduct.",
  "And we at the outset at the district court stage, if the -- if the district court had done that, that would have been fine. It could have gone back. The agency could have adopted the very proposed measures that we’re now talking about in the context of an injunction. The district court did not do that. It entered the injunction not only as to the sale of RRA, but as to the agency taking --",
  "-- those interim steps.",
  "And we know the district court didn't mean that literally, because its own judgment allows the continued planting and harvesting of RRA planted before --",
  "-- March 2007.",
  "Well, if it's a regulated article, then there's no use of it allowed at all unless the agency is granting exceptions. So the district court's grant of that exception was an exercise of its equitable authority in the context of considering Respondents' injunction. Respondents have litigated this all along as though the injunction provided something in addition to the vacatur, and this Court's cases establish that the injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy that does. It allows people to go into court to enforce it. It provides an opportunity for contempt sanctions. If I could just -- if I could address the issue of irreparable harm, there are two key things the Court -- we hope the Court will understand in adjudicating the question of irreparable harm. First is you need to separate out hay production and seed production. There’s absolutely no evidence in this record whatsoever of any cross-pollination from RRA hay fields to another hay field. So the district court's injunction applies broad-based to hay production and seed production. But at a minimum, we think you have to take seed production out. The next thing is that, when it comes to the risk of harm --",
  "When alfalfa is grown for hay, for forage, as opposed to grown for seeds which can then be planted. The next thing to know is what we're talking about here is the risk that -- and Roundup Ready alfalfa will appear in a conventional or organic alfalfa field. We're not talking about transforming a single alfalfa plant in the country. It's the risk that an existing alfalfa plant will produce a seed, which will then produce another alfalfa plant which would be a Roundup Ready alfalfa plant. So not a single alfalfa plant in this country is going to be harmed by the addition of Roundup Ready alfalfa. The district court found, on page 43 of the petition appendix, that Roundup Ready alfalfa provides no harm the --",
  "Sure. There’s three legal arguments we have, Justice Sotomayor. The first is the district court short-circuited the whole analysis by assuming up front that, since this was going to go to environmental impact statement, it didn't have to seriously get into the likelihood of irreparable harm. And we think that that’s clear error under this Court's Amoco decision. And, in fact, if you look at --",
  "Federal law and the regulation at 40 C.F.R. 1506.1(a) allows action to go forward where there’s not an adverse environmental impact. The agency has explained in great detail in declarations that allowing the very limited use of RRA under the restricted conditions of the proposed injunctions would not result in any environmental impact. If I could reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Kennedy, to answer your question, this Court in Amoco held that you don't give special weight to that; that you apply the traditional equitable factors. Your Honors, we absolutely did challenge the vacatur below. That's spelled out in note 1 of our reply brief. The whole fight in this case going forward since the district court has been over whether or not the court erred in not adopting the government's proposed measures. On page 184 of the petition appendix, it makes clear that the government's opposed measures were intended to replace the deregulation order. So the vacatur and the proposed measures are one and the same.",
  "Well, it --",
  "The district court at least acted improperly in enjoining the agency from doing that on remand. And if that's all the Court thinks it did improperly --",
  "Well, it's part --",
  "It's -- our view is it's part and parcel of the vacatur order. The district court looked at this in the context of the injunction and posed those traditional factors in examining the scope of relief.",
  "I mean, it's important for this Court to put aside --",
  "In terms of going back for the imminence, we’re operating under this injunction which is unlawful. It's preventing -- it's causing real harm to the nation's farmers today. There couldn't be more imminence in terms of the harm that we suffer because of this erroneous injunction. With respect, it's -- it's the farmers that are challenging this --",
  "If you go back, the agency could allow those measures to be implemented and that would solve --",
  "-- our problem.",
  "Not necessarily, Justice Ginsburg, but, with respect, we’ve been operating under this erroneous injunction for 3 years. This Court should say it's erroneous. There are other cases that are repeating this pattern. It's important for the Court to correct this error. And briefly on the question of harm: There are no instances in this record of any cross-pollination with hay, only a couple of -- a few isolated with respect to seed, and their harm really boils down to the question of their psychological objection to genetically engineered alfalfa. That harm is not cognizable under Metropolitan Edison or anything else. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1984 and again in 1989 the agency specifically determined that the statutory safety and practicability objectives would be best served by giving manufacturers the flexibility to install a lap-only or lap/shoulder seatbelt.",
  "The typical case where a Federal motor vehicle safety standard establishes only a minimum, like the standard for braking performance or roof structure is not going to be preempted. Geier says that and we're not challenging that.",
  "This case is different because the agency specifically recognized in 1984 and 1989 that there were serious safety and practicability tradeoffs between these two different design options and specifically gave manufacturers the option of installing one type of seatbelt or the other.",
  "I think -­",
  "We are not here -­",
  "What the agency -­",
  "What the agency wanted here was flexibility. It wanted flexibility because it recognized that there were safety tradeoffs and that the safety and practicability objectives were best served by leaving -­",
  "And -­",
  "The agency recognized here that Type 1 seatbelts, the lap-only seatbelts, themselves posed unique safety risks. It did so to children. If you look at the 1984 rulemaking, the agency couldn't have been more clear that we are not going to impose a Type 2 mandate for rear seats, because that's going to be harmful to children.",
  "The agency preserved that very status quo in 1989. Petitioners recognize that in note 1 of their brief.",
  "We don't think the Court should defer to the agency's position. We don't think the Court should adopt it. In Geier the Court found that the regulatory record was clear enough that it didn't have to rely on the agency position. So we think -­",
  "Well, I think what it said, and obviously Justice Breyer can correct me; he wrote the opinion for the Court -- was that it thought the regulatory record was clear enough, but it did ultimately say that it did agree with the agency, although it didn't make a difference to the Court's opinion.",
  "But if -­",

  "Of course, from -­",

  "That's right.",
  "And -­",
  "And I think that's what the SG says and we think that -- that the SG is wrong. We think the agency said in 1989 and it said in 1984 it could not have been more clear that they did not want to mandate the Type 2 belt, the very rule that the Petitioners want to mandate through this State law tort action. They didn't want to do it because they were concerned about child safety, they were concerned about aisle safety, they were concerned about practicability.",

  "The reason why is because -­",
  "Because the agency determined here that the flexibility was necessary to advance Federal safety and practicability objectives, and that that -- those objectives would be frustrated by a Type 2 mandate. And flexibility -- this Court has recognized -­",
  "Not when you have the kind of unique standard here. Granted, this is going to be the rare situation. But if you look at, for example, take child safety. The agency couldn't have been clearer in 1984. Look at 49 Federal Register 15241, the final rule, that it was not going to mandate Type 2 seatbelts because they found that that would harm child safety. The agency specifically carried forward that rule in 1989 for the rear inboard seats at issue in this case. Note 1 of Petitioner's reply brief said that the law is exactly the same in 1989 as to these seats as in 1984. It -- hasn't been preempted in 1984, notwithstanding what my friend said here from the government today; and if it was preempted in 1984 it has to be preempted in 1989. The tradeoffs here, we have talked about the lawsuit involving a -- a child who was -- who was restrained by a shoulder belt and harmed as a -- as a result of that belt, which is a concern that NHTSA has recognized throughout its history. Under their position, the manufacturer could be sued for having a Type 2 belt by the child who was harmed or by the person in the back row that had difficulty getting out of the car in the event of an accident, just as they could be sued under Petitioner's theory for having a Type 1 belt. This -- the agency recognized, this was a unique situation where there were serious safety and practicability tradeoffs; they wanted to give the -- the manufacturers the flexibility to make this decision, and that flexibility served, the agency concluded, the Federal safety and -- and practicability objectives. If you look at this Court's decision -­",
  "Justice Sotomayor, there are hundreds of Federal motor vehicle safety standards, and I would agree with you for virtually all of them, except you have the rare standards -- and they are rare, like the one in Geier and like the one here -- where the agency quite obviously is doing something much different. It's expressly granting options and it's making clear in the record that the reason it is doing that is to serve Federal objectives that would be frustrated by the imposition of a particular rule. I think you have to look at this from the standpoint of the manufacturers who are told that they can manufacture this car with this design or that design, and you can go look at the Federal Register and see that the reason the agency is doing that is to advance safety and practicability objectives.",
  "Well, first you would look -­",
  "In a very generalized sense. But we know from Geier that that doesn't resolve the preemption question, because the same could have been said with respect to the rule in Geier. First you look at the rule, and you are just not going to find very many rules at all in the Federal -- in the Code of Federal Regulations that provide this kind of express option for equipment design. And then second, you go look and you -- and you see what the agency said about that in its final rules and the commentary accompanying the final rules. And here, if you look, not only would you find that the agency granted this flexibility to serve Federal safety and practicability objectives, you would find that it specifically rejected the very rule that Petitioners want to impose on State tort law, because it concluded that that rule would be counterproductive from the standpoint of safety and practicability.

  "There was some question about a movement from tethered to non-tethered, but that only created the compatibility issue that the agency recognized in the 1989 rulemaking and 1984. I mean, at the same time the agency is telling manufacturers: Install your -- manufacture your car seats so they can be installed with a Type 1 lap-only belt, and it's telling parents: Parents, put your children in the rear center seat because that's going to be the safest seat, which, by the way, is the seat that is going to have a lap-only belt. And so it's clear -­",

  "It's not in the record, Justice Scalia.",
  "You have three rows in the car. In the front row, you've got the driver's side and the front row driver on the right-hand side. And then you have the middle row of seat, and then have you a back row. The middle row seat had a seat on the side, which was the outboard seat, a seat in the middle, which is where the descendent in this case was sitting, and then it had an aisle next to it. So it was a center seat -­",
  "No, it was on the side of the vehicle. So it was the center seat in every practical sense, and therefore provided the same structural concerns that NHTSA recognized.",
  "If I could make three points in response to that. First, as the language you just read indicates, it didn't require -- they didn't encourage at all costs. They encouraged where this specific safety concern could be addressed. Second, there is a world of difference between saying, we encourage manufacturers to do what's appropriate when they can practically do so, and a world in which a jury could have decided the day after -­",
  "We know from Geier that the agency doesn't have to make a formal statement to justify its intent.",
  "I think the record -- we certainly think the record here -- the agency really couldn't have been clearer in saying: We don't want the Type 2 mandate, the lap/shoulder mandate the Petitioners are trying to impose here. It said it unambiguously -­",
  "Well, that's just not true. And with respect to the government, I don't think that the regulatory record supports that generalized statement that it was Type 2 at all -- at all costs. It was clear that the agency recognized -­",
  "And gave the very unique kind of option here. The agency identified several costs with imposing a Type 2 mandate here. It recognized the unique safety concerns present when you are trying to stretch a Type 2 belt across the aisle, which is going to block access, which is a clear safety concern. It identified the child safety concerns which were the basis for this very same option in 1984 and which were carried forward when the agency preserved the status quo for the rear inboard seats at issue here. It recognized other safety concerns, including obstructing the rearward vision of drivers when you install the Type 2 belt in the center seat, because -­",
  "No, and the portion of the notice of proposed rulemaking that's cited refers to the no positive or negative effects. And that language, it does not lead to the conclusion that the government and Petitioner suggests, for a few reasons. First, the agency was referring only to rear outboard seats, not rear inboard seats, the kind of seat at issue. And that's important because NHTSA was telling parents: Put your children in the rear center seat, the inboard seat, because that -- that seat also was the seat that was most likely to have the lap belt, which is how NHTSA was telling child seat manufacturers to install their child seats, that you could install them with a lap belt because it was more compatible with that. Second of all, that, the reference to the no positive or negative, was a tentative assessment. If you look in the Federal Register where that language appears -- it's on 53 Federal Register 47988 to 47989 -­ the agency said: This is a tentative assessment; we want your comments on this. Comments came back and the agency backed off from that and said, we have to examine this more. And secondly, that positive -- no positive or negative statement -- could only apply when child -­ when children were using the boosters which would help with the Type 2 shoulder belt so the belt wasn't going over the neck. But NHTSA knew at that time that very few, less than 1 percent, of parents were actually putting their kids in the booster seats. This was 20 years ago. This was at a time when many children weren't in any car seats at all, no matter what NHTSA was saying. So they recognized that they were at real risk here, that children -- children with a Type 2 belt, just to be clear -- and NHTSA recognized this during the 1989 rulemaking -- that belt is going to pose an obvious safety risk to children, because the shoulder belt that is terrific for adults is going to take -- is going to create unique chest loads on children. And if the children is not on a booster, as virtually all were not, the belt is going to appear too high on the head -- on the neck or head, which is a safety problem.",
  "Well, because this -- this was something, Justice Scalia, that the agency struggled with for almost a decade until it ultimately adopted the latch system, which resolved the compatibility issue of the lap belt versus the lap/shoulder belt for installing the child car seat. I mean, anyone who has tried to install a child car seat with a Type 2 belt, the lap/shoulder belt, knows how difficult it was. And the agency went back and forth on this and ultimately went in a completely different direction in 1999 and installed the lap system. And another thing that happened is over time, booster seats became more accepted. More parents were putting children in booster seats. And we solved that safety concern as well. But 20 years ago, at the time that this rule was adopted, the agency clearly appreciated the child safety risk. Again, in 1984 -­",
  "Because it would -­",
  "This was an area that NHTSA was carefully monitoring. You had rulemakings in '84 and '89 and it adopted a very unique approach to resolving the safety issue, which was to expressly give manufacturers this option to advance Federal safety and practicability objectives. We haven't talked as much about the practicability objectives, but that is one of the statutory objectives of the act. Congress couldn't have been more clear on that and the agency in 1989 couldn't have been more clear in the final notice, saying we are not going to require manufacturers to install Type 2 belts in the rear center and aisle seats because that's just too costly. It's substantially expensive and the agency well knew based on its history that imposing this sort of overly costly safety measures that the Type 2 belt would have been for these seats at that time could have proved counterproductive with the agency's long-term safety mission. The agency said that in the rulemaking in this case at 52 Federal Register 22819 where it said that requiring these kind of overly costly measures created a lost opportunity to improve safety through other means. This is something that Congress gave the agency the expert judgment to make on these matters and the practicability objectives, which was just as much a statutory objective as a safety objective, would have been directly frustrated if, as could have happened under the Petitioners position in this case, on the very day after the agency passed this rule in 1989 and said we are not going to require rear inboard seats to have Type 2 lap/shoulder belts. A jury in California hit my client with a multimillion dollar punitive damages award because they did not install a Type 2 belt in that seat. That would have been directly contrary to the Federal objectives. It would have undermined the safety objectives that the agency recognized and it would have undermined the practicability objectives that the agency recognized, and then you have this world in which manufacturers like my client could be hit with multimillion dollar punitive damages award in one state for installing the Type 2 belt where a child was injured or someone was in the back seat and couldn't get out.",
  "I think that was later in time. It wasn't in 1989. Truthfully, if you look at late as 2004 when the agency adopted so-called Anton's law rule, which eventually did mandate Type 2 belts in these kinds of seats. Even then the agency recognized that there were still technical feasibility concerns with installing the Type 2 belts in these seats. And just to be clear, the problem is, is finding the anchor to install the shoulder belt in rear center or aisle seats. You have got to anchor it somewhere. If you put it in the side wall you are going to have straps crossing across the aisle and obstructing access. If you put it in the roof you are going to have something -­",
  "And the agency resolved conclusively that it was not practical in 1989. Was it theoretically possible? Eventually manufacturers -­",
  "It gave them that flexibility, the agency determined in the 1994 chief counsel letter and we hope the Court does read it, makes it clear that the agency concluded that in this situation, and it's a rare situation, the manufacturer was in the best position to decide what was most appropriate for its vehicles. And, again, there is this flexibility objective. If you look at Fidelity Federal Savings & Loan v. A. la Cuesta, the decision cited on page 19 of our brief, you have this Court recognizing that a Federal law that gave flexibility where you have a state mandate that interferes with that flexibility, that is an actual conflict. Ultimately under Geier, this Court is looking for the existence of an actual conflict. We think a rule that says manufacturers, you are free to choose between this type of seatbelt and that type of seatbelt, and the reason we are giving you that flexibility is to advance federal safety and practicability objectives. We are not going to require you to put a lap/shoulder belt in there because that would frustrate those Federal objectives, the state law tort suit that would mandate the very thing that the agency chose not to, to advance federal objectives is preempted. If there are no further questions?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Two factors distinguish this case from those in which the Court has found cause lacking to excuse a default: First, the State itself had a direct hand in the extraordinary events leading up to the default in this case; and, second, the actions of Maples's attorneys, which rise to the level of abandonment, are not attributable to Maples under agency law or other principles that this Court has invoked in determining when attorney conduct may be imputed to a client. For either or both of those reasons, the default at issue in this case is not fairly attributable to Cory Maples, and the contrary decision of the Eleventh Circuit should be reversed.",
  "I think that's -- that's right, Mr. Chief Justice. I would couple that, though, with the fact that the State initially set up a system for the representation of indigent capital defendants that relies extremely heavily on the good graces of out-of-State counsel to represent indigent capital defendants in Alabama.",
  "I think -- if only one from the out-of-State pro bono counsel?",
  "I think that would be a different case. I think what's remarkable about this case is you have both out-of-State attorneys, the notices come back marked \"Return to Sender -- Left Firm\" in an envelope, and the clerk does nothing. And what's extraordinary about that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the system in this case relies on the out-of-State attorneys to provide --",
  "That's correct, Justice Scalia.",
  "We have three points on the local counsel, Your Honor. First, the record shows that the notice is not attributable to Mr. Maples because Mr. Butler had disclaimed any relationship apart from facilitating the admission of his out-of-State attorneys.",
  "I think a -- a couple things on the clerk's perspective. First, we do think that it was well known in Alabama that, under this unique system, out-of-State attorneys were doing all the work in these cases, and local counsel were simply facilitating their admission. Second, one of the --",
  "A couple of the things, Your Honor. First, we do have the amicus briefs, which discuss that anecdotally. I would say that the State of Alabama in its brief in opposition to this Court a few years back in the Barbour case specifically touted the role of out-of-State attorneys under its system and, as far as I could tell, didn't mention local counsel once. So, I think it was fair to say that it's known that the out-of-State attorneys here were doing all the work. But even if the clerk --",
  "Well --",
  "What -- what -- I think the clerk would be imputed with knowledge, general knowledge of the system. But beyond that, what the clerk know -- knew was this: He knew that two of the three notices that went out were returned, both to the out-of-State attorneys, which ought to be an extraordinary event in the life of any clerk's office.",
  "Of course. But the point is --",
  "In this case, the local counsel didn't perform as a mail drop, and that was intentionally so. His own affidavit makes that clear. And I think what's important is the State itself must not have viewed him as a meaningful player.",
  "My point was that ordinarily a local counsel would serve as the mail drop; he would forward notice. In this case, Mr. Butler made quite clear from the outset that he was not even performing that role. The role that he intentionally performed was to admit out-of-State counsel and to let them do the work. But the State itself --",
  "It's in his affidavit, Your Honor, the petition appendix page 256.",
  "That's right, Your Honor.",
  "He did not.",
  "He did not tell the clerk --",
  "-- but the State itself, Your Honor must not have viewed him as a meaningful player, because when the default at issue in this case occurred, the State sent a letter -- faxed it -- to Mr. Maples directly on death row in Alabama, without --",
  "The clerk sent out notices to all three attorneys of record, the two out-of-State counsel and Mr. Butler. Mr. Butler did receive the notice. He didn't do anything, both because he hadn't assumed any role beyond facilitating admission --",
  "He did not. The State -- and this is at page 26 of the joint appendix. The State served it on his out-of-State counsel and not Mr. Butler, his local counsel. And when the default occurred, the State contacted Mr. -- Mr. Maples directly in prison, which would have been unethical if the State had known or believed that he was represented by counsel.",
  "I absolutely agree with you, Justice Ginsburg. I think that that is further evidence that everybody knew that Mr. Maples didn't have any local counsel in any meaningful sense.",
  "Well --",
  "The Constitution doesn't say that explicitly --",
  "We think notice of a postconviction order in a capital case would at least implicate a due process interest in receiving notice, that it's reasonable --",
  "I think under the --",
  "Well --",
  "The Mullane case specifically takes into account the interests of the individual receiving notice. There could be no greater interest of an individual than receiving notice in a capital case where the individual's life is at stake. Ultimately we don't think this Court has to find a constitutional violation. It has to find that the events --",
  "Here Mr. Maples did not have an attorney that was serving in an agency role in any meaningful sense. That's laid out in Ms. DeMott's amicus brief; it's laid out in our case. What's more is the State here didn't simply just, we think quite unreasonably, rely on a role that local counsel was not performing in Alabama --",
  "I think that the ordinary role of local counsel, which would have been to, at a minimum, forward notice in a proceeding, would be a meaningful relationship. The relationship that -- that Professor DeMott describes here is one of sub-agency. And, in fact, if you look at the Alabama rules, they put the onus on the out-of-State counsel to associate the local counsel. That's at page 365 of the joint appendix. The out-of-State counsel did that. Mr. -- Mr. Maples wasn't involved in that transaction.",
  "I think Mr. Butler -- just simply saying, I'm going to allow -- I'm going to facilitate your out-of-State attorneys to represent you, but that's my role. He had, quote, unquote, \"no role\" after that.",
  "Well, clearly that's right.",
  "That's exactly our point, Justice Scalia, which is that he forswore any responsibility. The lawyer in the Holland case just had those responsibilities, too. He abandoned his client. This -- what Mr. Butler here did here was inexcusable. But there's another factor at play here, and that's the confusion that the court itself affirmatively created when it sent an order that, by its term, directed that all counsel of record receive it. And that's what the order said; it's on page 225 of the joint appendix. And --",
  "Certainly, it knew that they were counsel of record in the proceeding. I'll let my -- my friend answer that question. What we know, though, is when the default occurred, it took the extraordinary step of faxing a letter directly to Mr. Maples in prison, which would have been unethical if it believed he was represented by counsel.",
  "Well, I don't want to speak for my friend. I don't -- there's certainly nothing in the record to -- to establish that they knew that these out-of-State attorneys didn't get notice.",
  "Yes.",
  "The very actions it took, Justice Breyer.",
  "That's true, Justice Breyer.",
  "Right. And I think the State's actions --",
  "No, Justice Scalia --",
  "But we know -- we know what action it took, and that action was an action that assumed that he didn't have meaningful counsel, or else it would have been unethical.",
  "I don't know that, Justice Kennedy. I think the Alabama system here created a system in which it would allow for appeals, not only in direct appeals, but postconviction proceedings. The extraordinary -- there are several extraordinary features of the Alabama system, and we think that ultimately they helped to facilitate the extraordinary and shocking events in this case.",
  "That's right.",
  "I think that's right.",
  "Well, I don't think they would be attributed. I think what you're looking for is whether the default itself is attributable to Maples. The New York -- what -- what the out-of-State attorneys did is they left the representation without fulfilling their duty to notify the court or Mr. Maples. Mr. Maples was in -- was sitting in a prison cell in Alabama under the reasonable belief that he was represented by counsel who would appeal if an adverse decision was issued.",
  "The direct proceedings had concluded.",
  "He did, Justice Scalia.",
  "It was, but when the State sets up that system and allows for appeals, it can't arbitrarily deprive it of an appeal based on the sort of circumstances here.",
  "I'm not aware of any State that does not allow appeal in postconviction proceedings.",
  "But I think --",
  "No. I mean, the statistics that I'm aware of are that habeas claims are in a material sense often successful in capital cases. We've cited those in our reply brief. Here we think the underlying claims are quite serious. The question in the case is really not who shot the victims. The question is, was whether Mr. Maples was going to be convicted for capital murder or murder that would result in life imprisonment.",
  "And I think, going back to the court's and the clerk's actions here, one of the things that exacerbated the chain of events here was that you had an order which directed that all parties would be served. Mr. Butler did say that he saw that that order directed that the out-of-State counsel would be served, which created an added risk of the likelihood --",
  "Well, I believe that Alabama may appoint them. They don't provide for appointment in all cases. I believe Georgia is another State. But in that respect, I think these States are alone.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "The vast majority do.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right. And that is --",
  "Well, I think they're independent grounds. If the Court concludes that the State's own actions --",
  "Well --",
  "I don't -- I don't -- I just want to be clear on this. They are independent grounds. If the Court concludes that the State's actions --",
  "But with respect to the attorneys, that's right.",
  "It would be the line established by agency law going back to Justice Story's time.",
  "I think it's actually more of a situation where he disclaimed any meaningful role at the outset. I think, you know, the real abandonment going on here was the attorneys in New York who left without notifying the court or their client. But that --",
  "The Court could.",
  "There is not a finding. We think that's the better reading of the record, and I'm happy to explain why. But most importantly, we think it's irrelevant whether he was represented by the law firm in the fictional sense. He was represented by individual lawyers in that proceeding. They were the ones who Mr. Maples agreed to have represent him in that proceeding. The Alabama courts made specific findings that Mr. Maples's lawyers were Ms. Ingen-Housz and Mr. Munanka. It said that after the default. At that time --",
  "I think one would ordinarily expect that. And we're not condoning the actions here. I would say that, at the outset of this litigation, there were individuals from the Legal Aid Society who were well familiar with capital cases involved. They apparently dropped out of the case. But we know --",
  "What we know is what Mr. De Leeuw has said, which is that he was involved in the case at some point. It's not clear what his involvement was. At the oral argument in the Eleventh Circuit, he said, on page 302 of the joint appendix, that he was -- they were awaiting further action from the court. So, we don't know what his involvement was.",
  "I think that would be appropriate, Your Honor. Of course, we think the Court should find that the Holland -- the Holland exception, or more particularly --",
  "That's right. There are those distinctions. Our point is that Holland recognizes that attorney conduct that amounts to abandonment is external to the client under agency and other principles. Coleman itself recognizes that external conduct is not attributable to the client and can't be a basis for cause. So, the Federal -- federalism interests are simply not implicated in a case where you find that the attorney's actions are external. And we think if you look at the principles you looked at in Holland, agency law going back to Justice Story's time, the principles of professional standards of care, you would find that an abandonment -- of course, that must be external to the client. Justice Alito said in his concurring opinion that where someone is not acting as an agent in any meaningful sense, it would be grossly inequitable and unfair to attribute the agent's conduct to the client.",
  "That's the principle we're asking.",
  "I think there are conflicts of interest here. They're laid out in the legal ethics briefs. The Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys were representing Mr. Maples up through the argument and decision in the Eleventh Circuit. But I think -- for purposes of what this Court would do, I think a remand would be appropriate, because if you conclude, as we think you should, that abandonment of counsel would be an external factor, then it would be appropriate to remand for further proceedings. We don't know what these other attorneys were doing. The record doesn't show that.",
  "We absolutely know that they were not.",
  "They were not.",
  "They were not counsel of record. Mr. Maples never agreed to have anyone else represent him in a way that could bind him. The Alabama court specifically found not only that they weren't counsel of record, but they were not authorized to practice in Alabama. This is on page 223 of the petition appendix.",
  "We asked --",
  "But the petition did include a request for an evidentiary hearing. And I think the problem is that both the district court and the court of appeals short-circuited the inquiry into counsel's actions because it believed that Coleman v. Thompson applied in the abandonment situation. And where a court made that kind of legal error, it would be appropriate for the Court to send it back and say, no, Coleman v. Thompson does not apply in the extraordinary case of abandonment, or an attorney's actions cannot be attributable to a client under agency law.",
  "Well, I think we've argued --",
  "I think explicitly. Now, we think that -- two points on this. We think --",
  "We think that all along they argued that the attorneys' actions established cause. That's why both the district court and the court of appeals addressed that and rejected it erroneously under Coleman.",
  "We think this falls squarely within the rule of Yee v. Escondido, where -- where the party makes the claim below -- which they made the claim here that the attorneys' actions established cause -- you can make new arguments, different arguments. And I think, particularly given that Sullivan & Cromwell had been involved early in this case and the possibility of conflicts of interest would make it appropriate for this Court to consider our abandonment issue, which was raised in the petition for rehearing, explicitly raised in the petition for certiorari -- explicitly -- we think it's properly before this Court. If there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. We agree that this is a sui generis case. The facts are extraordinary, the facts are shocking, and our position is simply that under this Court's precedents and the extraordinary facts here, Mr. Maples has established cause to excuse the default. With respect to local counsel, apart from the fact that the State communicated directly with Mr. Maples, an extraordinary step after the default, maybe the other telling thing is that in 2006, Alabama itself eliminated the local counsel requirement for pro bono proceedings, recognizing that it could only create problems; it didn't add anything. With respect to abandonment, I understood at times my counsel -- my friend, to acknowledge that abandonment may establish an external event with respect to the client. If that's so, then I think it's clear that we're at a minimum entitled to a remand. There were statements about what was clear from the record. I think, at a minimum, the record is not clear on a number of things that this Court would have to get into if it were going to consider adopting the State's position that Mr. Maples was not abandoned. Mr. Maples was in a prison cell. His attorneys of record did not tell him that they had left the firm. They were required not only to tell the court --",
  "And you have a record of the attorneys leaving with not only not notifying Mr. Maples, not notifying the court, and not obtaining the court's approval, which is required by Rule 6.2 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.",
  "Working through agency principles that go back to Justice Story's time, working through the principles established in this Court's decision in Holland and that will be applied in Holland. The lower court in Holland issued its decision on remand and found that Mr. Collins had abandoned Mr. Holland, using this Court's precedent as a guide. So, I think Holland already recognizes that attorney abandonment can be external. We're just asking the Court to apply the same principles and recognize that what's external in one context cannot be not external in the other context.",
  "I don't know the answer to that question. I'm not aware of any flood of relief in such cases. I expect that this would be very extreme. I think the facts here are about as extreme as you can get.",
  "Well, where you have counsels of record leaving without obtaining the approval that they're required or telling the Court, I think that is abandonment pure and simple. Beyond that, you would look to agency principles, whether there's a breach of loyalty. This is going to be a fact -- you would want to get into the facts, although I think it is a very high bar. I think the Holland decision makes clear it's a high bar. I think this case clearly passes that bar, but it's something that the courts will work out applying agency principles, applying the Court's decision in Holland. Recognizing what Holland said in this case isn't going to create any new rule; it's simply going to extend logically the recognition that attorney abandonment is external to the client as it always has been under agency principles. With respect to notice, this Court doesn't have to find a constitutional violation on the State's part. It's enough for cause that the Court finds that the State's actions are external. And I think the key inquiry is what Justice Kagan recognized, which is you look to what a person who is actually desirous of providing notice would do. In this situation, the clerk got two notices back, \"Left Firm.\" It opened it up; it would have seen this is an order in a capital case, and it did nothing. I don't think anyone who actually desired to provide notice of an inmate with his life on the line would do nothing, reasonably, in that situation. Mr. Maples is not asking to be released from prison. He's asking for an opportunity to present serious constitutional claims of ineffective assistance of counsel to a Federal habeas court on the merits. If the claims are as meritless as the State suggests, that clearly will have little burden on it. But simply allowing those claims to be adjudicated on the merits in Federal court will go a long way to preserving the legitimacy of the system of criminal justice in a case in which a man's life is at stake. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Whether this Court concludes that a 12(b)(1) or a 12(b)(6) label is the better fit, it should hold that Congress did not intend for private TCPA claims to be brought in Federal court under 28 U.S.C. 1331. The private right of action that Congress expressed is distinct in three different and meaningful ways. And if you look at the right of action, which is on page --",
  "We don't, and we haven't contested that the action here arises under Federal law. But what you've got is the question of the interplay between two statutes, 1331 and the private right of action here, in the same way the Court has dealt with the interaction between section 1983 and other private rights of action, for example, the City of Ranchos Palos Verdes v. Abrams case. And in that context, the Court hasn't said, oh, if it's covered by 1983, of course you've got to bring it under -- you can bring it under 1983 unless Congress has unmistakably cleared that you can't.",
  "And all of those cases dealt with the constitutional presumption of concurrent State court jurisdiction. And, of course, where the question is whether the -- whether the Constitution has been displaced, this Court has required Congress to speak with unmistakable clarity. This case is the first case where this Court is confronted with the question of whether there's any similar presumption going the other way. There's no constitutional foundation for that presumption. It's just the interplay between statutes. And for that reason we think the section 1983 paradigm is more important.",
  "Well, no. The background rule -- the -- right. There's a background rule provided by a statute which Congress can displace by a later enacted more specific statute, and then there's the background rule provided by the Constitution. And our position is that usually when the Court talks about Congress displacing, disrupting the traditional balance of powers protected by the Constitution, it does require Congress to speak with unmistakable clarity. It doesn't apply that kind of presumption when you're talking about an earlier more general statute and a later more specific statute. In fact, in that situation, the Court's general rule is that the later more specific statute trumps the earlier more general one. And I don't think there's any reason to carve 1331 out, as venerable as it is.",
  "I can't cite you another example. The Shoshone case is another anomaly. It's a little bit different. But I think -- I think the Court should give credit to what Congress did here. And if you look at the right of action, it's distinct in three different ways. First, Congress only spoke of bringing suits in State courts. Petitioner hasn't identified another Federal cause of action where Congress has done -- done that. Second, Congress modified the entire right of action based on \"and otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of the court of a State.\" Under the rules of grammar, there's no question that that clause modifies the \"may,\" not anything else that follows in the statute. And the third way it's distinct, Justice Ginsburg, is that Congress spoke of the limitations on State courts and State laws before it even expressed the violation. In the typical way that Congress expresses a private right of action -- and I've looked at a lot of them in the last few days -- Congress talks about the violation, and then it at times provides as a descriptive matter where it could be brought. Here, in the first --",
  "Well, I think there's separate provisions that allow the State attorneys general to go into Federal court, and the FCC has its own enforcement authority. They aren't conditioned by this limitation. We're talking about this private right of action.",
  "I think the basic elements of the cause of action are going to be the same, but State law can limit the availability of that cause of action, the ability to bring it in a court. And under -- for example, by a class action rule or just saying you can't bring those claims at all or statute of limitations. Petitioner's view is that a plaintiff can circumvent those limitations altogether, authorized by Congress in the most important clause of this private right of action, simply go into Federal court and be gone with those limitations.",
  "Well, it created a public Federal right. Congress all the time creates Federal legal protections --",
  "-- but it doesn't give private right of actions.",
  "And there's no question that they would have a Federal right. And, of course, this -- this private right of action is distinct. My point is only it's not unusual for Congress to create a Federal right and not provide a private right of action; for example, under the provision in Gonzaga v. Doe --",
  "Well, it wouldn't --",
  "I think that -- I would point you to the statutory findings and, if you thought it appropriate, look at Senator Hollings' statement as well. And the reason why it makes sense is Congress is dealing with a situation that, when it acted, the vast majority of States had passed laws to allow consumers to deal with this problem at the State level. They identified this interstitial void that Your Honor spoke about in your opinion on the Second Circuit, and Congress acted to close that enforcement loophole to authorize States to allow consumers to go after interstate calls.",
  "I've struggled over that, too, Justice Ginsburg, but the one thing I can say is that Congress perceived that enforcement gap that's identified in the statutory findings reproduced in the addendum here. And Congress, you would presume, acted to fill the gap that it saw, and it did this by keeping it at the State level, keeping in mind that we're talking about something with an enormous potential for volumes of claims.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, ultimately, all of the Federal circuits that have grappled with this problem have concluded that recognizing diversity jurisdiction isn't fundamentally incompatible with saying there's no Federal question jurisdiction, for a couple of reasons.",
  "For two reasons, Justice Breyer.",
  "The first is amount in controversy. Diversity has an amount in controversy requirement of $75,000, which makes it more likely, where a plaintiff has that, it would be in a situation where it would incur the costs of an attorney and other expenses to go into Federal court. Federal question has no amount in controversy after --",
  "Exactly, and the amount in controversy checks that. The second reason is that, to the extent that Congress created this unique Federal right and intended it to behave like State laws, as Judge Calabresi described it on the Second Circuit, then it's more natural to think of diversity jurisdiction allowing the Federal courts to entertain what is in effect a State cause of action than it would be for Federal question jurisdiction where you have the anomalous situation of someone going into Federal court and saying I'm not bound by the State law limitations, for example, the limitation on the class action, because I can bring this Federal private right of action under Federal question for $500 wherever it is. I mean --",
  "We would put that in the same category of diversity, which is to say -- I mean, ultimately, I think it -- particularly if you look at this as the private right of action, Congress did not express a private right of action for someone to go into Federal court here. If this Court looked at it through the lens of its private right of action jurisprudence, the Court would say, I would think, you did not confer a private right of action to go into Federal court in the unique way that you express it here. If the question was, if this private right of action said you can sue an in-State company and a plaintiff came here saying, well, it says in-State but they didn't say you can't sue an out-of-State, this Court would say, no, Congress said in-State; we -- that's the private right of action it created.",
  "And I think on that -- I mean, first, it makes sense that they would authorize Federal jurisdiction for the State attorney generals' actions because they authorized the FCC to intervene there. It also makes sense that they said \"exclusive\" there because there they were dealing with the constitutional presumption that State courts have concurrent jurisdiction unless Congress affirmatively says they don't. This Court had decided Tafflin a year earlier. And so, it -- to give Congress its due, it would make sense if you presume they're aware of this Court's decisions, that it would say \"exclusive\" there. The constitutional --",
  "But we're not.",
  "We're certainly not arguing for a distinction between diversity and Federal question. And ultimately, if pushed, we would take the position that because Congress was clear it wasn't authorizing suit in Federal court, we think diversity should go, too. My response to Justice Breyer was that it -- it's a closer call because of the -- the amount in controversy and the extent to which Congress created a right --",
  "I think it would be governed by Federal law. I think to the extent there's a --",
  "No, because the -- the public right of action isn't conditioned the same way that the private right of action is. And --",
  "If you look at the public right of action, it's not --",
  "Right. The public right of action isn't brought under (b)(3), which is a private right of action. And the anomalies arise when you think of allowing these claims in Federal court --",
  "The State law limitations apply to the private right of action. The Congress didn't say, here's the Federal --",
  "But, Your Honor, it's only weird if you say they can bring the private right of action in Federal court. If you say that Congress meant these to be limited to State court, it makes perfect sense. Congress was making clear: States, you have authority to address this problem; you can address it under your own law and rules of court.",
  "And if Congress has to say \"exclusive,\" then we lose. I'm not arguing otherwise. But I think our position is, is what Congress did here was unmistakably different and clear enough. And the flip side of what you've just said is to say that Congress meant nothing when it went out of its way to create what all agree is an extraordinarily unique private right of action.",
  "And if Congress had intended that, Your Honor, I think the more natural way for it to have said would -- would have been something like, in an action brought in State court, it may be limited by the laws or rules of that court. Here Congress cabined the entire right of action: \"may\" comma -- subordinate clause which modifies the \"may.\" And there's just -- in any other case, I think, Your Honor, the Court would read the \"if otherwise permitted\" clause as modifying the \"may\" and, therefore, the entire right of action.",
  "I think --",
  "I think in the Shoshone case Congress created a right of action whose content was -- was supplied by State law. So --",
  "The Shoshone Mining case. It's -- it's cited in our brief.",
  "No --",
  "No, but we're not saying that this case is on fours with that case, but I think it's an example where State law would fill the content of the Federal right.",
  "Well, and Congress didn't just say \"procedure,\" it said \"laws or rules of court of the State.\"",
  "It would be the general 4-year Federal statute of limitations. I mean, the way --",
  "But it's not odd if you give effect to the language of (b)(3), which in a sense says we're going to leave this up to the States. Congress contemplated through this language that there could be 50 different rules about how private TCPA claims would be brought in State court. I think that's undisputed. The question is whether or not you -- plaintiffs can just say I want out of that and go into Federal court, and conversely whether a defendant can remove any claim brought in State court --",
  "-- into Federal court.",
  "Right.",
  "And our position is ultimately both are at issue. Certainly, the focus of this case has been on the jurisdictional question, which is the 12(b)(1). But if the Court thinks that there's Federal jurisdiction, then it should say the cause of action fails under 12(b)(6) because both arguments are based on the same exact statutory language. This Court has recognized, for example, in the Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals case, that the availability of a private right of action intersects with jurisdiction. The Court recognized the same point in the National Passengers Association case, 414 U.S. 453.",
  "We don't dispute that, Your Honor.",
  "Unless a later-enacted statute precludes that rule. And here the later-enacted statute doesn't win it --",
  "The later-enacted statute creates the cause of action. Federal -- 1331 doesn't create a cause of action. It's jurisdictional only. They need to have a cause of action.",
  "Unless it has been displaced by a later-enacted provision. And I --",
  "I don't have an example in 1331. I have do have section 1983, which I think is a perfect parallel, because there you've got a venerable, general provision, section 1983, which is actually older than 1331, and the question comes along from time to time whether a later-enacted Federal right can be enforced through 1983. And the Court, in that context, says although we generally presume that you can go through 1983, if there's a later-enacted specific enforcement mechanism, we give the facts of that --",
  "I think, if you look at the City of Rancho Palos Verdes case, which I would encourage you to look at, I think it doesn't have to be nearly as specific as my friend is claiming. I think you look at all signposts of congressional intent. Here you've got the language which is unmistakably distinctive. The State-law, State-court-focused. You've got a structure of an act where Congress, when it wants concurrent jurisdiction or Federal jurisdiction, it says so. It provides the rules for venue and what not. You've got legislative statutory findings indicating that Congress both was aware of the vast volumes of calls which could create potential claims, wanting to address a particular problem of an enforcement gap at the State level. And then if you choose to look at it, you've got the legislative history of the sponsor of this very unusual provision saying --",
  "Yes, and we're not -- I mean, the question is whether or not that assumption should be displaced here, and we're saying that Congress's expressions of intent displace it here. And, again, I think if Petitioner --",
  "And I think that's why the parallel seems apt to us here. You -- instead of dealing with Congress displacing case -- State court jurisdiction with constitutional presumption, you have an earlier-enacted Federal statute, 1331, and the later-enacted statute, the TCPA private right of action here.",
  "But I think this Court has a more generous attitude toward section 1983. And I think in your opinion in the Rancho Palos Verdes case, you spoke of a rebuttable presumption that Congress doesn't mean to -- to displace section 1983, but yet you found it there because of a specific enforcement mechanism. I think the enforcement mechanism here is much more specific and meaningful than even the one in the Rancho Palos Verdes --",
  "It did not --",
  "It did not --",
  "We totally agree, but I think the important point from our perspective is either Congress meant what it said, and this Court should give effect to what it said in its very distinct and unusual way, or it's rendered, you know, largely meaningless, except in the most generalized sense, because if Petitioner's right, you can bring a claim in State or Federal court. The claim that you bring in Federal court is in no way limited -- limited by the laws or rules of a State court. And all of the stuff that Congress said about the State courts and the State-law-focused language at the very beginning of its cause of action is meaningless, because Congress didn't have to say any of this to authorize people to go into State court under concurrent jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution. And our position is, is that this Court should give effect to the words in the private right of action, distinct as it is, that Congress created, and hold that Congress did not intend for plaintiffs to be able to bring -- to circumvent these limitations by going into Federal court under 1331.",
  "Well, I probably wasn't clear enough, Justice Sotomayor. Our position is that ultimately there is no Federal question jurisdiction; that although it arises under 1331, the specific provision here was never intended to be enforced through 1331 and, instead, was only authorizing State courts.",
  "No, I don't think the State could actually alter what Congress said. It can -- it can alter, as Congress said, the ability to bring a right of action. Now, I do think this Court could affirm --",
  "And in that case, a private citizen would go to a State attorney general and say bring this action on behalf, or go to the FCC and bring an enforcement action. There are public rights -- public ways to enforce that. Just to be clear, we think this Court could affirm on the alternative ground of 12(b)(6), that there is Federal question jurisdiction, but this private right of action doesn't confer a right to go into -- into Federal court. My friend has said that that position has been waived. Under 12(h) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we haven't waived 12(b)(6); we just haven't asserted yet. It's clear that Federal courts can convert 12(b)(1) motions into 12(b)(6) motions, and there'd be no reason for this Court to remand simply for us to assert a 12(b)(6) -- put a 12(b)(6) label on the same position that we would be back before the courts arguing, transforming judicial review into something close to a ping-pong game.",
  "No, it would be a claim arising under Federal law without a private right to bring it in Federal court. And it would be odd, Your Honor, and our position -- we agree with our friends -- that this is an odd statutory provision. We ask this Court to give effect to its language, which both sides agree is odd but, we think, points to the conclusion that Congress meant for these claims to be brought in State court and not in Federal court under Federal question jurisdiction.",
  "But I think that that deprives -- yes, it's odd, but it's odd in a way that one must presume that Congress actually meant what -- what it was doing in several different ways here. I think it gets to a point where you just can't presume that Congress didn't mean the impact of its words here. So, we would urge this Court to give effect to them.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about who owns the riverbeds underlying the rivers at issue. It's not about flood lands; it's about the riverbeds. And under this Court's precedents, it's settled that title to the riverbeds conveyed to the State under the Constitution if they are navigable. It's been understood in Montana for more than a century that these rivers are navigable. The rivers were meandered as navigable. PPL's deeds -- and this is at page 172 of the appendix to the opposition brief -- specifically exclude the riverbeds. The test for navigability that this Court has applied for 140 years, going back to The Montello and The Daniel Ball, is whether the river served as a continuous highway of commerce. In The Montello, the Court recognized the fact that few of the nation's great rivers did not include some, quote, \"serious interruptions to uninterrupted navigation.\" And the -- and the Court's answer to that geographic fact was not to say then let's carve out the interruptions and say those aren't navigable. The Court's answer was to say unbroken navigation is not required to establish navigability.",
  "Under this Court's precedents --",
  "-- you have to show that the commerce traveled along the river under the customary modes of trade and travel.",
  "If you take the Great Falls, the history of portage from 1864 to 1868 was lively commerce of millions of dollars, in today's value, billions of dollars of gold, from Helena to Fort Benton back east. This is covered in detail by the Solicitor General briefs that we've appended here.",
  "The question presented is whether the Montana Supreme Court or whether a court -- a court -- what the constitutional test would be for a court in this situation. It's not even limited to the Montana Supreme Court here. It presents a legal question. With respect to summary judgment, the problem for PPL is not that it didn't present enough paper; the problem is, is it litigated the case under a wrong legal theory. It litigated the case that the -- that the Missouri, for example, was not navigable because you couldn't take a boat down the falls. This Court's precedents for more than 140 years asked the question of whether the river served as a continuous highway of commerce. We presented evidence, summarized --",
  "Your Honor, PPL recognizes that The Daniel Ball supplies the test for navigability for title. This Court recognized that in the Utah case, the vanguard title case that they hold out. So, the only question is, did The Montello apply The Daniel Ball test or did it apply something else? And the first paragraph of the Court's decision in The Montello said it applied The Daniel Ball test. Courts -- this Court and lower courts for more than a century have understood The Daniel Ball and The Montello to supply the test for navigability of title. What they're asking this Court to do is upend more than 140 years of precedent. And the amicus brief filed by the States in this case gives -- gives the Court a sense of the disruption that this would cause.",
  "The reason for the rule was the public trust doctrine which -- which sought to keep these rivers free for the public to use for navigation, for fishing, and for other uses. And this court's precedents --",
  "Well, it gets back to the -- the public trust doctrine, Your Honor. Fishing doesn't have -- fishing is a purpose of the public trust doctrine, which is why it was understood --",
  "Because the navigable rivers were the arteries of commerce in this country, and at the time of the founding, it was understood -- and this gets to the core issue of federalism in this case -- that the States ought to be the ones that control the navigable rivers --",
  "-- not the Federal Government.",
  "I think this gets back to the question of whether you can just chop up the rivers into navigable and nonnavigable bits. And we're talking -- this Court, Justice O'Connor observed in her dissent in the Phillips Petroleum case that navigability wasn't decided inch by inch. What the other side is asking you to adopt here is a test of navigability that's at least mile by mile, if not acre by acre, which is completely different than this Court has ever assessed navigability.",
  "What -- what the Framers were concerned about -- and this is also reflected in the Northwest Ordinance 2 -- was ensuring that the navigable rivers, the major arteries of commerce in this country, remained open. And so, they -- they applied a much more -- much broader conception of navigability than is suggested --",
  "And so, that was the argument --",
  "And so, that was the argument that the district court adopted in The Montello case, and this Court emphatically rejected it. And by the way, the portage in The Montello case was 5 miles long. That's reflected in the -- the record in that case before this Court.",
  "No, it's not.",
  "I think the relevant stretch or segmentation is really a litigation term. Our position is this Court's test: continuous highway of commerce. You would take the part of the river at issue in a case, take that part and look -- ask the question, was that part of a continuous highway of commerce or not? So, if you found yourself in Cataract Canyon in the Utah case, you'd ask yourself that question, and you would say, no, this is not part of a continuous highway of commerce, because no one argued either that the canyon was portaged or that goods were traveling down the Colorado River through the canyon and out into Arizona. If you ask yourself that question in this case, along the Great Falls, you would say yes, because the evidence was unrebutted that millions of dollars of gold was traveled up from Helena to Fort Benton along the -- the Missouri River with the aid of a portage and that that was unquestionably a highway of commerce. What they're asking this Court to do is chop rivers up into navigable and nonnavigable pieces. How would that impact the public trust doctrine? The -- the brief filed by the National --",
  "The United States has sided completely with Montana. The answer it gives for what is a short interruption in its brief is an interruption that doesn't warrant separate consideration. That's on page 17 of its brief. That's the epitome of a circular test, and --",
  "I think if -- if you applied the proper test here, you would conclude that the river --",
  "I think what -- the nonnavigable parts --",
  "-- didn't transfer under the equal footing doctrine. Oftentimes, those were subject to separate conveyances. So, they might come into private property. I think --",
  "Right.",
  "And what was --",
  "Yes, I think that's right.",
  "And what was critically important to the -- to the Framers was that the States would have control over the navigable waterways. This Court has described that as an essential attribute of State sovereignty.",
  "Well, owner -- the ownership -- along with ownership goes the right to control whether facilities can be built on them, bridges or pipelines. It goes -- along with that goes the rights to mineral leases --",
  "Right.",
  "I think that the test that we're articulating is The Daniel Ball and The Montello test -- continuous highway test. I think with respect to the riverbeds, it's always been understood that with control of the riverbeds along navigable waters, States have a right to control fishing and navigation and other aspects.",
  "Well, the --",
  "There's certainly --",
  "This case has recognized always that The Daniel Ball and The Montello is the test for navigability for title as well as admiralty. It has never drawn the kind of distinction that PPL and the United States ask you to draw here.",
  "Not -- not of this Court.",
  "And the lower courts have relied upon The Daniel Ball and The Montello in plenty of circumstances adjudicating title. I think the Court has to think about what the world would look like if the Court adopted PPL and the United States' views.",
  "Again --",
  "PPL's deeds --",
  "Your Honor, PPL's deeds specifically exclude the riverbeds at issue in this case. So, PPL can have no claim to those lands and, in fact, in its supplemental brief says that the United States owns the lands. We're not talking about the flood lands here; we're talking about the -- between the low-water marks. Those lands were surveyed and meandered at statehood to show that they did not convey to private parties. Montana courts have recognized for more than a century that these waters are not navigable. Everybody understood that they were navigable. The reason why this issue only arises now is because of a 1999 decision of the Montana Supreme Court that said that the State -- made clear that the State had a fiduciary obligation to seek compensation for the use of the riverbeds. So, that -- that then teed up the question of whether the State could actually charge rent for the riverbeds. The State in this case --",
  "They're not using the riverbeds, Your Honor. The reason why the facilities here are using the riverbeds is because they actually sit on it. There are other instances where private landowners have easements and leases, like mineral leases with the State, under the -- because of the accepted understanding that the State does own those lands. And this is not at all unusual. If you look at the State's brief, Washington and Oregon have thousands of these types of permits because it's established that if the water is navigable, then the State owns the riverbeds, and there are consequences that flow over this. But this really isn't a fight between the State and the private landowners. It's -- it's a fight between the State and the United States, because if this case --",
  "No, I think there are other landowners who have asserted -- who want rights to use -- to get minerals along rivers or have piers or bridges, and in those situations, they get permits from the State to use it. But I think what's going to happen is, if this Court declares that every mile or so that is an interruption is nonnavigable, then title is going to transfer to the United States because, under this Court's precedent in Utah, the Court held that if waters were not navigable, the United States would have --",
  "A mile stretch?",
  "Well --",
  "There are two areas at issue here: the Great Falls stretch --",
  "So, the test would be any non-de minimis interruption. That's the one that PPL and the United States are urging here. There are thousands of dams in the country. There's the Niagara Falls, which for more than a century, it's been understood that the State owns it, not because it's an international boundary; that's a line plucked out of a decision. Read the decision --",
  "The best evidence I think we have about this question of the implications comes from the brief filed by 26 States, which explains that if this Court adopts the kind of segmentation approach, any interruption that is -- that is not de minimis has to be carved out, it's going to wreak havoc in States across the country, especially in the western States. Again, getting back to --",
  "I'm not referring to specific leases on that. I'm talking about things like public access for fishing, for example. The States have cited the Steelheader case in Oregon. And this is what's going to happen: Either the public -- private landowners are going to claim people coming along my banks to fish, they don't have access to these waters. If they were navigable -- understood as navigable waters owned by the State, it's clear that they had would have access. There's going to be clashes. There's going to be --",
  "I think -- what this Court has said is if it's not navigable, the United States has it. But there would be the question --",
  "The question is whether there'd be a separate conveyance from the United States. There's certainly going to be plenty of private landowners, I think, who are going to claim private ownership. So, there is going to be some sorting out to do.",
  "Well, no. They're -- if -- if the river is not navigable, then the lands didn't convey under the equal footing doctrine.",
  "There'd be a separate question of whether they conveyed by some other Federal patent, land patent, or the like. And there are -- certainly are plenty of those. But I think what's clear is --",
  "Well, the United States is here. It has given its views. It's true that it didn't participate below, and that is a little bit unusual. What's weird is that the United States has never actually asserted ownership to the riverbeds in this case. But I think --",
  "Not with respect to the riverbeds. There's a statement in the brief that suggests that they pay rent. That's with respect to the upland, the flooded lands, for example, along the reservoir. The United States has never charged rent for the use of the riverbeds themselves between the low-water marks.",
  "I mean, certainly --",
  "There are two -- well, there's three distinctions between the test for title --",
  "-- and the test for regulatory purposes --",
  "-- none of which bear on the dispute in this case. One is for title. You look at the time of statehood. You don't look at the river at a later time. The next is, is that, for purposes of title, you look at the river in its natural state. You don't look at improvements. And the third is, for purposes of title, the kind of commerce you consider is actually more expansive than the type you could consider for regulatory purposes. This case, the focus has been on the rivers at the time of statehood, their use as highways of commerce without improvements, which is in the heartland of the test for title for navigability under The Daniel Ball and The Montello. None of the distinctions that this Court has ever recognized would bear on this, nor would it make any sense, I think, to say that the rule that we identified in The Montello as -- that has -- for more than a century, has been established as the test for title for navigability somehow has to be applied differently in this case in a way that would require breaking up the rivers. And I think --",
  "No, I think the United States' position is say they're navigable for Federal purposes but not for State purposes. And I think -- and they've taken what I think is a pretty remarkable position. If you look at the briefs that we've appended to our brief, the United States' in the Montana Power Company case, the United States is saying that the very same stretch of the Missouri along the Great Falls is navigable because it served as a continuous highway of commerce, and the falls did not prevent the river from being used as a continuous highway; and, therefore, it's navigable under The Montello and The Daniel Ball, which is the theory that they recognize. And now they're here saying, well, that was only for regulatory purposes, not for title purposes. But it's the same test in both cases, and that's the test that the nation has understood for more than 50 years.",
  "And so, this Court has always recognized the States' authority to make those decisions as an essential attribute of their sovereignty. And that's why the States --",
  "No, when they -- when they own the land under the river, that -- the ability to control access along those rivers -- river and fishing and the like is an essential attribute of State sovereignty. So, just saying that, well, the Federal Government and the State can regulate together is, I think, an important intrusion on State sovereignty as this Court has always understood under the equal footing doctrine and the public trust doctrine. And you also have the problem of competing regulation of these rivers when you go from mile to mile, interruption to interruption, potentially thousands along rivers. And that's laid out in the brief by the environmental groups here, the National Wildlife Foundation and Trout Unlimited and other groups, that talk about the problems with fragmented regulatory jurisdiction. And you also get into the question of public access for fishing, too. The rivers are used for commerce, but the public trust doctrine was always used to protect access to rivers for fishing, too. And so, if you look at a place like the Great Falls or the Thompson Falls, these are among the most sought-after fishing rivers in the world.",
  "Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well --",
  "And so, every time this Court has said that the ability to do that is an essential attribute of sovereignty, it must not have meant it because the United States could do it, too. I mean, it is important to the States because having the sovereign capacity over those riverbeds as navigable waters under the public trust doctrine is critical to the States' authority.",
  "And -- and I think it gets back to the public trust doctrine, the equal footing doctrine, what this Court has said in the Utah case and other cases about the role of States in regulating navigable rivers and owning title to the riverbeds underlying those rivers.",
  "Well, there was some evidence of use by fur trappers and the like. It was not extensive because this area was relatively sparse. I think --",
  "Well, and this Court has recognized that things like pirogues and bateaux were sufficient to establish the continuous highway of commerce. I think the point on the Madison is the susceptibility for use as a navigable river. And the main point that we made below is that where their own expert recognized that PPL's dams had impeded the flow of water over of the river, that if those dams impede the flow of water over the river but yet today there are thousands of drift boats similar to the boats that would have used it at the time of statehood, then it's good evidence that it was susceptible for use. But I think the Madison is in a different category than the Missouri and the Clark Fork. I do want to answer the question about the 17 miles. The Desplaines River in the Economy Light case, there was an 18-mile portage. That's made clear at page 18a of our addendum, where the Government recognized that. In Montello, it was a 5-mile portage. In -- there are other examples of portages.",
  "I -- I think that's right. It's in the testimony in that decision. But, certainly, 17 miles -- and the other thing is, is that in the amicus brief, on page 27 of the Tubbs brief, she suggests that the actual portage before statehood was only 8 miles. I don't think you could draw a constitutional line between 5, 7, or even 10 miles and 17 miles. We think the line the Constitution draws is whether -- asks whether the river was -- served as a continuous highway of commerce, notwithstanding any interruption along that way.",
  "But it's not even the rule that PPL was asking for, because they acknowledge that some interruptions would be navigable. They call it \"non-de minimis.\" It's not clear how you get there. If you go between the low-water marks, there's only a part of the way that you could actually bring a boat up, but, yet, it's established that the State owns the entire riverbeds between low-water mark to low-water mark. After traversing the Missouri and the very falls at issue in this case, Meriwether Lewis described that he didn't think the world could furnish a finer example of a navigable river through a mountainous country than the Missouri. That assessment made by the President's own agent, charged with assessing the suitability of the Missouri for commerce, was consistent with more than 140 years of this precedent --",
  "Your Honor, it was an 11-day portage. At the time of statehood, it was a 1-day portage. I think what's significant is he wrote it after that portage. And yet, he recognized there was not a finer example of a navigable river through mountainous country. That assessment was consistent with this Court's precedents for more than 140 years. It's consistent with the actual use of the Missouri as a continuous highway of commerce along the very stretch at issue here. We don't believe that PPL or the United States has provided a legal reason for this Court to overturn the judgment of the Montana Supreme Court that the Missouri or the other rivers at issue in this case are navigable.",
  "Your Honor, our position is the one that the Court reached in Colony, which is that an overstatement of basis is not an omission from gross income. What the Court held in Colony was that an omission -- an omission from gross income is where you leave out a specific taxable item or receipt. We think the court of appeals got it right when it concluded that the statute of limitations on the statute -- on the tax assessments at issue expired in 2003 and rejected the IRS's extraordinary efforts to avoid that result by discombobulating this Court's decision in Colony and by seeking to retroactively reopen and extend the statute of limitations. What the Government relies on principally is the addition of subparagraph (i) in the code, and that was added in 1954, before the Court's decision in 1958. And I'd like to make a few points about subparagraph (i) because I think it's the crux of the Government's position. The first is just the anomaly of their argument, that by adding this subparagraph -- and it's on page 1a of the addendum to the red brief -- which explicates the definition of \"gross income\" in one specific context, the sale -- the cost of goods or services by a trade or business, Congress meant to change the general rule -- and that's what it called it, the \"general rule\" -- in subsection (A).",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think that's probably right. It thought it was agreeing with the taxpayer side of the circuit split. There's legislative history indicating that it also thought it was addressing the computational rule of how to get gross income, which factors into the 25 percent trigger. I think what maybe is most important is that this Court in Colony looked at the 1954 amendments at the suggestion of the government and concluded that its decision was consistent with the 1954 amendments. That's in the last line of the decision.",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't think so, Your Honor. First of all, you're right, he referred to the whole 6501(e)(1)(A), which includes both subsections. It's not clear that he was identifying subparagraph (i). He could have well been referring to subparagraph (ii), along the lines of what my friend just spelled out, because much of the Colony decision was based on addressing the situation where the -- where the IRS is at a special disadvantage because something's been left out entirely. And that really kind of gets to the heart of subparagraph (ii). But the anomaly of the Government's construction here today is that Colony would come out differently, because Colony doesn't involve a taxpayer involved in the sale of goods or service; it involved a taxpayer in the sale of real property. So, even though this Court in Colony said - -",
  "Your Honor, the sale of real property, whether in parcels or otherwise, has always been treated differently than the sale of -- costs of goods or services, which really is a term of art. And if you go back at Colony, you can see that the Court referred to basis, referred to property, and that's precisely the way that the parties did in their brief. The Solicitor General in its own brief framed the question presented as overstatement of basis in the sale of property. That's the situation that we have here today. The subparagraph (i) they're referring to is addressed to the specific situation of a trade or business involved in the sale of costs of goods or services - -",
  "-- which is different.",
  "Your Honor, the Uptegrove case did, the Third Circuit case. But they involved -- the fact is they involved both the sale of property and the sale of goods and services. And at that time, no one was drawing this bright-line distinction.",
  "It did do that. There was one reason for Congress to address that specific situation, in that there was a regulation that had defined \"gross income\" differently. It's appended at the end of our brief, and it was discussed in Uptegrove. So, there was a reason to single that out. But I think the more - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think it's the opposite, if I understand your question, which is that taxpayers typically put more information which is going to put the IRS on notice when you're dealing with basis and the sale of property as opposed to the costs of goods and services, which involve many transactions and you're dealing with them in the aggregate. When you're dealing with the sale of property, as in Colony and here, you're dealing with specific disclosures as to the basis. Here, if you look on page 151 of the JA, it lays out the adjustment in the basis. And the same was true in Colony. And so, to the extent that there's a distinction there, I think it cuts in favor of the taxpayer. The problem for the Government is all of the amendments in 1954 were pro-taxpayer amendments as relevant here; and yet, the Government's conclusion is that by adding this subsection addressing the specific situation, it meant to take away the general rule in a way that hurt taxpayers. It's inconsistent with what this Court said in Colony because the Court - -",
  "Your Honor, everyone agrees it's not redundant, even the Government, because what it does is, at a minimum, it has a computational effect of affecting the 25 percent trigger. The amount to get to the trigger has to be - -",
  "Well, it's not clear, Justice Kagan. The -- the Federal Circuit in the Salman Ranch case cited legislative history that suggested it was trying to achieve just that result. But I think the broader point I would make is it's not at all uncommon for Congress to act to provide an answer to a specific situation that had come up by explicating it. And yet, one doesn't conclude that, in doing that, it's intended to overstate -- override the entire general rule that's stated, particularly where it doesn't touch the language that's the subject of the general rule. Congress didn't in any way touch the phrase interpreted in Colony, \"omission from gross income.\" And the anomaly gets even greater if you look at Congress's actions after Colony. In 1965, Congress amended the heading. Now, granted it's only a heading, but it amended it, the heading to the subsection, to mean \"Substantial omission of items,\" which is perfectly consistent with Colony's interpretation, directly contrary to the Government's interpretation. In 1982, Congress re-enacted the same language, \"omission from gross income,\" found in the provision at issue in Colony in 26 U.S.C. 6229, which is the provision for partnerships. And yet, it omitted the subparagraph (i) that the Government relies upon as the transformative provision narrowing the general rule. And so, why on earth would -- would Congress omit that subparagraph if it did the transformative work that the Government suggests? The Government doesn't have a response except to say that they have to be interpreted the same way, which makes no sense given the emphasis it's placing on subparagraph (i). I think the answer is, is subparagraph (i) just doesn't have and was never intended to have the transformative effect that the Government suggests. Whatever -- we can talk about what the Court meant in Colony, but I do think that it's critically important that Colony is entitled to full stare decisis effect. In fact, it's stare decisis coupled with Congressional re-enactment. The Government describes the world after Colony, but the fact is, if you go back and look, no one thought that Colony was just a ship passing the night that had only retrospective significance. Everybody, including the IRS, appreciated that Colony was a landmark decision.",
  "I think what my response would be first as to Phinney, the Fifth Circuit has clarified that the Government's construction of Phinney is just wrong. Phinney was consistent with the Colony rule. It dealt with a particular application of it.",
  "If I could make one point on Phinney, and then I'll address the other cases. I would ask you to look at the Solicitor General's opposition brief in Phinney, which recognized that Colony was the governing principle. One would think that the Government thought that Colony was just a shot in time, had no ongoing significance, they would have said that in the opposition brief in Phinney. The Solicitor General accepted Colony as the governing rule, as everyone did. As to the cases, I think it's fair to say that, no, we can't point to a case in the 1950s, '60s, or '70s where they specifically confronted the question before the Court today. But what I -- what I -- what I can say is look at the cases that we cite in our brief, and all of those cases discuss this Court's opinion in Colony as if it continues to have lasting effect on the interpretation of the \"omits from gross income.\" And yet, in the Government's -- the IRS's own internal documents -- we cite two, 1976 and 2000 -- where the IRS internally is treating Colony as a landmark decision which controls on a current going-forward basis.",
  "Well, I don't know how you would put a percentage on -- on, in effect, whether Colony was a \"step one\" case or not. I mean - -",
  "I think so. I mean, I think, you know, the IRS's actions here really put taxpayers in an extraordinary situation. I mean, they're taking a decision of this Court that says an overstatement of basis -- no, that's not an omission of gross income. They're relying on the 1954 amendments to get around that. Look at the Colony decision. The Colony decision says the 1954 amendments -- no, this decision is perfectly consistent with those. And here comes the Government - -",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the government in Colony argued that the 1954 amendments compelled its interpretation, which was the one that the Court rejected. If -- if this Court -- this Court must have considered that argument in reaching the opposite conclusion. I think -- I think you're right, that it's fair to describe that language as dictum. But this Court has many times said that even if something is dictum, if it explicates the Court -- Court's holding, the lower courts and this Court would give it great weight in its - -",
  "I think that the prefatory language there -- I think -- I think you're right. That's a fair characterization. But, ultimately, what the Court said was its holding was in harmony with the new statute. And you can't reach that conclusion if you agree with the Government's interpretation.",
  "I don't think it has to be (i), Your Honor. I think it could be subsection (ii). We don't know which one he was referring to. And the reason why it could be subsection (ii) is because a great deal of the Court's analysis dealt with the -- the question whether the Commissioner was at a disadvantage. I would like to address the rationale in Colony. My friend has referred - -",
  "Well, we do disagree with it - - I mean, I certainly accept the Brand X part of that. What we disagree with is that (a) the IRS has the authority to retroactively apply an interpretation of a statute, which gets to the meaning of 7805(b)(1); and (b) whether or not the regulation in this case on its face applies it retroactively. But I accept - -",
  "Well, they don't have any leeway to overturn this Court's decision if that decision specifically addressed the question. And that's the language of Chevron, and as it turns - -",
  "Brand X says that - -",
  "I don't think so, for this reason: Because Colony -- at the beginning of the Court's decision, Justice Harlan in a gracious way, as the Chief suggested, pointed out that there could be some ambiguity in the text. But then he went on to apply the traditional tools of statutory construction.",
  "Well, I would -- I would think that Brand X refers back to Chevron and looks to the first step of Chevron. Brand -- what Brand X is looking to is whether or not -- it's really a step one or step two case. And on step one, Chevron looks to whether Congress has addressed the specific question presented. And if you look at the Court's decision in Colony, what Justice Harlan said was Congress was addressing itself to the specific situation where a taxpayer actually omitted some income receipt or accrual in his computation of gross income, and not - -",
  "Well, I would disagree with that, respectfully, Your Honor. I think the -- the holding of the Court -- and, again, it's entitled to stare decisis effect even if this Court might approach it differently today under different modes of statutory construction or otherwise. The holding of the Court was that Congress addressed the specific situation of whether an overstatement of basis was an omission from gross income, and the Court said no.",
  "He was employing the traditional tools of statutory construction, not just legislative history. He talked about the structure and purpose and the patent tax incongruities created by the government's position that an overstatement - -",
  "And that's a tool of statutory construction.",
  "Well, I think you would first look at the language of the regulation and see whether or not - -",
  "-- by its terms, it applies retroactively. This Court has made clear, it made clear in the Bowen case, that it's not retroactively unless there's a clear -- not retroactive unless there's a clear statement of retroactivity. And our position is, whatever else is true, that what the effective date provision says and the preamble says, it's just unclear about whether it's retroactive or not.",
  "Well, I - -",
  "I think it's retroactive in the worst way, for this reason: It at a minimum extinguishes an affirmative defense, the statute of limitations. This Court recognized that - -",
  "-- in the Hughes Aircraft case.",
  "Well, again, I mean, I think if you look at Landgraf and the cases talking about what is retroactive, this regulation here if it is applied retroactivity -- retroactively has the consequence this Court points to as the worst kind of retroactivity, which is extinguishing a valid defense in litigation and imposing new consequences for past actions. Hughes Aircraft recognizes that, as do the many courts of appeals that we've cited in our brief.",
  "Well - -",
  "And with all due respect, the law in 2003 when the statute of limitations expired was Colony. Even if the Court -- the agency had leeway to reinterpret it, it's changing the law. And the reason why it's doing that is it's doing it retrospectively. If you look at cases like Brand X, the theory is you have one interpretation, and then the agency going forward can have another one. In Brand X, the agency sought to apply its -- its new interpretation prospectively. Here, it's doing retrospectively, and when it does that, it changes the law. Maybe the concrete example of that is - -",
  "No, no - -",
  "My point on that - -",
  "No, my point on that was not that Colony controlled as a step one matter; it's that even if the Government is right that Colony just said this is one permissible reading, it was the law as the -- it was the permissible reading and the law until the government changed it. And the government didn't change it, try to change it, until 2009. The statute of limitations in this case expired in 2003. And so, if the government can adopt a new interpretation going forward, the question is, can it apply that interpretation retrospectively during the time frame in this case? And our position on that is that they certainly haven't done so unambiguously. And that -- as this Court said in St. Cyr, ambiguity means unambiguous prospectivity. And the Court also rejected - -",
  "No. No. I mean, the Court could -- I mean, certainly, we think you'd go first to the regulation. And it says \"was open.\" The preamble says, quote, this is \"not retroactive.\" It says it does not apply to open tax -- it only applies to open tax years, and not to reopen closed tax years. That's on 75 Federal Register 78,898. The government -- the way that the government gets there is to say that, well, even though we've passed the regulation long after the statute of limitations expired, because this case is pending, we can apply the new interpretation in determining whether the period closed long before we passed this regulation. At a minimum, that's -- that's a highly strained, if not convoluted, way to get around retroactivity. The way that the regulation's effective date and the preamble speaks about whether this is retroactive or not is really kind of nonsensical. And I think, at a minimum, the taxpayer ought to get the benefit of that, and this Court should say that if the government really wants to do -- take the extraordinary step that it's taken here to retroactively reopen a statute of limitations, it ought to do so in clear terms and not the convoluted way it's done here. We also think that the -- the IRS just lacked the authority to -- to legislate, to -- to pass a new interpretation on a statute retroactively. That gets to the meaning of 7805 and whether -- which says regulations relating to a statutory provision enacted after the '96 legislation which purported to strip the IRS of authority to act retroactively, whether the \"enacted after\" clause modifies \"regulation\" or \"statute.\" And we think, in context, it must modify \"regulation\" because there's two types of IRS regulations: regulations relating to statutes and regulations relating to IRS internal practices. And what Congress said is internal practices -- sure, you can operate retroactively when appropriate. With respect to new interpretations of statutes, not retroactive. That was landmark legislation as part of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.",
  "Not if you read \"regulations which relate to statutory provisions\" as -- as one thing. Regulations which relate to statutory provisions as opposed to regulations which relate to IRS provisions. And if you look at the legislative history, it's clear Congress was thinking about that distinction. If you do read that as one unit, then the \"enacted on or after\" obviously modifies that. I think you have to look at it in context and in light of the purpose of it, to get to that conclusion. But courts have adopted that conclusion. The American Council on -- American College of Tax Counsel lays out those cases. We think Judge Wilkinson got it right when he referred to the IRS's position in this case as \"an inversion of the universe\" and concluded that accepting IRS's position would stretch accepted administrative deference principles beyond their logical and constitutional limit. The IRS has the tools of its -- at its disposal to identify tax deficiency and to take appropriate action timely. Congress acted in 2004 to respond to the precise situation precipitating this case with Son-of-BOSS transactions. It amended 6501 not by changing the meaning of what's an omission from gross income, but by adopting a new provision which requires taxpayers involved in listed transactions like Son of BOSS to report many additional things, and saying that the statute of limitations did not apply at all if they didn't make those reporting requirements. So, going forward, the only impact of the Court's decision in this case is going to apply to everyday regular taxpayers who simply erroneously misstate or overstate the basis in the sale of a home or other assets. There's no reason to take the extraordinary steps that the IRS takes -- asks you to take in this case to reach that conclusion. We would ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, to reject the IRS's aggressive position on administrative power, and put an end to a case that the taxpayer should have never had to file in the first place.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For two overriding reasons, the -- the admissions plan before you is Constitutional under this Court's precedents.

  "That's right. And so that's the second point I was going to make, which is that the holistic admissions process at issue here is a necessary counterpart to the state's top 10 percent Law and works to systematic -- to offset the systematic drawbacks of that law in achieving an interest that is indisputably compelling, the university's interest in assembling a broadly diverse student body.

  "Well, the persons self-identify on that form.",
  "They do not, Your Honor. Every year people do not, and many of those applicants are admitted.",

  "This Court in Grutter, Your Honor -- and maybe the most important thing that was said during the first 30 minutes is, when given an opportunity to challenge Grutter, I understood my friend not to ask this Court to overrule it.

And so the University of Texas, in determining whether or not it had reached a critical mass, looked to the classroom, along with - -",

And what we concluded was that we simply - - if you looked at African Americans, for example, in 90 percent of the classes of the most common participatory size - -",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",

  "Your Honor, at the time - -",
  "Your Honor, I don't know the answer to that question, and let me try to explain why the university didn't look specifically at -- to that. Because at the time that the classroom diversity study was conducted, it was before the holistic admissions process at issue here was adopted in 2003-2004. And so that determination wouldn't have been as important as just finding out are African Americans or Hispanics, underrepresented minorities, present at the university in such numbers that we are not experiencing racial -- racial isolation in the classroom.",

  "To look to the same criteria of this Court in Grutter. This Court in Grutter specifically rejected the notion that you could come up with a fixed percentage. Now - -",
  "It certainly is contextual. I think it could vary, Your Honor. I think -- let me first say that my friends have -- throughout this litigation, not in this Court, asserted 20 percent as a critical mass, and that's lumping together different minority groups.",
  "We - -",
  "No, it's not at all.",
  "It's not at all. It's looking to -- to the educational benefits of diversity on campus, and I think we actually agree on what that means and what Grutter said it meant, in terms of - -",
  "Well, let me make a couple of points, Your Honor. First, if you just looked at the numbers -- we don't think it's the numbers, but if you looked at the numbers, after 7 years, racial diversity among these groups at the University of Texas had remained stagnant or worse. 2002, African American enrollment had actually dropped to 3 percent. That's one part of it. The other part of it is, if you look at the admissions under the top 10 percent plan, taking the - - the top 10 percent of a racially identifiable high school may get you diversity that looks okay on paper, but it doesn't guarantee you diversity that produces educational benefits on campus. And that's one of the considerations that the university took into account as well.",
  "Because, Your Honor, as is true for any group -- and the Harvard plan that this Court approved in Bakke specifically recognized this, you would want representatives and different viewpoints from individuals within the same -- the same racial group, just as you would from individuals outside of that.",
  "Well, anyone's experiences, where they grew up, the situations that they -- that they experience in their lives are going to affect their viewpoints.",
  "Your Honor, I think it directly impacts the educational benefits of diversity in this sense, that the minority candidate who has shown that - - that he or she has succeeded in an integrated environment, has shown leadership, community service, the other factors that we looked at in holistic review, is precisely the kind of candidate that's going to come -- come on campus, help to break down racial barriers, work across racial lines, dispel - - stereotypes - -",
  "1998, Your Honor. But, but with respect to your -- your factual point, that's absolutely wrong, Your Honor. If you look at the admissions data that we cite on page 34 of our brief, it shows the breakdown of applicants under the holistic plan and the percentage plan. And I don't think it's been seriously disputed in this -- this case to this point that, although the percentage plan certainly helps with minority admissions, by and large, the -- the minorities who are admitted tend to come from segregated, racially-identifiable schools.",
  "No, Your Honor. And let me - - let me answer the question. First of all, the example comes almost word for word from the Harvard plan that this Court approved in Grutter and that Justice Powell held out in Bakke.",
  "Because, Your Honor, our point is, is that we want minorities from different backgrounds. We go out of our way to recruit minorities from disadvantaged backgrounds.",
  "No, Your Honor, what counts is different experiences - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, what we want is different experiences that are going to -- that are going to come on campus - -",

  "It's -- it's members of the same racial group, Your Honor, bringing different experiences. And to say that -- if you took any racial group, if you -- if you had an admissions process that only tended to admit from a -- people from a particular background or perspective, you would want people from different perspectives.",

  "Well - -",
  "Your Honor, this question, of course, implicates Grutter itself. And, again, I understood my friend not to challenge that. They haven't challenged that diversity is a compelling interest at all. What -- what we look to, and we think that courts can review this determination, one, we look to feedback directly from students about racial isolation that they experience. Do they feel like spokespersons for their race.",
  "That's one of the things we looked at.",
  "Your Honor, that's one of the things that we looked at.",
  "Another is that we did look to enrollment data, which showed, for example, among African Americans, that African American enrollment at the University of Texas dropped to 3 percent in 2002 under the percentage plan.",
  "Well, I think we all agree that 3 percent is not a critical mass. It's -- it's well beyond that.",

That's on page 138 of the Joint Appendix. All of -- I think many key facts are undisputed here. It's undisputed that race is only a modest factor. It's undisputed that we're taking race into account only to consider individuals in their totality. This is a - -",
  "I think the standard you would apply is the one set forth in Grutter, and it comes from Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke, that you would look to whether or not the University reached an environment in which members of underrepresented minorities, African Americans and Hispanics, do not feel like spokespersons for their race, members -- an environment where cross-racial understanding is promoted, an environment where the benefit -- educational benefits of diversity are realized. And the reason why the University of Texas concluded that that environment was not met here, it laid out in several different information points that this Court can review and - -",

That's on page 138 of the Joint Appendix. Secondly, I'd point to the fact that African American and Hispanics' admissions did increase. African American admissions doubled from the period of 2002 and 2004. So this has had a real important impact on diversity at the University of Texas.",

The declaratory and injunctive release -- relief that this case began with, that request has fallen out, and that's undisputed. So the only thing that is live in this case is a request for monetary damages. That request is on page 79 of the Joint Appendix, and it's focused exclusively on a request for the return of admissions fees. And the reason why that is not enough to confer standing is that she would have paid the admissions fee no matter what policy the university admissions had.",
  "Texas v. Lesage says that that -- that injury is not sufficient in a backward-looking case like this, where you only have monetary damages. In Jacksonville and all the other cases, they involved forward-looking claims for declaratory injunctive reliefs where people who were going to go out and get contracts again. So Texas - -",
  "Your Honor, that is not an answer to jurisdiction for this reason: It's true that it is bifurcated in the sense that we could go and prove damages, but the complaint makes no doubt that the only request for monetary damages is a request for admissions fees. That -- it says that explicitly. And this Court has said that relief that does not remedy the injury suffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into Federal court. That is the very essence of the redressability requirement. That comes from the Seal Co. Case.",
  "It's the only - -",
  "And the reason why - -",
  "The reason why the payment of that fee doesn't redress the injury, Your Honor, is that she would have paid it even if Texas didn't consider race at all; and, therefore, the payment of the application fee back doesn't remedy the injury that she is complaining about.",
  "Your Honor, I don't have specific numbers. Obviously, the Ivy Leagues and Little Ivy Leagues that have filed amicus briefs are using it. And this Court recognized in Grutter that the best universities, many of the best universities in America, have been using these plans for 30 years or more.",
  "Your Honor, one of the things that the University of Texas does monitor is the racial climate on campus. It does that to improve the experience for all students on campus.",
  "I don't - -",
  "-- have a specific number of people, Your Honor, but it is -- it is an important part of improving the educational experience for all students at the University of Texas no matter what their race.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the three prior cases in which this Court has held that a dog sniff is not a search, this Court has emphasized that a dog sniff is unique, both in terms of the manner in which information is obtained and the nature of the information revealed. As to the latter point, this Court has emphasized that a drug detection dog reveals only the presence of contraband, and that no one has a legitimate expectation of privacy in that.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, in the Caballes case, the contraband wasn't visible before the dog alerted. In the home case, we're not saying that you don't have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the home. Of course, you do. The question is whether you have a legitimate expectation - -",
  "Not when it comes to contraband, Your Honor. And we think that the Kyllo case helps - -",
  "Because, Your Honor, when you have a search warrant and you go into a home, there's going to be a lot of private information that you're going to come across, even if your expectation is finding evidence of a crime.",
  "Your Honor, they could do that, just like the police could go door to door and then knock on the doors and hope that they will find out evidence of wrongdoing that way. But the two responses this Court has always pointed to is the restraint on resources and the check of community hostility. Here, the police were combatting a serious epidemic of grow houses, hundreds of houses each year that were a scourge to the community, not only in terms just of the drugs that they were growing - -",
  "I think that would be different, Your Honor. It would be -- and that's a way in which the house is different than a car. Homeowners can restrict access to people who come up to their front door by putting gates or a sign out front.",
  "That's right.",
  "They're not, Your Honor.",
  "Your Honor, first of all, I think that, as this case comes to the Court, the police were lawfully present at the front door. That was established by the courts below, and we don't think that they've challenged it here. That's at least true with respect to the police officer. The police officer could go up to the front door and knock and detect the smell of marijuana, just like Officer Pedraja did.",
  "Well, I think the way you would - -",
  "I think the way that you would answer that question, Your Honor, is, of course, there's a curtilage that extends around the house and protects, in which the homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy. It's well established, we think, going back to the common law, that there is an implied consent for people, visitors, salesmen, Girl Scouts, trick-or-treaters, to come up to your house and knock on the door - -",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, first of all, I think, if the Girl Scout or the salesman or the trick-or-treater brought up a dog with them, there would be complied consent for that too, at least as long as the dog was on a leash. I don't think the subjective - -",
  "No, that's right. But I don't think it changes the subjective purpose of why they brought the dog with them.",
  "Well, you can certainly put the \"No Dogs Allowed\" sign out front. And there, there would not be implied consent.",
  "Well, we start with the proposition that - -",
  "Well, certainly not in the apartment, Your Honor. This search took place, the dog walked up the same way that a salesman would and alerted at the front of the door. He didn't go in - -",
  "No, I think -- and certainly this is true in my neighborhood, Your Honor, is neighbors can bring their dog up on the leash when they knock on your front door, and I think that's true in most neighborhoods in America. Homeowners that don't like dogs and want them off their property have a way to combat that, and that's putting a fence around it to say, no dogs - -",
  "-- allowed.",
  "Well, they could, Your Honor. There are certainly houses that have that. But with respect to the question - -",
  "And I think -- Your Honor, I think the reason why that doesn't work here is that if you ask that question with respect to the officer, I think it's well settled or accepted that police officers can walk up the front path, absent a sign or something, knock on the door - -",
  "I don't think it would, Your Honor. I think that we're talking about going up there, knocking on the door. The police officer cannot just - -",
  "With binoculars - -",
  "If the purpose of the police officer here, for example, was to walk up to the house, hope that they answered the door, or hope that once they were up there, that they would smell the odor of marijuana, as Officer Pedraja did, that would not convert it into a search. There was no invasion, physical invasion.",
  "Well, Your Honor - -",
  "-- I think - -",
  "I think what -- I think what happened here - -",
  "Well, I think everyone accepts when someone comes to your door, they can avail themselves of their God-given senses, whether it's looking into a window without binoculars, taking -- breathing in and smelling the air, as Officer Pedraja did. I don't think there's a constitutional difference when the person has - -",
  "Well, Your Honor - -",
  "Your Honor, what I think you can say there is implied consent to is a dog accompanying a person on a leash walking up to the front door, taking a sniff in a matter of seconds, not minutes - -",
  "Your Honor, I think what the record shows is, is that the dog was on the scene, i.e., at the curb, walking up, going back into the car, and then leaving, for a total of 5 to 10 minutes. Walking up to the front steps, sniffing, alerting and leaving is a matter of seconds or minutes. It's not -- the dog isn't up there for 5 to 10 minutes. It happens very quickly. I think in thinking about reasonable expectations of privacy, it is important to keep in mind physically what's happening in these houses. These people are growing drugs in the houses with the aid of electricity and light and heat. And they need -- they need air conditioning in order to control the heat. And that air conditioning is blowing a very strong odor of drugs out into the public, and the people know that. They know that. We know they know that because they use mothballs, which Officer Pedraja found here at the front of the house, outside of the house. And so what you're talking about, although we talk about what's going on in the home, really what's happening here is odor of illegal contraband is being blown out into the street and someone is coming up to it and using their God-given senses in a way that humans and dogs have used for centuries and detecting that.",
  "That you need probable cause just for the dog to sniff. No, that's absolutely right. And the dog sniff itself clearly is not a physical invasion in the same way that looking is not a physical invasion under the common law. And the dog, we think - -",
  "Well, that's true, Your Honor, but I think if it wasn't a search for the police officer to walk up there and sniff and report smelling live marijuana, then it wasn't a search when Franky walked up there and alerted to the presence of an illegal narcotic.",
  "I think it's been conceded in this case, at least it was below, that the officer could walk up there, knock on the door, report the smell of marijuana, and that that was not a search.",
  "Well, first of all, Franky's nose is not technology. It's -- he's using -- he's availing himself of God-given senses in the way that dogs have helped mankind for centuries.",
  "Your Honor, I think the contraband rationale would be the same. It would be different in that you don't have technology in this case. And I think that's an important distinction because, as we read Kyllo, the Court was very concerned about advances in technology, and that's just not true for a dog's nose.",
  "Well - -",
  "Your Honor, I think that's true for two reasons. One is Franky is using the same sense of smell that dogs have used for centuries. So this isn't a case where if you allow a dog to sniff today, he might use x-ray vision in the future. That's not going to happen. And the other thing is that Franky -- that the use of dogs for their sense of smell, which everyone agrees is extraordinary, mankind has been using them for law enforcement type purposes for centuries.",
  "Well, to use it for drug detection purposes, that's right. But they've -- we've been using dogs to track thieves for centuries going back before the founding. Scotland Yard -- Scotland Yard used dogs to track Jack the Ripper. That's the same type of way in which they are being used here. The fact is today they're looking for drugs in this context, but - -",
  "They have a much better sense of smell, that's right. But I think if you look at - -",
  "Well - -",
  "He's -- the dogs, no doubt, have an enhanced sense of smell compared to the officer. But I think that's really not functionally different than using an airplane to look into the house, like in Florida v. Reilly. And in that sense, I think this case is a lot like that. In Florida v. Reilly, the officers used a helicopter to fly over the drug house, and they saw exposed marijuana. Here, you're using the drug detection dog to smell the odor of marijuana that is being pumped out of the house into the street. And the people who use the house know that. They know that, and we know they know that because the mothballs were present. Mothballs are a masking agent. People don't have a legitimate expectation of privacy, this Court has held, in things that they knowingly expose to the public, even in the home. That's what the Court said in Florida v. Reilly. It's what it said in Katz itself. And I think, here, one way to resolve it is to say people who live in grow houses with a distinct odor of marijuana, who know that that is being pumped out into the street because of the air conditioning that they need to run the grow houses, there is no invasion in their -- in their expectation of privacy when either a man or a dog, when lawfully present on the property, uses their God-given senses to detect that. If I could reserve - -",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. First, with the question of how long they were at the scene, the record says that they were at the scene for five to ten minutes. That's -- that includes in the car; walking up to the door, which my friend conceded was a minute or two; and, then back in the car and leaving. With respect to the bracketing, bracketing just means that the dog is getting excited, moving his head around. This is a passive alert dog. They get a little bit excited and then sit down. It's no different than what a neighbor's dog would do when they get to the front door. Second, with respect to state law, we do think it's important. And Florida has a decision, State v. - -",
  "Yes. They're walking up the common path, and you can see it from the picture at the -- appended to the brief, and then up to the front door. It's near the front door where he alerted by sitting down.",
  "He's sniffing; he's breathing. That's right.",
  "With respect to state law, State v. Morsman, 394 So.2d 408 at 409, this was a case that came up during oral argument in the Supreme Court. It says that, under Florida law, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in a porch, taking into account that visitors and salesmen can come up to the front door. And I think that that's pertinent here. Justice Kennedy, if you don't like the contraband rationale, then I hope you would consider the knowingly exposed to the public rationale. Here, the record does show that they -- drug houses do vent the stuff outside. It's page A-48 of the joint appendix. That's in the warrant, where they talk about what the air conditioning unit does to the scent of marijuana in the house. We know that they knew about that because Officer Bartelt came across the moth balls -- that's on page 100 of the joint appendix -- outside of the house. The mothballs were outside of the house, which means - -",
  "-- which means that they knew that the odors were outside the house.",
  "Well, and I think that gets back to our point that this is a dog that's been used by humans for centuries by scent. And in that respect, it's quite different than the helicopter that was used for aerial surveillance in Florida v. Reilly.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is when does a trained drug detection dog's alert to a vehicle establish probable cause to search the vehicle?",
  "For it again, Your Honor.",
  "The Florida Supreme Court answered that question by erecting what we think is an extraordinary set of evidentiary requirements, in effect, puts the dog on trial in any suppression hearing in which defendant chooses to challenge the reliability of the dog. I think, most fundamentally, the problem with the court of appeals' -- the Supreme Court's decision -- is that it misconceives what this Court's cases conceive of the probable cause requirement, converting probable cause, which this Court has referred to as a substantial chance, or fair probability, of the detection of contraband or evidence of a crime, into what amounts to a continuously updated batting average and a requirement that dogs be virtually infallible. That -- that - -",
  "Well, and I think, Your Honor, under our view of it, it's okay to inquire into whether or not the dog has successfully completed a bona fide training program, which -- which we think is a training program in which the dog is going to be tested for proficiency, including in a setting where some vehicles have drugs and some vehicles don't. And Aldo, the dog in this case, clearly was. He'd received a 120-hour training program with the police department in Apopka, Florida. He received a 40-hour refresher seminar by another police department in Dothan, Alabama. And he was subjected to continuous weekly training, in which part of that training consisted of taking him out, walking him by some vehicles that contained cars, some vehicles that didn't. And the testimony of Officer Wheetley was that Aldo's performance was really good. And what he meant by that was that if there were eight cars with drugs.",
  "It was a lapse, Your Honor. The dog subsequently was recertified. Our position is that the Fourth Amendment doesn't impose an annual certification requirement. Some states have it, some states don't. I think, more important in this case was the fact that the dog was continuously trained, continuously evaluated in training.",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think the most important thing is successful completion of proficiency testing. I mean, what -- what our friends would like, and what the Florida Supreme Court would like, would really for the courts to delve into all aspects of the training, what types of distracters were used, what type of smell and printing was used and the like.",
  "Well, certainly that it was authentic, Your Honor. And here, the programs were - - were conducted by actual police departments in -- in Alabama and Florida. And this Court ordinarily would presume regularity in those sorts of training settings. And there's no reason to approach the training of a dog any differently, but - -",
  "No, Your Honor. The certification. Certification usually is done by private entities which are operated by former law enforcement officers. But the training itself, it usually and here was done by police departments themselves.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's right. There - -",
  "And I think that the central inquiry that we would think the judge would undertake is to determine whether or not the dog was performing successfully in proficiency testing. I mean -- after all, that's why we train the dogs. And if - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, in our view, we don't think it's -- it's an appropriate role for the Court to delve into the contours of the training, what specific methods were used to train or distract or - - you know, all the contours that they bring up in their brief.",
  "Not -- you would have to accept it, Your Honor, on its face. I think you -- in a record like this -- and I think this record is clearly sufficient -- and, ultimately, that's what we're asking this Court to hold -- what you have in the record is evidence - -",
  "I think it would be close - -",
  "-- close to that. We would ask whether or not the dog successfully treated -- completed training by a bona fide organization. And here - -",
  "Certification is not required. It may be one way that the police department could establish reliability a different way, but certification itself is not required when you have a record of the type of training that you have here. We do think that you could put the handler on the stand and ask about the reliability, certain questions about reliability. We don't think, in a record like this, the judge would say, well, it says that he completed 120 hours in narcotics detection at the Apopka, Florida police department, and 40 hours at the Dothan police department, so - -",
  "Your Honor - -",
  "-- I think one area where the Court mentioned that was in the Lago Vista case, where it talked about the importance of clear rules for police officers and - -",
  "Absolutely. And the same way that when an officer provides evidence for a search warrant, we don't demand the training of the officer, what schools he went to or what specific courses he had in probable cause.",
  "Your Honor, I think that that would be the unusual case, and it probably would be captured by the other factors; but, what we meant by including that is that there's no limit on the types of evidence that the police could submit to show reliability. If you didn't have certification or a formal training program, the fact that there was evidence that a dog like Aldo successfully performed in weekly training over the course of the year, and the police submitted the records, like the records in the Joint Appendix in this case at pages 106 and 116, that might be another way of establishing reliability. But the -- the central way would be showing that the dog successfully completed training or that the dog was certified.",
  "Well, Your Honor, we don't think there is a Fourth Amendment requirement of certification for handlers. Again, this is something that varies among states.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's correct. And Officer Wheetley here, of course, had been trained. He had gotten a 160-hour course in narcotics detection, and had done training with Aldo in the Dothan, Alabama police department, 40 hours there. And these dog -- the dog, Aldo, and Officer Wheetley had worked together for about a year before the time of the search. The handlers themselves are going to be in the best position to know the dogs and evaluate their reliability. And they have a strong incentive to ensure the dogs are reliable. That's both because they don't want to miss contraband when it's available -- when it exists in the field; and, also, they don't want to be put into harm's way. The traffic stop, in particular, is one of the most dangerous encounters police officers face. They're not going to want to be working with a dog that is consistently putting the officer in a position of searching cars based on an alert when that dog is not reliable in predicting the presence - -",
  "We don't think the Fourth Amendment puts a number on it. This Court has rejected a numerical conception of probable cause. But with respect - -",
  "But, but let me -- let me address the, the South Wales study, Your Honor, which I think is the one that you were referring to and that's the primary one relied on by the other side. In that case they reported that over the course of several years the dogs' alerts resulted in discovery of drugs only 26 percent of the time. But there is another part of that study which doesn't come up in the amicus briefs, and that's that in 60 percent of the other cases the individuals admitted to using drugs or being in the proximity of drugs. And if you include that in the universe of accurate alerts, as you should, then the number becomes 70 percent of dogs accurately alerting. That 70 percent based on the primary study that they rely upon - -",
  "Well, primarily by looking at whether the dog has successfully completed training. And you're right, dogs do go out of service when they reach a certain age. Dogs, like humans, become old and impaired over time. But -- but looking at weekly training records, like are available in this case, dogs that successfully perform week in and week out in training are going to successfully perform in the -- in the real world. And, after all, I think the most problematic aspect of the challenges to the reliability of these dogs is that law enforcement agencies across the country at the state and Federal level, law enforcement agencies around the world, and law enforcement agencies that protect this Court rely on detection dogs as reliable predictors of the evidence of contraband, evidence of the presence of explosives or likewise. And this is an area where we think that a page of logic and experience is worth a volume -- a page of experience and history is worth a volume of logic. These dogs have been used and are being used in many settings across the country and across the world today. And the reason they are being used is because the people who work with them know that they are reliable and - - and know by experience that they are reliable. And that's one of the central problems we have with the argument on the other side, is that ultimately this Court should distrust the reliability of the dogs. And again - -",
  "Your Honor, I think that the defendant can call the handler and can ask those sorts of questions. I think the court would cut it off if you got into questions like, well, did they use the play-reward or the scent-imprinting method in training. Well, what specifics -- because I think that delves too far into the details.",
  "Yes, and that was done here.",
  "I -- I don't think so, Your Honor. First of all, cueing is not part of this case because they haven't argued that the dog was cued. The argument is the dog was just sort of inherently reliable.",
  "And our position is, is that you can inquire into cueing during this hearing, that the defendants can -- can argue that the dog was cued, and in -- in the course of that argument you might be able to get into those sorts of things. That's different than the challenge that was made here. There wasn't a cueing challenge made in this case. I would like to just go back to one of the premises of your question, which is that the dog in this case didn't accurately alert. The dog in this case accurately alerted to the odor of illegal narcotics.",
  "Right. And, and I think that's another central problem with the Florida supreme court's decision, is this notion that alerts to so-called residual odors aren't indicative of the dog's reliability. A dog's alert to the lingering odor of methamphetamine which was in the car, must have been in the car in this case, is just as accurate as a dog's alert to the presence of methamphetamine itself in the car. If I could reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. First, probable cause in this Court's precedents looks not only to the likelihood that contraband would be present, but the likelihood that there would be evidence of a crime. And that would include the so-called residual odor, evidence that drug paraphernalia, someone had recently smoked illegal narcotics in the vehicle, or the like. So the alert to the so-called residual odor of drugs is just as probative to the question of probable cause as an alert to drugs themselves. The fact that Aldo alerted to the door handle area of the car doesn't negate in any way the probable cause that Officer Wheetley had to search. What it means is that the door handle area was where the scent of the illegal narcotics was the strongest. It could have been narcotics coming out of that area, or coming out of the door seam, or could have been the fact that someone who had used narcotics was using the door handle to get in and out of the car. Second, courts can determine reliability in this context. They would look to the performance in the controlled training environment. There is a real danger with suggesting that field performance records are - - are a permissible foray for defendants in suppression hearings to challenge the reliability of dogs because, one, as Justice Alito pointed out, it's not a controlled setting. We don't know whether the dog did alert to residual odors of narcotics that had been in the car, drugs that were hidden and simply not found during the relatively - -",
  "I think they could ask about it, Your Honor. I don't think they could demand the performance records themselves. And that would be a huge deterrent to law enforcement, even maintaining those records. Third, Officer Wheetley and Aldo did train together for nearly a year before the search in question. They did complete the 40-hour drug detection seminar at the Dothan, Alabama, police department. And that certificate's at page 105 of the record. And second, as Justice Scalia pointed out, all the incentives in this area are aligned with ensuring the reliability of drug detection dogs. It's not in the police interest to have a dog that is inaccurate in finding contraband or that is inaccurate and putting an officer in harm's way. Humans have relied upon dogs for law enforcement-related purposes, due to their extraordinary sense of smell, for centuries. Dogs, trained drug detection dogs and explosive detection dogs, are invaluable members of the law enforcement community today. We would ask the Court to reverse the decision below, which would act as a serious detriment to the use of that valuable tool.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed because the record establishes that the only employees whose status is at issue lacked the supervisory authority necessary to trigger vicarious liability under Title VII.",
  "That's right. We don't think the Seventh Circuit test is the complete answer to the question of who may qualify as a supervisor. But we think it's clear that the -- the person whose status is at issue did not qualify and therefore, the judgment should be affirmed. This Court --",
  "Well, most importantly, Justice Alito, because the courts need guidance on how to apply the EEOC and the Second Circuit standard. The best way to provide that guidance is to do what this Court often does, which is to apply the facts to the standard. In this case, applying the record facts to the standard that we think applies, the \"materially enables the harassment\" standard, it's clear that Ms. Davis, the person who is at issue, does not qualify as a supervisor. And the reason why it's clear is the record is uncontradicted that either the chef or Mr. Kimes made the daily assignments through the prep sheets. The prep sheets are what every employee in the kitchen got each day and they would tell you: Dice vegetables for 60 people; prepare boxed lunches for 20; prepare six vegetable trays. That's -- that was their daily assignments, and the record is absolutely clear, JA 2 – 277 to 278, JA 424 -- that all the employees got the prep sheets from the chef or Mr. Kimes. It's also absolutely clear that Mr. Kimes was the one who controlled the schedule in the kitchen. He is the one that told employees what times of days that they could work. He controlled the schedule.",
  "There is -- there is neither a material nor genuine dispute on that, Your Honor. It at the very --",
  "But they -- they omit the -- the clause that follows, which is critical, which is \"via demonstration, coaching, or overseeing to ensure efficiency.\" That is on page Joint Appendix 13. And that job description has to be read in light of the record that makes crystal clear that it was the chef who did the daily assignments for the prep sheets. And there -- and there are examples of the prep sheets as an exhibit to Ms. Fultz's affidavit, the affidavits at 424 of the Joint Appendix. The -- the exhibits are LLL and JJJ --",
  "Your Honor, you --",
  "Well, Your Honor has excellent briefing defending the Seventh Circuit. The Chamber of Commerce and other amici have defended it. We certainly think that it -- that -- that it's a superior --",
  "No, Your Honor. We think it's a superior bright line, but, as we say in our brief, we think that ultimately this Court's precedents compel that the Court reject that. And I think most -- most squarely we look at the Faragher decision. We look at lifeguard Silverman in Faragher, who had the authority to control all aspects of the victim's schedule and daily activities in a virtually unchecked manner. So if the Court is looking for an example that it wants to point to of someone who could qualify under the non-Seventh Circuit category, we think that lifeguard Silverman, from this Court's precedents, would be the example that this Court would hold out.",
  "That -- that's absolutely right, Justice Ginsburg. And I think, for some of the reasons that Justice Kagan brought up in her colloquy with -- with Mr. Srinivasan, I think the logic of the Court's precedents, agency principles adopted, would lead to the conclusion that someone who does control virtually all aspects of one's schedule but yet lacks the authority to hire, fire, or demote, nevertheless still would be qualified as someone who --",
  "We do have great difficulty, Your Honor. First of all, if we are wrong about what this Court's precedents compel, then this Court should adopt the Seventh Circuit principle, and we've -- we've said that in our brief, if we're wrong in our understanding of the Court's precedents. Secondly, we think that the -- the Court can and should establish meaningful limits on what this broader category of supervisors would require, and I think the case law illustrates that. If you look at the leading circuits who apply the standard --",
  "Well, I -- I would take issue with that. We -- we tried to provide guideposts that would be helpful. But if you look at, for example, the principle that the EEOC agrees with, which -- which is just that limited or marginal occasion authority to lead or oversee by virtue of a paper title, its grade, or seniority is not sufficient.",
  "Well, Your Honor --",
  "What this Court said in Faragher and Ellerth -- and I appreciate that you dissented in the case, but what this Court said was it adopted Section 219(2)(d) of the Restatement (Second) of Agency, the notion that if -- if there was -- if the employee was aided in the accomplishment of the harassment by virtue of an agency relation, that that would be the agency trigger for liability.",
  "And RMA then --",
  "I don't think it would, Your Honor, because we agree, certainly, with the EEOC that there are material limits to how far that principle could be stretched. The Court in Ellerth made clear that there were limits to the vicarious liability of employers in this context.",
  "Well, for the very --",
  "This is the balance I think that the Court struck in Ellerth, Your Honor, which was -- it took into account that the statute was passed against the backdrop of agency principles; but, yet, Congress also was cognizant that imposing vicarious liability on the employer for acts that the Court recognized were not themselves authorized by the employer, that that was a punitive aspect of that, and the Court would establish limits. And I think our position takes into account that there have to be limits in this area, on the extent of vicarious liability, in order to give effect to Congress's intent; but, also recognizes, in the situation like you had with the lifeguard in Faragher, that that person did have authority that would assist in the harassment – date me or clean the toilets, as the lifeguard in Faragher said. And so the Court, I think, struck a reasonable balance. And taking the balance and what this Court said, we think the proper way to resolve this case is to adopt something like the EEOC rule or the Second Circuit rule, but to make clear there are limits. And the best way to make clear that there are limits is to make clear that on the record in this case Ms. Davis did not qualify as a supervisor. Now, my friend said they didn't have the opportunity to develop evidence to the contrary; but, the fact is, from the outset, they litigated this case as if the Seventh Circuit standard did not apply. The reasons that they gave for why Ms. Davis was a supervisor, in the lower court, was that, one, they pointed to the job description, that she had this other authority to \"lead and direct,\" and they also pointed to the fact that she didn't clock in. Those are irrelevant under the Seventh Circuit test. So all along, they had in their mind that they wanted to try to show that Davis was different, and it did have some marginal authority to lead --",
  "I think it's a lot of guidance, Justice Alito. I think that the flip side of that is the Court would make clear that merely having some occasional or marginal authority to lead or direct by virtue of one's better paper title or seniority is not sufficient to trigger vicarious liability. I think that's going to resolve the mine-run of the cases in which this question has come up and been litigated, at least to the courts of appeals. If you look, for example, at the difference between something like the Mack case out of the Second Circuit and the Mikels case out of the Fourth Circuit, in Mikels, we had an example of two police officers, one had a higher paper rank, corporal versus private, and it was alleged that the corporal was a supervisor. And the court said, no, no, no, he's not a supervisor, all there is, is some marginal occasional authority. That's not sufficient. It was clear that the victim in that case wasn't shy about telling the harasser where to go, to tell him off. And that's the kind of --",
  "Right. And we -- we don't think that that's a dispositive criterion. We recognize the point that the person gets to establish superior ability to stand up to despicable treatment. But I think what our point is, is that it's part of the equation that you would look at. In essence, did the person treat the alleged harasser like a co-employee, or did the person treat the alleged harasser like a supervisor? And in this case, the record is clear that she treated her like a co-employee, someone who -- they obviously had disagreements among them. And I think that's what we take this piece of evidence to assist the Court on the question presented. I think -- but we think what was sufficient to resolve the question presented is the clear and unrefuted evidence that the prep sheets, the daily activities were assigned by the chef or Mr. Kimes, that Mr. Kimes had the authority to control the schedule. And if you want to go further than that, the record also shows that Mr. Kimes had the authority to review -- to do annual reviews. Mr. Kimes had the authority to evaluate. He had all the kind of authority that one would expect in a supervisor. And so you would ask the question, what's left? Essentially nothing. And whatever is left, we agree with the EEOC, is not, as a matter of law, sufficient to trigger vicarious liability. That doesn't mean she can't present her claim. It -- it means that it's just simply analyzed under the framework for co-workers, in which she bears the burden of establishing that the employer was negligent in not responding to it. And as Judge Wood, for the court of appeals, and Judge Barker made clear in their detailed opinions, this was not a situation where the employer stuck its head in the sand and ignored incidents of unpleasantries or, in some cases, despicable racial epithets --",
  "Well, Your Honor, we don't think it's a close case, but my friend does, and his amici do. And I think the damaging signal that this Court would send by remanding on this record would be that, whatever it might say in its opinion, that would have virtually no force in terms of establishing a standard that made clear that this -- whatever else may be true about what would qualify, something like this does not qualify. And, again, like this Court did in the Global Tech case, when the Court establishes a standard, oftentimes, it applies the standard to the facts and appreciates that that's the best way, the most judicial way of providing guidance on what that standard means.",
  "It doesn't, Your Honor, if you agree with our principle, that the EEOC also agrees with, that having some limited or marginal authority to lead or direct, as a matter of law, is not sufficient. So that that piece of evidence, giving it its reasonable inference, would not be sufficient to create a material issue. It also wouldn't be sufficient creating -- looking at the body of the evidence, which makes crystal clear that the prep sheets are really what was driving the daily activities in this workplace. And it was Kimes or the chef that did the prep sheets, not Ms. Davis at all. And it -- and it was also not material in light of the evidence that Mr. Kimes did the schedule. Ms. Davis was asked at her deposition on page 135, quote, \"Was there ever\" -- \"have you ever been assigned to a less meaningful or fulfilling job classification?\" And her response was yes, and she pointed to an example by Mr. Kimes, because it was Mr. Kimes who had the authority to make those assignments, not Ms. Davis. So the mere fact that you've got some marginal evidence drawn from snippets, giving it a reasonable inference that she at times had some ability to lead or direct, as the job description says, \"by coaching, demonstration or overseeing,\" is not sufficient as a matter of law to entitle her to summary judgment, nor do we think that this Court should take the unusual step of remanding so that she can dig into events six years old through new discovery. Again --",
  "Well, first, I would look at her summary judgment briefs, Your Honor, and in those briefs she argued that Davis was a supervisor because, one, under the job description she had the authority to lead and direct, the same sorts of things that we are talking now and would be talking about under the EEOC and Second Circuit tests. And, two, she points to the fact that they didn't clock in, again something that is irrelevant under the Seventh Circuit test. So this wasn't a case where the litigant felt themselves bound by the legal standard and one could surmise that they would have pursued it differently. I think I would look at that first. And then I would look at her deposition transcript which is in the Joint Appendix and the three affidavits that she put in, in this case, which are in the Joint Appendix. At some point you would expect her to come along and try to rebut the notion that Mr. Kimes and Ms. Fultz assigned the daily activities through the prep sheets. In fact, it's just the contrary. If anything, in her own affidavit she seems to accept that the prep sheets were done by Kimes and the chef. That's at JA 430. You -- you would expect her to contest the notion that Mr. Kimes was the one who did the scheduling, who did her annual reviews, who disciplined her on occasion. After all, she was claiming that Davis was the supervisor, and she didn't feel bound by the Seventh Circuit tests. So you would expect to see some indication of how Ms. Davis actually assigned her something to do, changed her schedule, the like. Instead what you find is all those sorts of allegations, she made them, but all those sorts of allegations were directed to Mr. Kimes. That was the basis for her retaliation claim, which isn't before the Court. But there are all the sorts of things that you might expect one to complain about against a supervisor in this sort of vein: She made me cut vegetables instead of doing the baking like I like to do; she didn't assign me enough overtime so I could make more money; she changed my hours. Those allegations were made. They were directed at Mr. Kimes and that's perfectly consistent with the record evidence. There was Kimes and the chef who had the authority to do her daily activities, and Kimes had the authority to do the schedule. It's not enough for her to come here today, I don't think, and just speculate that having an opportunity to go through greater discovery, which in essence would amount to a fishing expedition, the Court should take the unusual step of remanding to give her an opportunity for discovery. This Court -- although we acknowledge oftentimes this Court does remand for the lower courts to undertake that inquiry, it certainly doesn't always do so. So Global-Tech is one example; we've cited many more in our briefs. And here, I think, again, the parties -- there is broad agreement on what the standard should be. Something like the EEOC or Second Circuit test is, we think, the best way to frame it. But given the debate among the parties about what that test means and how it applies to Davis here, I think it's absolutely critical for the Court to apply the legal test to the record facts and hold that Ms. Davis is not a supervisor and to affirm the judgment below. Although it's not before this Court, if one wants to go to the next step and think about the affirmative defenses and the like, this isn't a case where the Court would be putting to rest a valid Title VII claim. But the claim was extensively looked at below by Judge Barker in the district court, Judge Wood and her colleagues on the court of appeal, and they found an environment in which Ball State reacted responsibly to the allegations that were made, investigated them and took prompt action where the investigation warranted it, particularly with respect to the most despicable things that were uncovered, racial epithets that were used by another employee, Ms. McVicker, not Ms. Davis. The only allegations against Ms. Davis that we think are relevant here during the time period that Ms. Davis was a part-time employee were: One, the so-called elevator incident where Ms. Davis allegedly blocked Ms. Vance as she got out of the elevator, which isn't race-based at all, we don't think; and two, the alleged use of words like \"Sambo\" or \"Buckwheat\" to refer --",
  "Well, we disagree with that, Your Honor. If you look on page JA 12, the job description position function, the last sentence says, \"Requires leadership of up to 20 part-time substitute and student employees.\" So we think it's clear. We said -- this is in our red brief and there wasn't any response to it in the yellow brief -- that any authority, any conceivable supervisory authority, could have only existed when Ms. Vance was a part-time employee. But we don't think that that's relevant, Your Honor, because putting -- putting aside whether she had authority over catering assistants who were part time or full time, the record is absolutely clear that Ms. Davis just lacked the authority that would have been sufficient to trigger vicarious liability. And again we think the paradigm case where that authority is present is something like the lifeguard in Silverman where they control all aspects of the daily activities, one's schedule, one's daily work assignments, and down the line. Here there is no evidence that any of that authority that was possessed, and the record makes clear beyond doubt that all that authority was possessed by others, Ms. -- the chef and Mr. Kimes. And I think, as the amicus brief makes clear, this is consistent with workplaces across America today, where jobs are less hierarchical, more collaborative, and so where you have got more senior employees by virtue of their experience or job title, just a paper title, are in a broad sense team leaders of the like in the workplace. That doesn't mean they are supervisors in any traditional sense, and it certainly doesn't mean they are supervisors for purposes of triggering vicarious liability under Title VII. So for those reasons, we would urge this Court to affirm the judgment below, to make clear in order to provide the needed guidance to the courts of appeals and the assumption that something like the EEOC or Second Circuit standard does apply to determine who is a supervisor triggering vicarious liability. Ms. Davis, the only employee who is at issue, does not meet that standard.",
  "If you have no more questions, thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On both jurisdiction and the merits, the government is asking this Court to adopt an overly expansive interpretation of the code to reach a result that would upset the statutory scheme devised by Congress and lead to further problems down the road. Now, on jurisdiction, I think the most important thing for the Court to recognize is that outside basis, the very thing, as you can tell from my friend's arguments on the merits, that the imposition of this penalty depends on is not a partnership item. In fact ­­",
  "Well, I think the government is asking the Court to add a great deal more than that. Just to go to the statutory text, with the provision at 6226, and it's on page 2A of the red brief, and what that says is that first it gives the court jurisdiction to determine all partnership items. Everybody agrees that outside basis is not a partnership item. And then it gives jurisdiction to the court to determine penalties that relate to partnership items. And what ­­ and what the government is asking this Court to do is, essentially, to read this to say that relates to partnership items or that relates to non­partnership affected items, like outside basis. And the reason why the Court shouldn't do that is, first, in a scheme that divides the world into partnership items that can be determined at the partnership level and non­partnership items that must go to the partner level, when Congress says \"partnership item,\" that's significant. It ­­ it adds defined terms of \"non­partnership item\" or \"affected item.\" It said \"partnership item.\" So we think that it necessarily excluded non­partnership affected items here, and that's the way to read it. And second, if you read the \"relates to\" as broadly as the government says, then it makes no sense. The partnership item here might as well say \"affected item\" because you're right, at some level of abstraction, you can always say that the penalty relates to the partnership item. That's going to be true for lots of these.",
  "You're right, Justice Scalia, and ­­",
  "Well, let me tell you, Justice Scalia ­­",
  "Justice Scalia, let me answer it this way: Partnerships can do many things, just like individuals and corporations, and they can engage in things that subject ­­ that trigger penalties. A partnership can misreport its income. A partnership can make a valuation misstatement. A partnership can engage in negligence, and the court can determine those ­­ the applicability of those penalties. Now, it's true that, down the road, in ­­ in a mathematical adjustment, the court is looking to whether or not the partner repeated that error on its return. But what's fundamentally different about this case is the penalty depends not on the partnership, just the partnership item; it depends on this outside basis determination that a court can't make. I mean, to put it another way ­­",
  "Ultimately, Your Honor, the partner ­­",
  "Your Honor, the partners don't actually ­­ the partnership does not pay the penalty, but the partner ­­ the partnership ­­",
  "No, I don't believe so, but the partnership ­­",
  "I mean, ultimately, I think that would trickle down to the partners. But, Your Honor, I think there are two different schemes here. One is where the partnership is doing things that actually does trigger the penalty. Take the 2010 noneconomic substance transaction.",
  "Yes and no, Your Honor. Yes, in the sense that, ultimately, what you're looking in the proper proceeding is to determine whether or not the partner repeated the error that's on the partnership return, but you can say, at the partnership level, that a penalty is ­­ is applicable because everything is complete. All the elements can be determined. The partnership has misreported its income. In this case, you just can't say that because outside basis isn't reported anywhere at all on the partnership ­­",
  "At the partnership level ­­",
  "­­ because you're talking about ­­",
  "­­ inside basis, not outside basis, correct.",
  "Your Honor, I think ­­",
  "And ­­",
  "What the court in doing ­­ what the court is doing in both of those situations is fundamentally different. In one case, it's looking at the partnership return, looking at how the partnership reported the basis and determining that the basis overstatement penalty would apply because of the error committed by the partnership. That is everything that we think the court can do under the statutory provision we just referred to, to determine the applicability of that penalty because it relates to a partnership item, the partnership's statement of its income or basis on the partnership return. Now, what's happening here is the partner ­­ the penalty is applying to the partner's statement of basis. That outside basis doesn't appear anywhere.",
  "Right. And the three ­­",
  "And the three circuit courts that have addressed that have agreed with us. And as Justice ­­",
  "No, not at all, Your Honor.",
  "What we're saying is outside basis is not a partnership item.",
  "Your Honor, I think that the confusion maybe is between the statement at issue here. The statement at issue in this case is the basis that the partners reported on their individual returns as a result of these transactions. If you go to the partnership return and go to page 169 of the Joint Appendix, and it may be difficult to find now because of these fold­outs, but you'll find what the partnership reported, and it reported all of the transactions at issue, and it reported accurately ­­",
  "Right, and ­­",
  "Well, it matters in the scope of jurisdiction, Your Honor. And again ­­",
  "The words that matter is \"partnership item.\" This is a statutory scheme that ­­ that talks about non­partnership items and partnership items.",
  "The partnership item, Your Honor, can include the partnership. We're not ­­ we're not disputing that part of the sham determination. My point is that the imposition of the penalty depends on an additional determination, which is a non­partnership item. And the Court ­­",
  "Right. And the reason why ­­ and I think that gets back to partnership item because, if you read \"relates to\" in the broad sense that the government is asking you to read it, then, in essence, you are adding ­­ you're taking away the limitation of \"partnership item,\" and you are adding words that says \"or affected item,\" because what they're saying is, look, anytime you have a partnership item that is in any way related to the imposition of a penalty down the road, then you can do it. But another way of saying that, and the way that Congress would have said if it meant it was, courts, you can determine the applicability of any penalty that relates to a partnership item or an affected item. But Congress didn't say that.",
  "Right.",
  "Now ­­",
  "Our point is the one that the D.C. Circuit and the other circuits have adopted, which is that to make this determination you have to go beyond the partnership item; you have to determine a non­partnership item, and this grant of jurisdiction ­­",
  "Again ­­",
  "No. When the penalty is ­­ is complete based on what the partnership has done, you can determine the applicability of the penalty. You can say all of the elements are met because of what the partnership did. And then, later, you're only looking to whether or not the partners repeated that error. Here, that's not ­­ that's not what's happening.",
  "We would, Your Honor. The noneconomic substance penalty that Congress passed to cover this situation here solves all the problems. As to jurisdiction, courts could determine it at the partnership level because looking to whether or not the partnership is a sham is a partnership item. And so courts have jurisdiction to do that. And of course, that solves the merits question, too, because Congress actually addressed the situation here on the merits. Instead, we have the government trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. I mean, on jurisdiction, before I go to the merits, I just want to talk about the practical consequences of this ruling. It's very significant from the standpoint of the taxpayers. What the government wants to do is funnel all of these penalty determinations into a computational adjustment, as opposed to the deficiency proceeding, which is the default rule under the statute, Section 6230. And from the taxpayers' perspective, that has huge consequence. It means that the taxpayers have to pay the refund up front, as Justice Sotomayor recognized. That means that, even in disputed penalties, they've got to pay all that up front, and then that limits their ability to challenge it. It means they can't go to the Tax Court to challenge it. They have to do it in a more expedited fashion. The default rule is deficiency proceedings. That is where Congress intended these penalty issues of the type that we have here that pertain to non­partnership items ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "And I think what you would be doing is assuming a fact necessary to the penalty, that outside basis was reported as zero, for purposes of finding jurisdiction, and we don't think the court could do that. The government acknowledges that it ­­ that it's at least possible that the taxpayer, in a fit of conscience or having fully ­­ more fully understood the transactions, would not inflate its basis, it would report a zero basis, and yet nobody would know that, in a partnership­level proceeding, because the partners' outside basis isn't even before the court ­­ before the IRS or the court in that proceeding.",
  "In the individual return.",
  "You do, but the partner ­­",
  "Every ­­",
  "Well, Your Honor, every partner's outside basis is going to vary in the typical situation.",
  "And the fact that it can vary, Your Honor, is one of the reasons why Congress wanted these determinations made at the partner level. And another thing on the jurisdictional question. I don't think the Court could resolve this question looking only to the sham partnership situation here. Sometimes, transactions are shams; sometimes, partnerships are shammed. And the jurisdictional question or answer to the question should apply across the board. And yet, if you have a situation where you have only a transaction shammed, then even the government would have to acknowledge that basis could be affected in many different ways in that situation. And, again, getting back ­­",
  "It couldn't because ­­ and it didn't because, again, if you go back to page 186 ­­ 169 of the Joint Appendix, everything about these transactions is accurately reported on that form which is in the partnership return. The partnership actually reported a gain on these transactions. The error comes in at the partner level and is only on the partner return in this situation. And that's why you can't determine outside basis at the partnership level, and that's why you can't determine the applicability of this penalty at the partnership level.",
  "No, no, Your Honor, in this sense, if this Court resolves the merits question, then that ­­ that ruling whether the penalty applies or not in this context is going to apply to all partners. So that ­­ that issue is not going to vary by partner. What can happen by partner is different partners may have different outside basis. Even in this situation, my friend acknowledged you could have a partner that, nevertheless, reports zero as his basis in this situation and not the inflated basis",
  "Well, that determination, Your Honor, is being made at the partnership level, and we agree that it can be made at that level, and that determination applies to all the partners. There is no inconsistency about that. The only question here is whether the ­­ the partnership level court can determine the applicability of the ­­ the basis misstatement penalty as the government calls it. And ­­ and it doesn't have jurisdiction to do that because it depends on that outside basis to do it.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Exactly.",
  "I ­­ I think largely, yes, but if I can explain that. First, that presents the low­hanging fruit situation the D.C. Circuit resolved. And we think they were right to say, even if you think it's low hanging, you're forbidden to pick it. Second, here, the whole partnership is shammed, but there's certainly cases where individual transactions are shammed. And if individual transactions are shammed, then the ­­ the outside basis can vary widely based on the individual circumstances of the partners. And so there, in that situation, it's not at all obvious or ­­ or necessarily true that the basis is going to be overstated. You have to look. And, again, that's why it's a completely separate determination made ­­ partner level.",
  "Well, you could have a partnership, Your Honor, that engages in many transactions. And the IRS would determine that one of the many transactions that it entered into was a sham. That particular transaction was only designed for tax purposes, but other transactions that it engaged in were legitimate. Now, in this case, the IRS is saying that the whole ­­ everything the partnership did is a sham. But in my case, some transactions are okay, some are different. In that case, the individual partners' outside basis, they may have ­­ they may have tried to take advantage of the sham transaction, but yet, all the other transactions affect their basis as well in the partnership.",
  "No, because, Your Honor, again, the penalty is based on what the individual partner claims as his basis, and that partner is going to be looking to everything that goes into his partnership interest, the costs or investment in the partnership, pertaining not only to the one transaction that we have hypothesized has been shammed, but many other transactions as well. So you ­­ you can't conclude either that there's been any misstatement or that any misstatement triggers the valuation misstatement penalty here. If I could talk a little bit about the merits, on the merits, our fundamental question is that the valuation misstatement penalty that Congress devised in 1981 was not intended at all to apply to the fundamentally different situation here where the government is claiming not that you misstated the correct amount of the value or that you didn't have an accurate amount of the value or the number that you put for basis or value, but that the thing that's the subject of the valuation or the basis doesn't exist at all. I mean, we know if you look at the ­­ the pre­enactment history, the post­enactment history, we know that this is not what Congress had in mind. If you look at the pre­enactment history, it's all about resolving a problem of a backlog of cases where taxpayers were misvaluing property and the tax would ­­",
  "Your Honor, they have basis, and we have context, punctuation, pre­enactment history, post­enactment history, and structure.",
  "No, not at all, Your Honor, because this is a valuation misstatement penalty. The reference to \"or adjusted basis\" comes in a parenthetical, subordinate way. And let me give you a hypothetical. One of my associates came up with a good example, I think. If you had a contract for a wedding that provided for flowers or plants in parentheses, you would ­­ you would understand that to mean flowers or plants like ­­ like lilies or ferns that would accompany flowers in the wedding. You wouldn't read that to include an oak tree in the middle of the reception area. Well, the government’s basis overstatement penalty is the oak tree in the middle of the reception area here. The most common situation in which basis misstatements are made, the government acknowledges throughout its brief, is where you misstate the price or cost of a good. And yet, they're moving ­­ which is ­­ which is why the reference to adjusted basis makes sense in the statutory scheme here. It covers that situation. But ­­ but they're saying, you don't need to ­­ it goes far beyond that, not only to the prosaic situation as they call it, but to a situation where you're not complaining about whether the thing ­­ what the correct number is or what the correct amount is. You're saying the thing doesn't exist at all. I mean, if I donate a painting that I say is worth $1 million to a church, and I put that on my return, but, in fact, it turns out that I didn't donate the painting, I may have committed a fraud. I may have lied about contributing the painting, but I haven't made a valuation misstatement, nor have I misstated my basis. And I think our ­­ our position is here that, if you look at everything, as I mentioned, the words of the statute, the context in which a basis is ­­ appears, the structure, there's a graduated scheme that makes no sense with a zero basis situation, which is essentially a nullity. If you look at the fact that Congress addressed this in 2010, not by amending the valuation misstatement penalty, but by enacting a penalty designed to apply to this situation, the noneconomic transaction situation.",
  "Yes, absolutely. That's the way Congress designed it. And unless ­­",
  "If the noneconomic substance transaction penalty that was enacted in 2010 was on the books, what would happen is a court could determine the applicability of that penalty, which is based on what the partnership did at the partnership proceeding, and we would agree that penalty applies. All the problems are solved by what Congress did to address this particular situation. The government is trying to put that square peg in a round hole. And if you add everything up, I think what's ­­ what's interesting about the government’s reply brief is it doesn't contest that ­­ that if there's any ambiguity here, the statute has to be read in favor of the taxpayer. And that's because of the canon that this Court has recognized that tax penalties are strictly construed in favor of the taxpayer. Here, at a bare minimum, there is ambiguity as to whether the Congress that passed the valuation misstatement penalty ever intended it to apply to this fundamentally different situation where no one disagrees about the numbers reported on the return. Again, if you go to the partnership return, the transactions are accurately reported. If you go to the outside basis, it's true that they reported a loss, but that's because they were following the IRS' rules about how you treat contingent liabilities. So that number is actually accurate under the IRS' rules. That's why the IRS has to come up with a sham to get rid of the property altogether and say that we are going to pretend that it doesn't exist at all. But, again, that's not a valuation misstatement. When the penalty talks about correct amounts, about accuracy, about value, it's trying to get at the number that the thing is worth. It is not concerned with a situation in which the IRS is claiming that the property doesn't exist at all. That ­­ that is a different problem. Congress addressed it in a direct way, in a noneconomic substance penalty. So this Court doesn't have to worry about this problem being unaddressed. But what it should do is correctly interpret the penalty that Congress enacted, which was on the books when these events occurred, which is the valuation misstatement penalty it is not the all­encompassing basis overstatement penalty. I think, if you're going to read one of the amicus briefs, read the Shakow amicus brief. It talks about all the additional situations, which IRS or Congress never applied this penalty to which would be swept in by the government's position here today. Thank you very much.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To affirm the Ninth Circuit on the first two questions presented, this Court must accept the following two propositions: First, a plaintiff can force a court to adjudicate the merits of his claim simply by refusing the defendant's offer of capitulation and complete relief. And, second, that a plaintiff has what amounts to a substantive right to class litigation that applies as soon as the complaint is filed and that entitles the case to proceed even if his individual claim drops out before ­­",

If you take the voluntary cessation context, a litigant could always insist that he's still entitled to the finding of liability.",

What the Kokkonen case recognized is that, once a case has come to an end, the Court has ancillary jurisdiction to dispose of it. In that case it dealt with the enforcement of a consent decree. Here our fundamental ­­",
  "Well, first, Your Honor, this case, there was not only the Rule 68 offer of judgment, but a freestanding settlement offer. So we think that the mechanics of Rule 68 don't apply here. It's ­­",
  "Well, I don't ­­ I don't think so. I mean, it still presents the question of whether the controversy still exists given that the defendant has offered the plaintiff everything that he ­­ he could secure through a Federal judgment.",
  "And the plaintiff in Genesis Healthcare asked for a collective action. The Court found that that allegation did not ­­",
  "Well, I mean, here's how I think it's different, Your Honor. You're right. It is different. But it's different in that this Court has repeatedly said that the class has no independent legal status until it's certified. And it's different in that, in Genesis Healthcare, you had a statutory right to a collective action, but the Court said that that didn't trump Article III. And here you just ­­",
  "Well, it was still pretty important to the plaintiff in that case, and it was a statutory right. And here the question is: When the individual claim drops out, is there any basis for the action to proceed simply so that, on the ­­ on the potential that a class could be certified?",
  "And that ­­ that's the cost­sharing argument that was made in Roper. And if I could say a couple things about that. First, the plaintiff in this case, unlike the plaintiff in Roper, never made that argument below. He never argued in favor of cost sharing. In fact, the complaint, if you look on page 21 of the Joint Appendix, touts that he has all the financial resources necessary to bring this action. Second of all, in Roper the Court relied on that interest solely for the purpose of allowing the appeal from the denial of certification when the mooting event occurred after the denial of certification. So there you had a real relation back issue. If the Court had been wrong in denying certification, then the case never would have become moot in the first place. Here, the mooting event takes place before certification. There's nothing to relate back to.",
  "And a court can make that determination, just like a court can determine whether or not a defendant who says he's going to stop his action has truly voluntarily ceased his action.",
  "Well, I think it absolutely does, just like it would in the voluntary cessation context. I ­­ I want to be clear because I think we have a little bit of a ­­",
  "The ­­ the reason is, when ­­ when one party throws in the towel, the match is over. Here, the question is whether there's an Article III case or controversy when the defendant is no longer fighting over the result as to the thing at issue. That's ­­ those are the words that the Court used in the San Pablo case. That's an Article III determination.",
  "And functionally ­­",
  "A ­­ a court can certainly make the determination of whether or not they have provided complete relief. In a case like this where you're dealing with liquidated damages, that's easy. It's just ­­",
  "No ­­ well, you're right, Your Honor. That's the Rule 68 offer. If you go on page 57a of the Petition Appendix, there's the freestanding settlement offer, which isn't a Rule 68 offer. The other thing about Rule 68 is it's really not designed for the situation of complete relief. It's designed for the situation where the defendant and plaintiff have to gamble, essentially, over whether or not an offer for less than complete relief is a sufficient ­­ they ­­ they want to settle on that basis. In this case you had a freestanding settlement offer. It provided for complete relief, and so the question is whether or not the ­­ the plaintiff had a personal stake in the case sufficient ­­ in the outcome of the case sufficient to keep this case alive. Justice Kennedy, to get back to your point about settlement ­­ and I think what's important to recognize here is ­­ here's our position: When the offer of complete relief is made and when a court has determined that it is, indeed, for complete relief, then the case has to come to an end. Now, whether you say it's ­­ it's moot at that precise moment or whether you say it starts the ball rolling down the hill towards a dismissal or entry of judgment for the plaintiff based on the terms of the offer, the point is ­­ is that when the defendant has offered everything, the courts can't go ahead and expound on the law. Now, this Court has repeatedly said, when it's not necessary to decide, it's necessary not to decide. And that's the fundamental principle at stake here. Defendant has offered everything, and the plaintiff ­­",
  "Well, and that would be an unusual situation if it did, Your Honor. I think ­­",
  "And ­­ and ­­ you know, Roper's another case where there was an offer that the Court never ­­ it didn't really question in that case whether the offer mooted the claim on the merits. The only question was whether they could appeal the denial of certification. Here the plaintiff's position is asking this Court to go far beyond what the Court recognized in Roper and really to recognize a substantive right to class adjudication. At the end of the day, that's what they're insisting on. As soon as they filed their class complaint ­­",
  "I ­­ I don't think you can describe it as a procedural right. This Court has said that Rule 23 is a procedural mechanism. When the requirements are met, it said that there's no separate legal status for the class until the class is certified. In the Jacobs ­­",
  "Well.",
  "Okay. Well, first of all ­­",
  "Yes. First of all, the Court has recognized two narrow exceptions, Your Honor. First is an appeal from the denial of class certification when the mooting event happens while a case is on appeal. That's the Roper case. And the second is the inherently transitory exception. Now, it's not even clear that the Respondents are asking for either exception, because I don't see \"relation back\" or \"inherently transitory\" in their red brief. But it's clear that the first exception doesn't apply because this case doesn't involve an appeal from the denial of class certification, and it's clear that the second case exception doesn't apply, \"inherently transitory,\" because in Genesis, this Court made clear that the concern of the so­called picking off wasn't a sufficient basis to say that a claim was inherently transitory. That exception doesn't deal with the defendant's litigation conduct; it deals with whether the claimant's conduct is going to recur, like a pretrial temporary detention situation. This case doesn't fit into this ­­ that exception at all. What ­­",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "So a ­­ a couple answers to that, Your Honor. First, that's not an issue in this case. They've never disputed Campbell­Ewald's ability to pay. Second of all, I think a court can determine that the plaintiff ­­ the defendant is ready and able to pay. And third of all, in the situation where the case is dismissed for mootness based on the terms of the offer and then it turns out that they can't execute the offer ­­ I mean, that's a situation where the court ­­ the plaintiff can go back to the court and say, you based ­­ you ­­ you dismissed the case on an erroneous factual premise. That's like the Judge Friendly decision that we cite in our reply brief. So that situation is not going to happen. And all of these practical concerns are going to go away if this Court recognizes in this case that a defendant's offer of complete relief ends any case or controversy over the individual claim. The case goes away. The plaintiffs are going to accept the offer.",
  "I don't think ­­ it certainly wouldn't be a classic certification decision factor, Your Honor. And I think ­­­ I mean, one of the reasons why the court insists on an Article III case or controversy is that it wants to insist that it doesn't expound on the law, but ­­",
  "Well, it's a ­­ it's certainly a very unusual situation where the personal representative has been made whole. Now ­­ now, there's some claims ­­",
  "Well, I suppose that he could in terms of the person represented, but the real question is: Why would you want a court to expound on the law difficult questions about certification, as this Court knows as well as anyone, when there's no case or controversy to begin with, when the defendant has offered the plaintiff everything? And then the question is: If his individual claim drops out, what interests ­­ to put it in Judge Friendly's terms, what interest does a ­­ does a plaintiff have ­­",
  "Well, you're right, Your Honor, about that distinction, but I think what Judge Friendly said applies equally here, which is that when a plaintiff loses his individual interests in the case, he has no ­­ no right to ­­ to litigate on a class action because it might benefit others. He also pointed out that the offer of complete relief in this case, in this kind of situation, puts the plaintiff in a better position than a default judgment. The plaintiff has everything that he asks for. He's walking away with the money. And to your point earlier, Justice Sotomayor, just to be clear, the offer in this case included a stipulation to an injunction as well. So that ­­",
  "Well if ­­ you can't undo past conduct.",
  "No, but ­­",
  "Well, three responses to that. First, in the San Pablo case, for example, the court's decision specifically makes clear that the plaintiff refused that offer. Second of all ­­",
  "That's ­­ that's, of course, right, Your Honor. But, of course, if acceptance was the rule, then it's a little bit odd that the court didn't mention the fact that he didn't accept it at all. The other point I wanted to make in response to Justice Sotomayor's question is: We cited a long footnote in our opening brief that has many cases recognizing this principle, and in our reply brief, we cite the holding case out of the English courts. It's an 1840 case, and that case is exactly on point. It involved a situation where a claim was brought for a debt, the defendant came in and said, here's your money, and the court in that case ­­ the plaintiff refused to accept it. And the court in that case said it had a beholden duty to end the case, given that the ­­ the defendant had offered everything that the ­­",
  "­­ plaintiff was seeking.",
  "So I think first ­­ just a quibble ­­ I do think there's a longstanding practice of recognizing that when the defendant has been offered everything he could secure, the case goes away. Second of all, and I think, you know, maybe more important: I mean, I would say that your dissent in Genesis Healthcare itself ­­ itself recognizes that acceptance can't be the rule in all cases. I mean, you recognize in the situation where the plaintiff doesn't accept for obstinacy or madness, but once you're there, you recognize that acceptance can't be the rule. And that's got to be right, because in the voluntary cessation context, we don't require the plaintiff to accept that.",
  "And ­­ and I think here ­­ I mean, once we're at the point where we realize this case can't ­­ can't go on any further because he's been offered everything as the case comes to this Court, then the ­­ then the question for the Court is, well, how do we dispose of it? Do we tell the lower court to dismiss it as moot, or do we tell the lower court to enter judgment for plaintiff based on the terms of the offer, at which point it clearly becomes moot? I mean, this Court ­­",
  "No, there hasn't been ­­",
  "There hasn't been an adjudication, Your Honor. It's judgment entered based on the terms of the offer. It's not a judgment adjudicating the claim on the merits. It's not a judgment where the Court is picking a winner or loser. The Court is simply recognizing the fact that the defendant has offered everything and a judgment is entered ­­",
  "Well, first of all, a judgment is just technically an order disposing of the case. I mean, we went back and looked, and you yourself as a district court judge issued judgments in cases where you dismissed it as moot. It just reflects that the case has come to an end. Second of all, what we've recognized as an alternative position is the Sixth Circuit position here, which is that ­­ that in this situation you can dispose of the case by entering judgment for plaintiff based on the terms of the offer. That's not a judgment on the merits because it's not adjudicating the claim on the merits. It's not picking a winner, not involving the court picking a winner ­­ a loser or winner, and it resolves all of the hypothetical concerns that they've raised about eliminating the case before they actually have the check in hand. And that's ­­ that's an appropriate way of disposing of this case. And no one can argue that there's an Article III interest in ­­ in proceeding with the litigation once they have a judgment disposing of the case. And we're back to ­­",
  "Your Honor, those are ­­ those are ­­ accord and satisfaction, for example, is a contract­based doctrine. It happens where ­­ where payment is made before the case gets to litigation. There's ­­ there's no principle. Once the ­­ once the litigation begins, the principle that controls is Article III. Article III's case and controversy requirement requires that the plaintiff had a ­­ have a personal stake, a live personal stake in the outcome of the case at all stages of the proceeding. And on the first question, our point is that once you've been offered everything you could receive ­­ and again, that's how the case comes here, and he has been offered everything that he could get through a favorable judgment on his individual claim ­­ there's no longer a personal stake in litigating that case to the outcome ­­",
  "Just as was true in Genesis Healthcare, the would­be class representative is in the same exact position he was before this case goes away, because he can still file his own claim. He can settle that claim. He can provide ­­ he can file his own class action. And you know, here, what we're arguing about is policy arguments about whether or not the Court ought to find some basis to keep the class action alive.",
  "That's not an appropriate determination of Article III.",
  "Well, this ­­ this gets to the concern of, these sorts of class actions are going to go away. First of all, it's ­­ it's hard to feel too sorry about the plaintiffs who have everything that they could possibly ask for when we're talking about absent people. As a practical matter in these sorts of class actions, what they get is pennies on the dollars of their claim. The big money goes to the class action lawyers here. All of this can be addressed if Congress wants to address it by addressing these policy concerns.",
  "Well, in the same ­­",
  "It's just like the voluntary cessation context, Your Honor. In that case ­­",
  "He ­­",
  "He could ask for a unicorn, Your Honor. The point ­­",
  "The court can make that determination. And you'd want it to make that determination before it went ahead and adjuted the claim on the merits, whether it's ­­ it's deciding difficult questions on certification, whether it's going ahead and making law in TCPA, whether it's going ahead and making law in an immunity ­­",
  "They can dispose of it ­­",
  "The court can make that mootness determination. It does in every other context in which mootness arise. And Article III wants the court to make that determination before the court goes on and expounds on the law. If I could return ­­ reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First, the Article III principle that should control the resolution of this case was stated in the San Pablo case on page 314. The court said the court is not empowered to decide moot questions or declare rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case before it. And that's exactly what's at issue before the case ­­ the Court today.",
  "I'm ­­ I'm not talking about the technical distinction of the cases. I'm talking about the Article III principle that controls here.",
  "Your Honor ­­",
  "Your Honor, a court ­­",
  "A court makes the determination that the offer is complete, just as it would make a determination that the defendant had in fact voluntarily ceased his conduct.",
  "Okay. Thank you.",
  "And ­­ and the Court did it in this case.",
  "As it always would for a mootness determination. Of course.",
  "Yes.",
  "Because it could ­­ in this ­­ the case is settled.",
  "Your Honor, I think Justice Scalia had exactly the right answer on this, which is that there's ­­ there's decades, if not centuries, of practice dealing with this situation, and it's a settlement context. Everyone agrees this Court has repeatedly said that the settlement moots the case. That doesn't mean that courts don't have authority ancillary jurisdiction ­­",
  "­­ to dispose of the case.",
  "Well, I don't think ­­",
  "I ­­ I think we're in a ­­ a little bit of a chicken­and­the­egg situation here, Your Honor. This Court has repeatedly said settlements moot cases, and yet courts have authority to enter relief to ­­",
  "Well, we're back to whether or not the plaintiff can force the court to proceed ahead and expound on the law. And on that, I think my friend's presentation ­­",
  "No.",
  "The case can go forward, in their view, and the courts will have to expound on the law. There's no independent interest in receiving a judgment. If that's the rule, then mootness is off the table. In almost any case can the defendant ­­ can always ­­ the plaintiff can always say, I want a judgment. We're ­­ we're down to the question, really, of: How do we get rid of this case? Because I think that even they recognize that the ­­ if the offer is for complete relief, then, the courts below held, the case has to come to an end. There's two options for this Court. One, you hold that the case should be dismissed as moot, and two ­­ if you don't agree with that, then two, you hold that the case should be disposed of by entering judgment for the plaintiff based on the terms of the ­­ of the offer of complete relief. That's the Sixth Circuit rule. You can go and look, as we did. There are plenty of judgments where the courts have implemented that rule. There's no evidence of any difficulty in applying that, and what that does is it disposes of cases in a common­sense fashion. It prevents court from ­­ courts from going ahead and expounding on the law in cases in which they have no business doing so. If I could make one point on the immunity issue: Justice Ginsburg, you're exactly right. They sued the wrong party. MindMatics did everything in this case, and we're at least entitled to immunity from vicarious liability.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To pick up on the questions this morning, I'd like to focus on three things. One, why the record supports the Texas legislature's conclusion in 2009 that the holistic plan at issue was a necessary complement to the State's Top 10 Percent Law; two, why the record shows that Texas's holistic policy has had a meaningful impact on diversity at the University of Texas; and, three, why the record absolutely forecloses any claim that University of Texas has adopted a quota. With respect to the first question of necessity, there are three principle ways in which the record shows that the plan at issue was a necessary complement. First, as Justice Breyer mentioned, there is a significant portion of the admissions pool, all out­of­State students, all students from Texas high schools that don't rank, some of the best high schools in the State, and all students just below the top 10 percent who are nevertheless great students who aren't eligible for admission under the top 10 percent at all. And the Fifth Circuit found that without the consideration of race in the mix for those students, admissions would approach an all white enterprise. Secondly, the record in this case shows ­­",
  "That's right, which is an important component of the class, Your Honor. Second, and I think this goes to your point, Justice ­­",
  "Okay. This goes to the meaningful impact point, and I think there are several ways to address it, Justice Alito. First, what you can do is you can look in the increase in African­American and Hispanic holistic admissions after the consideration of race was added. And what you find is, is that in each year, 2005, 2006, 2007, the percentage of African­American and Hispanics admitted and enrolled under the holistic plan grew. In fact, there was a 70 percent ­­",
  "Your Honor, I think, given the contextualized and individualized nature of that inquiry, that's going to be difficult. But I think the record nevertheless answers your question because you can show a marked increase in diversity under the plan at issue. I just ­­ I've just explained to you how the record confirms that holistic admissions of African­Americans and Hispanics increased markedly in each year. If you look at student body diversity overall, African­American enrollment increased by two, doubled from 2002 to 2008 from about 3 percent to about 6 percent.",
  "Okay.",
  "Your Honor, it's ­­",
  "It's exactly the opposite. This Court has said time and again that you can't assume that minorities think alike just because they have the same skin color. What the University of Texas does is it considers ­­ it takes into account the fact that people who come from different experiences, different backgrounds are going to have different contributions to the class. If you had the situation where all the out­of­State admits or most of the out­of­State admits were coming predominantly from western States, then the University of Texas and any university would try to get out­of­State admits from other parts of the country because it would want the ­­ both perspectives.",
  "No. What stereotyping, Your Honor, is saying, that just because you get a sufficient number of blacks or Hispanics under the 10 percent plan means that you can't look at the class holistically and say, we're not getting a variety of perspectives among African­Americans or Hispanics.",
  "It's ­­ it's not a stereotype at all, Your Honor. It's based on the undeniable fact about the manner in which the top 10 percent plan operates. The Top 10 Percent Law was enacted in response to Hopwood, and there's nothing ­­ there's no challenge to the law in this case that admits many well­deserving students. But the fact is, is that ­­ that the way that the Top 10 Percent Law admits minority students is by admitting those students from the lower­performing, racially identifiable schools. And the way ­­ the reason we know that is because if you look at the bill analysis decided by Justice Ginsburg in her dissent the last time we were here, that analysis specifically says on page 4, \"Because of the persistence of segregation in this State, minority students will be admitted under the top 10 percent plan.\"",
  "We ­­",
  "And the University ­­",
  "Your Honor, the University of Texas applauds those students. It wants those students. Those students are admitted through holistic review as well. Nevertheless, the University can look at an incoming class and determine that not all the perspectives among a particular class of students is being represented. This is straight out of the Harvard plan in Bakke ­­",
  "Your Honor, we've never claimed that all of them do. That's a straw man argument. But if you look at the data, what you would find, in particular look at the 2008 profile that we cited in our last brief on page 33, you do find that on balance, there is a difference in background of the students, African­American, Hispanic students, coming in through the holistic plan versus the top 10 percent plan. And that's no surprise, given the obvious purpose of the top 10 percent plan. The purpose of the holistic review plan is to take into account all considerations.",
  "Your Honor, it's set forth in the 2004 proposal which is in the supplemental joint appendix. It's elaborated by the deposition testimony. Let me give you some ­­ a few pieces of that. Number one is, is the University made clear it was pursuing the educational benefits of diversity in the broad sense specifically recognized by this Court. This is on pages 1 through 3 of the Supplemental Joint Appendix. Number two, the University made clear that in its judgment the top 10 percent plan, in particular as it grew to crowd out the class, was compromising its educational objectives. That's on page 25a and 31a of the Supplemental Joint Appendix. Number three, the University made clear that because of the decrease in student body diversity under the very race­neutral policies that our opponents are asking this Court to impose, that additional measures were necessary to make sure that it was achieving its educational objectives. All of that is laid out in far more detail, frankly, than it was in Grutter or that it was in the Harvard plan. It's amplified by the deposition testimony. In particular, look at the testimony of Ms. Iship and Mr. Walker. And I can elaborate that ­­",
  "­­ on that, if you would like.",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "It absolutely has. We ­­ in the record, Your Honor, it's established that we have reviewed it on an annual basis. We reviewed it on a five­year basis. I was personally involved in part of that.",
  "Your Honor ­­",
  "We would look to a number of different ­­",
  "And ­­ and I'll answer that question. We looked ­­ we looked both to student body enrollment. We do look to classroom diversity. We look at feedback from students; from faculty ­­ after all, this is an academic judgment, as this Court said in the Fisher case, and certainly said in the Grutter and the Bakke case ­­ we look to ­­ to the racial climate, including incidents. There's briefs before you in the Black Students Association brief, Latino Organization briefs ­­",
  "It's ­­ well ­­",
  "And look at the facts, Your Honor. In 2002, you had 272 African­American enrollees out of a class of 8,000. Even Judge Garza recognized in note 11 of his decision that the University of Texas had not achieved its critical mass or educational benefits in 2004. So I don't think that that seriously is debatable. If it is, then we should have a remand and an opportunity to put in more evidence ­­",
  "Your Honor, I'm not here to give you a date, but what I would say is this: There are systematic problems that these problems ­­ that these policies are attempting to address, including the test score gap between ­­ between African­Americans and Hispanics. And ­­ and the record in this case overwhelmingly shows that without the addition of race, student body diversity suffered, particularly among African­Americans.",
  "And we ­­ we appreciate the ­­",
  "Your Honor, as soon as we ­­ we can achieve the same ­­ sufficient numbers for the educational benefits of diversity without taking race into account, we will no longer take race into account. The strict­scrutiny inquiry focuses on whether or not there are race­neutral alternatives, which I think really is the way to police this. And in this case, because it's backward­looking, you look to whether or not the University policies in place for seven years ­­ this is a distinct case. You have a record of seven years of trying the race­neutral alternatives that they're proposing, top 10 percent, plus race­blind holistic review. And the record tells you what happened.",
  "University of Texas does not do legacy, Your Honor. But if you look at what happened ­­ and this is the second reason why it's necessary ­­ it's ­­ it's ­­ I don't think it's debatable that student body diversity suffered at the University of Texas under the policies that they're asking this Court to impose. And in particular under African­Americans where you had evidence of glaring racial isolation, certainly in the classroom where 90 percent of the classes, the most common size, are zero or one African­American ­­",
  "Let me answer that in two ways. One, doubling the enrollment of African­American students, which happened from 2002 to 2008, is going to increase diversity in the classroom. And we've looked at that, and it has. Secondly, with respect to diversity among particular majors, University does take holistic consideration of where ­­ which schools students are admitted to as well. So its policy addresses that concern as well. But what the record does show, Your Honor, conclusively, I think, is that diversity languished at the University of Texas in the period where we had race­blind holistic admissions plus the top 10 percent, and that the plan at issue here was necessary to supplement that. The Texas legislature found that.",
  "It has.",
  "Your Honor, we've looked at that, in part, in the five­year analysis ­­",
  "There's a different breakdown there, Your Honor. But I think there's two dimensions to this diversity issue. One is just the glaring racial isolation that existed, particularly among African­Americans. And then two is an effort, through the addition of holistic review, to admit minorities from different viewpoints, experiences, and perspectives. That gets back right to the core of the essence of the diversity embraced by this Court in Bakke. If you look at the Harvard brief in the Bakke case, page 17, it specifically says, \"Our interests in the educational benefits of diversity would not be met if all of minority students were ­­ were coming from depressed socioeconomic backgrounds.\"",
  "And I would ­­",
  "I don't think it's ­­ it's seriously debatable, but if we need evidence on this, let us put it into the record that a class selected by the holistic consideration of numerous factors is going to be more diverse in a way that promotes the University's educational interests than a class selected by a single factor. And let me give you the deposition ­­",
  "And there's two problems with that. One, they're not ­­ minority students are not going to be selected. It's going to become, as the Fifth Circuit found, essentially an all­white enterprise. That's the first problem. And then the second ­­",
  "No. It's not zero, Your Honor. But take 2002 for example. 272 African­Americans out of a class of 8,000. That's glaring racial isolation. University of Texas concluded that was unacceptable. And I don't think that that's seriously debatable. But again, if we need more evidence on why having 90 percent of our classrooms of the most common size was zero or one African­American doesn't achieve our educational objectives ­­",
  "Your Honor ­­",
  "Your Honor, we can talk about different classes, but ­­ but this Court has ­­ has accepted in Bakke and Grutter, and I think it accepted again in Fisher I, that student body diversity is a compelling interest.

  "Yes.",
  "Your Honor, we didn't ­­ we ­­ we ­­ we specifically pointed to evidence on standing, and we talked about that, if the Court would like to supplement the evidence in other respects. And I ­­ and I think, frankly, we would be entitled to a remand. If you look at the Grutter case, for example, this Court rejected the argument that the percentage plan was an adequate substitute for the holistic consideration of race. It didn't require evidentiary findings on that. But if the Court thinks these findings are necessary, then the University of Texas can put in ­­ certainly put in additional evidence in the record showing why these holistic students, selected across the broad diversity recognized by Bakke, contribute meaningfully to the class in this issue.",
  "I ­­ I think certainly you can conclude, Your Honor, that, where you have all out­of­State students, all students from the best schools in Texas that don't rank, students who fall just below that 10 percent but nevertheless are great students, if we're not getting adequate diversity out of the ­­ that class, special class of students, we're not meeting our educational objectives. If you have ­­ if you have doubts about whether or not the record ­­",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, let me ­­ let me answer that question.",
  "First, we did look at that. We had seven years of experience under the race­blind holistic admissions policy. And what the university found ­­ this is at page 31 and 25a of the Supplemental Joint Appendix ­­",
  "Race­blind ­­",
  "­­ race­blind holistic, and up to 10 ­­",
  "Absolutely. And what we found was that, particularly as the top 10 percent plan began to grow and crowd out more of the admissions pool, the university was not meeting its educational objectives. That ­­ that's what it found specifically. It stated that on page 31a of the Supplemental Joint Appendix. We also knew ­­ and it's interesting: The Texas legislature found that the holistic plan was a necessary complement. The Texas district court judge did. The Texas Court of Appeals judge and his colleague did. And all ­­ what all of them recognized is the obvious way in which the top 10 percent plan operates with respect to ­­",
  "Your Honor, I ­­ I think the first thing I would like to say is that it's a different way. And I don't mean to dodge the question by that. But what I would say is, if ­­ if that's a meaningful difference, then this plan is ­­ is in an even stronger light than the plan in Bakke and the Harvard plan. Because the University of Texas has heeded this Court's message. It's taken three­quarters of the class that it selects through a facially race­neutral system, the Top 10 Percent Law. And what we're here debating is whether or not it can complement that policy by taking race into account for a quarter. Now, it may actually be that the university could achieve more diversity through the pure Grutter­Bakke­style plan, but we think, working with the Texas legislature, we've come up with a hydrid ­­ hybrid plan that works together to both ­­ to both address this Court's concerns about using race too much in the process, and addressing University of Texas's legitimate, core academic concerns about compiling a class that's diverse in all the ways that are appreciated by Bakke. If I could read one aspect of the deposition testimony here. This is from Ms. Ishop on page 253a of the Joint Appendix, and she explains why top 10 percent alone is not sufficient. What she says is, quote, \"Considering an applicant on the basis of just their test score and class rank leaves out all of that life experience and circumstantial experience that an applicant faces. It's also important not ­­ not only to how they developed and the type of student they are, but also to what they contribute to our campus.\" That's what the holistic policy adds. If you exclude race from that mix, you not only aren't looking at the individual in all its respects ­­ and race still does matter in Austin and across this country ­­ but you're ­­ you're preventing the university from rounding out its class from complementing the single­minded way that the Top 10 Percent Law to achieve its diversity objectives in a way that is narrowly tailored to its interests, which this Court has found compelling.",
  "Well ­­",
  "No, it's not, Your Honor. I mean, look, we think that the record is sufficient. We think that the Fifth Circuit got it right. But ­­ but to be clear, we can certainly put in plenty of additional evidence. I mean, there was a trial in Grutter, as Your Honor pointed out in your decision in Fisher I. There's been no trial here. There is, at a minimum ­­ if ­­ if ­­ if our evidence doesn't cross the bar on strict scrutiny, at a minimum, we put in triable issues of fact on whether or not the holistic plan was a necessary offset, whether or not the university was achieving its educational objectives in an environment in which you had 272 African­American students enroll out of an incoming class of 8,000, an environment in which 90 percent of the classrooms had ­­ the most common side had zero to one.",
  "Well, I ­­ I ­­ I think you can make those going in the university's favor. And one aspect of that, frankly, is the two­court rule that this Court usually applies. Both the district court and the court of appeals looked at this and made findings ­­",
  "Well, I mean, I don't want to be result­oriented about this, Your Honor. But ­­ but I do think that ­­ that it's one thing to say in this record there are no triable facts, where the ­­ the courts below have gone that way. It's another thing to second­guess. And ­­ and the Court can. It's a summary judgment issue. But it's another thing, I think, to overstep the conclusions of the district court and the court of appeals here. And ­­ and I think it's particularly relevant here when it comes to the operation of the Top 10 Percent Law. Our friends have challenged the fact that the Fifth Circuit discussed the way in which it operated, saying that that's outside the record. If it is, let us put all that evidence directly into the record. But they've never disputed the way in which the Top 10 Percent Law operates. What ­­ what I'd like to say too is, if this Court rules that University of Texas can't consider race, or if it rules that universities that consider race have to die a death of a thousand cuts for doing so, we know exactly what's going to happen. Experience tells us that. University ­­ this happened at the University of Texas after the Hopwood case: Diversity plummeted, especially among African­Americans. Diversity plummeted at selective institutions in California, Berkeley, and UCLA, after Prop 209. And that is exactly what's taking place today at the University of Michigan. Now is not the time, and this is certainly not the case ­­",
  "So this Court ­­",
  "This Court ­­",
  "This Court heard and rejected that argument, with respect, Justice Scalia, in the Grutter case, a case that our opponents haven't asked this Court to overrule. If you look at the academic performance of holistic minority admits versus the top 10 percent admits, over time, they ­­ they fare better. And, frankly, I don't think the solution to the problems with student body diversity can be to set up a system in which not only are minorities going to separate schools, they're going to inferior schools. I think what experience shows, at Texas, California, and Michigan, is that now is not the time and this is not the case to roll back student body diversity in America. Thank you, Your Honors."
