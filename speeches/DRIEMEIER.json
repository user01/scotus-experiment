  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 3731(b) provides the statute of limitations for, quote, a civil action under section 3730. There is no question that Ms. Wilson's claim of retaliation is a claim under section 3730. Petitioner asks the Court to construe section 3731(b) to include an implicit limitation to claims under subsections (a) or (b) - -",
  "Section 3731(c) does not require, in its application, the Court to construe a civil action under section 3730 to mean anything other than what its words import because it only relates to the United States' burden of proof. The petitioner suggested that it implicitly was limited to an action under 3730(a). Well, that's certainly not true because if -- if an action is brought under 3730(b) and the United States intervenes, section 3731(c) establishes the standard of proof. If Congress were to amend section 3730(h) to allow the United States to bring a claim on behalf of the employee who was retaliated against, section 3731(c) would, by its terms, establish the burden of proof that the United States would have to meet. So there is no inconsistency there.",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think that 3731(b) is capable of application exactly as written, and in fact, as we say in our brief, that that is the statute of limitations which most serves the purposes of the statute unlike the alternative the petitioner - -",
  "Well --",
  "No, sir.",
  "There are any - -",
  "Many States have adopted statutes of repose, and they apply to a cause of action that under State law accrues for purposes of statute of limitations upon the discovery of the injury. But a statute of repose can come in and instead tied to the act, say, for instance, in which the date that a product was first sold into the market. And so the cause of action, for purposes of statute of limitations, will not arise in many instances until after the statute of limitations has run because of a statute of repose. So that it's certainly not unheard of in the law.",
  "That's right, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "That's right. There - -",
  "-- there other examples of -- of cases in which the time in which a claim can be brought may have expired before the cause of action accrues.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, in the Bay Area Laundry case and in the Reiter case, the Court has acknowledged that there is a general rule that statutes of limitations start to run when the cause of action accrues. But in each of those case -- cases, the Court was very clear that that was the rule that applied in the absence of contrary indication by Congress. And here we have a very explicit contrary indication by Congress, that the statute of limitations for any civil action under section 3730 runs from the date on which the violation of section 3729 was committed. In other words, Congress has opted here to establish a single uniform statute of limitations for all claims that might arise under the False Claims Act. And as I said before, that serves the purposes of the False Claims Act better, far better certainly, than petitioner's alternative. As we have pointed out, many State statutes of limitations, assuming that one can determine which one applies of the many that might be offered, are much shorter than the statute provided for bringing the qui tam action. As a practical matter, then an employee might be forced to split their claims. If they split their claims, any number of adverse consequences follow. First, they could find themselves barred from bringing a subsequent qui tam action on behalf of the United States by the public disclosure bar of the False Claims Act. The Eleventh Circuit has a rule that says that the two claims are one for purposes of res judicata. So in the Eleventh Circuit, apparently they could be barred by res judicata from bringing a qui tam action. The disclosures in the course of the wrongful termination of retaliation claim action would, of course, alert the defendant to the scope and extent of any Government investigation.",
  "Well, as a practical matter, oftentimes the employer fires the employee as soon as the employer has a sense that the employee is on to something. He doesn't have a full knowledge of what the employee knows and certainly doesn't know that the employee might have told the Government and that the Government is investigating. And that's the purpose of the under seal requirement of the False Claims Act, to allow the Government to conduct a full investigation of the claim, talk to other employees about what was going on. Sometimes the employee really has identified fraud, but may only have identified a portion of the larger scheme of fraud that's going on. And the Government gets to investigate that while the claim is under seal. But in the course of discovery in any wrongful termination suit or retaliation suit, all of that information would become available to the employer. And so the sealed provisions of the FCA would be defeated in large extent. There's also the fact of just the litigation efficiencies of litigating the two claims together.",
  "-- will be the same.",
  "The -- the most close reading of the text would be that any civil action under 3730 can be brought within 3 years of when the official of the United States -- now, we differ from the Ninth Circuit on this. We believe that is only a Government official, in particular a Department of Justice official -- knows of the facts relevant to bringing a cause of action that the United States could bring, i.e., the cause of action under 3730(a). But we think that 3 years from that date in the action under 3730 could be brought, including the qui tam action or including a retaliation action. But that reading is not essential to the position that we advocate here.",
  "Well, of course - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, it - - it does make sense applying it to a retaliation action because it could be, for instance, the employee who was the individual who informed the Government official charged with responsibility to act of the facts that would warrant the United States in filing an action under 3730(a).",
  "That's -- that's possible.",
  "Well, there may be events that - -",
  "There may be instances where the employee would not know that they could take advantage of that provision. But in the Bay Area Laundry case, the Court considered and rejected a virtually identical argument. That case -- the statute of limitations also was stated in the alternative, and the second one was 3 years after the information necessary to the claim had arrived. And the party who was opposed to the position the Court ultimately adopted said that the Court's interpretation of the first of the two alternatives would render the second superfluous. And the Court said, it may be superfluous to this category of claims, but it's not superfluous to other categories of claims, and so that does not prevent us from construing the first provision in the way that we are. So likewise, even if the Court were to conclude that 3731(b)(2) is unavailable to a retaliation claim or unavailable to a qui tam claim, as some courts of appeals have held, it would not mean that 3731(b)(1) is unavailable, just as holding that 3731(b)(2) is unavailable to a qui tam relator would not mean that 3731(b)(1) is unavailable to a qui tam relator. A couple of Justices, Justice Souter - -",
  "Well, again, we believe that the best, most faithful reading of the text is that (b)(2) is available to all causes of action under 3730. The -- Justice Souter asked a question about statistics and the frequency with which the claims are litigated together. In a review of court of appeals decisions, there were 51 court of appeals decisions actually involving a 3730(h) claim. Of those, in 32 the qui tam -- a qui tam claim and a retaliation claim were paired. They were litigated together. In only 5 were both a qui tam action and retaliation claim brought, but brought in separate litigation. So 32 to 5 is the relevant comparison there.",
  "In -- in - -",
  "-- 14 claims an individual brought a retaliation claim but never brought a qui tam suit. It may be that the Government had sought this - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, in - - in fact, if we -- if we look more closely at those 14 cases, 5 of them were dismissed because the plaintiff was not even involved in protected conduct under the statute. So the closer you get to the core of what Congress had in mind, when it enacted the statute, of -- of pulling out employees who have the information that only they have that the Government needs in order to recover fraud, the closer you get to that core, the more likely it is that the claims that are going to be litigated together. And that's the way the Court ought to apply the statute. It's the way Congress wrote the statute, to serve those purposes. The -- I -- I think that the alternative of applying State statutes of limitations raises -- North Carolina does not dispute that, for example, in Florida the -- the analogous statute of limitations under Florida law -- it's the Florida State False Claims Act which has a retaliation provision -- would be 180 days. 180 days is far too short to put together the complicated qui tam complaint that is called for under the False Claims Act.",
  "Excuse me, sir?",
  "Well, Florida may have made an alternative policy decision in terms of wanting the claims to be litigated together or apart. The Congress has established a single uniform statute of limitations which allows the claims to be litigated together, and as I've said, that is in fact the practice that when someone is going to bring a qui tam action, they almost invariably -- there -- there are 5 exceptions - - bring the cases together. If there are no further questions, thank you very much.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In enacting the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress recognized that suits against Federal employees, based upon their official conduct, constituted a very real attack upon the morale of the Civil Service. Congress addressed that concern in two ways. First, it allowed plaintiffs to sue the United States directly, but secondly and importantly, it provided that a plaintiff who took up that opportunity, the judgment in the suit against the United States would constitute a complete bar to any action against the employee.",
  "That's right, Your Honor, and this Court has adopted a practical rather than technical construction of that statute. And the Court has recognized in -- in numerous cases that claims of official immunity are -- warrant immediate appellate review because they can only be effectively vindicated by review at the motion to dismiss stage. And -- and that is the kind of protection that section 2676 provides. It establishes that the judgment in the suit against the United States shall be a complete bar against any action against the employee. So it's the action itself that is precluded, and it is precluded completely. And that --",
  "Well, Your Honor, the -- the Court recognized in the Digital Equipment case that even a claim of res judicata could correctly be characterized as a right to be free from suit, but it said that that wasn't enough. One had to look at the importance of the -- of the value protected, and the --",
  "And -- and the Court --",
  "I'm sure you do. And the Court has recognized in any number of cases that claims of official immunity are the kind that present sufficiently important public interests to warrant an exception to the -- the otherwise rule that appeals can only be had at the final judgment.",
  "Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, because this is like the other claims of immunity that the Court has recognized warrant collateral appeal in Mitchell v. Forsyth or Nixon v. Fitzgerald. It's a kind of official --",
  "That's right, Your Honor. We point out any number of ways in which section 2676 confers an immunity on employees that is broader than the traditional common law rule of res judicata. For example, res judicata would not bar a suit against another party that could not have been joined in the first suit, but by its plain terms, section 2676 would bar such a claim. Likewise, common law res judicata would not bar a second suit to -- to recover a kind of damages that were unavailable in the first, but whereas punitive damages are unavailable in a suit against the United States, section 2676 would plainly bar a second suit against the employee to cover punitive damages.",
  "Well, certainly there is no categorical rule that claims in the nature of claim preclusion are not eligible for immediate appeal under collateral order. In Abney v. United States, for example, the Court upheld immediate appeal of the denial of a -- of a double jeopardy claim, which likewise depends upon the existence of a prior action.",
  "Well, the Constitution does not use the word immunity, nor does the Westfall Act use the word immunity.",
  "That's right. Like the claim of double jeopardy in Abney, the claim of immunity here depends upon the existence of a prior litigation, but as in Abney, the -- the interests that it protects are the interests to be free from the -- the cost burdens distraction of litigation.",
  "Well, I'm not sure that --",
  "Well, it -- it's -- it's not entirely clear that the United States would be subject to a second suit. It -- the -- the susceptibility of the United States to a further suit would be governed by collateral --",
  "That's -- that's right. But -- but what's important here is that the interest protected is the interest of the employee against the -- the distraction -- against the attack on morale. That was the language that the Assistant Attorney General used.",
  "Well, Your Honor, the -- the statute protects against the -- the cost of repetitive litigation, the harassment of the employee of multiple suits. These are the exact same types of interest that the Court has recognized --",
  "It -- well, in this particular FTCA claim, there -- there was no discovery. But as we point out in -- in our brief, FTCA cases, even those dismissed on the basis of the 2680 exceptions, are often resolved only after years of litigation, including often trial. So -- so the harassment is -- is the same. On -- on respondents' view, the judgment bar would not kick in. For example, in a case like Varig Airlines, where this Court upheld the Government's assertion of the -- the discretionary function exception only after 8 years of litigation when the case had been -- gone to the Ninth Circuit two times where there had been a trial and final judgment and --",
  "It would certainly involve the employee. Any trial would -- would inevitably involve the employee in discovery, in -- in appearing at trial as a witness. The -- the Government also is protected by section 2676, as the Assistant Attorney General said. The -- the burden on the Government, because the Government is often called upon to defend employees against suit -- and -- and the Government, having litigated once and obtained a judgment in the first FTCA suit, should not be forced to expend all those resources again in a second suit, this time styled as one against the employee.",
  "Yes.",
  "2676 makes the -- the scope of its application turn on whether there has been a judgment and an action under section 1346(b).",
  "Well, Your Honor, the -- that view of the language, shall not apply, would be inconsistent with this Court's decisions both in United States v. Smith and in FDIC v. Meyer. In United States v. Smith, for example, the plaintiffs had made exactly that argument with respect to shall not apply. They said that -- that 1346 shall not apply to an action that arises in a foreign country. Therefore, section 1346 cannot provide the remedy to which we are supposed to be limited. And the Court rejected precisely that argument.",
  "Well, what they --",
  "Well, take another example why -- why you couldn't read the -- the shall not apply language in that way. The first exclusivity provision of section 2679(a) with respect to sue and be sued agencies -- if you said that 1346(b) shall not apply to a suit against the Postal Service because the suits against the Postal Service regarding miscarriage of letters is excluded from 1346(b) by that same language, shall not apply, well, that would render the Postal Service exception meaningless and you would sue the -- the Postal Service pursuant to its sue and be sued authority instead of suing the United States under 1346(b).",
  "The -- the -- 2679(a) says that the authority of an agency to sue and be sued in its own name shall not extend to claims cognizable under section 1346(b). The argument might be made, with respect to a suit against the Postal Service for miscarriage of the mail, that -- that claim is not cognizable under section 1346(b) because section 2680(b) says that 1346(b) shall not apply to claims relating to the miscarriage of mail. So by the same reading of shall not apply, one would come to the conclusion that -- that the claim relating to the miscarriage of mail is not cognizable under 1346(b), and therefore you sue the -- the Postal Service.",
  "And -- and a -- a claim with respect to the miscarriage of mail is one that comes within the exception. And so that reading of shall not apply has been rejected by the Court in Smith v. United States, likewise is inconsistent with the Court's decision, FDIC v. Meyer, and would render it simply ridiculous with respect to claims against the Postal Service.",
  "That's right.",
  "Right. And -- and --",
  "Exactly, and in that sense, that reading of shall not apply is simply inconsistent with the Court's holding in United States v. Smith.",
  "Well, I think what it -- what it means is that -- what it -- what it has been understood to mean is that the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity. It -- the United States has not subjected itself to liability on claims of the nature of those exceptions. And that's how the Court has described it in any number of cases, that the exceptions in 2680 mark the limits of the extent to which the United States --",
  "Well, there --",
  "-- there are any number of things wrong in our view. First, Congress has, as Your Honor recognized, created an express exception for Bivens claims in 2679(b), but it has created no similar exception to -- to 2676 even though prior to passage of the Westfall Act, any number of courts of appeals had construed 2676 to apply to Bivens claims. Further, as respondents recognize, 2676's application at this point is virtually limited because of the Westfall Act to a second case that raises a Bivens claim. So their --",
  "Well, Your Honor, obviously that -- that issue is not presented here because here we have two separate litigation --",
  "But --",
  "Well, the -- the consistent view of the courts of appeals and district courts over 50 years has been that the judgment bar does have some application even when the claims are litigated simultaneously. For example, it's the universal rule among those courts of appeals that have decided the issue that if the plaintiff obtains a judgment against the United States, that that judgment immediately --",
  "Can it be brought? It can be brought.",
  "It -- it can certainly be brought because the judgment bar only comes into effect when there's been a judgment. So it could be brought. But as I was saying, the -- the courts are unanimous in holding that if both of those claims were to proceed through litigation and to trial and there were to be a judgment in the action under the FTCA against the United States, that that would immediately bar any recovery against the employee. And that's been the view, again, for some 50 years now. So --",
  "Well, in -- in a footnote --",
  "-- in our brief we suggest it might not --",
  "And -- and in fact, in -- in re-reading FDIC v. Meyer in preparation for oral argument, footnote 7 of that decision suggests that that would be a judgment in an action under 1346(b). FDIC v. Meyer was saying that it would, nonetheless, be cognizable under 1346(b) because the allegation was that they were acting within the scope. So -- so perhaps we should not have conceded that. But it could still be that the -- the judgment bar wouldn't apply. It would be an action in -- under -- a judgment in an action under 1346(b), but the judgment bar protects an employee of the Government. And -- and that's a defined term and it's defined in the way that suggests the person acting within the scope of their employment, advancing the purposes of the agency. So there -- there might be a reason why the judgment bar itself would not apply to a claim where the determination was that the person was not acting within the scope of employment.",
  "It -- Your Honor, it would not, I think, cover a claim that -- where the dismissal was curable, where the person could go and exhaust their claim. But the test of whether --",
  "They have -- they have 2 years to bring the administrative claim. They have 6 months to bring the suit in court after the administrative claim has been resolved. And the -- the reason --",
  "That's right. The -- the statute makes the test whether there has been a judgment in an action under 1346(b), and plainly, under any reading of that language, it means where there is a judgment that finally resolves the liability of the United States under section 1346(b), there has been a judgment in an action under 1346(b). And I don't think that the language is susceptible to any other reading. So if the claim, as Your Honor suggested, finally resolves whether the United States could be liable under section 1346(b), then the judgment bar applies. Unless there are no further questions --",
  "I -- I think I'm going to borrow Justice Breyer's response because it's -- it's a little clearer than the -- than the point I was trying to make. And that -- by that same logic, that would mean that the provisions of 2679(b) would not apply to the claim, and that is --",
  "-- precisely the question that was addressed in -- in United States v. Smith, and the Court said that -- that it did apply.",
  "But if 2679(b) did not apply, there would be no basis for substituting the United States and having the claim dismissed. And that was precisely the issue that was addressed in -- in United States v. Smith. So -- so plainly you cannot read it to mean that -- that all of the provisions of the FTCA are simply a nullity or nugatory with respect to such a claim. That -- that -- rather, as Your Honor suggested, what it means is that the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity.",
  "But in FDIC v. Meyer, the Court was very clear that the FTCA is the kind of case which defines jurisdiction by the scope of the waiver of immunity and to -- the claims to which the United States has rendered itself liable. So -- so all of those issues are interrelated, and -- and it reflects the substantive nature of those exclusions. It could not be --",
  "It is true that --",
  "The -- the --",
  "2679(b) applies only to -- to State law causes of action.",
  "That's right.",
  "Well, certainly --",
  "-- we -- we believe that United States v. Smith was right, and that shall not apply cannot have the meaning that Justice Stevens was trying to attribute to it for that reason. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. First, I think it's important to note that respondents concede that the Westfall Act confers a form of official immunity. That statute, like 2676, does not use the word immunity. Rather, it uses the word, any action related to the same subject matter is precluded. And that is virtually indistinguishable from the language of 2676 that -- that establishes a complete bar to any action by reason of the same subject matter. So there is no requirement that Congress invoked particular language to create an immunity. The question is what are the underlying concerns that are protected? And the respondents have admitted that 2676, like the Westfall Act, was intended to protect employee morale against the threat of personal liability when they were acting for the Government, as well as the distraction and cost of defending against suit. This Court, in fact, in Gilman --",
  "Well, Your Honor, I -- I admit that Congress --",
  "-- Congress addressed the -- only part of -- of the problem. But as Justice Stevens recognized, plaintiffs would want to sue the solvent defendant, and that's why the -- making the Government itself subject to suit was part of the deal. And -- and Congress understood that plaintiffs were going to take up that option. And that's why, up until the -- this Court's adoption of Bivens, there were virtually no decisions about 2676 because plaintiffs just didn't try. This Court in Gilman, an early case relating to 2676, recognizes that -- that the statutory provision was intended to address precisely these types of concerns, morale of employees, the same concerns that have led this Court and Congress in other contexts to recognize other forms of -- of official immunity. And this one is equally subject to immediate review. Respondents suggest, considering for a moment, what Congress would have expected in 1946 when it initially enacted this, and -- and I think that that is helpful. There is -- it is quite clear 2676 is explicit, that Congress did not expect the end of the litigation against the United States under the FTCA to mark the beginning of the litigation against the employee in his personal suit. And -- and respondents offer the example of the postal carrier as one of those quintessential cases that Congress meant to address. But, of course, the postal exception to the FTCA, another exception in 2680, 2680(b), would bar many claims against the United States relating to a postal carrier's misdirection of the mail. Now, respondents would have the Court believe that if that suit was brought against the United States and the United States was found not to be liable because of that exception, that the plaintiffs were free -- and Congress intended that the plaintiff be free -- to then go sue the poor mail carrier himself personally.",
  "With respect to section 2676, Bivens claims today, after the enactment of the Westfall Act, stand in the same footing as common law claims stood prior to the enactment of the Westfall Act. In other words, prior to Westfall, you could bring a common law claim against an employee, but if you brought a suit against the United States, the judgment in that suit would bar the common law claim against the employee. In other words, the plaintiff had to make a choice. Likewise, when Congress enacted Westfall and said you no longer have a choice with respect to common law claims, those have to be brought against the United States, it left the plaintiffs with a choice with respect to constitutional claims. They could choose to pursue a Bivens remedy, but if they sue the United States on those claims, the judgment and the action under 1346 would be a complete bar to any action against the employee.",
  "That's right. And an additional concern of Congress was that the Government would be forced to defend against the suit twice. In effect, the cost of litigation might be borne by the Government in both cases.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is nothing in either the habeas rules or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that deprives the District Court of its authority sua sponte to recognize the untimeliness of a habeas petition. To the contrary, to the extent the rules speak to the issue at all, they confirm that in light of the significant social cost of Federal review of State Court convictions, the Federal Courts have a unique responsibility to weed out unmeritorious claims and to enforce the limitations on habeas review. Rule 4 imposes an obligation on the court to dismiss unmeritorious petitions without even calling for an answer by the State. Now, Rule 4 is not applicable here, but the absence of an obligation to note the deficiency sua sponte does not connote a prohibition on acting sua sponte; rather, it suggests that it lies in the court's discretion. That is exactly how this Court addressed similar question in Granberry, where it rejected the two extremes -- one, recognizing the limitation as jurisdictional, that the court was obligated to raise it sua sponte, but also rejecting the opposite extreme, that the court was prohibited to address an issue that had not been preserved in the District Court.",
  "It's not really a special rule that we're advocating.",
  "The relevant analogy in the civil context is not to what a court would do with a statute of limitations defense in the civil context, it is to what would the court do with respect to an affirmative defense that, like the habeas limitations, implicates broader social interests?",
  "Well, the Court recognized -- Arizona v. California is an example of the broader social interests that are implicated by the affirmative defense of res judicata. And the Court noted, in Arizona versus California, that it would be appropriate for the court to raise that defense sua sponte. And, of course, Plaut versus Spendthrift Farm says the same thing.",
  "Well, our point is that it is a matter for the court's discretion. And there may well be circumstances where it would be an abuse of discretion to interject a timeliness objection. For example, if the case had gone on for years, and a trial had been held, as Your Honor suggested in the question earlier, that might well be an abuse of discretion, but it would not -- for example, take the case where the District Court had dismissed, at the outset, on the merits, and it went up to the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals said, \"You know, that merits issue is a very difficult one. And, in fact, we think we might have to remand for an evidentiary hearing on that issue. But, you know, this case was untimely filed. We can dispose of it on that basis. And we can save all of those judicial and party resources by addressing that issue now.\" We think that would be an appropriate exercise of the court's discretion. Here, as Your Honor noted earlier, this was the first thing that happened in the District Court after the filing of the petition, the answer, and the reply. There was no waste of judicial resources by the fact that it was raised sua sponte by the court in the first thing that the court did after that briefing. There was no prejudice to the Petitioner, because it was omitted from the State's responsive pleading. There is -- as the Court said in Granberry, the failure to plead it perhaps waives the District -- the State's opportunity to insist on the defense. The State, because it said, in its answer here, erroneously, that the petition was timely filed, or if it had said nothing, would have waived its opportunity to stand on, and insist on, that defense. But it is not an absolute forfeiture. It does not bar the party from suggesting at a later time, \"We would like to amend,\" or, in this case, the court to note it sua sponte. The court did, here, of course, give the Petitioner every opportunity --",
  "We believe that the court is not absolutely limited by the defenses --",
  "-- asserted by --",
  "Yes. Yes. The court is not absolutely limited by the affirmative defenses asserted by the State. For -- and that is perhaps most easily seen with respect to affirmative defenses such as failure to exhaust, nonretroactivity. If the court was going to have to assess a brand-new constitutional claim that the habeas petitioner --",
  "-- was asserting --",
  "That's right. And obviously, as the State suggested, if the State didn't want to stand on the statute of limitations defense because, for example, it was particularly messy, there was going to be a lot of litigation about equitable tolling, it would in inappropriate for the court to insist on litigating that issue. But if, for example, the State said, \"Well, you know, if we didn't stand on this defense, instead this Petitioner would go back to the State Court, and the State's Courts are going to be very hospitable to this claim. We think you're more likely to deny relief, so we'd rather have it litigated here,\" it would inappropriate for the State to try to force the Federal Court to litigate that issue instead of the State Court. These are all fact- specific, case-specific considerations. And that's what the Court did in Granberry. It remanded -- after setting aside both extreme positions, it remanded to the Court of Appeals for a case-specific application of discretion. As to the question of whether the Eleventh Circuit here believed that there was an absolute obligation, I think that it's relevant to note that, although there was one point at which it said, \"The court was obligated to enforce the statute of limitations\" -- and, of course, that's true if the State has preserved the defense -- there were three other points in the Court of Appeals opinion where it used discretionary or nonmandatory language. For example, at petition appendix 4(a), the court said that the District Court \"may dismiss.\" At the petition appendix 5(a), it said that the State's failure to raise \"does not bar\" the court from acting sua sponte. Again, at petition appendix 6(a), the State's concession, quote, \"does not compromise the authority of the District Court.\" All of those are phrased in more permissive language --",
  "Well, perhaps the ­ - perhaps the even most clear indication of what the Court of Appeals viewed this is its citation to Jackson as an application of Jackson. And in Jackson there is no question, because Jackson said, quote, \"The District Court possessed the discretion to raise sua sponte.\" And the -- and the magistrate judge, as the State's counsel, mentioned -- in footnote 1 of its opinion, cites that same standard and makes clear that it's raising this at a -- as a matter of its discretion. So, remand for the exercise of discretion would be -- serve no purpose in this case. If there are no further questions --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: In the Westfall Act Congress provided an absolute immunity for Federal employees for acts taken within the scope of their employment and it went further and provided that when the Attorney General certifies that the employee was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, that that issue of Federal immunity is to be decided by the Federal court. It is the Attorney General's assertion of this Federal defense of immunity that satisfies article III just as the employee's own assertion of immunity satisfies article III under the Federal Officer Removal statute and just as a, in other circumstances a plaintiff's assertion of a claim under Federal law satisfies article III.",
  "Well, I think that the, the -- that would probably be a defect in removal procedure rather than a jurisdictional defect but even if it is - -",
  "Well, Your Honor even if that is a case that would be removed without jurisdiction, that case is quite different from this case because this case - -",
  "Well, the issue that is not subject to further review for purposes of jurisdiction is the Attorney General's certification that the employee was acting within scope. The statute doesn't provide that the Attorney General's certification that it is a civil action is conclusive but only the Attorney General's certification that the employee was acting within scope is conclusive for purposes of removal. That's the essential element of the Federal defense and that's what satisfies article III jurisdiction. And in fact, this Court in the Willingham case recognized that an employee could assert a claim of Federal immunity even though he was also at the same time denying that he caused any harm to the plaintiff.",
  "Well if anything the language of the Westfall Act is broader because as Your Honor emphasized earlier, the statute, the Westfall act provides that the Attorney General is to certify that at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose the employee was acting within the scope. So arguably the necessary question is what was the employee doing at the time. The Federal Officer Removal statute is somewhat narrower because it requires that the claim arise out of the, the acts taken under color of office.",
  "That's right. And that's what the Attorney General did here, certified that Mr. Haley was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose. And as several - -",
  "You are correct that our view is that yes, the Attorney General can certify in that case. The issue is really one along a continuum as I think Your Honor has recognized. Of on, on the one extreme, one might say that the Attorney General must accept all of the plaintiff's allegations as true. And, and I don't think that anybody here is arguing that.",
  "That was the position of the district court, although I don't think the Petitioner is now advocating that view. And that view would certainly be inconsistent; it would create the anomaly that the Attorney General's authority to certify scope and to assert the immunity on behalf of the employee would be narrower than the employee's own authority to assert the immunity, because again going back to the Willingham case, the Court never asked whether it would be within the scope of employment for the prison officials to have maliciously tortured the prisoner; rather the defense was we didn't harm the prisoner but anything that happened between us and the prisoner happened within the scope of our employment. And so the Attorney General's authority to certify has to be at least as broad as that in our view.",
  "The -- I think I do. In our view - -",
  "In our view, it would be anomalous that the, that the more innocent employee would be deprived of the benefits of the Westfall Act, and if I could use a more simple - -",
  "Well, I don't think that that could be the end of it. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, reality is much murkier than the black or white and even in the hypothetical that Your Honor poses, it is quite possible that as the case progresses, the plaintiff is going to attempt to introduce evidence that is much more ambiguous as to whether the employee was acting within the scope or not. If I could use a simple example of assault. If the, if a supervisor is dressing down her employee for, for inadequate work, the employee then sues the supervisor alleging that she assaulted her, shaking her fist right under her nose, threatening harm to her. Even if that would be outside the scope of employment, the employee might say -- the supervisor rather might say, I never raised my hand at all. I raised my voice certainly but I never raised my hand. A third party witness may say well I saw the supervisor wag her finger at the employee but not in a threatening fashion. Now - -",
  "Well, if the employee - -",
  "If the employee was acting within the scope of the employment when she wagged a finger, then a fortiori she was acting within the scope of her employment when she didn't raise her hand at all.",
  "But Congress made, established an absolute immunity where the employee was acting within the scope of employment, and Petitioner agrees that scope of employment is the essential question for immunity. So if in my hypothetical the supervisor was acting within the scope of her employment when she dressed down, raising her voice but not raising her fist, her, her subordinate, then she is protected by the Westfall Act from a claim arising out of the context of that employment.",
  "Your Honor, the Congress enacted the Westfall Act against the presumption of regularity of Federal officials and that is of course what this Court has often said as well, and so I don't think we should construe the statute on the presumption that the Attorney General would, would certify ridiculous cases.",
  "That's right. That would mean that the district court did not on the merits ultimately uphold the defense of immunity, but as the Court said in Mesa, the merits of the immunity defense have nothing whatsoever to do with the question of jurisdiction.",
  "That's right. Lamagno was about whether the certification was reviewable. Your Honor is also correct about the facts of that case. One of the points of dispute between the Government and the plaintiffs there was whether Mr. Lamagno was drunk at the time of the accident, and, and the Attorney General certified on his understanding that Mr. Lamagno was not drunk. And that was upheld by the district court on remand after some discovery and summary judgment type litigation.",
  "That's right. It can be reviewed and the Attorney General's certification is not conclusive for purposes of the substitution.",
  "It is conclusive for purposes of the court's removal jurisdiction.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. That's what happened. But, and in that - -",
  "Well, the procedure for what happens upon the district court's review is not spelled out in the Westfall Act, neither is the review itself in particular. But the, the employee - -",
  "Well, the uniform view of the lower courts is that when the certification is overturned, the effect is to resubstitute the employee as the defendant and it proceeds in Federal court as a pendent claim. The Attorney General's assertion of the defense of immunity which we presume to be colorable because we presume regularity by the Attorney General, confers article III jurisdiction on the courts, even though it may ultimately on the merits be rejected. This Court held in the Carnegie-Mellon case that the district courts have discretion whether to exercise jurisdiction over pendent claims once the Federal question has been resolved. If the courts have discretion to exercise that pendent jurisdiction, then certainly Congress can instruct them to exercise that - -",
  "That's right. Congress has removed the discretion in this class of cases and says that the courts must retain jurisdiction.",
  "Well, the, perhaps, perhaps that's so. Certainly Carnegie-Mellon - -",
  "By its text, the statute speaks to removal and that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal. But I think - -",
  "But the -- as the Court held in Carnegie-Mellon, a remand of pendent claims after the Federal issue has been resolved is not a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction within the meaning of 1447(c). Rather, it is a discretionary remand under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, and so - -",
  "And it would be reviewable. That's why -- that's one of the reasons why the district court's order here is reviewable, because it is not an order of remand authorized by 1447(c) because, first of all, Congress has instructed the courts that they are not to remand.",
  "It is certainly true that the district court - -",
  "No, Your Honor, because here the Court need not go beyond the face of the district court's order to understand what it was doing. The court exercised jurisdiction over the Federal question that was properly brought before it by the Attorney General's certification and this Court's decision in Lamagno. After resolving that, the district court said, having concluded that the United States is not a proper party to this case, the court must now determine whether or not it has jurisdiction, and it also said that the absence of the U.S. as a party to the case destroys the court's jurisdiction. So it's evident that the court understood that it had jurisdiction and that it was a subsequent event that deprived it.",
  "I don't think that that would be consistent with Congress's intent. The - - in all of the Government - -",
  "That is true. But I think that the intent of Congress was the same as this Court, all the members of this Court, recognized in Lamagno. In Lamagno, even the dissenters, the plurality, all acknowledged what Congress intended by the \"conclusive for purposes of removal\" language was to prevent the shuttling back and forth of the case. Once it was removed, it was to stay in Federal court. That was what Congress intended. And one reason - -",
  "That's right. By pendent jurisdiction what, what I meant to convey was that it is within the Court's article III jurisdiction to exercise jurisdiction over the State law claims that were pendent to a Federal claim. Under this Court's judicially developed doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, that is discretionary with the court. But if it is discretionary with the court, then certainly Congress can mandate that the court exercise that jurisdiction and that it would be consistent with article III. But another reason why Congress would have wanted the case to remain in Federal court even if the certification is overturned is, as we've alluded to before, the development of the case subsequent to the certification substitution decision may, may illustrate that the plaintiff's claim does indeed assert facts that were within the scope of employment. The court would at the very - -",
  "No. The case is I think not distinguishable from removals under the Federal Officer Removal statute, where Congress has indicated that it is the Federal defense that confers jurisdiction rather than the Federal claim. Then, the ultimate merits of the Federal defense are irrelevant to the jurisdictional issue. And the Court - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I think that Your Honor's point illustrates that this issue of Federal law is one that Congress has mandated be resolved at the outset by the judge, and if the employee petitions for certification over the Attorney General's objection the statute allows the Attorney General to remove the petition to Federal court and the statute states that the district court shall find and certify whether the employee was acting within the scope.",
  "He can, you are correct. It is at the option of the Attorney General under (d)(3) to remove the case at that point so that the review of his noncertification happens in Federal court. (D)(3), in stark contrast to (d)(2), provides that if the district court holds that the Attorney General was correct that the employee was not acting within the scope the case is to be remanded to State court. So the presence of the remand - -",
  "Yes.",
  "That's right.",
  "The -- I think what that illustrates is that Congress wanted the issue of immunity resolved at the outset of the case by the court. And one reason that that is so essential under the Westfall Act FTCA scheme is that if the immunity - - if the scope of employment issue is resolved in favor of the employee, that has many, many consequences, including that the United States is the proper defendant, exclusive jurisdiction lies in the Federal court, the case must be dismissed until an administrative claim is filed and that avenue is exhausted. All of these procedural and substantive defenses come into play depending on how the scope of employment issue is resolved.",
  "Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I think Justice Breyer's question, though, had to do with the procedure at the certification review stage. That is to be done by the district court sitting without jury and that's because under the statute the Attorney General's certification has the legal effect of making the United States the defendant. The United States -- the action shall be deemed an action against the United States and the United States shall be substituted, and that is true unless and until the certification is overturned. And there is of course no Seventh Amendment right to jury trial against the United States.",
  "I'll respond to anything, Your Honor.",
  "That the remand was not one of the remands authorized by 1447(c) - -",
  "Not just that it was erroneous.",
  "No, Your Honor.",
  "No, Your Honor, I think not. And we have two arguments that both the issues, substitution and remand, are appealable. One is a very specific one and that is that Congress has categorically taken this kind of remand outside the court's authority under 1447(c) by specifically prohibiting remand at all in 2679(d)(2), and that argument of course would not have relevance, I don't think, much beyond this case. And this Court has recognized that Congress can exempt a certain class of orders from the scope of 47(c) and (d) without cross-referencing those provisions. In the Rice case, the Court said that that specific removal provision did not purport to impair or restrict the application of the then equivalents of 747(c) and (d). But clearly 2679(d)(2) does purport to impair the authority to remand by making the certification conclusive for purposes of removal. So with that as our narrowest argument - -",
  "But when Congress specifically prohibited the courts from remanding a case under 2679(d)(2) it certainly did not mean to protect a court that ignored that mandate from review.",
  "If I may, Your Honor? I think, two things: One, that there is a difference between Congress categorically prohibiting a certain kind of remand, and saying that a remand was simply erroneous. And secondly, that that argument would not go to our argument that under Waco, at the very least, the order on substitution is appealable, because it is separate and independent from remand.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Steel Company the Court held that it is impermissible to adjudicate the merits of a case over which the Court may lack jurisdiction. But it is another thing entirely for the Court to decline to exercise jurisdiction that it might well possess. In Ruhrgas clarified, in language that counsel has already quoted, that a court may choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits. Now, the dividing line between a threshold non-merits ground and a merits ground may in some cases be difficult. And the Court has -- members of the Court have disagreed in some cases; but there is an easier set of cases and that is where the Court is declining to exercise jurisdiction and especially where as here, it is doing so in favor of litigation of the substantive dispute in another forum. And this Court has -- has decided already that it is permissible, for example, for a court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction before deciding a difficult question of whether it would possess subject matter jurisdiction over the supplemental claims at all. Forum non conveniens is in the nature of an abstention extension doctrine. In Gulf Oil, one of the first cases of this Court to describe the forum non conveniens doctrine and its factors, analogizes forum non conveniens to a Burford abstention. The Court even in Steel Company acknowledged that abstention on grounds of Younger, for example, would be permissible to decide before resolving a disputed question of jurisdiction.",
  "That's, that's right, Your Honor. And the Court said so in the course of rejecting an argument that because it was conceded that jurisdiction and venue were proper in the Southern District of New York, that the doctrine of forum non conveniens could not apply. The Court said that couldn't be so, because the doctrine of forum non conveniens presupposes the availability of two fora. But the Court did not address the entirely separate question of whether the Court could assume that even I it had jurisdiction, it would not exercise it. And - -",
  "That -- that's right, Your Honor. And in the court already determined it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or if venue was improper, then forum non conveniens would have no work to do. But Gulf Oil certainly didn't address this question of the ordering of these restful matters. And of course the doctrine of forum non conveniens, its entire purpose is to allow litigation to occur in a more convenient and appropriate forum, and it would undermine severely the purposes of the doctrine - -",
  "That's right, we would. And, and one of the cases that Ruhrgas quoted and relies on was the D.C. Circuit's decision in -- Papandreou, which involved subject matter jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. And there the Court quite rightly said that it would be improper to force a foreign sovereign to undergo extensive jurisdictional discovery in this case when it was clear that at the end of the day the Court would dismiss day in favor of a foreign forum in any event. So it would apply to, to questions of subject matter jurisdiction as well as personal - -",
  "I think they could do both. The second would be really superfluous.",
  "If -- if -- an appeal, the court could, the court of appeals could affirm on either ground. Again, to emphasize the point that counsel has made, the argument here is not that forum non conveniens must necessarily be decided before jurisdictional questions. In fact, the natural order would be to decide jurisdictional issues first. But as the Court held in the analogous circumstance of venue in the Leroy decision, there are circumstances that counsel in favor of reversing that order, such as avoiding a difficult constitutional issue or, as in Mr. Papandreou, avoiding imposing the burden of jurisdictional discovery on a foreign sovereign or foreign entity when a case going to be dismissed in the end in any event. If the Court has no further questions - -",
  "Well, I think the second court would have to at the very least ascertain that circumstances had not changed or that there weren't relevant difference of facts. Your, your hypothetical earlier was of filing, refiling this suit in California.",
  "It is in the nature of a discretionary determination, as Your Honor says, that -- that different judges could reach different decisions. In the Parsons case, Parsons versus Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court emphasized there the question was whether a state court's forum non conveniens determination had preclusive effect on a Federal court's analysis of the factors. And this Court held that did it not. In large part because it's impossible to know that every factor would be the same or would be weighed the same by the second court. And so I think it would be open to the second court to, to reanalyze the issues; but even if it weren't, even if there were some preclusive effects, I don't think that that undermines our position, because it is, of course, equally true of other threshold determinations such as personal and subject matter jurisdiction that they may have issue-preclusive effects in subsequent litigations. For example, a trial court could decide that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the amount in controversy is insufficient because under state law, the plaintiff would not be able to recover punitive damage. That determination would be given issue-preclusive effect in a subsequent suit filed by the same plaintiff in another district court. In fact Justice Scalia wrote an opinion on that subject in the D.C. Circuit in the Dozier versus Ford Motor Company.",
  "Our understanding of a conditional dismissal in this circumstance is that the dismissing court is explaining its understanding of the world, and that -- and facts as they bear upon its analysis, such as is the defendant subject to jurisdiction in a foreign forum. Oftentimes, the plaintiff -- if I could answer -- oftentime the plaintiff objects to dismissal because they can't sue the defendant in the foreign forum. The defendant agrees to waive any objection to jurisdiction. That understanding of fact is a condition of the dismissal. If it later proves to be untrue because the defendant objects to jurisdiction of the foreign court, it would be open to the plaintiff to seek to reopen the first suit on that ground. Thank you very much.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has recognized repeatedly that the bar on appellate review in 1447(d) applies only to remands under 1447(c). This Court has held that the courts of appeals have authority to decide whether a remand order was, in fact, one within the authority of 1447(c). In fact, just this term in Osborn, the district court remanded the case on the basis of 1447(c) for purported lack of subject matter jurisdiction.",
  "Your Honor is absolutely correct. Osborn concerned a particular kind of categorical exception from 1447(c). Our argument is that as a categorical matter, the basis of remand in this case was not one within the scope of 1447(c). That although the District Court termed the sovereign immunity of the defendant's jurisdictional, it was not jurisdictional in the relevant sense. And this Court held precisely that in the Oliver American trading case. There, a case removed by Mexico was dismissed by the district court on the basis of its immunity and the district court certified that holding as a jurisdictional decision immediately appealable to this Court. Yet this Court looked beyond that label attached by the district court and held that sovereign immunity is not jurisdictional in the relevant sense because it does not limit the authority of the Federal courts qua Federal courts but rather is a general rule that would preclude suit in State court as well. Likewise, under 1447(c) it is not a basis to remand that the defendant is immune. When Congress authorized sovereign defendants to remove cases to Federal court to vindicate their immunity, it did not intend that when the district court upheld that immunity, it would be remanded to State court which would be free to disregard the Federal court's decision.",
  "Yes.",
  "The Missouri Pacific Railway case holds that even this Court, on review of a State court judgment following remand cannot review the remand order itself. It can review issues of Federal law that were decided by the State courts on remand but - -",
  "Missouri Pacific Railway case.",
  "What, what's notable is that Congress enacted 1447(e) at the same time that it amended 1447(c). It provided in 1447(e) for an authority to remand in a particular instance where the court lost subject matter jurisdiction post-removal. It had of course been the rule since this Court's decision in St. Paul Mercury Indemnity, that post-removal events did not defeat the removal court's jurisdiction; and in the statute it was made explicit that 1447(c) authorized remand only when the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction. And when Congress amended the language in 1998 to make clear that non-jurisdictional defects in removal had to be raised immediately or were forfeited, it at the same time -- and added the language, or changed the language in the second sentence that raises problems for our argument; at the same time, it added 1447(e) to provide, as I said, a particular authority to remand based on post-removal events that would have been unnecessary if, as Respondents urge, 1447(c) was intended to confer general authority to remand on the basis of post-removal events.",
  "No. And the courts of appeals that have considered that question likewise hold that a remand under 1447(e) is right in pari materia with (d) although the courts seem to be split on whether the decision to allow the joinder is a separable decision appealable under Waco or not. But -- but that issue is not presented. But what is significant is that had Congress intended by the amendment of 1447(c) to authorize for the first time remand on the basis of post-removal events, 1447(e) would have been unnecessary; and yet, the legislative history, the 1447(e), makes clear that Congress believed that in the absence of that provision, the Court would have been limited to two alternatives. Authorize the joinder -- or deny the joinder, or dismiss the case.",

  "Well, I -- Your Honor - -",
  "But -- but the district court's order is clear. And it is absolutely correct in this regard that removal jurisdiction existed at the outset. So the court does not lack removal jurisdiction.

And in fact, this Court used that shorthand repeatedly in the Kircher decision to describe 1447(c), lacks removal jurisdiction. This Court - -",
  "Well, the Court has to go back to the history of the statute, how it's evolved. Clearly pre-1998, authority to remand was only if it was removed without jurisdiction. And so the question is when Congress changed the language to lacks subject matter jurisdiction, did it mean lacks removal jurisdiction? Which it - -",
  "No, it would not have. Bit that's because of the peculiarities of the difference between original jurisdiction under the FSIA, section 1330(a), and removal jurisdiction under the FSIA.

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: Congress did not, in the 4-R Act, establish a right to obtain in Federal court administrative review of State valuations. Rather, it established a Federal right against State discrimination in which the railroad could bring a de novo suit in Federal court to vindicate that right. Justice Alito pointed out the wide range of value that could be generated by generally accepted methodologies -- 6 billion to 12.4 billion, in this case. Clearly, if one were to accept the State's rule that any reasonable methodology, by which they mean any methodology that is reasonable in the abstract that may have been approved by this Court in the 1800's, a State could hide any variety of discriminations within that rubric. There would be very little, if any meat to Federal court review under the 4-R Act.",
  "Well, I think that it would, to a large extent, undermine the right and protection that Congress intended. And partly, I think that the -- Your Honor's question is based on a faulty premise, and that is that the State uses a single methodology in carrying out its valuation.",
  "Well, I think that to call the weighing of the three evidences of value that might be generated by cost income, sales methods, a choice of methodology to which the Federal court is required to defer is a misnomer, because it really is an exercise of judgment with respect to the facts of the case and the reliability of the data available.",
  "I think Your Honor is correct, that the -- because you're pointing out that really, the choice among methodologies is more a question of what are the facts on the ground, what is the reliable, available data that could be used in generating these different evidences of value. And the court's role, in our view, is to consider all of the evidences of value, not just the State's evidence. That would be the proper approach in a suit for administrative review -- of administrative determination by the State, but is a de novo proceeding in which the court is to consider all evidence of value to determine, to its own satisfaction, what the true market value of the railroad is.",

  "There would be a range. I don't know that it would be a range from 6 to 12 billion. But -- I think - -",
  "Well, the district -- as in the Tyler Regional Planning case, the Court indicated that district courts frequently have to undertake complicated valuation questions, and they rely on the testimony of experts. Appointment of a master might well be permissible. But I want to go back to the textual indications, that this is a question for the Federal court. There is no question that the statute refers to the burden of proof in determining true market value. In Burlington Northern, the Court recognized that the allocation of burden of proof demonstrates that it is a fact to be proved to the Court. In fact, in se, with respect to true market value of the commercial and industrial properties, it specifically says that it is to be proved to the satisfaction of the Court. Now in Burlington Northern, the Court remarked that it would be unreasonable to construe the statute to lead to strikingly different approaches, whether the railroad's challenge was based on the alleged undervaluation of other properties or overvaluation of the railroad property. Now, we know from the statute that the court is not to defer to any methodology, or amalgam of methodologies, the State uses in valuing other commercial and industrial property. Rather, the court is to look to the best evidence of value, which is sales data. Now, if the court has sales data available to it in the case regarding the value of the railroad, certainly the court should rely on that reliable information, rather than the State's chosen methodology. Thank you very much.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: I think there's no question that the State of Maine could not require carriers to obtain a license to deliver tobacco products and condition that upon the carrier's service complying with the mandates of State law, that that would be a law that relates to the carrier's service. Now, Maine maintains that its law is saved from preemption because of two distinctions: One, it that is adopted with a health rather than economic purpose, and because it operates directly on the shipper rather than the carrier. And we don't think that either of those arguments is consistent with the text, structure, or legislative history of the Act. But I would want to point - -",
  "The Federal act. That's right. But it's worth noting that those arguments, in any event, only go to the provision in C(3)(C). The provision that is under dispute in section D does not have either of those characteristics. It operates directly on the carrier, and it is not adopted for the health concern but rather to support the State's licensing and tax purposes. But if I could go back to the reasons why their argument is inconsistent with the text, structure, and history of the Federal act, as Respondents' counsel noted, Congress did consider an alternative version of this bill, one that was limited to economic regulation, and the Congress rejected the Senate version and adopted instead the House version that much more broadly pre-empted State regulation related to carrier services. It added the provision of services and adopted the \"related to\" standard rather than regulation. And so it has rejected this limitation that Petitioners urge. Moreover, the argument that there is a general health exception to the pre-emptive force of the FAAAA is inconsistent with the structure of the Act. There are specific exceptions in the Act related, for example, to motor carrier safety, but those exceptions correspond to other grants of authority to the Secretary of Transportation to adopt regulations and to pre-empt State regulations that would interfere with interstate commerce or impose too much of a burden on interstate commerce. There is no similar back top, if the court reads into the FAAAA a textual general exception for any act adopted with a health purpose by the States.",
  "Well, what Congress -- what Congress had in mind in the Act was that carriers would respond to the marketplace, not State regulation. And where a service is widely available in response to the marketplace, for a State to dictate to shippers that they should use one service as opposed to another, we think would have -- it would be a different analysis under Morales. The Court in Morales said that the test was whether there was a significant effect on the carriers. And where, as here, we have the three major carriers all providing, for example, an adult-signature-required service, for the -- for a State to say, well, when you ship alcohol, you have to use that available service, that would not have much of an effect at all on the carriers.",

  "I think with respect to this particular example about the adult signature required, the Court probably would need to go no farther than the fact that the Federal government has itself recognized the existence of that service and required it in a law that relates to the shipping of wine when one is prohibited by safety regulations from taking it on the airplane with them. So the existence in the marketplace of this service has already recognized in Federal law.",
  "I have not studied the New York statute sufficiently to speak to that, and I don't think the government has a position about that. We do believe -- the settlement agreement, though, is distinct from the Maine law in some very significant respects. And the most important of those is that under the settlement agreement, the carriers agree to use reasonable best efforts; whereas the Maine provision -- this is the second sentence of D -- deems the carrier to have knowledge - -",
  "I have some familiarity with it.",
  "Well, I -- Your Honor, we have not taken a position on whether the settlement is and, with respect -- although I have familiarity with the settlement, I have less familiarity with the underlying New York statute that it was agreed to, in response to - -",
  "Yes.",
  "In our view, where, as construed by the First Circuit -- and we sort of accept that view -- the First Circuit, on page 26 of the Pet. App., construed the first sentence of D as requiring that carriers do not act as knowing accomplices in the illegal sale of tobacco products. So construed, we don't believe that that provision is pre-emptive. It is akin to the general prohibition on furnishing tobacco to minors in 1555-B(2), and we don't think that that provision is pre-emptive.",
  "Excuse me.",
  "No. I -- I say that it is a law of general applicability, and it does not require any change in the carriers' practices. What -- what the imputation of knowledge does, however, is require the carriers to change their practices so that they will get the knowledge when they can. For example, take another example. If Maine said that it would impute knowledge to the carriers of the tobacco contents if an X-ray scan would reveal the cigarette contents, it would in effect be requiring the carriers to install X-ray machines and pass every package that they get through those X-ray machines. That's how an imputation of knowledge can be used to direct the conduct of the carrier, and that's what is so problematic about the second sentence of D. They impute knowledge based upon whether the name of the shipper appears on a confidential list that the attorney general has provided. In other words, even though, in their normal practices, they don't pay attention whatsoever to the shipper's name, they have to incorporate that into their practices in order to avoid the imputation of knowledge.",
  "Well, yes, Your Honor. A Federal law -- there is Federal law with respect to shipment of hazardous substances. There are uniform requirements with respect to how one must label hazardous substances, but - -",
  "Well, as I understand it, the -- the uniformity of the symbol for hazardous substance is something that the handlers are trained to scan for.",
  "Well - - JUSTICE ALITO -- and they have a supercomputer so I don't understand why not necessarily - -",
  "Not necessarily, as I understand the service. Some of -- many, many of the packages are delivered to a company with which UPS has a contract, such as a Staples or some other kind of store. And it becomes -- the Staples store becomes the shipper. They are the ones with the contract with UPS, not whoever it was that brought to it Staples. So it is not necessarily part of their practice that they would have that information at all.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Although the precise formulation adopted by the court of appeals may be somewhat novel, its holding of a finding of privity here is consistent with well-established principles of res judicata. Where multiple persons engage in coordinated successive litigation to vindicate a joint interest with respect to which a judgment in favor of any of them will benefit all, then a judgment in the first litigation in which that interest is adequately represented finds the others as well.",
  "Well, I think it's important to start by recognizing that even Petitioner acknowledges that there can be circumstances in which Taylor would be bound, even though at the time, at the end of Herrick's litigation, he had no notice, he had not participated. And that is, on their view and ours as well, that if Herrick had thereafter created an agency relationship with Taylor, and Taylor then as agent went and brought the second FOIA suit - -",
  "That's right. And -- but all of that can exist or be created after the first litigation is over. And so the absence of notice in the first case - -",
  "That's -- that's right.",
  "Well -- but Taylor in the second suit that he brings as agent to advance the interests of Herrick would be bound. Taylor would be barred. His suit would be - -",
  "Well, I don't - - the court certainly did not find that there was no collusion. I agree that the court didn't reach - -",
  "It didn't reach the question of what they called \"tactical maneuvering.\" I think that there is a -- a strong argument could be made that Taylor was Herrick's agent; but I don't think that it's critical to find that he was his agent in the very technical sense of the Restatement of Agency.",
  "No. No, Taylor - -",
  "If Taylor brought the second suit in his own name and it was found to be barred by res judicata, a third suit in Taylor's own name would likewise be barred. And there's a case that I think illustrates this point perhaps better than any of those we cited on our brief, unfortunately. But I think it's helpful - -",
  "-- because - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think that it proves the point that has been the sort of underlying concern of many of the questions: What happens when you're just shy of a true agency relationship? And the case is United States versus Des Moines Valley Railroad. It's an Eighth Circuit case, 84 F.40 from 1897. But importantly, this Court quoted it at length in the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad versus Schendel case - -",
  "Yes. Yes, I did, Your Honor. The Schendel case is 270 U.S. 611. And they discuss Des Moines Valley at page 619. And what had happened in Des Moines Valley was that the United States had granted some land to the State of Iowa, which in turn passed to the railroad, which in turn sold to one claimant. There was another person who claimed directly from the United States as a homesteader. There had been litigation between the person claiming via the railroad and the homesteader as to who had title to the land. And the judgment in State court was adverse to the homesteader. And what happened later, about 10 years later, was that the United States brought suit to have declared invalid the title of the person claiming via the railroad. And the district court actually initially questioned whether the United States had standing to bring the case at all. They viewed it as Fairchild's case. That was the homeowner -- the homesteader, a little coincidence with this case, which also has a Fairchild. But the court of appeals specifically said it wasn't deciding whether the United States had standing to bring the case in its own name -- the case was litigated by the United States attorney -- they looked to the purpose that the United States sought to vindicate. They said that the United States does not seek to obtain title to this property for itself again. They are, in a sense, lending their name to allow Fairchild a second bite at the apple. Now, there was no control that Fairchild had over the United States. Fairchild didn't direct the United States attorney who was representing the United States. But the United States had taken up the interest of Fairchild, taking advantage of the fact that it had standing to sue itself - -",
  "Well - -",
  "I think what Your Honor is reacting to is the reality of the situation seems to be that there's a sufficient relationship between these two that they ought to be barred. But there is no section of the Restatement (Second) that specifically governs this case. And Petitioner's view, which is that somehow the Restatement (Second) has become codification of res judicata law would not permit it.",
  "Well, Your Honor, I agree that the Restatement (Second) does not, for example, state the law which we all know and which Petitioner concedes is the case, and that is that the agent who brings the second lawsuit is bound, even if the agency relationship arose - -",
  "-- after the first relation was concluded.",
  "What the evidence shows is that Herrick made Taylor aware of the -- of the outcome of the litigation, but we don't have - -",
  "There's no evidence of that.",
  "Well, the - -",

  "Well, counsel on the other side filed an affidavit that said -- it was very carefully crafted, I think -- that there was no attorney-client relationship with Herrick with respect to this - -",
  "No, that's right. What the court of appeals relied on was the fact that Taylor had made Herrick's interest his own and brought the suit in order to vindicate the exact same interests that Herrick, himself, had already litigated and lost. And that was to get the documents to restore Herrick's plane.",
  "No, that person is not barred. And - -",
  "I think in -- Your Honor's first question to opposing counsel was such that, yes, I think that if that was the individual whose interest was relied upon to give an association standing, that it would bind the individual whose name and interest was relied on. And this is in some ways the reverse situation where - -",
  "No, the court of appeals was clear that just a common membership in an association or just a common interest would not be enough. They -- they distinguished the situation of a common interest in a -- in the same objective - -",
  "That -- that's true. We think that that, in fact, makes FOIA even more susceptible to this kind of vexatious litigation that Petitioner seems to think is entirely permissible. And the courts have held that the - -",
  "Well, because FOIA allows - -",
  "-- a number of defendants - -",
  "Well, FOIA allows the case to be brought in a number of different venues. It can be brought in the venue of the -- where the requestor lives, where the documents are located, or in the District of Columbia.",
  "And so a person such as Herrick could ask for assistance on his project, the project of rebuilding the plane, of people scattered throughout the country.",
  "And they could maintain it throughout the country.",
  "Well, Your Honor, the fact is that in FOIA, especially an exemption 4 case, there are special burdens on the government. The government has the burden of proving that the exemption is warranted. So the plaintiff can just sort of lob anything in there. The government -- there is the burden of persuading the court in each case that the exemption is warranted. Fairchild, a private party that wants to protect its own property interests in the trade secret, is forced to go around the country litigating this over and over and over again as well. And the courts that have considered the question recognize that the public-right nature of the interest is one that makes application of the rule particularly appropriate because both the interests of the individual litigant, the plaintiff, is reduced, but also the opportunity for vexatious relitigation is increased multiple times because of the almost infinite number of potential plaintiffs. This case was decided by the lower court on the basis of the relationship between Herrick and Taylor. It was the fact that Taylor had taken up Herrick's own interest. There was the interest in the project. The project was the restoration of the plane. Herrick owned the plane. Herrick had brought suit based on that interest and lost. He asked Taylor to help him in that project. Taylor then brings the suit to get the same documents for the same purpose. And we think that the U.S. versus Des Moines Valley Railroad case is an example where, just shy perhaps of an actual agency relationship, because there's no control in Des Moines Valley, that still the fact that the second litigant has volunteered to take their name to, in a sense, take advantage of the fact they have independent standing - -",
  "Well, Your Honor - -",
  "We are not advocating a broad rule. We, in fact - -",
  "-- think that's one of the virtues of our argument: That where there is a document that is of true public interest such that multiple individuals on entirely independent grounds might well seek it, they would not be barred. But where a document has commercial value like this one does to Mr. Herrick, so that he can restore his plane without going to the incredible expense of developing another manner to prove to the FAA the airworthiness of that plane, there is that commercial value that gives him the incentive to try to relitigate over and over again. And on Petitioner's view, as long as he stops just shy of an agency relationship, he can do that throughout the country. And this is - -",
  "Well, the rule is a broader rule. And we've pointed out that it has in common with the rule with respect to co-beneficiaries that existed since the 1800s at the very latest, the rule as stated in section 48 of the Restatement, which is an example, a counter-example, Justice Ginsburg, to your question about whether it always had to be a pre-existing legal relationship, because section 48 deals with a particular situation where there are multiple individuals who can claim for personal injury of one of them. And the section is stated in terms of another person, not a family member. And the commentary to this section makes clear that although most situations where it would apply would be family members, it also applies to -- and I want to quote it: \"A de facto connection may sometimes suffice as well as a formally valid one.\" So the law of - -",
  "But it recognizes there could be a close-enough relationship between the two such that the purposes of the rule would be satisfied, but there is no legal, familial relationship. And - -",
  "They didn't need to because of the fact that Taylor had voluntarily taken up Herrick's interests to get a second bite at the litigatory apple, as the First Circuit put it. And it is not the fact, as Petitioner would argue, that every time another person has an individual, standing right to sue under a statute, that it means that that person necessarily gets to relitigate where a person with whom they have a close relationship such as this has already litigated and lost. And so, getting back to Your Honor's question - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, it is interesting that the restatement with respect to the third category in the reply brief -- they called it the third category of control perhaps. It is described in the restatement in comment to section 62 as where the person falls short of becoming a party but which justly should result in his being denied an opportunity to relitigate.",
  "That is the nature -- that is the nature of res judicata principles. That it is not: Can you avoid this by avoiding the legal technicalities? It is the substance of the relationship that counts. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:",
  "Your Honor, the United States did not participate on the question of the scope of the express pre-emption provision in Cipollone, and to a large extent the express pre-emption question in this case is what was the meaning of the decision in Cipollone. And so that is of less interest to the United States than certainly the second question presented, which has to do with the FTC's own authority and its exercise of that authority.",
  "Your Honor, the United States has not taken a position on the bottom line of the first question presented.",
  "I don't believe that the position that the United States stated in Reilly is dispositive of the first question presented in this case. But, again, that doesn't mean that the brief that the United States has filed with respect to implied pre-emption is not relevant.",
  "Well, I - -",
  "But we - -",
  "I would hope so. Thank you. But we also address a question that is common to the two questions presented, and that is an argument that the Petitioners make with respect to implied pre-emption, but they also make it with respect to express pre-emption, and that is -- and, Justice Ginsburg - -",
  "Well, as Your Honor is aware, we submitted a -- a supplemental authority letter that in July of this year the Commission issued a request for comment on a proposal to rescind its guidance with respect to the tar and nicotine test results, precisely because of concern that they are misleading due to the evidence that has developed about the incidence of compensation. That was not believed at the time that the Commission issued its guidance back in 1966 and '67 to present a significant problem. But it is evident now. The scientific community indicates and certainly the findings of fact in the RICO case are that the -- that the tobacco companies have known since 1967 that in fact compensation is nearly complete, and for that reason, the tar and nicotine yields via the Cambridge test method are not indicative of the yield to a true human smoker. And for that reason, it proposed to withdraw.",
  "With respect to the -- I want first to take issue with the question of \"approved,\" because I think that it -- it draws an analogy to the FDA context, to Riegel and the like, and that is not the nature of what the Federal Trade Commission does. It doesn't stand - -",
  "We proposed a rule to require the disclosure of tar and nicotine - -",
  "That's correct.",
  "No. The consent decrees did not require them to put the information in their ads. It said that it would be deceptive to make claims about the tar and nicotine content of the cigarettes without expressing, in milligrams, what the yield was per the Cambridge test method. But that's a very different thing. It's a prohibition. They were ordered to cease and desist making claims about tar and nicotine content without giving the consumer the benefit of the yield figures. But the Commission has never - - specifically at issue in this case are the descriptors \"light\" or \"lower in tar.\" In 1987, the Commission issued a notice in which it said these terms are are not defined by Federal law. They asked whether there should be - -",
  "Yes, Your Honor, because the -- the \"light,\" on its own, much more conveys the impression to the consumer that this is the yield to the consumer himself, the actual human smoker, and in fact that was why the - -",
  "They -- whether they are or are not misleading depends upon the incidence of compensation. At the time the Commission issued its guidance in 1966 and '67, the HEW report was that compensation was not expected to be a problem. It was not believed to be a problem. Beginning in 1983, when in light of the Barclay's case in which it was determined that a particular cigarette, the yield according to the test method had nothing to do with yield to an actual consumer, the FTC started to inquire about this. But the Petitioners, although they have known since 1967 about the incidence of compensation, failed to disclose that information to the Commission. They have failed to -- they have refused to give them the benefit of their insights, their own studies. The Commission has asked - -",
  "You're right.",
  "In 1978 - -",
  "There has been a question. In 1978, the Commission issued a notice requesting comment about whether lip drape in fact occluded the holes that dilute the concentration of the air, and the tobacco companies did not respond to that, even though they had their own studies showing that it was a problem. So it is -- it is true that the Commission has only now issued the notice proposing to withdraw its earlier guidance; but the Petitioners themselves should not be able to benefit from their own misleading of the Commission. But again, I think it's more fundamental than that, is that their arguments rely upon a misconception of what the Commission does. As Justice Souter noted, it is Supreme Court law the Commission does not supplant State law; it acts cooperatively with State law. The Commission does not act as a gatekeeper like FDA in approving things. It acts as a law enforcement agency. It goes after fraud when it is aware of it. But that is not to the exclusion of State law enforcement agencies or other Federal law enforcement agencies.",

  "Well, Your Honor, there is now a new and independent reason why the asset is blocked. And, in fact, Respondent no longer defends the holding of the court of appeals on that basis. It is, we wish to emphasize, essential that this Court vacate that holding and indicate that it is no longer legally valid so that it is not -- that erroneous holding is not used against us in support of Iran's two-million-dollar claim.",
  "Well, we -- we think that the Court would not. It would vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals. It would be helpful certainly to the United States if the Court emphasized the natural fact that that would mean that the court of appeals' erroneous holding was not any longer legally - -",
  "No. The -- the Court would vacate the decision, certainly.",
  "It is our position that the -- because Respondent has relinquished his right to attach these assets, the decision of the court of appeals should be vacated. And that would have the affect of rendering inoperative that erroneous -- the other erroneous holding of the court of appeals with respect to blocked assets. It is the position of the United States - - and we agree with Respondent on this point -- that as of now, because of the October, 2007, designation, the property of Petitioner is blocked and subject to attachment under TRIA. And I don't believe there is any need for further proceedings on that. The Secretary of State designated the Ministry of Defense of Iran, and the position of Petitioner in the court of appeals on remand from this Court was that it is the Ministry of Defense of Iran, a central core constituent part of the Iranian state, that is the entity that was designated.",
  "Elahi, Respondent Elahi, could get it if he had not relinquished his rights to attach - -",
  "-- assets at issue before the tribunal. As of right now, the asset is blocked and Iran could not repatriate it, as of right now. Of course, blocking orders can be amended, but as of right now it is frozen and Petitioner cannot repatriate it.",
  "Well, Your Honor, again, the blocking order is the present status of the assets. It doesn't mean that they could not later be repatriated to Petitioner; whereas, execution by Respondent against the assets would mean that they would be forever denied to Petitioner.",
  "Well, you are right, Your Honor, that is the position of the United States. And earlier Your Honor quoted language from the oral argument of the United States that the -- or maybe it was one of our briefs -- that the Cubic judgment is -- that the tribunal doesn't have to - -",
  "That is in the context of our saying that, whether or not -- in the view of the United States, whether or not Petitioner ever collects that money, the United States is entitled to an offset, and in fact, we believe it's a complete defense to Iran's claim. Of course, Petitioner's argument -- or Iran's argument before the tribunal is that it is - - that the United States is entitled to a reduction of liability only if Iran actual receives the assets. And that's why the language of the statute is written more broadly when the litigation before the tribunal is ongoing. At that point any property that is at issue before the tribunal is not subject to attachment by one who has relinquished, and that's because this Court nor any other lower court in the United States is supposed to pre-judge the merits of those respective positions. Iran's position -- and it's on page 85a of the United States' appendix -- is that the awarded amount, unless received by Iran, cannot be offset against any relief which the United States may be found to owe Iran. So that is Iran's position. That is at issue before the tribunal. The Respondent would have the Court believe that the proceedings in the tribunal are in the nature of an in rem proceeding, that it's a property dispute. They use that term repeatedly in the brief, \"a property dispute.\" But that is not the nature of the proceedings in the tribunal. Iran has asserted a claim that the United States violated its obligations under the Algiers Accords. The remedy it seeks is , and I quote -- this is from -- excuse me -- from the -- let's see -- the remedy they seek -- they seek is the value of the Cubic sale to Canada. They have said that in the state -- in Iran's reply in statement -- claim 16 that Respondent relies upon, they say that the remedy they seek is not the asset itself. Of course, the asset had been dissipated before Iran ever filed a statement of claim against the United States. The remedy is the proceeds of that sale to Canada. The proceeds of the sale to Canada, which are the subject of Iran's claim against the United States in the tribunal, have been reduced to judgment in the Cubic judgment. That - -",
  "Well, I believe that in fact the language of the statute makes it -- the assertions of the parties before the tribunal that define the property that is at issue before the tribunal. That, again, is so that the courts are not put in a position of adjudicating, prejudging, the merits of the parties' arguments before the tribunal.",
  "Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that this Court needs to consider what the outer reaches are. In this case, this is -- Iran characterizes it, and this is at page, again, at page 85 of the U.S. appendix, that the Cubic judgment, quote \"constitutes an integral part of the remedy sought in case B/61.\" This isn't an offset or a counterclaim. Justice Ginsburg, you previously alluded to the fact the United States did not file a counterclaim. And that's because this is not some unrelated counterclaim the United States has against Iran. This is a critical part of Iran's claim against the United States. It defeats, in the view of the United States, Iran's claim entirely. At the very least, it reduces the amount of Iran's claim against the United States. This isn't somehow unrelated; we're asserting, well, we can use this as an offset because you also owe us money from something else. This is in Iran's own statement, and this is the statement that you --",
  "I -- I don't know. Cubic is not before the tribunal. But what we can ask is, can we conceive of -- and I think it's relatively easy to conceive of -- an award of the tribunal that says, the United States owes Iran $2.8 million; if the Cubic judgment is received by Iran, the United States owes Iran nothing. And clearly, in that circumstance, the Cubic judgment is the subject of the award of the tribunal.",
  "Well, I guess, Your Honor, you have to think what does it mean for any property -- property to be at issue before the tribunal or the subject of the award?",
  "Well - -",
  "If I may respond. Your Honor, on that view, even the ACMR is not at issue before the tribunal, because the tribunal cannot order the United States to hand over the ACMR to Iran. In the A/15 judgment to which Petitioner's counsel alluded earlier, the tribunal recognized that it is not a violation of the United States' obligations under the Algiers Accords not to issue an export license. Therefore, Iran - -",
  "-- is not entitled to the ACMR. It's entitled to its loss, and its loss has been reduced to judgment in the Cubic judgment.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Phillips.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: EWSAA section 1503 authorized the President to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq any provision of law that applies to countries that have sponsored terrorism. The terrorism exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act falls squarely within the plain language of that authority. But if there were any question about that, certainly the President's exercise of his authority under that statute would be entitled to deference. Even if one were to add the atextual additional limitation that the Acree court majority tried to, that it only encompassed statutes that would stand as an obstacle to the funding of the Iraqi regime in the aftermath of removing the Hussein government, still the President's memorandum to Congress makes clear his determination that the threat of billions of dollars of judgments against Iraq and the seizure or freezing of their assets by attachment constituted an immediate threat to the foreign policy interests of the United States and our critical foreign policy goals in Iraq.",
  "That is because of the authorities that the President exercised under the second proviso of 1503. There are exceptions to the immunity of foreign states with respect to attachment. There is one that specifically applies to countries that have been designated as having sponsored terrorism, and that exception as well was rendered inapplicable to Iraq pursuant to this same authority. And so, again, it is essential to the government's foreign policy interests in Iraq that these judgments, the ability to attach Iraqi assets -- in fact, at the time, in the summer of 2003, there were plaintiffs that were running around trying to attach the very assets, the very bundles of cash, that the United States Government was attempting to shift to Iraq in order to pay immediate needs in -- in Iraq in the immediate aftermath of having removed the Hussein regime. These critical foreign policy goals would have been frustrated had the President not been able to make our Foreign Sovereign Immunity Law conform to our foreign policy. And, of course, the Court in Altmann recognized that foreign sovereign immunity is an expression of our present foreign policy interests. That has always been the case. And although Congress can establish the general rule, and did in the FSIA, section 1503 recognizes that there had perhaps never been as dramatic a transformation in our foreign policy with respect to a country as happened in the spring of 2003, whereas there had been a whole panoply of sanctions and other provisions of law that had applied to Iraq because of the Hussein regime's sponsorship of terrorism. On a -- on a dime, our policy shifted 180 degrees, and we became intensely concerned in the success of the new Iraqi regime.",
  "No, Your Honor. The judgment in the Acree case dismissing the claims for failure to state a claim was because counsel in that particular suit was unable to identify a source of law for their claim. The D.C. Circuit has correctly held that Federal law did not at that time provide a cause of action under 1605(a)(7), and counsel was unable when pressed at oral argument to identify the source of law. But numerous district court judgments exist where the courts have upheld the availability of transitory tort under the law of the forum State, under the law of the residence of the plaintiff, or under the law of the -- of the place where the wrong occurred to provide a cause of action. So - -",
  "That's right. And -- and, of course, the courts have to apply a choice of law analysis. As I said, a number of these judgments apply the law of the forum State where the plaintiff resided. The United States has expressed its view that there are constitutional limitations on the ability of a State to project its substantive law to a tort that occurs abroad, but -- but those issues have not yet I don't think have been resolved by the D.C. Circuit, at least. So plaintiffs have successfully obtained judgments in suits brought under 1605(a)(7). And there were billions of dollars in claims that were asserted against Iraq. And -- and, as I said, plaintiffs were actively going and trying to seek the actual money that the United States was trying to transfer over to Iraq to pay immediate costs of the reconstruction. But this does not mean -- and I think Justice Scalia's question was critical here. It does not mean that the plaintiffs are left without any remedy, rather that these plaintiffs have been put on the same footing as any other claimant against a foreign state that is not on the very small list of designated state sponsors of terrorism. Their claims are subject to state-to-state diplomatic resolution. And, in fact, there have been discussions -- there are ongoing discussions -- to establish a framework for resolving the claims against the Hussein regime.",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think that -- that that is one consideration. The United Nations has established a mechanism for funding many of the victims of the Hussein regime. And -- and -- but the United States would have the obligation to represent the interests of the United States citizens that were injured. But, as -- as Your Honor's question points out, there are a lot of considerations that go into the diplomatic or state-to-state resolution of the claim beyond those that would be available to a court to consider in just adjudicating the particular plaintiff's claims. And that is why these have historically been reserved for diplomatic resolution. So - -",
  "No. No, I don't. And -- and Congress has established as a means to deter further acts of terrorism by states that have been so designated - -",
  "-- the abrogation of immunity.",
  "That's right. The -- the general rule that Congress established in 1605(a)(7) was that the jurisdiction of the courts would continue for any claim that arose from acts committed while the state was designated. But the authority that the President was given in 1503 was to render those statutes immediately inapplicable to Iraq. And, of course, it would not be inapplicable to Iraq to hold that today a court would have jurisdiction over Iraq and authority to enter a judgment against Iraq pursuant to 1605(a)(7). It would be application of that statute. So the only way that one can give full effect to the plain language of the statute, \"make inapplicable,\" is to say that as soon as the President exercised that authority, 1605(a)(7) became inapplicable, unavailable, as the basis of exercising jurisdiction over Iraq.",
  "That is true. And in 1503, Congress restored to the President in a sense a very small portion of the authority he had previously exercised before the FSIA's adoption. 1605(a)(7) on its own terms turns on determinations by the executive. It's a statute that can be turned on and turned off by designating or de-designating a country. It has a particular temporal consequence, the rule that -- that the Chief Justice alluded to. In 1503, the Congress gave the President a different authority to turn that statute off, the authority to make it inapplicable only with respect to one country, Iraq, and in the context of the most dramatic transformation of foreign relations that - - that could transpire.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As I think the discussion this morning illustrates, the Federal nature of the second category, the phrase that is directly at issue in this case, is self-evident from the text. The terms congressional and GAO are Federal and under the doctrine or canon of construction noscitur a sociis - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, I -- I want to start by making clear that we disagree that that's a better interpretation of the first clause, but I will take it as the premise.",
  "It -- it may indeed be harder to do that. We think that it is warranted in light of the policy that motivated Congress and in light of other references to Federal administrative, civil and criminal hearings in the statute. But even if those reasons which we think justify limiting the first category to Federal proceedings -- the Court were to disagree with that, that would not justify disregarding the clear indications of the Federal limitations on the second clause. And there is no policy - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think that -- that again, as Justice Alito's question at the very beginning of the argument illustrated, the literal language of the word administrative would encompass hearings conducted by private hospitals or universities as well. Now Petitioner es hewed that interpretation - -",
  "That's -- that's right, Your Honor, and governmental in a particular nature, of a particular nature, the Federal Government. As is the Court's decision in Cook County made clear, municipal governmental entities are with respect to the False Claims Act the same as private corporations. The -- the Court recognized that municipalities are the recipients of many Federal dollars. In that case the local governmental entity whose conduct is at issue was a county hospital. And -- and county hospitals receive funds under the same programs that private hospitals - -",
  "No.",
  "Well, I guess it depends on what you mean by the relevant context.",
  "No, Your Honor, it is -- it is clear from the legislative - -",
  "That it was Federal proceedings that Congress had in mind. And -- and if you would take - -",
  "If you would look on page 19 of the - -",
  "I'm sorry, Your Honor.",
  "I'm -- that's right. That's right, Your Honor.",
  "Well, we have the -- the committee report and the bill that was recorded by the House which states specifically at that point, the public disclosure bar referenced information which the Government, capital G, disclosed the basis of allegations in a prior administrative civil proceeding. That was the House.",
  "Excuse me?",
  "Well, as we note, Your Honor, the statute uses the term \"Government\" with a capital G throughout to refer to the Federal Government.",
  "Excuse me?",
  "Well, congressional -- the -- the term congressional is frequently used without a capital, but State legislatures are not referred to as congresses. And that is one of the anomalies that petitioners simply cannot explain: why Congress would have thought that an administrative report issued by a local school board should give rise to the bar, but a report or a hearing conducted by a State legislature would not.",
  "Well -- well, Your Honor, it is of course a -- a truism, that -- that programs are administered by the executive branch more than the legislative branch, but that is no reason to think that Congress would have meant to exclude, if those State legislatures did conduct a hearing with respect to fraud by the State, exclude that as a public disclosure. The reason that Congress didn't include State legislative reports is because it didn't include State reports at all. It was - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, I -- I think that it is more likely as -- as the development and progress of the clause reflects, that Congress was focused on what does the government know and what does the disclosure show about the whether the government is already or is likely to focus on the fraud.",
  "There -- I -- there are currently under consideration bills or, and as I understand it, they are not, there are other bills that are in contemplation that would revise the language of the statute, but -- but would not necessarily focus on this. There are a number of other issues connected - -",
  "I -- I don't know. But of course - -",
  "I -- I don't believe that as of yet the department has taken a specific position on -- on the legislation that is contemplated in this particular ambiguity.",
  "The Senate - -",
  "The context is - - is Federal. References to States in connection with the act that Congress has thought about it are treating States like other private qui tam relators. They Petitioner referred to the Dean case, and, in fact, that was something that the -- the legislative history refers to, but what was offensive about the decision in the Dean case was that Wisconsin had been the original source of the information, but had been barred because it had provided that information to the government. And, under the government knowledge bar, they had been precluded, so -- so Wisconsin would have been taken care of under the original source provision, but it doesn't reflect a view that States have a particular distinctive role. In fact, as this Court's decision in Cook County reflects, municipalities are treated just like any private corporation for purposes of the act. They can be defendants, they could be plaintiffs, qui tam relators, but there is no reason to construe the statute in a way that would allow a local government, technically, to shield itself from qui tam suits by disclosing the facts that would be the underlying information support of the fraud claim in, perhaps, a report that was intended to -- to whitewash the situation - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think it's important to note that, in order to be a public disclosure -- the second category at the very least -- all that needs to have happened is that information be disclosed to -- to one additional person. That -- and that makes a lot of sense when we are talking about disclosures of the government -- Federal government's own reports because, if the Federal government is already investigating and pursuing the fraud, one other person that finds out about it and then files a qui tam action on the basis of the government's own effort is precisely the situation that Congress sought to preclude. But it doesn't make any senses when we are talking about a disclosure to an individual by a State or local - -",
  "Well, we think that the -- the disclosures -- the allegations in the types of reports, audits, investigations, that are referenced in the clause are the type that would evidence that the government is pursuing them. And -- but where a State -- perhaps a local school board discloses facts that might give rise to an allegation of fraud in a hearing where there was only one or two members of the public in attendance, there is no reason to think that that information is going to be brought to the Federal government's attention. The purpose of the bar is to balance -- Congress was seeking to balance two rules. One is to encourage qui tam relators to bring information and bring suit where the information was unlikely to be something that the government -- Federal government was focusing on. Where the Federal government was able to protect itself and bring this suit on its own, then there's no reason for the Federal government to have to share its recovery.",
  "Well, Your Honor, Petitioners' reference to this audit being in the possession of the government -- it's happenstance that this particular report, the Crisp & Hughes report, was sent to the Federal government official. But the vast majority of State and local governmental investigations, audits, and reports, are not going to be given to the Federal government, and even though they are -- they cite the Single Audit Act, which is only a very narrow subset of audits that States or local governments perform -- do not actually disclose the allegations of the fraud. In order to get to the actual information of the fraud, the -- first of all, it would have to be brought to the attention of the relevant Federal agency. Usually, the cognizant agency is the one that has the most money at stake, but the fraud may have to do with a different Federal program, so it has to be brought to the attention of the program whose interests are actually at stake. They have to go beyond the report that is - - that is publicly available in the clearinghouse website, which tells you virtually nothing, to an underlying report which is itself, generally, fairly vague, and all Petitioners say is that the working papers of the auditor are available to the government, not even in the government's possession, they are available to the government if it requests it. The government has to drill down many levels before it necessarily is going to know about that fraud.",
  "No -- no, Your Honor, I don't think so.",
  "No -- again, this report here did have information that was indicative of fraud, and this report - -",
  "Excuse me?",
  "There -- there were multiple allegations. One of the allegations underlying the relator's claim is that the government -- the county certified that certain procedures were followed that would have included a requirement that it be bid out, and that it was not. Another was that certain work was paid for or billed for, but wasn't performed or was not performed well, so there were -- there were different allegations, and where that would be disclosed to a single person, that would constitute a public disclosure, at least with respect to Federal - -",
  "But only if we - -",
  "And what is at issue here is whether the Federal government is ever going to learn of the fraud.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The judgment enforced against EBIA in this case was entered by a non­Article III bankruptcy court pursuant to a statute that this Court has declared unconstitutional as violating the separation of powers. The entry of a judgment of the United States is not nearly a matter of private interest to the litigants. Rather, it carries the force of law that is binding on other courts, binding on the executive branch which must enforce the judgment, and even binding on the legislature which cannot reopen the judgment. The entry of final judgment of the United States is the ultimate exercise of the judicial power under Article III, just as the enactment of legislation is the ultimate exercise of the legislative power under Article I.",
  "The judgment that was entered by the district court was not an exercise of original jurisdiction but rather appellate jurisdiction. In fact, Section 1334 is clear that it confers the district court original jurisdiction, but once a judgment has been entered by the bankruptcy court, the review by the district court is an exercise of appellate jurisdiction under Section 158.",
  "Your Honor, the entry of judgment is the act of the judicial branch that carries the force of law. The issuance of a report and recommendation by a magistrate does not. It's only after the exercise of judgment and the entry of judgment that it has binding effect. Binding on the other branches ­­",
  "It ­­ yes, Your Honor.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. Because the active entry of judgment ­­",
  "Yes, Your Honor. But the act of entering judgment is, both as a legal matter and as a practical matter, different from the appellate ­­ exercise of appellate jurisdiction. The act of entering judgment, the district court must ­­ if it is the one entering the judgment, has to determine that judgment is properly entered. It's a proper exercise of the appellate ­­ of the Article III power. The district court would have the discretion under Ninth Circuit law consistent with Anderson v. Liberty Lobby to carry a motion for summary judgment to allow the record to develop further. That option, available to the district court when it's sitting as a matter of original jurisdiction, is not available to the district court sitting on appeal.",
  "That's true.",
  "On appellate review, it had two options: Affirm or reverse. As an original matter, though, it would have had a third option, which would have been to deny the motion at that time to let the record develop more fully. But more fundamentally ­­",
  "Well, Your Honor, I truly believe that on this record, where there clearly were disputes between the two affidavits, that an Article III judge would not have entered summary judgment as an original matter. Sitting as an appellate court where its decision was going to be subject to appellate review immediately, perhaps its analysis was different. But I think more fundamentally, the absence of a judgment entered by a court with authority to do so means that the appellate court also lacks appellate jurisdiction, and this Court has so recognized in Ayrshire Collieries, in the Glidden case ­­",
  "Well, I don't know ­­",
  "Well, Section 158(a) speaks in language of the district court exercising appellate jurisdiction. It uses the word \"jurisdiction.\" So once the ­­ in 157(b), a core matter such as this, the bankruptcy court is delegated authority to hear and determine and enter final judgment subject to review pursuant to Section 158. Section 158(a) specifies that the district court is exercising appellate jurisdiction in that event. So the district court ­­",
  "It uses ­­",
  "Yes, 158(a) says ­­",
  "I'm using the government's amicus brief, the statutory appendix that's on page 4a.",
  "It is in our brief. The reason I cite to the government's brief is it also has 1334. It's slightly more comprehensive. So on page 4a of the government's statutory appendix, Section 158(a), \"The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals.\" This Court has, in numerous decisions, attributed significance to Congress's use of the word \"jurisdiction,\" that Congress knows what the word means and when it uses that word, it means it is jurisdictional. The ­­ Section 1334, on the other hand, which is on page 14a of the government's statutory appendix, 1334(b) says that \"The district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under Title 11.\" So the district court does have original jurisdiction at the outset, but when it has referred the matter to the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy court has entered final judgment, then pursuant to 157(b) and pursuant to 158(a), the district court is now exercising appellate jurisdiction.",
  "To be clear, Congress designated fraudulent conveyance actions as core.",
  "Well, I think that what's constraining the court is the language that Congress enacted. Congress ­­",
  "I ­­ I don't believe there is an ambiguity, Your Honor.",
  "Well, the ambiguity ­­ I actually think there is no ambiguity because ­­",
  "Congress ­­ Congress very clearly distinguished a dichotomy between those cases in which the bankruptcy courts were to issue proposed findings and rec­ ­­ conclusions and those that it was to hear and determine. The cases that bankruptcy courts were to hear and determine were cases in which the bankruptcy courts were to enter final judgment subject only to appellate review ­­",
  "There are ­­ there are several, Your Honor. And part of the problem is that the question of how to construe that language in 157(b) does not only affect how Stern claims are going to be handled, but also, all other claims under 157(b). Congress very clearly wanted an efficient system in which bankruptcy judges would enter judgment and there would be only appellate review by the district courts. If the Court reads 157(b)'s \"hear and determine\" language to also encompass the authority to issue non­final reports and recommendations, that would not be limited to the class of cases covered by Stern that are core, but not ­­",
  "It's ­­ unfortunately, the statutory language does not admit of severance of the kind that Respondents suggest. And that's because fraudulent conveyance actions are core, not simply because they're listed in 157(b)(2)(H), but because they are proceedings that arise under Title 11. That's the definition of core proceedings. And so even if the Court were to line out ­­",
  "I ­­ I don't think that 157(b) envisions that the district court could do that. The district court's review under ­­ of a judgment entered under 157(b) is, on appeal, pursuant to 158, which is an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, not original jurisdiction.",
  "That ­­ that's right.",
  "That's clearly not what Congress provided. It had different ­­",
  "That's ­­ that's true. And ­­",
  "No, Your Honor.",
  "And ­­ and, in fact, there are a number of ­­",
  "I think, Your Honor, there are two problems with that. First is that by changing the definition of \"core proceedings,\" there are other collateral consequences for other provisions of the code. Under Section 1 ­­ 1334(c), for example, there is an abstention in certain noncore proceedings. And so Congress has defined the scope of the abstention according to the same language that it uses in 157(b) whether a proceeding arises under Title 11 or does not do so, but is merely in relation to a case under Title 11. So if the Court goes and revises what Congress has provided as the definition of core in 157(b), there will be collateral consequences for other statutes that Congress had enacted. But the second point is that there are, as I think Justice Scalia was suggesting, policy decisions that really only Congress can make in deciding how to respond to Stern, because one can compare, for example, the provisions of 157(c)(1), which is the bankruptcy judge issuing a proposed findings and conclusions, and the Magistrates Act, 636. The two are actually quite different. The magistrates, for example, are assigned a specific motion to consider and issue a report and recommendation on. By contrast, the bankruptcy court in (c)(1) exercises jurisdiction over the entire proceeding, including up to conducting a trial in something that isn't subject to jury trial, and then issuing a report and recommendation to the district court.",
  "But the formalities matter.",
  "Well, I ­­ to begin, I think the formalities do matter and not only do I think so. This Court has repeatedly said that the absence of a judgment entered with authority means the absence of appellate jurisdiction as well. And all the appellate court can do is to vacate and remand.",
  "No, Your Honor.",
  "Quite ­­ quite the contrary, Your Honor. The Court has repeatedly stressed that the parties may not, by their agreement, confer jurisdiction that would not otherwise exist.",
  "To the contrary, Your Honor, in Schor, the Court made clear that where the structural features of the Constitution are at issue, that is precisely where parties cannot be depended upon to assert the interest, and it cannot be joined by consent. And here we have an example. The constitutional violation identified by the Court in Stern existed for 25 years before the issue finally made it to this Court. In part because parties were reluctant to assert that issue before a bankruptcy court in which its fate held. The ­­ the issues here, the other side says there is no structural problem because there's no aggrandizement or encroachment. But to the contrary, Congress has reserved to itself power over bankruptcy judges that the Constitution denies it over Article III judges. The President's power to appoint has been encroached upon.",
  "I think in large part they do. Although there is a distinction, perhaps an important distinction, that in the Magistrates Act, the consent requirement is built into the statute.",
  "You're absolutely right, Your Honor. And I think that the problem that this Court identified in Stern and that we identify here applies equally to the magistrates. But we have explained that that argument, even if not accepted in full, would distinguish our case from the Magistrates Act, because here, the Act enacted by Congress was unconstitutional. It assigned, irregardless of consent, this action to determination and final judgment by a bankruptcy judge. The Court considered this statute and held it unconstitutional in Stern. So if consent were to cure the problem here, then the jurisdiction of the Court would depend solely on the consent of the parties. If, on the other hand, the Court was considering in the first instance whether consent as a limiting feature on the jurisdiction of the non­Article III body meant that there was not the types of structural problems that the Court identified in Stern, then it would be as part of the determination whether there was or was not an Article III violation in the first instance.",
  "Only ­­ only the former, Your Honor.",
  "That ­­ that's right. I was answer ­­ just answering the question ­­",
  "­­ about the logic of the argument and how far it went. And ­­ and, I guess, again, what we suggest is that there might be a distinction when the Court is considering a statute. And as Schor lays out the many factors that the Court might consider, the fact that consent is a limiting feature on the non­Article III body's jurisdiction might lead the Court to conclude there was no Article III violation. But here, where there was no consent in this statute, the Court has already held in Stern that there was an Article III violation. The statute does not constitutionally confer jurisdiction on the bankruptcy courts. So if there is jurisdiction here, it would be purely a matter of private party consent. And that's precisely what the Court has held is not permissible as a matter of jurisdiction.",
  "I'm not arguing that there cannot be implied consent, but in Roell, as ­­ as a construction of the Magistrates Act, the Court held that consent must be knowing and voluntary. There, of course, the litigant had notice because the statute had advised the litigant that it had the right to refuse consent.",
  "I'm ­­ I'm sorry. I was ­­ I was ­­ I thought I was answering a different question. In our view, consent cannot be the basis for the exercise of jurisdiction by a non­Article III court.",
  "Express or implied. That's right, Your Honor.",
  "So this is the subsidiary argument, our, really, fallback argument, which is to say, even if consent could play a role, it would only be where that was part of the statute, and thus, part of the Court's analysis of whether this statute was constitutional.",
  "I'm sorry, Your Honor.",
  "So there ­­ there were two cases that the other side had cited, Roell and McDonald, for that point. But in each case, the statute itself featured consent as a limiting feature on the non­Article III court's authority. If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I have four points in response. First with respect to the history. Hecker's and Kimberly were not instances in which the non­Article III actor entered the judgment of the United States. In Hecker's, the Court compared the referee's actions akin to a jury. And a jury, of course, only finds facts. Only the court can decide whether to enter judgment on the basis of the jury's verdict. Likewise an arbitrator can decide facts pursuant to the parties' contract, but until they bring it to the court and judgment is entered confirming ­­",
  "Although Northern Pipeline, because the party had objected, did not address the question whether consent ­­",
  "No, Your Honor. Because the earlier cases do not establish an authority to enter judgment of the United States by a ­­",
  "Well, Thomas certainly does not foreclose the argument that I'm making because ­­",
  "Right.",
  "That's right, Your Honor.",
  "And Kimberly, again, referred to the confirmation of the award, again the judgment being entered by the court. The ­­ in Roell, which really marks the furthest extent of the recognition of consent and the role that it can play with respect to judgments and, of course, the Article III argument was not advanced by the parties there. Both parties agreed that consent would be sufficient. But significantly, even in Roell, the Court said that the consent would have to be knowing and voluntary consent. And we have the opposite of that here. Because both the legislature and the judiciary had told EBIA that it had no right to an Article III judge for pretrial motions. And although my friend ­­",
  "No, Your Honor, to the contrary, and we don't need to hypothesize because the record is clear, the motion was to withdraw for purpose of conducting a jury trial because our client recognized that Ninth Circuit precedent Healthcentral.Com explicitly held after Granfinanciera, that although you might have a Seventh Amendment jury trial right to an Article III judge, that did not entitle you to Article III determination of pretrial motions including summary judgment motion on a fraudulent conveyance claim. It was directly on point. Our client cited that, recognized it, it had no right to Article III court prior to trial. So the motion to withdraw was limited to the motion for a trial if the court got that far. So the suggestion that in the answer we disputed that fraudulent conveyance actions are core is not consistent with the record. The complaint had listed eight causes of action, several of which were core, several noncore, and then a single concluding allegation that the proceeding was core. Under Ninth Circuit law we rightly denied that allegation."
